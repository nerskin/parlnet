"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-10-28,"—At the request of Senator Minchin, I seek leave to move a motion to give precedence to:
the introduction and consideration of: a bill for an Act to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to provide for the revival of certain medical services items should later items be disallowed; and
Business of the Senate notice of motion no. 3 for today.
Leave not granted.
—Pursuant to contingent notice, and at the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Minchin, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Minchin moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to:
a motion for the introduction of A bill for an Act to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to provide for the revival of certain medical services items should later items be disallowed; and
consideration of that bill and Business of the Senate notice of motion no. 3.
More than seven weeks ago, the coalition, together with Senators Fielding and Xenophon, gave notice of our intention to disallow the government’s moves to reduce Medicare rebates for cataract surgery. We made it very clear that our intention was to prevent the government from cutting those rebates and certainly from deleting those items from the regulations altogether. The reason we want to prevent the government from cutting those rebates is that we take the view that it will hurt patients, it will make this life-changing surgery unaffordable for many Australians, it will push people into the public health system—where the particular procedure is actually more expensive for taxpayers—and it will hurt Australians, in particular those in rural and regional Australia.
The Minister for Health and Ageing, Minister Roxon, has had plenty of notice. Has she done anything? She has not done anything at all. True to form, she sat on her hands at first. Then out came the scare campaign and then, two days ago, in her usual reckless fashion, she pressed ahead, regardless of the fact that she well knew that a majority of senators in this chamber did not support the cuts the government was trying to push through the parliament.
We were keen to handle this issue in a very sensible and reasonable fashion. It is a very unusual for us to use this process and we do not do this lightly. Our intention had been, and we made our intention very clear, to stop the government from cutting those rebates for surgery by 50 per cent. We wanted to do it in a very responsible and reasonable fashion, so we gave notice yesterday of a disallowance motion and we also gave notice that we would seek to amend the Health Insurance Act. In good faith we informed senators in the chamber that we intended to move two amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009. That would have been a very easy, non-disruptive way for the Senate to deal with this.
What did the government do? Rather than grasping the opportunity of cleanly and smoothly handling this challenge faced by the Senate, the government—even though for the whole week it had been telling us that this was a very important and urgent bill, and it was listed on the Senate red on Monday and Tuesday—at the last minute, seconds before the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill was due to pass the House of Representatives and just before the third reading vote was to take place, it deferred further consideration of the bill. That was a reckless and irresponsible move, and by doing it the government did not leave us with any option other than to take the steps that we are undertaking here today.
This is a very serious issue. The coalition, together with Senators Fielding and Xenophon, have made it very clear that we do not support this savage cut to Medicare rebates for cataract surgery. We think it will hurt patients, we think it will push patients into the public system—into the lengthy and overburdened public hospital queues—and we think it will hurt patients, in particular in regional Australia. We will do what it takes, and if this is what it takes then this is what we will do. The government was well aware, but they were trying to push through a budget cut for which they did not have majority support in the Senate. It was due to come into effect on 1 November. It was announced on budget night in May, but two days ago the government finally tabled those regulations—with four days to go. Nicola Roxon, the health minister, has been out there frightening patients and frightening doctors. She has been threatening the Senate knowing that there are only four days to go. She has said, ‘If you pass this disallowance motion, there will be no rebate at all.’ It is an absolute disgrace.
The process that we are engaging in today will give the government an opportunity to deal with this matter responsibly. Our intention is to ensure that, if the Senate disallows those cuts to Medicare rebates for cataract surgery, we will revert to the Medicare rebates that are currently in place. That is the intention behind the process that we are engaging in today.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2009-10-28,"—What the opposition are now engaged in is nothing short of a stunt. They let my office know about this a couple of minutes before 9.30 am, when the bells were ringing. If that is the way they want to manage the relationship on how we deal with the program, it is clear that what they said yesterday about the program should be just thrown out the window. The opposition have now clearly indicated that they want to manage the program, and that they want to speak to the program and to use it to suit their own political ends, rather than allow the usual procedures in this place to continue in an appropriate way. So all that has happened now—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—I listened to you in silence, Senator Cormann; you should offer me the same courtesy. What you cannot do, Senator Cormann, is provide a cogent argument as to why you are pulling this stunt. It is a stunt and you know it. There are ways to deal with these matters in debate, but you cannot help yourself. What you found out, first of all, was that to attempt to disallow the regulation was silly. Now you are trying to fix that as well. The opposition are simply making policy on the run. It is unwise, can I suggest to you, to make policy on the run in this way. What you need to do is sit down and deal with this in a sensible way rather than continue to make short-term decisions using this chamber in this way. It is inappropriate. It should not be supported. I urge senators not to support this silly stunt that is being performed by Senator Cormann.
Of course, the nub of the issue goes to Senator Cormann’s inability to grasp the need for reform in this area. What underpins this is that Senator Cormann must be in the pocket of specialists who are ophthalmologists. There is no other explanation than that to drive the position that he is putting. The opposition’s actions are not about putting patients first. This is about putting the interests of a group of specialists—a group who earn over half a million dollars a year from Medicare alone—first. That is what the actions of the opposition are about in this respect, and it is a sad day to see it. Ophthalmologists will simply continue to charge their high fees for the procedures while the opposition’s actions will prevent the government from paying any rebate to the patient. That is what the opposition faced. They then decided to use the Senate for the purpose of trying to retrospectively fix their problem, before it was even there. So they are not even in order, quite frankly. It is a stunt.
The opposition have come into this chamber and simply tried to hijack the Senate to ensure that they can underpin their false argument. It is an extraordinary abuse of this Senate’s procedures. It is an extraordinary abuse for the opposition to use the Senate in this way, yet they try to put a rational argument that they are acting in good faith. Well, it is not acting in good faith for them to make policy on the run, to come in here and to use Senate procedure for a stunt to try to underpin their own argument and to try to bolster their own position—let alone to come in here and abuse the Senate processes. That is the difficulty that the opposition face. There is no merit in the argument that is being put by Senator Cormann. In fact, the opposition may wish to respond to the CEO of the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, who was today quoted as saying:
I would like to know why the Opposition is seeking to support medical specialists who are seeking to retain high incomes at the expense of consumers.
The government want to pay an appropriate rebate for this procedure and hope that the opposition will reconsider their position and support these changes. That is the position they should be adopting. They should be in a position to negotiate in good faith with the minister and to come up with an outcome—rather than to come into this Senate, abuse the processes of the Senate and pull stunts such as this without any notice. It is a very shoddy way of acting, and quite frankly it quite surprises me that the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate has allowed it to go on.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-28,"—I indicate that I support the motion. I know a little bit about stunts, and this is not a stunt. The position is this: yesterday, when I discussed this matter with Senator Cormann—
—So it was contemplated yesterday, and we got no notice.
—It is not my motion, but my understanding is that the government’s bill, which the opposition and others intended to amend, did not go to the third reading stage. That was quite extraordinary and changed things dramatically. That is why this extraordinary measure has been used. There is an issue here about whether or not this amendment is necessary, but the government has its own view, and to remove any ambiguity this needs to be sorted out. I would have thought that the fair thing to do, from the point of view of statutory interpretation, if regulations are disallowed would be to revert back to the earlier regulations. But this legislation is about ensuring that this issue is brought to a head, and the government needs to determine what its position is. It is not reasonable that if there is no Medicare rebate paid. It is not reasonable for patients, and that is my primary concern.
If the Minister for Health and Ageing—and I think the minister did make a number of reasonable points on the whole of fees being charged—is concerned about overcharging, there are other mechanisms to deal with that which are not so blunt an instrument as the government has used in relation to cataract surgery. That is for another debate, if this motion succeeds, but I support this motion on the basis that the government’s own actions yesterday in the lower house in not allowing the bill to go to a third reading vote—which was quite extraordinary—forced the hand of those who are concerned about these measures and about the impact they will have on senior citizens in Australia.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-10-28,"—I have some matters of rebuttal for the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I support the comments of my colleague Senator Cormann, and Senator Xenophon summed up what has happened. This is not an ambush. This morning we woke up and found that listed on today’s order of business was no bill, because it was stopped in the House of Representatives yesterday. The only politics being played in this are that the government are aware that we want to amend this bill and they have deliberately held it up in the House of Representatives so we cannot amend it. The only course for us to take is to fix it now with our own legislation, with the support of other concerned senators not necessarily from the Liberal or National parties but equally aggrieved and upset that this matter would not otherwise have been resolved.
The implementation will commence on 1 November—this weekend. Once we finalised this morning what we were going to do about this, we advised the government of the day. The stunt is that the government have not bothered to consult with us about holding this bill back in the House of Representatives. The only political argument that they have is absolutely false, because they are the ones playing games. We are responding to the government’s fear. The government is scared of introducing this bill, because we will amend it. We would have amended this bill successfully, and they were not prepared to run that test through the Senate chamber so they held it back. We have rectified that. The people of Australia will thank us for this because we will solve this problem. This weekend everyone will be sure about what is happening with the cataract rebate.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Cormann’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-10-28,"—At the request of Senator Minchin, I move a motion to give precedence to:
the introduction and consideration of: A bill for an Act to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to provide for the revival of certain medical services items should later items be disallowed; and
Business of the Senate notice of motion no. 3 for today
This is a highly unusual step for us to take. It is a highly unusual process. We grant you that. It is not something that we are doing lightly. However, the government’s actions have forced us into a position where we have no other choice. I want to clarify a few remarks that Minister Ludwig made. He suggested that this is somehow policy on the run and a last-minute consideration. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have been very determined for a long time to make sure that we stop the government from cutting the rebates for cataract surgery because we think that it would hurt patients, force them into an already overburdened public system and make it unaffordable for many of them. People who are not able to get access either through the public system or because they cannot afford it in the private system, at worst, might go blind.
If ever there was an effective preventive health measure it is cataract surgery. Cataract surgery is a life- changing procedure. It helps prevent falls; it helps prevent fractures; it helps prevent mental pressure; it helps prevent social isolation. It is a very important procedure. The government through its very ill-considered and short-sighted budget cuts is trying to save $313 per procedure—to achieve what? To push those patients into the public system where taxpayers will have to pay more than $3,500 to fund exactly the same procedure—that is, for those people who are lucky enough to get in. We understand that there has been advice floating backwards and forwards. The Minister for Health and Ageing has made it very clear that she was not going to take a constructive approach on this. She sought to frighten patients. She sought to frighten doctors and she sought to threaten the Senate, so we took very careful advice.
We very carefully considered our options and we made a decision some time ago to move amendments to the Health Insurance Act to ensure that any disallowance of the Medicare rebate items for cataract surgery would revert to the rebates that are currently in place. We knew that we had to do two things: we had to move an amendment to the Health Insurance Act before we dealt with the disallowance motion in relation to those particular items. There were two different ways we could do it: we could do it the sensible way, our preferred way, which would have been to move two amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009, the bill which the government had given us every indication was a high-priority bill, a bill which they wanted to pass this week, a bill which was time sensitive.
If the rumours around Parliament House are right I understand that Minister Chris Bowen is very unhappy with Minister Roxon because he is now very worried about what is going to happen with his Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009. Minister Roxon, for her own political purposes, for her to be able to maximise the threat to the Senate, for her to be able to maximise her scare campaign towards patients and doctors, pulled a stunt. At around 5 pm yesterday afternoon, with seconds to go before the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009 was due to pass the House of Representatives it was deferred, just before it went to a third reading vote even though consideration of the bill had been completed without amendments. So here you have a bill which was considered noncontroversial in the Main Committee. Consideration of the bill was finalised without amendments. It went into the chamber of the House of Representatives and was about to get passed, and guess what? At the last minute the government pulled it, and the only reason the government pulled it was because the government wanted to prevent the Senate taking a sensible, responsible, carefully considered path in moving amendments to the Health Insurance Act.
We would not be wasting all this time today if the government had not pulled this stunt. So if the government’s legislative program is out of order today it is on their heads, and I suggest that Minister Ludwig goes and has a close, careful conversation with Minister Roxon because she clearly does not seem to understand how the Senate works. She does not understand no for an answer. She does not understand that if she does not have majority support in this chamber she cannot get her way. This is government arrogance at its worst.
We have seen it before that where the government clearly do not have the support of the Senate for a particular course of action, by hook or by crook, they just try to push it through using every procedural trick in the book. On this occasion we made a decision that this is an important issue for patients across Australia who need timely and affordable access to quality cataract surgery. The government wanted to maximise the leverage over the Senate by doing what they did last night, and that is the reason why I, on behalf the opposition, am moving this motion. I will not hold up the Senate too much longer. I think the point is well made: this is a very important discussion for us to have in the Senate and we have the opportunity today to send a very clear message to the government about what the intentions of the Senate are.
These regulations are supposed to take effect on Saturday. The government announced this on 13 May. How many months ago was that? June, July, August, September, October—the government announced this more than five months ago, but they only tabled these regulations two days ago at five minutes to midnight. This was essentially to minimise the Senate’s opportunity to scrutinise what the government is doing and to minimise the time the government could take for appropriate remedial action if the Senate did not support what they are proposing to do.
The minister initially said nothing. Then she said that she got advice that if the opposition votes against this the whole item is going to disappear. We understand that we cannot just move a disallowance motion in isolation. But the government’s own departmental officials do not. I asked the senior official who is responsible for the MBS branch in the Department for Health and Ageing what would happen if the Senate were to disallow these cataract surgery related Medicare rebates. Her answer was, ‘Well, I think it would revert back to the previous rebates.’ If there is confusion at the top levels of the government, what chance have we got?
Contrary to the government’s approach, we always knew what our strategy was: that we needed to move an amendment to the Health Insurance Act as well as to give notice of a motion to disallow and then take a vote on that motion. This is the only way we can make this arrogant government understand that the Senate cannot be taken for granted. Hopefully, the government will learn a lesson from this and in future treat the Senate, and the people we represent, with a bit more respect. Quite frankly, we have got a job to do in this chamber. The government thinks that it can steamroll things through this chamber the same way as it can steamroll things through the House of Representatives. Well, guess what? Every single one of us represents a great state or a great territory across our great country, and we have got a contribution to make in this chamber. At the end of the day, when the whole debate has been had, we will vote. If the majority of senators support something the government wants to do then it gets up and if the majority of senators do not support it then it goes down. That is the way democracy works. It is time the government understood this.
So, with those few remarks, the Senate is well aware what the opposition, together with Senators Fielding and Xenophon, are seeking to achieve: we are seeking to put beyond doubt that if the Senate were of a mind to disallow the reductions in Medicare rebates for cataract surgery then our intention is for the rebates for those items to revert back to the rebates currently in place when it comes up after this legislation has been dealt with. We know that this bill has to go back to the House of Representatives and the government will have to make a decision. They will have to make a decision on whether they will bring on the bill, give it precedence, deal with it and vote in favour of it, or whether they are going to ignore it, vote against it or let the time pass 1 November. If the government do not deal with this before 1 November then it is on their head; the chaos that will be caused out there in the community will be on the government’s head. Clearly, the government have not thought this through. The government should have engaged with us constructively and much earlier. The government should have realised that, without the support of the Senate, they will not be able to press ahead. Arrogantly and, I would argue, incompetently, the Minister for Health and Ageing thought that she could get away with it. This is an important issue. This is about ensuring timely and affordable access to quality health care for all Australians. On this basis, this is a very important process for us to go through today.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-28,"—I think the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, does a lot of good things. Her focus on preventive health is laudable, but that is for another debate, perhaps later today. The focus on getting to the cause of illness and to the cause of people getting sick in the first place is a fundamentally good thing. I also think that the minister’s reforms to the dental program—which, with some relatively minor amendments, I support—need to be done, and it is regrettable that after a year that has not been dealt with.
I do have an issue in relation to the changes to cataract surgery. I think a mistake has been made. I think the government’s concern about some ophthalmologists not doing the right thing has been dealt with with a very blunt instrument. This instrument has been to have an across-the-board change to the cataract rebate. This bill is the same as the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009 but with one important difference: it ensures that if any regulation to change in a time in an item to a table of medical services is disallowed them the situation will revert back to the previous regulations.
Currently if such regulation is disallowed then the result is as if no regulation existed. This is vital because items in a table of medical services provide rebates for important procedures such as cataract surgery. The government has cut the rebates for items Nos 42699, 42701 and 42702 by 50 per cent. These items are for medical services associated with cataract surgery, and the information provided by the Medicare benefits branch in estimates last week indicated that in the 2007-08 financial year there were 187,912 cataract procedures provided. Of these, 131,675, or roughly 70 per cent, were provided in the private system, which would have had the rebate level halved under the government’s changes. Meanwhile, the remaining public sector patients would have continued to get their treatments for free, but I think it is important to have that balance between the public and private systems and that you do not overload an already stretched public system.
My office has been inundated with correspondence from constituents and individuals opposing these changes by the government. It has not been just about lobbying by medical practitioners or private health groups; bodies such as COTA—the peak advocacy body for senior citizens in this country—have publicly criticised this move by the government and so have those who have practised in the area for many years. I will quote from an email from one ophthalmologist:
The proposed change will reduce surgeons’ income—but not in the way the Government might think. Almost none of my colleagues will reduce their fees. There will be some reduction in demand for surgery with patients putting off their surgery or electing to go public—more on that in a minute. Most ophthalmologists (myself included) use safety for driving and safety from falls causing fractured hips as the primary indication for determining readiness for surgery. You can see that deferral of surgery is potentially dangerous. It is also true that the demographic that suffers from cataract surgery is very price sensitive. The capricious way that this extreme measure has caused a lot of anger within the ophthalmology community. The ophthalmology community is not politically divided and is strongly united in response.
The general public has been contacting me about this as well. I have been getting many faxes, emails and letters—many handwritten—from constituents who are concerned about this. It has been put to my office that the department were looking for cost cuts, they saw these large items and they made the cut without looking at the consequences. I think it really is a case where the government has used a very blunt instrument to deal with a perceived problem.
While it is true that there have been significant improvements in technology with this surgery in Australia since 1984, this needs to be put in perspective. Prior to 1984, a cataract operation was an intracapsular lens extraction which took about an hour to perform, depending on the proficiency of the surgeon, and had a relatively mediocre result. At that time, one waited until patients were virtually blind before performing surgery. In 1984, in South Australia, extracapsular lens extraction was introduced and this improved results dramatically and reduced the time for the operation considerably. As a consequence, the fees were reduced in 1987 by a federal Labor government. I have been reliably informed that there have been no significant advances in the last 10 to 15 years.
I think that the government is using the new technology as an excuse when in fact that was previously dealt with back in 1987. That is why I cannot support the government on this issue—because of the impact on patients. I think if the government wants to deal with issues of overcharging and informed financial consent, these are separate issues and this is not the way to do it, because of the impact it will have on patients.
Yesterday an amendment to the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009 was circulated in the names of Senator Cormann, Senator Fielding and myself. That amendment would have achieved the same purpose as this bill. It was an amendment drafted in support of a disallowance motion for changes to cataract surgery rebates. Essentially what the government was seeking to do was to make easy cost cuts at the cost of those with cataracts. The disallowance motion would have prevented this. To protect cataract patients we also sought to amend the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill to ensure that if any change to an item in a table of medical services were disallowed, then the situation would revert back to the previous regulations. However, the government recognised that it would still end up providing the previous rebates for cataract surgery, so I think it is a fair assumption to make that the bill has been stalled. That is why I have reluctantly agreed to this course of action. I do not think there is any other course in order to protect those who require cataract surgery in terms of their not being out of pocket.
I think it is also relevant to point out that in estimates last week—and Senator Cormann is well aware of this, because I think he is the person who asked the question—the advice from a senior official in the department was that the item would revert back to the previous rebate level if the new lower rebate were disallowed. Because there is ambiguity in relation to that, I think it is important that we remove any ambiguity with this particular bill, and I think that is the most sensible approach. If this bill does not get up—if the government maintains its position that there will be no rebate—I think that we will find ourselves with an urgent legal challenge being made by a representative group or by an individual taking on a test case, presumably in the Federal Court. That is something that we need to avoid, given the uncertainty and the fact that there will many Australians who will defer their cataract surgery pending this.
I think there is a way forward in this. I know that the opposition does not say this, but I think that the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, has done a lot of good things in her portfolio. I have supported many of those things, but this particular measure is not one that I support, because I think it is too blunt an instrument to achieve a good policy outcome and I am concerned about patients being significantly disadvantaged. Therefore, I support this bill and I am still hopeful that there can be a reasonable compromise that will not disadvantage patients who require cataract surgery.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I just wanted to make sure that Senator Xenophon was aware that, at this stage, we are still talking about the motion to give precedence rather than the bill itself.
 (Senator Trood)—I am not sure that is a point of order, Senator Cormann. Senator Xenophon is of course entitled to include in his remarks anything that he chooses.
—I thought it was important to set out the basis of why I support this particular motion, and that is that I believe the bill has merit. In a sense, it will save me doubling up on my comments in relation to support of the bill. I am grateful for Senator Cormann’s point of order—even though you have ruled, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it was not a point of order. The point is: I think it is important that I make clear why I support the motion. I support the motion for the reasons set out in terms of the policy rationale behind this bill. That is why I think it is important that we support the suspension of standing orders, and I have set out in my remarks why I support this particular move. I think it is important to set out the background for that.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-10-28,"—It seems that we are on the precedent motion, and I think it is clear that this bill is one that you would not give precedent to, quite frankly. We are now in a very odd position, where the opposition feel minded to hijack the Senate procedures to fix what would otherwise be a silly position they have got themselves into. I will take the Senate through this madness that the opposition are now putting forward. I will go back to the position where, at budget, the opposition agreed to pass our budget measures, except the private health insurance issue, which they would have a debate about. I think that is clear. Those were the words that Mr Hockey used at the time—I do not have them before me but I recall them in that way, and if I have not recalled them correctly I am happy to correct the record.
In short, the government made clear what its position was in relation to its budget. It is a budget that means that issues such as this would need to be passed so that things like Avastin as an emerging treatment for bowel cancer, new paternity leave reforms, incentives to get doctors to the bush and matters relating to regional cancer centres and the like can be proceeded with. It is about providing realistic savings out of the budget to allow these matters to be dealt with—and when technology and techniques improve. The government put forward this position to ensure that where technology did improve you could change your schedules. That is the next piece of this puzzle: where the government, quite rightly, moves to change or introduce a regulation to deal with the schedule. The opposition always has the opportunity to say, ‘We object to that position,’ and have a debate about that at the appropriate time. That is the position we would ordinarily come across. But, in dealing with it in seriatim, as we are—and as Senator Cormann has quite correctly said—we would oppose that position and we would not agree to the schedule. Notwithstanding the rationale or the arguments that might have been put forward, that is a debate you would have during the disallowance motion.
However, Senator Cormann, in making policy on the run, seems to have turned little attention to how this place works. It works by the government ensuring that its legislative program is dealt with in terms of what is before it in the Senate. The government determines the order of bills that are dealt with in the Senate, and that is the long-established precedent in this place. The opposition, to support a mad position that Senator Cormann has now adopted, have agreed to allow him to move a suspension notice to allow a private senator’s bill to be introduced into this place. So we are now in a position where the opposition, Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding have agreed to hijack the legislative program—notwithstanding that we have a lot of urgent bills to be dealt with during this sitting period and notwithstanding the pressures we have on the program for the next fortnight—to allow this pantomime by Senator Cormann to play out.

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—The shrieks from Senator Cormann highlight the difficulty that he has put himself in. It has exposed the madness that he is now pursuing in the Senate. He is using the Senate—and the opposition have agreed to this with Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon—and the procedures in this place for his own political pantomime. It is the only way you could describe it. We will get to the substance of the bill shortly. We are dealing with the precedent motion. I will deal with this madness that the opposition are now pursuing. To underpin the position, they were looking to the House of Representatives for a bill which was dealing with Medicare compliance—not a bill dealing with the Health Insurance Act at large, but with Medicare compliance.

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—Mr Acting Deputy President, I allowed Senator Cormann to speak in silence. Interjections are disorderly. It seems that he does not like me explaining his madness. Quite frankly, I can understand that. I might have interjected too if I had started this madness. I do have the right to be heard in quiet, and he should defer to that, rather than highlighting the fact that his position is untenable and exposed.
So he looked at a bill about Medicare compliance, all the way over in the House of Representatives, and thought: ‘Ah-ha! I have a way of stopping myself looking so stupid in this instance. If I oppose the disallowance motion, the position I will find myself in is that the Medicare schedule that has been introduced will drop away.’ But, of course, the bill is not in the Senate. It is a matter for the government when it comes to the Senate. That is the legislative program. He guesses a whole range of ideas as to why it has not moved from the House to the Senate, but those are assumptions he has made in relation to how these things work. But, notwithstanding that—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Cormann had an opportunity to make his contribution in silence, and I should have the same courtesy extended to me.
 (Senator Trood)—Thank you.
—The position now, of course, is that Senator Cormann has to stretch to say, ‘Look, I don’t have a particular bill before me to deal with to try to support the insane position I am now trying to adopt,’ so he introduces a private senator’s bill to give himself cover for the pantomime that is being played out here. He intended to wait for a bill to come across from the House to the Senate and amend that, but it is an unrelated bill. It is not dealing with the substance of the matter; it is an unrelated bill, and he was seeking to tack. So not only do we have an unprecedented position now emerging here, where Senator Cormann is using the Senate in this peculiar and unprecedented way, but this is a second way of providing himself a cover for the pantomime that he is trying to act out. That is, quite frankly, unprecedented in that it is normal practice in this place not to tack other amendments onto bills, and usually both the opposition and the government take the principled position and reject tacking bills. Why? Because the amendments are not about the substance. They have not been through a Senate committee. They have not been dealt with in an appropriate way. They have not been looked at, scrutinised—and, of course, that is the usual position we adopt this place.
Instead, the opposition have now breached two significant principles. One is—in the first instance, to provide Senator Cormann cover for his pantomime—to say that it is okay to tack bills. That is a significant breach of what I would call the usual procedures in this place and the policies that oppositions for a long time have adopted. Why? Because it is a sensible, principled position to adopt. Why? Because all governments can suffer from tacking bills, which are then used as stunts in the Senate and which eat up time. Why? Because we have a bicameral system, so it has to also pass to the House to be considered, and the reality of that should be driven home to the opposition.
The opposition have to understand—and maybe they have been in opposition for too short a time to follow this—that, first of all, the principles in this place are that the government determines the legislative program and the government determines the order of bills to be dealt with, and the principle usually adopted in this place is that you do not tack bills, especially when you do not even have them in the Senate to begin with and you try to second-guess when a bill is going to be introduced into the Senate. If it is not introduced, you then second-guess again—so it is an assumption based upon an assumption—and say, ‘Seeing that it’s not here, I’m going to introduce a private senator’s bill to hijack the legislative program.’ That is the third breach by the opposition in a program, because if you agree to all of these—there are three so far, and I am counting—what is to prevent Senator Xenophon, Senator Fielding or the Greens, although I suspect they are more reasonable than this position, from adopting mad tactics in this place to turn it upside down so we do not deal with our legislative program? We are then in a position where we are always at risk of having this place turned upside down at any time. They are the principles that have long been established in this place to allow proper scrutiny of the legislation, to allow the Senate to do its work. The opposition are now saying that they will throw all that in the bin and deal with whatever mad stunt a particular senator might come up with to give himself notoriety—
—Cover.
—and cover. The next major issue is that it is unprecedented not only to then agree to a suspension to deal with the private senator’s bill, as I outlined, but also to do the second tack, which is to say, ‘We’ll also include the disallowance motion in that procedure so that we’ll deal with that as well.’ That is the fourth breach of what I would call longstanding principles in this place. Why? Because once you start making rules on the run, once you start breaching long-established processes and principles in this place, you end up making not only policy on the run but also practice on the run. The difficulty will be where you end up once you throw all of that in the bin and you then want to argue from a principled position, should something else occur that you might want to argue against. The precedents in this place are well established. What the opposition are now doing is throwing all those precedents in the bin and saying: ‘We’re going to run it like a rodeo. We’ll let the bull out and see what happens.’ It is complete madness to travel down this path, and you should recognise that.
I do not expect Senator Cormann to recognise that, quite frankly. I do not. I accept that he has a policy position. He is blinded by how to resolve the position he has put himself in by mistake, accident or even design. He is looking for cover. He will search around, stretch out and grab anything to hold on to to see if he can bring himself a bit of respectability. But I cannot accept that the opposition, from their leadership, are going to accept that position. I cannot accept that, but it seems that they have been either sucked in or hoodwinked into this process. I can argue, but it seems that they are hell bent on proceeding down this path.
I can only give you some free advice—and cautionary advice, at that—that this is not a path that should be travelled because you have not provided any notice of your overturning of procedure. This course of action is unprecedented. You will get yourself into Odgers on it, I suspect. I am not sure if this Clerk will write it up; maybe the next Clerk will have to deal with that. The position you are allowing is that the opposition will be able agree to any freewheeling process and procedure to find a result to give them some cover, some fig leaf of respectability, in relation to a policy position that is completely unsustainable.
I will not deal with the substance of the matter in this debate. It does not look like I am going to have the numbers in this place, so I will not take up all of the time. I will end on this point: this is a silly position to adopt to try to give yourself an air of respectability in relation to a policy position that is completely unsustainable.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-10-28,"—Senator Ludwig has outlined the inadequacies of the government by attacking the man. He has attacked Senator Cormann rather than the substance of the motion. He is trying to thwart the motion by indicating that it is a pantomime and things of this nature. I want to take us back to the real issue. The reason for us seeking precedence is that there will be thousands of Australians who will not have the benefit of cataract surgery if the government’s course of action were to be continued. That is the crux of the matter. That is what we are fighting for. We have come from that policy position very early on. We wanted to disallow the regulations, and that has been flagged for seven weeks.
It should be no surprise to the government that we wanted to move down this path, and we tried to do this through all the procedural avenues recognised as Senate convention, until yesterday. Yesterday, the government removed the bill and removed the opportunity for it to be debated in this chamber—and to be amended in the fashion that Senator Ludwig indicated. That amendment, on very good advice from the Clerk’s office, would have facilitated the particular course of action we wanted, and that was to make sure that the rebate for cataract surgery remained in place so thousands of Australians would not be disadvantaged.
On Monday and Tuesday this week the bill was listed on our Order of Business, subject to its introduction from the House of Representatives. Yesterday it was listed, and then miraculously removed. This is not an ambush, as Senator Ludwig indicates, because we have been very open and frank about our wish to amend the bill to achieve our outcome. That has been known for some time. We were then forced to take urgent action, and the urgent action was finalised this morning. A bill was presented to our Senate tactics group and we agreed to that bill. We have taken a sensible course of action. It is an unusual step, as Senator Ludwig indicates, but we were forced into this by the urgent circumstances. This legislation was going to be ready this weekend and the legislation was not going to arrive in this chamber for us to deal with in a timely manner.
On top of that, Senator Ludwig said, ‘It was all Senator Cormann.’ Apart from the Liberal and National parties, who are as one on this, we have two other senators. We cannot adjust or rearrange government business without the support of the majority. This is a democracy, as my colleague Senator Cormann mentioned, and we are doing this in the best interests of thousands of people who will now, if the government supports this in the lower house, continue to receive the rebate they are entitled to for cataract surgery. That is the basis of what we are doing and we have been forced into this urgent set of circumstances because of the government’s tactics in the House of Representatives yesterday.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2009-10-28,"—I did not intend to enter this debate but, given what has just been said by the Manager of Opposition Business and Opposition Whip, I have to say this: is the good senator suggesting that we should have kept the bill on the red even though it was not available to us? The nonsense in his argument is that we were supposed to keep the bill on the red because it had been there before, when in fact we could not keep it on today’s red because it had not passed the House of Representatives. He knows that. The fact of the matter is that what he is trying to say is: ‘We have this strategy. We were going to deal with the disallowance today.’ We have been dealing with all sorts of adjournments and disallowance motions this week and there has been no indication that this was the path they considered essential, that the disallowance might have to be put back or that some other action had to be considered.
Senator Xenophon belled the cat in his contribution earlier that this action this morning was discussed and arranged last night. The suggestion by Senator Parry and Senator Cormann that this matter was not decided until this morning is a fiction. It was cooked up last night, and Senator Xenophon has belled the cat. There was no consultation with us about this. We did not know until the bells were ringing this morning. There was no opportunity to discuss it. It was clearly an ambush. I reject the suggestion that this is not purely and simply a move by Senator Cormann and the coalition to give themselves political cover because they want to disallow something—and there is a consequence to that. That is their position. They are trying to give themselves political cover. That is what this is about and the Australian people will see through it.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Cormann’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-10-28,"—I, and also on behalf of the Leader of the Family First Party, Senator Fielding, and Senator Xenophon, move:
That items 42698, 42701, 42702 and 42718 in Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations 2009, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2009 No. 272 and made under the Health Insurance Act 1973, be disallowed. [F2009L03329]
We are moving this disallowance motion to stop the Rudd Labor government from halving Medicare rebates for cataract surgery. We consider this to be one of a series of ill-considered and short-sighted budget cuts in the health portfolio. It is a budget cut that would hurt mostly elderly patients in need of timely and affordable access to high-quality cataract surgery. It would make access to this life-changing surgery unaffordable for many. It would force tens of thousands of Australians to join lengthy public hospital queues. What is worse is that it will see people go blind, when it is entirely preventable through this life-changing cataract surgery. It will hurt, in particular, patients across rural and regional Australia. I will now read an email I received from an ophthalmologist from regional New South Wales:
Just to let you know, I am one of the ophthalmologists who provide services to rural areas—Bourke and Griffith. I have just given my notice of resignation for Bourke, as I can no longer provide the services under the proposed new arrangements. My last operating list in Bourke will be October 29-30. Similarly, I am seriously considering not entering into a new contract with Greater Southern Area Health Service for Griffith—I am the only bulk-billing eye surgeon in Griffith—on the basis of the proposed cuts.
So here we have somebody who is saying that, on the basis of the cuts proposed by the government, she is no longer going to provide any services whatsoever into the rural area around Bourke and she is no longer going to provide bulk-billing services into the area around Griffith.
As I am in receipt of Commonwealth funding to cover the trouble for my trips to Griffith and not Burke, this may allow me to continue to provide the Griffith service a little longer.
I will read another email from the same region. This is from an ophthalmologist who was quite happy for me to use his name. His name is Ashish Agar and he works for the Outback Eye Service at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. He says:
I wish to highlight some of the public surgery at risk if this funding cut is not retracted. This is an often overlooked aspect of the discussion—how much so was revealed in discussions with the federal health department only last week.
I received this email late last night. He goes on to say:
In response to a query regarding how regional and remote areas will cope with the cutbacks, we were advised ‘not to worry’ as the proposal is ‘all about private surgery’. This degree of misunderstanding would be laughable (worthy of the best of “Yes, Minister”), were it not from our principal public health body, and so close to the date of the proposed change. As it stands though, this statement was simply frightening. The government really have absolutely no idea of the tsunami about to hit public cataract surgery in Australia.
May I give our own service as an example—the Outback Eye Service is based at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, and evolved from the pioneering efforts of a former Professor, Fred Hollows in the 1970s. It is a free, completely publicly funded comprehensive ophthalmic service covering the Far West of NSW. The most important health intervention we provide these remote communities is cataract surgery. We are in fact restoring sight to over a dozen citizens in Bourke District Hospital with Sydney-based surgeons and nurses as well as local staff, at this very time.
Unfortunately, this now appears to be the last surgical trip we will be making offering this life changing procedure. The funding cut of 50% makes our service unviable, and there is no ‘private’ option for us to recoup our costs from the patients (which on a matter of principle we would not entertain in any case). Decades of arguably the most cost effective public health intervention is about to be denied to those who need it most; the elderly, isolated, indigenous and socially disadvantaged.
This is what this debate is all about. These are the people that the opposition, with the support of Senators Fielding and Xenophon and the Greens, is standing up for.
Cataract surgery is a truly life-changing procedure. It prevents blindness, through removing the natural lens of the eye, when it has developed an obfuscation, and replacing it with a synthetic lens to restore visibility. That makes cataract surgery, as I have mentioned before, a very effective preventative health measure, helping to prevent falls, fractures, mental stress and isolation. Affordable and timely access to this treatment can mean maintaining an independent life, continuing to live at home, continuing to drive a car and continuing to remain active.
This impost on our mostly senior Australians is particularly offensive given the reckless government spending in most other areas of government. The Rudd Labor government have been spending like drunken sailors. We have spending spree after spending spree, cash splashes, stimulus payments—you name it! And yet here we are. We have the Rudd Labor government forcing elderly Australians in need of timely and affordable access to this procedure to pay the price for that reckless spending. This is not about a sensible, well-considered saving based on real efficiencies. The reality is that it would have worked like this: the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation would have gone to Nicola Roxon as the Minister for Health and Ageing on winning government and said, ‘We want $6½ billion out of your portfolio.’ The first $3.1 billion they thought would be easy: ‘We’re going to run up this 70 per cent tax grab on alcopops and we are going to sell it as a health measure. So that one is in the bag.’ But they hit a snag. The Australian people were very suspicious, because they pretty well realised that this was about revenue raising and was not a health measure.
Since then we have had about $3.5 billion in spending cuts to the health portfolio while there has been reckless spending everywhere else. Australians in need of timely access to affordable health care have to pay the price for the Rudd Labor government’s reckless spending in every other area of government. We were told that health was going to be a high priority. You have got to be kidding. I will give you some examples: a $960 million saving from the changes to the Medicare levy surcharge; $1.9 billion being sought out of the private health insurance rebate reductions; $100 million being sought in savings from a very ill-considered cut to chemotherapy funding; a further $450 million saving through cuts to be extended Medicare safety net; a $150 million saving through cuts to Medicare rebates, which includes the $98 million in cuts to rebates for cataract surgery—and there are others. Do you know what they have in common? They are all targeted at one portion of the Australian population. This divisive, ideological government is targeting those Australians who access their health care through the private health system. We on this side of the parliament believe in both a strong and well-funded public system and a strong and well-supported private system. Before the last election the Rudd Labor government promised that they believed in the same thing, but we have seen again and again that that was nothing but pre-election rhetoric.
I will go through some of the facts that came out from answers given by Department of Health and Ageing officials in Senate estimates last week. Firstly, we know that nearly 200,000 cataract surgery procedures are performed across Australia every year. More than 70 per cent of those procedures are performed in the private system. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, wants us to believe that this rebate for cataract surgery only covers the 15-minute, easy, cheap, simple procedure at the time of surgery. The reality is that it also includes—and the department conceded this—a period of postoperative care, including further consultations. Contrary to any assertions by the minister, as I mentioned in my speech on the Health Insurance Amendment (Revival of Table Items) Bill 2009, the government actually has no idea how long cataract surgery takes, given that they do not collect such data through the MBS or otherwise. Departmental officials did not dispute the findings of an AMA survey that 70 per cent of ophthalmologists take between 25 and 40 minutes for cataract surgery, not the 15 to 20 minutes advanced by the minister without any tangible evidence.
Health department officials talked about the period since the rebate was first introduced—and ‘since the rebate was first introduced’ is a very important phrase because the government, in answers to questions on notice, said when the rebate was first introduced it took 45 minutes to perform the surgery, but since then the government wants us to believe it is now much more simple, cheaper and quicker to provide the surgery. Have you ever heard Nicola Roxon talk about the fact that there have been major cuts to this rebate in the past? Have you heard that, Mr Acting Deputy President? I bet you have not. Let me inform the Senate that health department officials confirmed that since the rebate was first introduced cataract surgery rebates have already been cut twice, by 30 per cent in 1987 and by 10 per cent in 1996, undermining assertions by the minister that this further 50 per cent cut is necessary to cater for improvements since the rebate was first introduced.
The value of the MBS fee rebate has reduced even further over time, given the average indexation of around two per cent per annum in other years was well below the health services cost index, the health CPI, increases in average weekly earnings, or even just CPI—you name it. The Special Minister of State, Senator Ludwig, mentioned that ophthalmologists earn half a million dollars: I am not sure whether Minister Ludwig has run a business, but I am certain that Minister Roxon has not run a business because income and revenue is only one part of the equation in running a business—there are also costs. If costs go up—costs go up in the real world—they do not rise by less than the CPI; wage costs do not go up by less than average weekly earnings. That is something that the minister has not even acknowledged. There is actually an important point to be made here. In 1996 the government made a deliberate decision to index the Medicare benefits schedule by less than CPI. Why? Essentially to include an assumption for productivity gains. So there is an inbuilt assumption of productivity gains in the way the indexation of the MBS works. Since the item was first introduced when surgery took 45 minutes, we have had a 30 per cent reduction in rebates in 1987 and a further 10 per cent reduction in 1996, and since 1996 there has been a deliberate decision to keep indexation below CPI to essentially build in those productivity gains.
Having imposed all these productivity gains over the past 22 years, the government is now turning around and saying it wants to squeeze another 50 per cent out of this lemon. There comes a time when there is nothing left to squeeze. There is a very interesting Access Economics report on all of this. It is dated 2004, so it came out after this particular type of indexation had been in place for 12 years. It deals with the impact on general practice, but the principle is the same. I urge Minister Roxon to have a very close look at how the indexation of the MBS works and how productivity gains are built into the way that indexation is worked out.
The reality is that the government had a political strategy, and the government’s political strategy was again on display in the minister’s comments in the Senate today. The two main arguments are (1) ophthalmologists earn too much and (2) the procedure is now much simpler, faster and presumably, according to the government, cheaper to perform. Let us consider those arguments in turn. Firstly, the attack on doctors and ophthalmologists: the minister’s main argument in favour of these cuts to Medicare rebates for cataract surgery is that ophthalmologists earn too much. True to form the Minister for Health and Ageing is running yet another campaign demonising a group of Australians. Incredibly, she even enlisted the support of the Australian Labor Party organisation, making the government’s attack on ophthalmologists extraordinarily party political. Does she realise that she is a minister of the Crown, that she is no longer involved in student politics? In her ham-fisted determination to push this through, she was completely oblivious to the invaluable contribution ophthalmologists have made and will continue to make to our community, alongside all of our many hardworking and dedicated healthcare professionals across other areas.
Again today the government attacked the opposition because we are siding with the specialists. The reality is that we are standing up for patients, first and foremost. That the government considers it a good idea to run a campaign against a group of healthcare professionals that is based on the politics of envy is a matter of great concern. A month or so ago it was a campaign against community pharmacists, as part of the budget cut on chemotherapy; then it was Australians with private health insurance; and this week it is ophthalmologists. Who is going to be in the minister’s sights next week? The government says this is about doctors earning too much. The government is not doing a single thing about doctors’ fees. Doctors’ fees will not change as a result of the cut in the rebate that is payable to patients. The only thing that will change is the out-of-pocket expense faced by patients, which will go up. There will be no change to doctors’ fees as a result of what the government is doing.
One of the sources mentioned by the government was an article in the British Medical Journal and it is where the minister took a quote out of context. In fact, that is the only source the minister gave as to where she got that 15-minute reference. I want to quote from the author of the article referred to by Minister Roxon, Professor Tien Wong from the Centre for Eye Research Australia, University of Melbourne. He states:
I would like to state categorically that my British Medical Journal editorial is misquoted in this context. First, it is an opinion editorial piece on how cataract surgery has evolved. I did not conduct a formal research project to evaluate specifically cataract surgery time. Second, the surgical time of course is only a small part of the cataract surgery procedure. There are pre and post op assessments. Cataract surgery is very cost-effective, even at the current price, and there are major significant adverse effects of not doing it. For example, the Blue Mountains Eye Study has shown the impacts of visual impairment on falls, hip fractures, earlier institutionalisation, loss of self rated health, depression, earlier mortality et cetera. The minor savings will be eaten up many times over by the cost of not doing cataract surgery.
The government have not thought this through. I want to quickly touch on the item for complex cataract procedures because we have included it in the disallowance and I think it is important for the Senate to understand why we have done it. Everything here with this government is smoke and mirrors. Just because they describe something as a complex procedure and a complex item, they think that people believe that it is. Do you know what they have done? They have taken item No. 42702, the most commonly used item—95 per cent, perhaps even more, of cataract surgery is claimed under this item—and applied the two per cent increase that is applied every time the MBS is indexed, and they have renamed it. They have taken the old standard rebate, applied the usual two per cent indexation which was applied across the board to the MBS, and renamed it ‘complex surgery’ and then they cut everything else by 50 per cent.
We consulted with the profession about including this in the disallowance motion. If this disallowance motion is successful in relation to the three other cataract surgery MBS items then essentially this complex item becomes redundant. This complex item was only ever part of the minister’s political strategy. To use Minister Ludwig’s terminology: this was part of Minister Roxon’s ‘political cover’. She wanted to say that she was doing something reasonable. They are taking $98 million out of this service, they are forcing tens of thousands of patients into the public system where this procedure costs more and she says, ‘But, look, aren’t we reasonable, aren’t we wonderful, because we have created this new complex item?’
You know what? She tried to announce it twice. It was announced on budget night and then, when the government was trying to crank up its scare campaign, all of a sudden it was reannounced in October as if it was a new revelation. I have had question after question from journalists about this. Every now and then journalists do not do enough research. Some of them are really good and do a lot of research; others are not quite as good. When they see a press release from the minister and after the spin doctors walk through the press gallery, they might take the minister at her word. In October, the minister said: ‘Look at this. We’ve got this compromise proposal. We’ve got a new complex item.’ After you scratch the surface, you realise that it is just a reannouncement.
If I had more time, I would have gone into how the minister refused to provide us with answers in relation to the constructive proposal by the ophthalmologist profession on achieving savings using Avastin instead of Lucentis. The reality is that the department told me today that the minister has had advice from them since 26 June 2009 in relation to that matter. What has the government done? Nothing. This is yet another matter in relation to which the Minister for Health and Ageing has been sitting on her hands.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICES TABLE) REGULATIONS 2009</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,2,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-10-28,"—As co-sponsor of the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations 2009 disallowance motion, I thought I would make sure I spoke. If this disallowance motion does not go through, you will find some ordinary Australians out of pocket 300 bucks. This government have taken not only the Australia public for granted on this issue but, quite clearly, the Senate for granted on this issue. They have taken them for granted. They have been mischievous at best in trying to manoeuvre a way around to not allow this disallowance motion to have effect. They have to come to the reality that this is a concern for the Australian public and they have to make sure that they sit down with various people to get to a common-sense arrangement rather than saying: ‘Stuff you all. We’re going to put this thing through and the only people this is going to hurt are the Australian public and they are going to be out of pocket 300 bucks.’ It is the wrong way of doing it.
They have taken the Australian public for granted and they have tried to take the Senate for granted, and it clearly has not worked. They cannot see through their own spin that quite clearly this is going to hurt those Australians who want to have the operation done and, if this disallowance does not go through, all that is going to happen is that people are going to be charged more for the surgery. They will be out of pocket. If they think that overcharging is going on, they need to find another way of addressing it, rather than making sure that the Australian public end up paying more.
Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure performed on older Australians and it is seen as a vital element in preventing falls, fractures and loss of mobility in the elderly. Do not take the elderly for granted. They value their health and they value the insurance that gives them peace of mind. The government are at a stage where they are undermining people’s trust in them with regard to health. This is another issue that the government have taken for granted, and this disallowance motion is very important in getting them to go back and look at other ways to address the problem as they see it.
Do not pass the problem on to those vulnerable people who will be charged more for cataract surgery if this disallowance motion does not get through. I make it clear that the government have to go back and do some work. They should stop trying to do nothing—believing in their own spin, not seeing through it—and do something that will actually address the problem, rather than just passing it on to the Australian public and saying they are doing something. That is wrong. I encourage all members of this chamber to support the disallowance motion.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICES TABLE) REGULATIONS 2009</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-10-28,"—I am not going to reiterate the arguments I made a short time ago other than to highlight our belief that this issue is about patients. They are being caught in the middle. I am concerned that the government is trying to hide behind the argument that wealthy practitioners are seeking to line their own pockets. I have highlighted the fact that we are concerned about some of the high costs and that this rebate probably does need to be reviewed—but in finer detail, not by just slashing it in half. We do not wear the argument that the only reason we should support the cut to this rebate is that there are practitioners who have high incomes. As I said, we acknowledge that there are issues there; equally, we think there are issues on the side of the ophthalmologists, who are concerned about it being slashed to just one rate, and that there needs to be some finessing of that.
The government have also highlighted, as has the opposition, the point that if the bill we have just dealt with does not pass the House of Representatives and this disallowance motion goes through we may be in scenario where we do not have any rebate for this procedure. I have sought advice on this and, as I understand it, the government could bring in a new rebate tomorrow. In other words, they have had plenty of time to sit down and talk to the ophthalmologists about this and plenty of time to deal with it, yet it still has not been resolved. As I said, there are issues on both sides; it is not the fault of one side or the other. However, patients are again being caught in the middle. The government could bring back a new rebate today. There is plenty of room for the government to manoeuvre.
It is unfortunate that we have had to go to these lengths to achieve this. I do take slight offence that this is being termed a stunt. The Senate is here to debate these issues. These concerns have been firmly on the agenda for months and months—since May. The government is right; it put this on the agenda in May—and people started raising concerns then. This was raised at budget estimates in May and early June, so it should come as no surprise that these issues are of concern. The Greens have been very careful to listen to both sides of the debate on this. We have heard the ophthalmologists, we have heard the government and we have sympathies for both. The point is: this issue has not been resolved, so we are reduced to this process in the Senate. Unfortunately, it is a mess.
The Greens want to see a way forward out of this. We have been trying to negotiate a way forward but unfortunately it has come down to this. We do not want to have issues of a complex nature such as this one on rebates sorted out in this chamber. It would have been much better if it had been resolved earlier. Unfortunately, it has not been and we have come to crunch time. The Greens have not been convinced that just halving the rebate in this way is the way to go. As I said, we have concerns about the impact of these cuts on those on low incomes and on the ageing in our community.
We are not convinced by the government’s call on this. We are extremely sympathetic to dealing with this issue but we have not been convinced by their arguments. Equally, we are not convinced by the arguments of the ophthalmologists that we should do nothing; we do think there should be some refinement of this rebate. We do not support the process to date and believe the government need to go back and rethink it. Equally, ophthalmologists need to be prepared to enter into negotiations about how we can resolve this in a way that causes the least pain to the people caught in the middle—that is, low-income Australians and the ageing in our community. We urge the government to rethink this and, if this disallowance motion is successful, to come back immediately with new rebate figures that can be supported by both sides—in the same way that they entered into negotiations with health professionals, the community and consumers to come up with a satisfactory outcome in the ART debate. The government do not have to leave this languishing. The ball is back in their court to show some maturity in this debate and come back with rebates that meet everybody’s requirements.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICES TABLE) REGULATIONS 2009</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-10-28,"—I have articulated the nub of the debate a couple of times this morning and I will not take up the full time allotted me. We need to get onto Senate work. Let me make this statement right at the outset and then I will deal in short form with the content of the debate: this is Senate obstructionism, clear and simple. The opposition are simply blocking the legislative program of the Senate. They have hijacked the Senate to allow this mad debate to proceed. It is a silly position that the opposition have adopted. I am sorry that the Greens have brought themselves into it as well. Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon might try to hide behind it as a serious debate about forcing the government to negotiate, but it could only fairly be described as a political stunt.
Let me correct the record. Senator Cormann knows that the public hospital system does not access the MBS. He was referring to the hospital system. He knows that he was in fact misleading—
—But what about the specialists working there?
—Again he interjects to cover up his mistakes and misleading of the Senate. There is always difficulty with these types of debates. I know that sometimes the opposition may not like to hear the truth in these matters, but it does not give them the right to interject. They know interjection is disorderly and it only extends the debate unnecessarily. Of course, Senator Cormann knows the truth of those matters. He should make it plain, rather than reading great slab of words which he knows are misleading.
Earlier, Senator Williams made a contribution about rural and regional consumers, and it is worth responding to Senator Williams in kind. There are two issues—firstly, Commonwealth assistance to support regional and rural delivery of cataract services. The government supports eye services through a number of mechanisms such as the Medicare program, the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program, the Visiting Optometrists Scheme, the PHI and the Macular Degeneration Foundation. These are important government initiatives in rural and regional Australia. In addition, there are Indigenous matters. For many Indigenous patients, the pathology means that cataract surgery is difficult and time consuming, and they will benefit from the new higher fee. Items will be available to any patient with similar difficulties and complexities, and $58.3 million is being allocated to improve eye and ear services in Central Australia. In his contributions to the debate today, they were the two issues that Senator Williams engaged with in a genuine sense, and I answer him in that way.
As I have indicated, the position this chamber is faced with is clear. If you support the disallowance motion then, stunts aside, you are clearly supporting a motion that will remove the item from the schedule. That is what the Senate can do. That is within the legislative ability of this chamber and that is what, if this motion is carried, it will do. That will be the position that you will have put yourselves in. The sensible course is to oppose the disallowance to ensure that the government can continue to have an MBS schedule which provides this support for patients and consumers. We can debate backwards and forwards about the merits of it, but this is the position that the minister has arrived at through, I suspect, difficult decision making. If you look at the statistics and the position that this government has arrived at, it is about ensuring that cataract procedures are remunerated appropriately under the MBS. That is the nub of the issue. To agree to anything else in this chamber would be to ensure that MBS item numbers cannot be altered, that you maintain specialists on MBS item numbers as you want. That puts Senator Cormann in the position simply of supporting specialists; there is no doubt about that.
The position that we urge the Senate to adopt is to reject this disallowance motion. The clear advice of course is that the opposition’s actions today will throw cataract procedures into disarray. That is the position that they have advocated and they will allow to occur today. The opposition should not try to hide behind or cover up their ineptitude in this area. This is the position that they are going to put patients and consumers in.
—It is about putting patients first!
—Of course, they can complain about that not being the position, but that is the position that will eventuate. They have been provided with very clear advice. That will be the effect of their actions, let there be no mistake about it. That is the position that the Senate will adopt if it supports the disallowance motion. It is not about putting patients first; it is about putting the interests of a group of specialists first, a group which earns over half a million dollars a year from Medicare alone.
As I indicated, I am not going to extend the debate on this any longer than necessary. In dealing with one other matter, the impact on waiting lists, in the rant that was provided by Senator Cormann, who covered a range of matters that were in some part related and in other parts unrelated to the debate that is before us, it is important to remember that the impact of the decision is purely dependent on whether ophthalmologists mitigate their charging practices. If Senator Cormann wants to talk about the real world than he should also understand how the real world operates. It is important to remember that they are earning more than half a million dollars from Medicare alone and will still be doing so after this change. That is before any gap fees or private health insurance contributions. We know the community wants government to fund new medicines, new technologies and new services, which means that, when new technologies lead to efficiencies, the funding should be adjusted accordingly. That is the real world; that is how it operates. Of course, there is not a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow for Senator Cormann to draw upon.
—They go to the Julia Gillard memorial pot—that is where they go.
—These are choices that have to be made and savings have to be harvested. Senator Cormann interjects again, but it only really highlights the challenge that Senator Cormann has in trying to explain his position. The opposition is always confronted with the difficulty of trying to persuade us on the merits of this argument. There is no merit in the argument and there is little merit in the procedure that has been adopted this morning, which can only be described as Senate obstructionism. I will not take up all the time in dealing with this issue and will close at this point.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICES TABLE) REGULATIONS 2009</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,2,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-28,"—I briefly indicate in reiterating my position that I support this disallowance motion, for the same reasons that I supported the Health Insurance Amendment (Revival of Table Items) Bill 2009, introduced by Senator Cormann this morning.
I take issue with what the minister has said. Ultimately the government can fix this mess. To say there will not be any rebate whatsoever and that people will be out of pocket does not ring true to me. Ultimately this is something that the government have the ability and the power to sort out. I think they can sort through this mess in goodwill and in good faith, because I do not think the way these proposed changes are to be implemented is satisfactory. To say that they are going to leave hundreds of thousands of Australians potentially without cataract surgery or having to shift to the public health system—which will cause taxpayers to bear a huge burden and cause increased pressure on an already stressed system—is not good enough.
I urge the government to sit down and negotiate in good faith so that this can be resolved. To say, ‘We are going to abandon any rebate’—have no rebate whatsoever—just does not ring true and I do not think it will ring true out in the community. This is about a fair way forward. If the government is worried about overcharging and if it is worried about informed financial consent, those issues should be dealt with separately, not in the context that the government has dealt with them in relation to this measure. This is a measure that is simply too blunt and that is too brutal in its effect on senior citizens.
I think that Senator Cormann is unfair in his criticisms of the Minister for Health and Ageing. I think she has done a lot of good things and I think there are a number of measures that she has implemented and that she is trying to implement that are worth while. But in relation to this particular measure I think there is a better way forward and that is why I support this disallowance.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICES TABLE) REGULATIONS 2009</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,2,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-10-28,"—I again place on record that this is not a political stunt, as Senator Ludwig has outlined in his contributions. How can it be such when you have the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Greens, Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon all disagreeing with the government? Senator Ludwig is starting to sound like a spoilt child who is not getting his own way.
The only reason that the coalition have acted in this way, with the support of the crossbench, is simply that this has become an urgent situation. The implementation of this measure was going to occur this weekend. The government had ample opportunity on Monday or Tuesday to bring their bill forward so that we could amend it. They were scared. They knew that we would amend the bill and that it would have passed this chamber, so they deliberately withheld the bill, forcing our hand to create an emergency situation which other senators from the crossbench and my colleague Senator Cormann have indicated is a last resort. That is what the government have forced us to do. We have rearranged the business to facilitate the passage of this legislation and the disallowance of these regulations to assist thousands of Australians.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICES TABLE) REGULATIONS 2009</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,2,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-10-28,"—Again I thank all senators that have contributed to this very important debate on these two very important measures that we have before us today: firstly, the Health Insurance Amendment (Revival of Table Items) Bill 2009, which was passed earlier and, secondly, this disallowance motion.
I want to commend Senator Siewert for her very insightful remarks. They echo, I am sure, the sentiments of Senators Fielding and Xenophon and certainly those of the coalition. We never wanted to get to this point. We went out on 8 September and gave public notice that a majority of senators did not support what the government was proposing to do. We said that if the government went ahead with the 50 per cent cut to the Medicare rebates for cataract surgery, it would hurt patients. It would force them into long public hospital queues, where the procedure costs taxpayers more to perform, and it would in particular hurt patients in rural and regional Australia. What did we think would happen when we made that announcement on 8 September? What was our expectation?
Our expectation was that a sensible minister who understands parliamentary accountability and understands that executive government is accountable to both houses of parliament would have realised that she had a problem. The government announced this budget cut in May, and a majority of senators indicated that they did not support that cut. What did the Minister for Health and Ageing do? To start with, she ignored us. She did nothing. She put her head in the sand. What was the next step? The next step was to run a scare campaign, to frighten patients, to frighten doctors, to threaten the Senate and to say, ‘If you go ahead with this there will be no rebate at all.’ That is not the way to treat the Senate.
We have expressed a very serious position based on very serious consideration of all of the issues. The Minister for Health and Ageing has form on this. Senator Xenophon clearly has a higher opinion of the minister’s performance than we on this side of the parliament have. However, I urge the Senate to reflect on Minister Roxon’s performance when it comes to legislation and budget measures before this Senate. It is as if she is driving a truck at 150 miles an hour, heading straight for the wall and, instead of slowing down, turning right or left, picking up some additional passengers, keeps going until the truck hits the wall and it is too late.
Senator Siewert is exactly right: the government could very easily fix this. If the government came out now and said: ‘Okay, we understand that we played it hard, but we don’t have the support. So we will go back to the original rebates for cataract surgery as they are in the most recent previous regulations.’ The government could do it in a whole number of ways. Probably the easiest way right now would be for the government to support our bill when it goes to the House of Representatives, to give it precedence and to vote in favour of it. That would fix it and it would fix it not only for this occasion but for the future, because the argument that the government are putting forward is completely untenable. The government are telling us that they have got delegated power through the Health Insurance Act 1973 to do whatever they want with the Medicare Benefits Schedule and that whatever it is they want to do, whether they want to introduce 90 per cent cuts to it—even if the government did the most irresponsible thing—the only option for the Senate would be to delete or not to delete.
From a public policy point of view that is not in our national interest. Whenever the government come into this parliament and want to pass legislation and we on this side complain—because it is our role to test and scrutinise—and say: ‘Well, there is not enough detail in this; all of your detail is going to be in the regulations,’ do you know what the government say? The government say, ‘Well, don’t you worry about that, Jana, because there is this disallowance process.’ All you need to do is move a disallowance and all will be fine. What this exercise has proved, very clearly, is that everything is not going to be fine. If this Senate wants to stand up for patients and if this Senate wants to make sure that elderly patients across Australia in desperate need of timely and affordable access to this very important life-saving surgery get it then a disallowance motion will not do the job. That is just not good enough, and that is why the opposition, together with Senators Fielding and Xenophon, very carefully considered all of the procedural options available to us.
Quickly, in summing up, I will just refer to the advice Minister Roxon has circulated today. There is a particular comment in this briefing note, signed by David Learmonth, a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Health and Ageing, and signed as noted by Nicola Roxon, the minister. Point 5 says, ‘While the advice provided to Senator Cormann at the hearing on 21 October 2009 was correct, as a matter of general principle much depends upon the way in which this disallowance motion is drafted.’ Tell us something we do not know! The reality is this. I am not meaning to embarrass her, but I am sure the official now realises that she actually got it wrong in the answer that she provided at Senate estimates. I was a bit surprised at the firmness of her response and at her clear indication that if the Senate disallowed those items we would return to the previous rebates. I did not expect that answer.
I am concerned that, since having given what I believe was an incorrect answer, the department have not gone out of their way, and the government have not gone out of their way, to correct that information. The department are now trying to cover up their tracks. They are trying to have it both ways and are suggesting, ‘Oh, well, what we said was really right but, really, it depends on how it is introduced.’ That is just rubbish. The question was very specific: ‘What would happen if the government disallowed those rebates?’ The officer knew what I was talking about. The answer was:
I think that it would revert back to the previous rebate.
We did consider a whole series of procedural options to make sure we achieved our objective. We are not wedded to process; we are flexible with our process. We are focused on the objective we are trying to achieve, and that is to stop the government from cutting rebates for cataract surgery by 50 per cent and to do it in a way that will not leave thousands and thousands of patients and doctors out there without the certainty of having that rebate in place on an ongoing basis.
We do not want to be part of a circumstance where, because of this disallowance, the item numbers are all of a sudden deleted altogether. That is why we initially planned to move an amendment to the Health Insurance Act through the Health Insurance Amendment (Compliance) Bill 2009—to be very flexible on process but very focused on the outcomes we wanted to achieve. When the government played its little tricks in the House of Representatives yesterday, we swiftly changed process but remained very focused on the outcomes we wanted to achieve. This has got nothing to do with obstruction; this has everything to do with standing up for patients. It should tell you something—that is, that government senators are the only ones in this chamber who think what we are doing here today is a stunt. It is not a stunt; this is very serious business. This is about standing up for patients.
I do have to respond to a few other remarks that Minister Ludwig made. The minister talked about private and public hospitals; he actually tried to sell as a virtue that this only applies to the private system, that it does not apply to the public system. Tell us something that we do not know. We know that you are targeting people who access the surgery through the private system, even though the only saving you will make is $313 per procedure, and the additional cost that you will impose on taxpayers is an additional $3,500 plus to provide the service in public hospitals. We understand that, and we understand that patients who will get access to this procedure through the public system—if they are lucky enough to get in—will get that access for free. But the thing that the minister does not understand is the reality of the health workforce across Australia. Ophthalmologists actually happen to work in both the private and the public systems. You pooh-poohed the quote I read out. This was a very dedicated ophthalmologist, and you totally dismissed anything he said. Here is an ophthalmologist who operates as a private practitioner in Sydney, and he happens to go and provide services in outback New South Wales. What does the minister not understand about this? If you make his private practice less viable it will make it more difficult for him to do some of the other things—for example, to provide services to regional New South Wales. I find it quite astounding that the minister is not able to understand such a simple fact.
I ran out of time before on the issue of Avastin and Lucentis. The minister and officials of the department have been running this line about how ophthalmologists have not come forward with constructive ideas on how we can achieve efficiencies. The reality is that they have. I am not going to hold up the Senate by going through all of those proposals again, but a specific one was in relation to exploring the use of Avastin as a much cheaper option to achieve similar clinical outcomes. I asked questions about this at the end of July and, as Minister Ludwig well knows, because he had to take the question on Minister Roxon’s behalf, after 90 days no answer was provided. We again had to use what the minister would describe as a ‘procedural trick’, a ‘stunt’—whatever he wants to call it—to force the government to the table to provide an answer that the Australian people are entitled to. I thought I would get a bit of information, and guess what? I asked:
Has the department received a Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists working party recommendation that it is clinically appropriate to use medications such as Avastin and Triamcinolene to treat blinding conditions as part of an intravitreal injection …
The answer was yes, that they did get that advice. I asked what Minister Roxon was doing about it, and the answer to parts (c) and (d) of the question was, ‘The minister is considering this advice and has requested further information.’ I asked, ‘Do you know when the minister received that advice?’ The answer provided to the question on notice was, ‘On 26 June 2009.’ This is a minister who is not interested in constructively exploring positive ways of achieving efficiencies. This minister is not interested in achieving efficiencies in the health system in a way that does not hurt patients. If she were, she would not have been sitting on this for more than four months. In the interest of being able to conclude this debate, I will leave it at that. I commend this disallowance motion to the Senate.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2009-10-28,"—Today I rise to highlight the importance of the Rudd government’s stimulus strategy to Western Australia. Since the global financial crisis began, unemployment has risen rapidly in my home state. In October of last year unemployment in WA stood at 2.7 per cent. Since then it has risen every month, including last month, and now stands at 5.7 per cent. There are more than 70,000 unemployed in WA, more than double the number of a year ago. As someone who has worked for a job service provider, and as someone familiar with the expert evidence on the impact of unemployment recently presented to the Senate Economics Committee, I take very seriously this rise in unemployment in my home state.
Unemployment has the potential to permanently scar the lives of individuals. They lose skills, lose the opportunity to gain experience, lose confidence and even lose hope. For young people, the impact may be particularly pronounced. The experience of unemployment at the start of their working lives can result in a feeling of worthlessness that affects the entire trajectory of their careers. Older workers, on the other hand, often find it difficult to retrain when they are required to shift jobs late in life. Older workers are also more likely to have dependants who rely on their employment. Unemployment puts pressure on household budgets and strain on personal relationships.
When unemployment is concentrated in particular communities, its impact is heightened. The flow-on effects can destroy local business and undermine community capacity. The longer the period of unemployment, the greater the impact. Communities scarred by high levels of long-term unemployment are often marred by intergenerational poverty. Consequences of such poverty include increased welfare dependency, drug and alcohol abuse, juvenile delinquency, family breakdown and high rates of chronic disease and mental illness. In addition to the human costs, the net result is increased expenditure on social security payments, on health services, on child protection, on policing, on courts and on prisons.
Long-term unemployment is defined as unemployment lasting longer than 12 months. On this basis, the next 12 months are critical. To minimise the negative impact of the global financial crisis we must minimise any long-term unemployment that results from this downturn. This will be a real challenge. We know from past global recessions that the number of long-term unemployed is likely to rise. There is a time lag between the recovery in the economy in terms of growth and the recovery in terms of employment. Following the recession of the early 1990s, unemployment rates took more than a decade to return to pre-recession levels. Let me repeat that: after the last recession unemployment took more than a decade to come down.
So, when the opposition argue that the stimulus should be wound back at the first sign of recovery, they either are economically illiterate or simply do not care about the unemployed. Signs of resilience in the economies of our Asian neighbours may be enough for the opposition. A recovery in business confidence may be enough for the opposition. A lack of a technical recession may be enough for the opposition. But it is not enough for Labor, because we care about those thousands of unemployed Australians. There are 70,000 of them in WA alone. I am proud that the Rudd government’s early and decisive action has helped to avoid recession and to protect thousands of jobs. I am proud that leading Australian economists and business groups, the IMF, the OECD and even the Liberal Premier of WA all recognise that the Rudd government stimulus strategy has cushioned Australia from the worst of the downturn.
I am even prouder that the Rudd government sees this as the beginning and not the end of the battle to ensure Australia’s prosperity and to combat the insidious effects of unemployment. That is why I want to highlight the critical role of our stimulus initiatives in securing employment in WA. The Rudd government stimulus strategy is designed to support growth and jobs now, while investing in physical infrastructure and human capital for the future. The aim is to minimise unemployment now, while preparing Australia for the opportunities that recovery will bring. The first phase of the stimulus involved targeted payments to low- and middle-income families, working Australians, pensioners and carers and drought-affected farmers. When I spoke on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan in February I said that the aim of these payments was to deliver an immediate stimulus to the whole economy, one that would bolster consumer confidence and reach into every community, however small or remote. The stimulus was vital to support jobs, especially in my home state of Western Australia, which has so many isolated, regional communities.
Now that the figures on consumer spending, business confidence and retail employment for the first part of this year are in, we know this strategy has worked. The second phase of the stimulus strategy involved funding for shovel-ready infrastructure, spending on investments in schools and housing, energy efficiency, roads and boom gates and community infrastructure. Once again, the stimulatory effect of this spending is dispersed throughout the nation, including the many far-flung communities of WA. For example, 183 WA primary schools received funding under round 1 of the P21 school modernisation program and 349 WA primary schools received funding under the second round. This represents an investment in WA local communities of some $930 million.
This spending is supporting local jobs and businesses now while ensuring that schools can provide our children with the education they need for future success. Similar investments are being made in the infrastructure of our secondary schools, TAFEs and universities, all targeted at equipping our young people to take advantage of future opportunities—investments like $4 million for the construction industry apprentices training facility at the West Coast TAFE in Clarkson under the Training Infrastructure Investment for Tomorrow program. The government’s $650 million Jobs Fund is the linchpin of its employment strategy. A wide range of local infrastructure projects have been funded through the Jobs Fund because a diverse industry base is critical to future prosperity. The $5.5 million being invested in WA heritage places, such as the Shark Bay World Heritage Area, will generate jobs now while enhancing the capacity of communities to attract tourists in the future.
A substantial proportion of stimulus spending is directed at developing more sustainable communities and at preparing for a low carbon economy. Geraldton was the first community in Australia to benefit from the Rudd government’s $40 million investment in cycling infrastructure. Their funding will provide for the construction of new bike racks, bike lanes and off-road bike paths and, once again, generate local jobs. Similarly, the Western Australian Council of Social Services is receiving $1.8 million to recruit, train and employ greenhouse auditors. It is particularly important that we take steps to address unemployment in areas of highly entrenched disadvantage, so I am delighted that the Rudd government is investing heavily in some of our most disadvantaged communities through the $180 million East Kimberley development package. The package will upgrade sporting grounds, recreational facilities and vital transport linkages while providing Indigenous locals with desperately needed jobs.
Nation building for recovery lies at the heart of the Rudd government’s stimulus strategy. This year’s budget included an $8.5 billion investment in critical economic infrastructure projects so that when recovery comes our ports, roads and rail networks will have the capacity to service a growing economy. These projects include the Oakajee Port common user facilities which will service the needs of WA’s growing iron ore industry. To maximise the employment generated by projects such as the massive Gorgon LNG project we will need skilled workers to grasp the jobs created. The $2 billion Productivity Places program, our major reforms to training and higher education and our Securing Australian Apprenticeships program will all contribute to this objective. Our recent announcement of a new national resource sector task force will ensure that training is targeted to meet the needs of such major projects.
WA is of critical importance to the Australian economy. It has the highest rate of population growth and accounted for 38 per cent of Australia’s exports last year. With ongoing demand for our commodities from the rapidly growing economies in our region, WA is well placed to help drive Australia’s recovery. The Rudd government’s policy settings have done much to keep Western Australia working, but we must continue to be vigilant, to support jobs and livelihoods, to protect people from the social harm caused by unemployment, to assist people who become unemployed to reskill and to invest in the infrastructure that will support our national recovery, unlock Western Australia’s full economic potential and create the jobs of the future. I call on the opposition to join us in supporting these important initiatives and to stand up for Western Australian jobs.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Employment</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2009-10-28,"—I seek leave to incorporate additional information in answer to a question and to two supplementary questions that Senator Siewert asked me yesterday about the impact of the Timor Sea oil spill upon Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone and possibly on Indonesian communities.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
I am advised that satellite imagery on 1 September 2009 showed that small patches of weathered oil had crossed into Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but not its territorial waters. The Australian Embassy in Jakarta notified the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs as soon as possible on 3 September 2009 as a matter of good neighbourly relations and mindful of the 1996 MOU between our two Governments on Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response.
Since that time, overflights have indicated that patches of weathered oil and sheen have remained within Indonesia’s EEZ, closing to some 51 nautical miles south east of Palau Roti around 21 September 2009. Subsequent regular overflights however indicated the weathered oil and sheen had moved further offshore.
As part of the ongoing response to the oil spill, two vessels entered Indonesia’s EEZ on 23 September 2009 to conduct containment and recovery operations, using a boom and oil spill skimmer, on heavier patches of oil that had been sighted by aircraft. These vessels have been supported by overflying aircraft to direct them to the heavier patches of oil. Australia notified Indonesia of the presence of the vessels and their activities in Indonesia’s EEZ on 23 September 2009.
These operations were completed within several days and the vessels then returned to an area within several nautical miles of the platform in Australia’s EEZ
An overflight on 1 October 2009 was conducted from Darwin with two officials from the Indonesian Director General of Sea Transportation on board. On this flight sheen was observed some 62 nautical miles south east of Palau Roti.
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) assesses that the type and amount of oil that has been observed in Indonesia’s EEZ is considered to pose no significant threat to the marine environment or any coastlines or reefs. AMSA will continue to monitor the situation and the Government will keep Indonesia closely informed of the movement of the oil and our response efforts.
The Government is aware of reporting of impacts in Indonesia and will discuss with Indonesia any concerns it has about the presence of oil in its EEZ, including assessing any question of damage or loss arising from the Montara Wellhead oil spill. The Government anticipates that the company would be involved in any such discussions if they are required and notes that the company has fully cooperated with the Government on the response to the spill to date.
Australia will continue to act consistently with international law and our strong bilateral relationship with Indonesia in responding to this incident.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Timor Sea Oil Spill</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,9,1
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2009-10-28,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by Senators Fierravanti-Wells and Scullion today relating to border protection.
I rise once again to speak about what is fast becoming an absolute farce: the plan that this Prime Minister billed as his so-called Indonesian solution. It is now becoming an utter shambles. I cannot help but quote the comments of my colleague Tony Abbott yesterday evening on Lateline. Much has been said in the last few days about the former government’s Pacific solution but can I say, as Mr Abbott has said, ‘John Howard found a problem and created a solution; Kevin Rudd found a solution and has now created a problem.’
The opposition of course has been prosecuting its case in relation to this for quite some time. But now, finally, it is good to see that the media in this country is picking up on the issue. One only has to look at the blaring headlines in the daily papers over the last few days to see that. I will quote some of them: ‘Ad hoc solution no long-term answer’; ‘PM’s Indon plan all at sea’; ‘Local fury strands Rudd plan’; ‘Boat stand-off pressures Prime Minister’; and ‘Rudd isn’t clear on asylum seekers. How can voters make sense of it when his statements remain so confusing?’
We now have this situation where the Oceanic Viking has sailed over 2,000 kilometres. We have this absolutely chaotic situation where we really do not know what is going on. What this is showing is that this government’s plan is actually not a plan—it is a boat-by-boat situation and it seems to lurch from boat to boat. In fact, it is really just improvisation. We seem to go from one crisis to the next. One only has to read the press to see that even refugee advocate groups are now criticising this government. Last week at estimates the Ambassador for People-Smuggling Issues told us that it is his role to take a cross-government perspective on issues pertaining to people smuggling. He told us on 22 October:
We have not actually sat down with the Indonesians yet to negotiate what this framework will look like and what forms our support will take.
The day after, we had this $50 million tab being put on this so-called plan, which is effectively outsourcing our border protection policy failure to the Indonesians.
Of course, pressed on the issue, nobody in the government can give us any details in relation to it or tell us what the cost of this would be. The home affairs minister simply does not want to talk about it, and he probably does not know. Chances are that this $50 million so-called plan has been hatched somewhere in the Prime Minister’s office and there have been some frenzied calls to the Indonesian President, and all of a sudden it is being billed as a plan.
There is a hypocrisy about this. I pick up this point from an article by Piers Akerman in which he shows the hypocrisy. I see Senator Faulkner walking out. Senator Faulkner has been very keen in estimates to press the issue of engagement. Regarding the Senate select committee October 2002 report into a Certain Maritime Incident, Senator Faulkner was happy to prosecute and wanted to know all about Indonesian engagement, including the possible limits of disruption policy, and he asked a wave of questions. It was all very well then. The hypocrisy is that now that we ask for details the government is just shutting down on the issue.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,10,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2009-10-28,"—I have been in this Senate long enough to remember the events that occurred in 2001.
—You’re still suffering!
—And I have been here long enough to know that most of what Senator McGauran says in interjections should be ignored, so I will ignore him.

Senator Fierravanti-Wells interjecting—

—Order! Order on my left!
—Mr Deputy President, the previous speaker was listened to in complete silence. Senator Fierravanti-Wells said that former Prime Minister John Howard found a problem and created a solution. I remember that when the Tampa appeared and rescued the people who were in danger of drowning we were told, and the Australian people were told, that their parents had thrown their children overboard. Of course, we remember that that turned out to be one of the greatest lies to be perpetrated on the Australian public, and it was used maliciously and malevolently in the election campaign, including by the then Minister for Defence, Mr Reith. So do not lecture us about the problems of dealing with asylum seekers. We were here. We drew attention to the disastrous and cynical policies that you followed when you were in government.
You criticise the current government for talking to the Indonesians about resolving these issues, when many of the people who are seeking to come to Australia are paying people smugglers to get here. We are seeking to negotiate and work with the Indonesian government on many of the people who are transiting. We get criticised for that, but what was the approach of the previous government? They did deals with Nauru and other Pacific countries and essentially said, ‘Take the problem off Australia’s hands.’ That was the approach of the Howard government and the previous ministers in charge of this portfolio. The old adage in the law is: if you are going to complain come with clean hands. The current opposition do not have clean hands on this issue. Their hands are absolutely dirty when it comes to dealing with this.
This is a serious issue. We recognise that, and that is why, when the opposition were in government, we worked with them on such issues as the excision of certain islands from our migration zone and on an approach which recognised that Christmas Island would be an appropriate location for the processing of boat people, and that is what is currently happening. Nobody denies that this is a major issue and a major problem for the country. We are seeking to deal with it in a humane way, but also in a firm way, to ensure that the people who are seeking to come to Australia are not allowed to enter willy-nilly. Rather, we are seeking to work in a regional way to enforce our borders and, at the same time, to work through the mechanisms that have been established internationally, through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and others, to ensure that genuine claimants are treated appropriately.
I also recall the images that so starkly illustrated the former government’s policy—those children behind the razor wire. They were some of the most disgraceful pictures of people incarcerated in this country. Eventually those places had to close because, finally, the genuine liberals within the Liberal Party recognised it was an inhumane policy and agreed to stop it. Of course we abolished TPVs, temporary protection visas. You supported us. Now you raise the spectre of those TPVs but, when put to the test, you are not prepared to say you will bring them back. This is clearly a major problem. We are dealing with it. For the opposition to try to lecture us about the inhumanity of this is the height of hypocrisy.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,10,1
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2009-10-28,"—I rise today to take note of answers given by Senator Evans. Mr Rudd’s border protection policy is in complete chaos. As ever, he is all talk and no action. It appears that Mr Rudd has no solution in Indonesia or anywhere else for the border protection policy chaos he has created. The Prime Minister still has 78 asylum seekers stranded at sea on the Oceanic Viking because of his failure to recognise the consequences of his own decisions and to provide a new and sustainable solution. All week the opposition has been asking questions of the Prime Minister about his role in the Oceanic Viking fiasco, and he has been washing his hands of it.
The minister in his answer at question time today said he was confident these people will be disembarking in Indonesia in the near future. I was horrified to read on the Australian news website at lunchtime today:
The standoff creates a dilemma for Australian officials, with government sources confirming any forcible removals from the Oceanic Viking would be the responsibility of the Australian crew, and not Indonesian police.
It is understood Indonesian police have no authority to act in such a fashion aboard an Australian ship, leaving the 30-odd crew aboard the Viking the task of evicting any intransigents.
This is of great concern to me. As part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, last year I spent a week in the Torres Strait with Border Protection Command, under commander Rear Admiral Allan du Toit. I really wonder if the people on HMAS Wollongong whom I spent time with thought that they might end up having to do something like what the 30 personnel on the Oceanic Viking may have to do. It just beggars belief.
I will go to Michelle Grattan’s comments today:
Australia obviously has no control over the detention centre to which the people are bound and it has to rely on the international agencies to try to ensure the people are treated decently. For a Government spruiking its humane approach, this is, at best, awkward.
Well, where do we go from here? This Australian ship has been floating around in the ocean for over a week and we still have no idea who is in control of the issue. Presumably it is the Prime Minister, but he says he cannot recall the directives and sequence of events. So, if he is in control, he must be completely and utterly out of control. Who is really dealing with this issue? The foreign minister has today not ruled out the use of force to remove the Sri Lankans from the Oceanic Viking. That is why I asked: will it be up to the 30-man crew on the Oceanic Viking to do this job?
Mr Rudd and Labor must now acknowledge that they have a huge problem and they should stop trying to spin the boats away. Labor are conflicted, divided and confused on border protection, and the people smugglers know it. The arrival of the 45th boat and 2,069 people since August 2008 demonstrates that Mr Rudd and Labor’s policy of winding back our border protection regime has failed. The coalition’s record on border protection speaks for itself, and it is well known to the Australian people and the people smugglers. The Rudd Labor government has gone soft on border protection and the people of my state of Western Australia in particular are very much taking notice of this. The former Howard government’s tough stance on border protection speaks for itself. The boats stopped coming and people smugglers had to look elsewhere.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,10,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2009-10-28,"—I am glad that the opposition have chosen to focus on this issue in taking note of answers today, because there are a number of myths that hopefully, if I get the time, I will be able to highlight. But before I do that I want to reflect on the surprise that I think the Senate as a whole should have that the opposition have chosen to take on this issue in the way that they have. Senator Forshaw quite clearly highlighted some of the history here and the point that the opposition do not have clean hands in this matter.
I want to refer to a couple of issues that are relevant to what was raised by some members of the opposition. Firstly, we all need to be reminded, as Senator Forshaw mentioned in the context of the Tampa, that it was the previous government, in the lead-up to a federal election, during the caretaker period, under the caretaker convention, that quite cynically changed our approach to asylum seekers arriving by sea—and put enormous pressure, Senator Adams, on Australian Defence Force personnel. I participated in our first Defence Force Parliamentary Program. I was on the HMAS Adelaide. I know full well how our Defence Force personnel felt about the pressures they were placed under by the Howard government. So the opposition does not have clean hands, and the hypocrisy that has arisen in the debate so far astounds me.
I want to refer to a summary, since Senator Fierravanti-Wells talked about the fact that she was glad that the opposition was now getting headlines on this issue. As if it is about press headlines! Where is the compassion in this debate? How can the opposition stand up here today and say what they have in relation to asylum seekers and feign compassion when they are talking about cataract surgery—feign that compassion is about them arguing that funds should go there rather than to the stimulus package—and then get up here and talk about the asylum seeker debate in the way in which they have? It is not about press headlines.
Yes, Senator Adams, this is an awkward situation, but let us look at why it is awkward. It is awkward because Sri Lanka has just emerged from a decades long civil war which cost tens of thousands of lives, uprooted hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans and left an economic divide between north and south, east and west. There are currently 250,000 Tamils from the north of Sri Lanka in camps for internally displaced people. You suggest that the ‘strong Howard government approach to border security’ solved these problems. Of course it did not. Of course, the intensity of these types of international issues is going to shift or vary over time. But the myth that the Howard government approach to asylum seekers is what reduced the number of people seeking asylum internationally is just laughable.
Let us look at some of the more intelligent media reflection on this issue. For instance, while flying up to Canberra on Monday I saw the Financial Review and I set aside an article by Geoffrey Barker. The conclusion to that article gives the more intelligent, reflective response, I think, to the current situation—a situation which is indeed, Senator Adams, awkward. No-one denies that it is awkward. In an article headed ‘PM’s policy an easy target’—thus the debate by an opposition looking for easy targets today—he concludes:
Rudd’s approach is not perfect. But it does try conscientiously to balance humanitarian obligations, toughness and political acceptability.
I do not apologise for being part of a government that seeks to balance humanitarian obligations with a tough border security policy. I do not try to argue that it is not awkward and that it is not difficult. There is nothing that is not awkward or difficult about the displacement and the political unrest amongst our neighbours. But we do have obligations internationally to seek to assist these people. That we do so, or seek to do so, in partnership with Indonesia makes an enormous amount of sense.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2009-10-28,"—It is not only shutting down on this issue. There is also sophistry on this issue because the longer this government is in power the more unauthorised boat arrivals we face. There have been 45 unauthorised boat arrivals in the 14 months of this government. The more this government is in power, the softer this country seems to be on border protection. The government realises that, despite trying to say it is tough on border protection, the public is awakening to its being soft on border protection. So what does the government decide to do? It decides to create a distraction, a decoy, because it does not want the news to be about the unauthorised boat arrivals. It wants the news to be something else. So there is spin over substance; there is spin and a decoy. Last night in Sydney the Prime Minister delivered a speech to the Business Council of Australia. It was called ‘Building a big Australia’. What he did not say is that his government is intent on building a big Australia through unauthorised boat arrivals—
—Go for it, Mary Jo!
—He spoke instead—
—Order! Senator Collins, I did hear you say that others were heard in silence, so I guess you should allow Senator Fisher to be heard in silence as well.
—In building a so-called big Australia, he spoke instead of a national strategic plan—national planning for our major cities to keep them, for example, developing in an environmentally friendly way—and, in keeping with this national government intervention in its nationally consistent strategic plan, he proposed to tie infrastructure funding to the states with compliance with this nationally consistent plan. The Prime Minister, tripping over himself in his eagerness to deliver the spin over the substance, and in delivering speed over substance, forgot to check and made mistakes. He forgot to check the detail of his Building the Education Revolution plan and the detail of his National Broadband Network plan under Minister Conroy.
In talking about a national strategic plan for building cities under this federal government, he forgot that in his government’s haste to roll out the Building the Education Revolution his government is presiding over state Labor governments creating nationally inconsistent rules to help the Building the Education Revolution happen in a hurry—and exempt from local planning laws. For example, in my state of South Australia—and yours, Mr Deputy President—Pulteney Grammar School demolished a bluestone building built in 1875 without having to go through the normal planning processes to do so. It did this to make way for the Prime Minister’s Building the Education Revolution. Trees of significance have gone. How is that environmentally friendly? How is that consistent with any national strategic plan and with national BER funding?
In Tasmania, our Senate Select Committee on National Broadband Network heard that in its haste to roll out the NBN, this federal Labor government is proposing to allow the state Labor government to exempt certain infrastructure building from local planning laws. This is to facilitate the hurried rolling out of the National Broadband Network in Tasmania. Where is the nationally consistent plan? How is it environmentally friendly to do that in a way that allows construction for the National Broadband Network to be 70 per cent aerial cables—
—Order! Senator Fisher, I would remind you that the motion before the chair is about taking note of answers given by Senator Evans to Senators Scullion and Fierravanti-Wells. I do think you are straying a bit far from the intent of the motion to take note of those answers.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. You bring me back, as does the government with spin over substance—because the longer Labor is in government, the more unauthorised boat arrivals there are to ‘build a bigger Australia’. The longer they are in government the more they are in haste to deliver less real substance in policy delivery. And, in the case of Minister Conroy, there is so much haste with the National Broadband Network that he delivers commercial-in-confidence information. More haste, less speed! There is certainly less broadband speed from Minister Conroy. The longer this government are in power— (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,10,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-10-28,"—What does a policy failure look like? How would we know one if we saw one? Perhaps a policy failure could be identified as the comprehensive failure to achieve every single one of a government’s stated objectives. We know what the government’s stated objectives are in relation to border protection. The stated objectives of the Rudd Labor government in relation to border protection were essentially the same as the stated objectives of the Howard government and other Australian governments before them—that is, to keep Australia’s maritime borders secure from unlawful arrivals.
So how can we judge whether the policy objective as stated by the Rudd Labor government has been achieved? It is not very hard. We can identify whether there has been a failure to achieve that objective by the extent to which there has been penetration of Australia’s maritime borders or attempts to penetrate those borders, and by that test the Rudd Labor government’s policy failure in relation to border protection has been absolute and  comprehensive. But, sadly, it is even worse than that. Not only has there been a comprehensive and total policy failure; by adopting a new suite of policies, announced in this chamber by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, in August last year, the Rudd Labor government has—as my friend and colleague Tony Abbott said on Lateline last night—taken a situation which had been solved and created a problem. That is the difference, as Mr Abbott pointed out.
When the Howard government was in office it found a problem and created a solution. At the time of the election of the Rudd Labor government, there was no longer a problem. The problem had been solved by the policy of the Howard government. The Rudd government, through its incompetence, through its inability to match its tough rhetoric with tough policies, in fact reinvented the problem.
Let us see what the track record was. The document to which I am about to refer has been prepared by the Parliamentary Library. It tabulates unlawful boat arrivals in Australia since 1989, before the election of the Howard government. It goes all the way back to when the Hawke government was in office. The document tells us that, in the four financial years from 1990 to 1994, there were about four or five unlawful boat arrivals a year. They began to increase significantly in 1994-95, when there were 21 unlawful arrivals. They fell away again for a few years and then the problem got really severe in 1998-99, when there were 42 unlawful arrivals. That was on the watch of the Howard government. It became more severe in the following year, 1999-2000, when there were 75 unlawful arrivals. In 2000-01 it remained very severe, when there were 54 unlawful arrivals, with 4,137 passengers on the boats. That is the year in which the Howard government introduced a suite of tough and decisive measures.
What happened after the Howard government introduced those measures in 2001? In 2001-02, the number of boat arrivals fell from 54 to 19, because the people smugglers were being put out of business. The people smugglers were being put out of business because they could no longer deliver to their customers the promise to secure an immigration outcome on the shores of Australia. In 2002-03 the number of unlawful boats setting sail across the Timor Sea for Australia had fallen to zero. In the following year there were three. In 2004-05 there were zero. So I do not think—
—Go on, complete the picture.
—I will, Senator Evans, but let me just interpolate to say that I do not think you need to have more than about a year 1 education in arithmetic to work out that when the number of arrivals falls from a peak of 75 to zero two years later that is a very sharp, indeed an absolute, decline. That did not happen for no reason; it happened because of the policies implemented by the Howard government—the tough policies implemented by the Howard government, and announced in the middle of 2001, which in August last year Senator Evans, the minister sitting at the table, abandoned. It remained the case that there were no—or single-digit numbers of—unauthorised boat arrivals right up until August last year when the Rudd Labor government, through its minister Senator Evans, announced the abandonment of the tough policies by which the Howard government had succeeded in the space of three years in taking the number of unauthorised boat arrivals from 75 a year to zero.
Is there anybody in the entire country who is so foolish that they would think that there was not a cause and effect relationship between the introduction of tough policies and the fall to zero of the number of unauthorised boat arrivals two years later? Equally, is there anybody so foolish that they would doubt that there is equally a cause and effect relationship between the announcement by Senator Evans of the withdrawal of those tough policies in August 2008 and the sharp upward spike in the number of unauthorised boat arrivals?
We have now gone from a situation where in the first year of the Rudd government, when the Howard government’s policies were still in place, there were only three unauthorised boat arrivals to a situation where, in the 15 months since the abandonment of those tough policies, there have been 45 unauthorised boat arrivals—and the trend is escalating. The number of unauthorised arrivals is increasing at an increasing rate. Those are the statistics from the Parliamentary Library’s tabulation—it went from 75 a year to zero in consequence of the adoption of tough policies by the Howard government and from three to 45 in the space of two years as a direct result of the abandonment of those tough policies by the Rudd Labor government.
This is what the opposition always says about this issue. It is not enough to have tough words—the Prime Minister is a past master at using belligerent language; you have to have the policy courage to match the tough rhetoric with tough policies. If you do not have tough policies, the people smugglers will see right through you—as they have seen right through the Rudd Labor government. They will be back in business—as they are back in business today—and they will ply their evil trade so as to imperil the lives of innocent people buying passage on their boats. That is the result of your policy failure and weakness. (Time expired)

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2009-10-28,"—I am delighted indeed to speak on this subject on such an auspicious day. Today is an auspicious day because in the Catholic calendar of saints today is St Godwin’s day, a day which I know is of great spiritual significance to senators opposite. I know that those opposite have long been devotees of the cult of St Godwin because a few months ago they gave evidence of their faith by displaying in this Senate a holy relic of the saint, a miraculous email of Saint Godwin, which had apparently come to Senator Abetz in a vision. So, in keeping with this auspicious day, I thought I would start my contribution today with a text from Holy Scripture. In the Book of Proverbs, at Proverbs 26:11 in fact, we read:

As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that repeateth his folly.
I am sure those opposite will see at once the relevance of this text to today’s debate. Today in this matter of public importance motion we are seeing the opposition repeating the folly of its MPI on Monday. Like the dog that returns to its vomit, the opposition comes back to the folly of this divisive, inflammatory debate about asylum seekers. Of all the issues which face this great nation today, the only issue which those opposite think is urgent is the appearance of a few dozen Sri Lankans in boats in the seas to our north-west—in fact technically one might say a few dozen Sri Lankans appearing in the Indonesian zone for rescue and safety. At a time when Australia is facing the challenge of the greatest global economic crisis since the 1930s, when we are embarking upon the greatest modernisation program for Australian schools in our history and when the world is facing the challenge of dangerous climate change, what do those opposite want to debate? Of course they want to debate asylum seekers.
Senator Brandis a few moments ago had the gall, dare I say it, the ‘courage’, to try to lecture this government about policy courage. How Senator Brandis could do that when opposition senators have yet to come to terms with any of the great debates which are taking place in this parliament is a matter of wonderment. I do not know who coalition senators think they are fooling with this barrage of motions and speeches on asylum seekers. Everyone knows what is going on here. This is an opposition that do not and cannot debate the economy. This an opposition that cannot and will not debate action on climate change. They do not want to have a debate about schools or workplace relations. All of those are subjects that those opposite cannot debate because they are divided and because they do not have a policy—because they are spending their energy fighting with one another on those matters rather than bringing a position to this parliament. On all of these subjects they have no policies, no leadership and no credibility. So this debate is the last resort of a scoundrel.
The debate on asylum seekers is a debate they want to have but, consistently, the opposition continue to not have a policy on this matter either. They have rhetoric; they do not have a policy. Tony Abbott demonstrated this graphically during his appearance on ABC television just last night. When Tony Jones repeatedly asked him what his policy was concerning the recent Sri Lankan boat arrivals, his only response was, ‘Well, I’m not the government, Tony.’ Strangely enough, that is also what the shadow minister for immigration, Sharman Stone, says every time she is asked what the opposition policy is. So you can bemoan the fact that John Howard is no longer your Prime Minister and you can weep for the fact that his harsh policies on boat people are no longer in place, but consider this: you are not advocating their return either.
The reason the opposition want to talk about asylum seekers is desperation politics—desperation politics from a desperate, divided and demoralised opposition which have now reached the very bottom of the political trough, right down there with One Nation and a whole other band of brothers, trying to appeal to the lowest political instincts of xenophobia and racism, which they hope are still lurking in sections of the electorate. They are trying to pull, from opposition, the trick that they so fondly remember from 2001. But in 2001 they were in office, and in 2001 they were led by John Howard. The trick will not be able to be repeated when they have no credibility on any of the other great issues facing this country and a leader who could not sell ice to Eskimos.
The core proposition underpinning the opposition argument on this matter is that since the Rudd government introduced a more humane and widely accepted regime it has attracted refugees to our shores. That is their core proposition. But they know it to be a falsehood, because those pull factors are as if nothing when one considers the push factors that are taking place across the world at the moment. Literally millions of people are on the move. Conflicts throughout Africa, Central Asia and, most recently, Sri Lanka have driven literally hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes to become internally or internationally displaced persons. A tiny fraction of these folk make their way to Australia’s shores, and upon them the opposition pin their hopes for election.
Before the current beat-up about Sri Lankan boat arrivals, the government’s support was running at 59 per cent of the two-party vote, and now the opposition’s strategists must ponder the fact that it is still running at 59 per cent. They have to ponder the fact that their argument does not have the facts to underpin it. For 25 of the last 33 years there have been unauthorised boat arrivals in this country. The fact is that those years Senator Brandis tried to paint as representing years of success for Howard’s policies were in fact nothing more than the logical ramifications of the fall of the Taliban in the final months of 2001 in Afghanistan. The opposition, in this area as in so many others, have ignored the facts and the evidence and are relying on a farrago of rhetoric.
The central thesis of the opposition’s case on asylum seekers is, as I said, that the changes in policy which the Rudd government carried out in 2008—principally the abolition of TPVs and the dumping grounds of the Pacific solution—have led to the current increase in unauthorised boat arrivals. But we know—we can prove—that this does not stand up to scrutiny or examination. The simplest way to demonstrate that is to look at the number of arrivals. In 2005 there were 11 people who arrived in this way; in 2006 there were 60; in 2007 there were 148; and in 2008 there were 161. So we can see quite clearly that the abolition of TPVs and the closing of the Nauru and Manus facilities had nothing whatever to do with the trend of arrivals. This trend began in 2005, when those opposite were in government, and it has continued ever since. And, of course, it has continued ever since, irrespective of regulation in this country, because of the crises happening around the world.
The second way to demonstrate the falsity of the opposition thesis is to compare Australia’s experience with that of other countries. I gave senators opposite this information on Monday but, since they were obviously not listening carefully, I will do them the justice of repeating it. In 2008 there were 36,000 unauthorised maritime arrivals to Italy, 15,300 to Greece and 13,400 to Spain. All of these figures have risen sharply over the past few years, and the reasons for this are well documented. In 2008 there was an 85 per cent increase in the number of Afghani asylum seekers worldwide and a 24 per cent increase in the number of Sri Lankan asylum seekers.
The third refutation of the opposition’s thesis on asylum seekers is the preferred destination of these people—because those opposite work very hard to try and convince Australians that our borders are in crisis, that they are permeable and that we risk an influx of hordes of strangers. But of course nothing could be further from the truth. Our borders and our border-management policies are not only intact, they are working. The recent hubbub has been built up over a vessel which was in distress—a vessel which was in distress in international waters; a vessel which was in distress in international waters but in the zone for which Indonesia is responsible for safety and rescue.
The Indonesians, being our close allies and our partners in managing our borders in our region, contacted us and said, ‘Notwithstanding the fact that this vessel is in our area, and notwithstanding the fact that it is our responsibility to conduct rescue operations in these waters, could you please do it on this occasion as your assets are closer?’ On that basis, Australia responded. We did not simply respond because we are a good ally of Indonesia; we responded because it is the decent thing to do when vessels on the high seas are in distress. On the back of that story, and on the back of those facts, those opposite now like to preach to us about an Indonesian solution. Those opposite like to talk about how we are dumping people in Indonesia. They like to talk about the fact that our borders and our vessels are challenged as they have never been challenged before. That is a nonsense, and a careful study of the facts reveals it to be so.
If asylum seekers really thought Australia was a ‘soft touch’ in terms of granting asylum, as the opposition allege, we would be seeing a significant proportion of these asylum seekers trying to come to Australia who otherwise seem to be searching the Mediterranean and elsewhere. But that is not what we are seeing. We are not seeing a changing composition in the persons seeking asylum in this country. Among industrialised countries, in 2008, 96 per cent of Afghan, 97 per cent of Iraqi and 82 per cent of Sri Lankan asylum seekers sought asylum in Europe. Australia is much closer to Sri Lanka than Europe is, yet 82 per cent of the Sri Lankan asylum seekers were trying to get to Europe rather than Australia.
Those opposite would have you believe that in these war-torn villages, in these desperate communities, in these places that have been ravaged by war, by famine and by conflict, people gather and do a quick regulatory impact study based on what law changes have occurred here in Australia and perhaps other jurisdictions too. The opposition would have you believe that these people sit around the beaches of Sri Lanka and the war-torn hills of Afghanistan and carefully look through the policies of this government and our border protection regime. Mercifully, they are not reading your press releases. The truth is, of course, that these are desperate people who will take what escape they can. The proposition that they are motivated to come to Australia on leaky boats because word has reached the distant hills of the Pashtun tribes that Senator Evans has changed the laws here in Australia is a fantasy, a nonsense—and a nonsense that will not survive serious debate or serious discussion.
So much for the opposition’s thesis. To be fair to them, putting together a rational argument based on facts was never their challenge. They have not tried it and they are not starting today. This is a desperate political stratagem borne of desperation. Somewhere deep in the bowels of the Liberal Party is a panicked strategy group, a panicked leader surrounded by panicked staffers who has pulled the last lever in the conservative toolbox—a xenophobic debate in Australia about immigration. This is not, and it has unfortunately never been, an argument about facts, because those opposite do not care about the facts. They do not care about the fate of asylum seekers and they certainly do not care about Australia’s national interest.
All they care about is saving their own skins from the political tsunami that they have worked so hard—and, God bless them, with St Godwin’s help—to bring to their own destruction. That is what this is all about: an opposition’s vain hope that by appealing to a Hansonite instinct they will get the same response they believe they got in 2001. But, as I said, this is not 2001 and you ain’t got anybody like John Howard. This is a tactic of the desperate and the doomed but, worse than that, it is a tactic of the discredited and the dishonoured. It is the tactic of a parliamentary party that can no longer come to this place with an argument. There are worse things than losing elections. One is losing respect, and that is what this opposition have well and truly embarked upon.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Border Security</title>,Matters of Public Importance,21,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-10-28,"—I rise to briefly participate in this debate, one that I think Australians right around the country would be disappointed that we are actually engaging in. No longer do we want to participate in a debate in Australia about demonising vulnerable people rather than focusing on the responsibilities of our government, our national and international responsibilities and laws. I believe that the Australian public have moved past the dark days of the Tampa and understand that we do have a responsibility to help people when they are in need. We know that the number of people seeking refuge around the world varies at different times, and it is quite clear that one of those times is now.
I am extremely disappointed to hear that the Prime Minister has not been able to come to a workable solution with Indonesia to ensure that the people onboard the Oceanic Viking will be guaranteed to have their claims processed fairly and safely. This ‘Indonesian solution’, as named not just by the coalition but also by the government, is really no different to the Pacific solution. It may be in a different place and we may have a different Prime Minister, but without some decent guarantees and some ground rules about how people in these situations will be treated—how quickly their applications will be processed, a guarantee that children will not be detained and a commitment to help resettle people who are found to be genuine refugees around the region, including Australia—this solution is no different to the Pacific solution.
That is one point that I would say I probably do agree with the coalition on, despite the fact that I am not quite sure exactly where all their arguments have been of late. I feel that they are in essence a little lost at sea. But, in saying that, the Prime Minister did not take the decisions that he should have last week. The Prime Minister would like us to believe that control of the situation is completely out of his hands. We know that this is an Australian ship. The Prime Minister could call this ship home to Australia any time he wanted. We called for this a week ago, and 10 days later there are still children, women, men and families on board the Oceanic Viking, circling the ocean, waiting for a safe place to land. The Prime Minister has lost control of his promise of a humane approach—that is certain as this ship endlessly circles around the ocean in the vain hope of a place to land. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-10-28,"—We heard from Senator Feeney, and he reminded me of Corinthians: ‘If I speak with the tongues of angels but do not have love, I am nothing.’ But in this case he does not even have an idea of scripture. It is very interesting—and this would have to be the clanger of all time—that his so-called feast day of St Godwin is today—today being, if I am correct, the 28th or the 27th.
—The 28th.
—Anyway, today is the feast day of St Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of hopeless causes. That is so typical of exactly where the Labor Party’s policy is. The saint of today, St Jude, is the patron saint of hopeless causes. That is exactly where they are. How completely apt is his discussion about a patron saint. How completely lacking in detail is the Labor Party, as usual. They are completely bereft of any research. There are just wonderful statements about the cabal of the illuminati but without a skerrick of detail sitting underneath what they talk to you about. This is just so beautiful! What a great day to be in this chamber when they make such a clanger like that. It is a ripper.
This is a very serious issue, and not for one moment would I cast aspersions on the character of the people who are endeavouring to come out. They are coming out not because of a push issue but because of a massive pull issue. Have a look around you. We are so lucky and blessed to live in a country like this. It is logical for people to want to enhance their economic position in life, but Australia does not have an unlimited capacity. It cannot simply lose control of its borders. If it does, it will just get completely out of control. At the moment we have a blue and yellow fiasco called the Oceanic Viking. We had something similar to that in our time, called the Cormo Express, but fortunately with the Cormo Express we were only dealing with sheep. This time the Labor Party have taken it up a level—they are dealing with people. And it is an icebreaker, so help me, that these people are on and that is wandering around in equatorial Indonesia. Where are they going to take them next: Macquarie Island? Davis? This is because you have lost control of our nation’s borders. Through your complete lack of decisiveness in dealing with this issue, we have now got ourselves into a position where the communication channel is open and the phone calls are being made back. It is quite evident that there is knowledge afoot that Australia has become an easier target.
Senator Feeney just had to listen to the Sri Lankans who managed to get themselves onto AM in the morning. We can also read their statements in the paper as to how they see Australia. They believe the policy has changed, and they are right. They have perfect market knowledge. They know the policy has changed. They know the Labor Party, as of August last year, watered the policy down. We are now dealing with the issues. I have been to Christmas Island a couple of times and I would not cast aspersions against the people, but there is a driving force. It is the driving force that is always there—the desire to migrate to a better place. But it just cannot happen like this. It just cannot happen that people jump on a boat and make their own arrangements. There must be controls over our borders, and we have lost those controls under the Labor government.
The fact of their arrival by ship carries associated issues such as the possibility of rabies coming in. There is most definitely, especially amongst crew members, tuberculosis on board. If we lose control of it, that will work its way into Indigenous communities and have huge health ramifications, especially in Northern Australia. There are also the issues of foot and mouth and screwfly. These all go hand in glove with a loss of control over our borders. This is what the Labor Party has delivered to us—and this is on St Jude’s day; St Jude, the patron saint of hopeless causes: hopeless policy, a complete lack of decisiveness, acumen and research, and a desire to gloss over the reality of the situation with garbage.
I acknowledge that Senator Feeney says there are not many Sri Lankans coming here and that they are mainly going to Europe. There is also the truth that the vast majority of people illegally in Australia are backpackers, predominantly from England. The problem with that argument is that, while those people are also illegal, they have gone through some form of customs protection. What we have here is a complete disregard for a border protection policy. We are opening ourselves up to a whole range of problems, including inciting these people to take huge risks in their lives and inciting them to put themselves in the hands of people who will definitely exploit them. It is a fact that under the former government’s policies, arrivals went to zero. As Senator Brandis has said, actions speak louder than words.
—It’s not true, though.
—That is the case. In 2004 and 2005 there were no arrivals. They say, ‘There were no push factors.’ What section of the world are you looking at? There are continual push factors. If you were making an argument on push factors then you could make them on the situation in sub Saharan Africa, on civil war in Angola or genocide in southern Sudan. There are also a whole range of people on the Thai-Burma border. These people constantly want to get themselves into a position of safety or into a position where there is economic improvement in their lives. It is not fair to the Karen who have been pushed out by the Burmese that we just say, ‘Oh, well, it’s a shame you couldn’t get yourself to Indonesia and get yourself onto a boat because then you could have come in 90 days and with no questions asked.’
The Labor Party has created this problem and Mr Rudd is looking completely unauthentic. He is looking indecisive and, to be honest, hypocritical. He is trying to ride both sides of the fence on this issue and it just does not ring true. Before the election, Mr Rudd delivered rhetoric to the Australian people that showed that he thought he could run a compassionate argument—but run it with a wink and a nod. He hoped that everything would stay under control. Now he has found that he appears neither compassionate in his delivery to the Australian people nor decisive in trying to actually fix the problem. His policy has become a sort of quagmire policy—one of hope in which he is pleading that the neighbours, that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, will fix this problem. It is not the President of Indonesia’s problem; it is Australia’s problem, and Australia has to fix it.
No wonder the Indonesians are getting frustrated. They are saying: ‘It is your issue. They are jumping over your fence. You are the ones complaining about it. Fix your own problems. Don’t come over to Indonesia and say we have to fix your problems.’ So it is looking like a complete mess. It is an absolute mess and it is going to make its way onto the international stage even more than it already is. We will have this big yellow and blue fiasco that will continue on until such time as this government manage to grasp the nettle, become decisive, make changes and prove to the Australian people that they can protect our nation’s borders.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Border Security</title>,Matters of Public Importance,21,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-10-28,"—Senator Brandis, in opening his contribution to this discussion on border security, asked the rhetorical question, ‘What is a policy failure?’ and proceeded to try and answer his own question as part of the debate. The correct answer, in part, is to rely on a maxim that would be familiar to the many lawyers in this place, particularly the many lawyers on the opposition benches—that is, if you want to go to a court of equity for redress, for comfort, come with clean hands or, as was said in another famous document, those who live in glasshouses should not throw stones. So in this discussion why don’t we start properly at the beginning, avoiding rhetorical questions, and ask: who has clean hands in this debate and who has hands that are soiled, dirty and unbecoming? To answer that question, why don’t we review what has occurred in the area of illegal immigrants or asylum seekers over the last six, seven or eight years in this country. Let us examine the actual record of the previous Howard government and let us compare and contrast that record, based in fact, with the current practices of the Rudd Labor government. Let us review the practices of the previous government.
It is fair to comment at the outset that their solution to the then problem of asylum seekers was a barbaric solution. It resulted in deaths at sea, wholesale lying to the Australian public, excision of offshore islands of this nation, remote processing facilities and, what is worse, the locking up of children and women, often for periods of one or more years, simply on the basis that these people did not have the immediate capacity to defend their interests. What was the result of that practice, implemented wilfully, deliberately and over a long period of time by the Howard government? When the dust had settled, what did we find as those then asylum seekers and refugees sought recourse to the tribunals in this country? We found that over 94 per cent of those persons were admitted lawfully to this country, issued with visas, permitted to settle and get about their lawful and proper domestic business. The policy that was created, implemented and which the previous government stood by for a long period of time resulted in total failure in practice and the opposite of what it sought to achieve—that is, the total, lawful admission to this country of an overwhelming majority of those persons who were then described as asylum seekers. The position of the then Howard government in practice and over time was one of total failure.
What have they learnt from that experience going back four and five years? What have they been able to put into practice? What wisdom have they been able to bring and what capacity have they added to this debate, as this country faces difficult choices about people who are lost at sea? After almost two years in opposition, their position is simply a search for a policy on immigration. The coalition know they cannot go back to the Howard era policies and the two contributions to date have expressly refused to address the issue of a sound policy on illegal immigrants into this country. When Labor abolished the failed and wasteful Pacific solution, who opposed it? Not the opposition. When Labor abolished the failed and inhumane temporary protection visa regime, who moved to disallow the regulations and give effect to their beliefs? Not the opposition. The opposition, subsequent to both of those moves by the current Labor government, have made no commitment at all to reintroducing either of those demonstrably failed policies. In addition to not giving a commitment to previous policies, they have outlined no policy that the Australian people can give consideration to.
In contrast, Labor has maintained excision, mandatory detention and offshore processing of irregular maritime arrivals on Christmas Island. Even in some of the more divisive elements of the previous government’s policy, which the Labor government committed to prior to the last election and has maintained since, the opposition coalition cannot differentiate themselves then or now in policy. They cannot participate in a public debate like this because they do not have a policy. We know they do not have a policy because the two representatives of the coalition who chose to participate in this debate in the last half an hour, Senator Brandis and Senator Joyce, could not outline one phrase or one clause which might be characterised as a policy on illegal immigrants and which they might be able to put in this debate or take to the Australian people in due course. There is no policy; simply a vacuum.
Why is that? Because for the last six months all they have done is concentrate on themselves and their own wasted failures. They are so hopelessly divided, confused, devoid of purpose and have no capacity to get themselves out of the policy development mire they have put themselves in, particularly in the last six weeks. In that context it is unfair to say that some members of the coalition have not addressed themselves to this issue. Indeed, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration unanimously endorsed the Rudd government’s new directions in detention policy. That was best described by members of that committee as ‘a continuation of the reforms begun under the Howard government in 2005’. Yet when the legislation giving effect to those reforms was introduced into the parliament the coalition opposed it. Coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration endorsed its call for the abolition of detention debt, yet when the legislation was introduced into the parliament we had a huge, continuing and histrionic debate about the utility of abolishing debts accumulated by people who had been locked up in detention centres for many years. What did the coalition do then? They opposed the bill that was introduced by the Rudd Labor government.
While on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, the shadow minister expressed concern about people without work rights and access to Medicare. The government listened to the recommendations of that committee, in a unanimous sense, and moved to address those issues. It wanted to reform work rights for asylum seekers, but what was the coalition’s response? They moved to disallow the regulations. Principled coalition members and senators, to their credit, spoke in favour of the government’s changes on each occasion. In their search for a policy—because they have no policy, because their two principal spokesmen in this chamber today could not put words towards a policy, because they have not worked it out in either party room or brought it together in their joint party room—I suggest that the coalition follow the worthwhile advice of Senator Troeth when she spoke recently on an immigration issue. She said:
Let us grasp a new opportunity to understand the difference between sending the wrong message to those who truly wish us harm and sending the right message to those who need our help. Australia does not have to choose between strong, secure borders and compassion for those seeking liberty and freedom. We can have both.
Of course we can have both. As if it is beyond the wisdom of humankind to work out a solution to this problem. The words of Senator Troeth, both in terms of emotion and in terms of sound policy advice, are worth following.
We heard some discussion earlier, by both Senator Feeney and Senator Joyce, about the international factors that drive the increase in illegal immigration or asylum seekers from time to time. As some of the other speakers today have said, we know that the number of those who are displaced, seeking a permanent home or seeking comfort have now risen to many millions. Somewhere in excess of 40 million people are displaced around the world, living in camps and border camps and seeking comfort in another country so they can go about their lives.
In recent years, global factors have been a significant contributory factor to the number of asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and refugees who come down into this part of the world. As was also identified by previous speakers, the principal cause of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants coming down here in the last five to seven years is the displacement of people arising out of the consequences of wars in their homelands. When the Iraq war was at its peak, large numbers of people were leaving Iraq, going to their borders, getting caught up in the system and heading south seeking a home, trying to seek safety and the like.
Similarly now, as the war in Afghanistan has intensified, as a civil war particularly in the southern areas and the areas bordering Pakistan has become more and more violent and as more and more destruction has occurred, more and more people are either displaced or are seeking to remove themselves from the war zone. Large numbers of people have been heading south, by land and by sea, and they have been arriving in the waters around this country and around Indonesia, Malaysia and the like. Similarly, as the civil war that has been a feature of Sri Lanka for the last 20 years has resolved itself and one side has been able to claim unconditional victory in that war, those who are on the losing side have sought to flee their country. Again, the large numbers of people seeking support, comfort or a homeland away from Sri Lanka arise out of the failure of that country to regulate itself and out of the consequences of a civil war. We have seen tens of thousands of people displaced—arguably hundreds of thousands or millions—and seeking comfort all around Europe, through South Asia and up into the Middle East. One does not have to be any type of clairvoyant to know that if the war in Pakistan continues, with the government of Pakistan fighting the Taliban forces in particular areas and seeking to eliminate them, large numbers of Pakistani citizens will cross the border and flee, and some of them—perhaps a small number—will find their way down here.
It is totally unreasonable to suggest that because of the changed policies of the current government—which, as I identified, are a logical continuum of the policies of the previous government, with some changes on the margins—there is now a pull factor, a demand factor, whereby tens of thousands of people are immediately saying, ‘Let’s race down to Australia. Let’s get into that country, because the welcome mat is out.’ What a load of rubbish. All we heard from Senator Brandis, but more particularly from Senator Joyce, was the repeated assertion of that proposition. It was not supported by one argument, by one set of facts, or by one set of numbers. It was simply an assertion that changes of policy on the margins, on the periphery, have resulted in this dramatic influx of people into the waters immediately surrounding our country and Indonesia, going up as far as Singapore and Malaysia. Of course that is a nonsense. If you do look at the numbers of people who are displaced from civil wars in their own countries, you can see the clear reason as to why so many people are now, over the last few weeks, seeking comfort in this country.
In that context, what are the Rudd government border security initiatives? We have all seen the news on the TV: ‘tough but humane.’ But what does this mean? It means a tough approach towards those who seek to improperly profit and manipulate those who are without support or comfort, and it means a humane and fair means of access for those who seek comfort. In that context, what has the Rudd government done? It has maintained excision, mandatory detention and offshore processing of irregular maritime arrivals on Christmas Island. It has established a dedicated Border Protection Committee of Cabinet to drive whole-of-government strategy to combat people smuggling. (Time expired)

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2009-10-28,"—The Labor Party is the master of obfuscation. Before I address some of the issues Senator Bishop raised, I would like to address some of the issues raised by Senator Feeney in his address earlier. It was alleged that we did not want to debate the economy. If Senator Feeney wants to debate the economy, he, along with the whole government, will find the opposition front and centre talking about what debt burden this government will leave Australia and future generations with. We will talk about schools and education and how the other side of this chamber refuses to let parents know about the standards and achievements of their children. They are captured by the public sector unions. But, apparently, this is one issue we are not allowed to discuss.
Senator Feeney made some allegations about the Liberal Party, which I will not repeat but I will address. It takes a lot of gumption for the Labor Party to come in here and try to allege that the Liberal Party is running a fear campaign and dallying with One Nation, because it was not the Victorian Liberal Party at the last federal election that got One Nation Senate preferences; it was the Labor Party. It was not people on this side of the chamber who benefited from those. For the party of White Australia, for the party of Arthur Calwell, who made appalling comments when he was the then Labor leader, for the party of Gough Whitlam, who made comments—and I will dignify this chamber by not repeating them—about Vietnamese asylum seekers coming to Australia, to accuse the Liberal Party of such appalling manoeuvres requires an unprecedented amount of gumption.
The Liberal Party and the coalition have credibility on this matter. We have a track record of managing Australian borders. This government refuses to understand two things in particular. Firstly, it refuses to concede that pull factors and its policies make a difference, and that they go directly to the proposition that people smugglers—the vermin that both sides of this chamber agree about—through these areas sell the prospect of passage to Australia. I am not contending necessarily that everyone is jumping on a mobile phone and reading about the latest press release from Senator Evans; however, we do know that people smugglers are selling a product, we know that they take notice and we know that they solicit business. So to deny that pull factors—the policies of this government, the signals it has sent on weakening Australia’s border protection—have an impact on what people smugglers around these countries say is a farce. The government knows it, we know it and the Australian people know it.
The measure of success of a government policy is in its direct impact. Senator Brandis mentioned a few of the numbers, but they are worth covering again. In 2000-01, there were 54 boat arrivals, with 4,134 people. In 2001-02—including the period where the previous government brought in policies to send the right signal to these people, particularly to the people smugglers—arrivals fell to 19 vessels and 3,039 people. But, in 2002-03, it fell to zero on both counts—zero vessels, zero people. In 2003-04, there were three vessels and 84 people. Those numbers remained relatively stable up to 2007-08, when there were three vessels and 25 people. In 2008-09 the increase started: 22 vessels and 1,039 people. No-one here denies the impact of push factors. No-one here denies that the global environment has an impact. What we are saying, however, is that the policies of this government have a direct impact on propositions the people smugglers sell to people who seek passage to a country like Australia. In 2009-10, so far, we have had over 20 vessels. That is directly following this government’s changes on border protection policies that have allowed those people smugglers to sell such a message.
The obfuscation this government undertakes is extreme. It says that we have more people illegally in Australia who have arrived by plane—and that is all true; and that we have more people who arrive by plane and seek asylum—and that is true. But the difference is that those people have legally entered Australia. At airports all around the world, people coming to Australia are checked as to whether they have a valid visa. No-one is denying the right of people to apply for asylum. We are saying that policies that encourage people to take this risky trip, that give the vermin of people smugglers a better proposition to sell, are the wrong way to address this particular global problem. We are not comparing apples with apples. That is an immigration issue. It is not an issue of illegal—sorry, I correct myself: ‘unlawful entry’. I do not necessarily want to use the words of the Prime Minister.
The Labor government walks both sides of the street on this issue. Our Prime Minister goes to extraordinary lengths not to answer this question and not to answer questions about this in a way that will see him on television. The Prime Minister has gone to immense trouble to not answer questions in parliament. He does not want footage of himself in parliament answering a question on this, because he does not want to be talking about it in public. I will quote him at length, and this is a particularly long sentence; I have not managed to count the number of commas in it. For a person who is quite successful at delivering the eight-second grab, it is amazing how this Prime Minister will avoid delivering an eight-second grab on this particular issue. He does not want people watching television news to know that he is trying to walk both sides of the street on this. He talks to The 7.30 Report; he does not talk to A Current Affair. He says one thing to the Age; he does everything he can do to avoid it being in the Herald Sun. This is what the Prime Minister said in response to a question on this issue:
But you know, if you’re being serious about this, we are dealing with challenges in source countries, dealing with challenges in transit countries, dealing with challenges of course in interdicting vessels at sea, and dealing of course with the processes of mandatory detention of proper processing to ensure that you’re dealing with the physical and security questions which are part and parcel of the proper processes of Government.
Is that not diplo-babble or bureauspeak? It is an example of this government trying to avoid scrutiny, an example of the Prime Minister walking both sides of the street and an example of this government’s hypocrisy.
This government has sent the wrong signal. It has allowed people smugglers to walk around these countries and advocate that passage to Australia has become easier. That is an appalling risk for these people. I join Senator Joyce in saying that I am not attempting to besmirch people seeking asylum. However, I say to people who are truly concerned about the vulnerable: the people who can afford passage are not always the most vulnerable people in these countries. It is outrageous to assert that we should be prioritising those who have the means, the contacts and the networks to come across the Indian Ocean when resources and places will inevitably be taken by those people. We do not know about the others who are left. We do not know about those who may be in greater need of protection.
I will conclude on this: this country has a record, of which I am personally proud, of a large immigration program and a particularly large humanitarian program. But public faith in that program is dependent upon the government having control over our borders. This government is weakening border security. This government is giving the people smugglers a better product to sell. This government is not justifying its own policies; it is just trying to obfuscate by making comparisons to Europe and talking about the opposition. This government is going to undermine this very pact which both sides of politics in this country should be proud of.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2009-10-28,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the following reports of the committee: Review of the listing of Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organisation and Annual report of committee activities 2009-09.
Ordered that the reports be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the reports and to incorporate the tabling statements into Hansard.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the reports.
The statements read as follows—
Mr President, on behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I have pleasure in presenting the Committee’s report entitled Review of the Listing of Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organisation.
The Committee heard evidence that Al-Shabaab engages in, and offers support for terrorist acts.
There has been a number of media reports in relation to this listing and recent criminal charges relating to preparation for a terrorist attack on the Australian Army base at Holsworthy in New South Wales and aiding and abetting the commission of an offence against section 6(1) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 by another person to undertake armed hostilities in Somalia.
The Committee raised concerns with the Attorney-General’s Department that this listing might be seen to interfere with or be prejudicial to the court proceedings in relation to the above charges.
The Attorney-General’s Department pointed out that none of the charges related to membership of a terrorist organisation and that this listing would not affect the proceedings or make it easier for the Commonwealth to prove its case against the accused.
Mr President, I will now turn my comments to Al-Shabaab and will take this opportunity to provide some information on the group’s current engagement in terrorist activity.
Al-Shabaab, or ‘the youth’, is the name applied to the Somali militant group which was formerly the most prominent of the militia groups comprising the militant wing of the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC). Al-Shabaab encompasses a range of elements, ranging from those focused solely on the domestic insurgency in Somalia to elements that support al-Qa’ida’s global ideology of violent extremism. Elements of al-Shabaab are linked to al-Qa’ida through leadership contacts and training, both recent and historical, and by al-Qa’ida senior leadership endorsement of its activities.
Al-Shabaab has prepared, planned and carried out frequent attacks as part of its violent insurgency since the beginning of 2007. Its tactics have included mortar attacks, and use of rocket-propelled grenades and firearms. During 2007, elements of al-Shabaab appear to have drawn inspiration from violent extremists in Afghanistan and Iraq, and adopted their tactics of Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs), roadside bombs and suicide attacks. Suicide-vehicle bombings in Hargeysa and Boosaaso, northern Somalia, in October 2008 have been widely attributed to al-Shabaab.
In view of the information presented to it the Committee will not recommend to Parliament that the regulation be disallowed.
Mr President I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Committee members for their work in reviewing this and other terrorist organisations. Lastly I would like to thank the Secretariat.
Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.

28 October 2009
Mr President, on behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I have pleasure in presenting the Committee’s report entitled Annual Report of Committee Activities 2008-2009.
Mr President, the Committee completed another full and productive year scrutinising the administration and expenditure of the intelligence agencies and completing reviews of the proscription of ‘terrorist organisations’ under Subsection 102.1A(2) of the Criminal Code. Since the last annual report on the Committee’s activities, tabled in October 2008, the Committee has tabled four reports. In addition to the tabled reports, the Committee is currently conducting the seventh review of administration and expenditure.
Four reports on the listing of organisations as terrorist organisations were tabled in the period under review. The four reports dealt with thirteen organisations, all re-listings, although some organisations were listed under different names.
The reports were:
Review of the re-listing of Al-Qa'ida, Jemaah Islamiyah and Al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code Act 1995
Review of the re-listing of Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), Jamiat ul-Ansar (JuA) and Al-Qa'ida in Iraq (AQI) as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code Act 1995.
Review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Islam, AAA, IAA, IMU, JeM and LeJ as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code Act 1995
Review of the re-listing of Hizballah’s ESO as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code Act 1995
Mr President, I previously mentioned the Committee’s work in reviewing the administration and expenditure of intelligence agencies. In relation to the Committee’s review of administration and expenditure No. 6 draft copies of the report had been sent to all agencies by 10 March 2009 and by 22 June 2009 some Ministers had not replied with a final vetting letter. Some letters were only received by the Committee in the sitting week 15-18 June.
The Committee accepts that, due to negotiations between it and agencies, there may be some time before a final vetting letter can be arrived at. However the time frames that have been involved are, the Committee believes, unacceptable and point to an administrative failure by Departments in relation to the vetting of its reports.
It is clearly desirable that these Administration and Expenditure reports are tabled in a timely manner. The Committee believes that, in most cases, a response on vetting should be forthcoming within one month of its presentation to the relevant Ministers. Past experience indicates that any issues of concern tend to be straightforward and uncomplicated.
Reporting on these matters to the Parliament is important. The Committee therefore recommends that procedures be put in place to allow for the Committee’s Administration and Expenditure reports to be vetted within one month of their presentation to the relevant Minister.
The Committee’s sixth Review of the Administration and Expenditure of the Australian Intelligence Community was tabled on 7 September 2009 and, as such, was not commented on beyond the vetting issue I have mentioned in the current Annual Report.
Since 2002, the Committee has sent representatives to the biennial conference of oversight agencies. In 2002 the conference was held in London, in 2004, in Washington and, in 2006, in South Africa. In 2008, the conference was hosted by the intelligence agencies of New Zealand in Auckland between Sunday, 5 October 2008 and Wednesday, 8 October 2008.
In 2008, the following countries sent delegates:
Australia:
Belgium:
Canada:
New Zealand:
Poland:
Republic of South Africa:
United Kingdom:
United States of America:
This conference is invaluable in allowing members of intelligence oversight bodies from different countries to meet and exchange views. I note for the House that the 2010 conference will be held in March in Sydney and will be jointly hosted by the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Committee.
In conclusion, and on behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the work of the Committee during the past year.
Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2009-10-28,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the following reports of the committee: Review of the listing of Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organisation and Annual report of committee activities 2009-09.
Ordered that the reports be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the reports and to incorporate the tabling statements into Hansard.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the reports.
The statements read as follows—
Mr President, on behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I have pleasure in presenting the Committee’s report entitled Review of the Listing of Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organisation.
The Committee heard evidence that Al-Shabaab engages in, and offers support for terrorist acts.
There has been a number of media reports in relation to this listing and recent criminal charges relating to preparation for a terrorist attack on the Australian Army base at Holsworthy in New South Wales and aiding and abetting the commission of an offence against section 6(1) of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 by another person to undertake armed hostilities in Somalia.
The Committee raised concerns with the Attorney-General’s Department that this listing might be seen to interfere with or be prejudicial to the court proceedings in relation to the above charges.
The Attorney-General’s Department pointed out that none of the charges related to membership of a terrorist organisation and that this listing would not affect the proceedings or make it easier for the Commonwealth to prove its case against the accused.
Mr President, I will now turn my comments to Al-Shabaab and will take this opportunity to provide some information on the group’s current engagement in terrorist activity.
Al-Shabaab, or ‘the youth’, is the name applied to the Somali militant group which was formerly the most prominent of the militia groups comprising the militant wing of the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC). Al-Shabaab encompasses a range of elements, ranging from those focused solely on the domestic insurgency in Somalia to elements that support al-Qa’ida’s global ideology of violent extremism. Elements of al-Shabaab are linked to al-Qa’ida through leadership contacts and training, both recent and historical, and by al-Qa’ida senior leadership endorsement of its activities.
Al-Shabaab has prepared, planned and carried out frequent attacks as part of its violent insurgency since the beginning of 2007. Its tactics have included mortar attacks, and use of rocket-propelled grenades and firearms. During 2007, elements of al-Shabaab appear to have drawn inspiration from violent extremists in Afghanistan and Iraq, and adopted their tactics of Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDs), roadside bombs and suicide attacks. Suicide-vehicle bombings in Hargeysa and Boosaaso, northern Somalia, in October 2008 have been widely attributed to al-Shabaab.
In view of the information presented to it the Committee will not recommend to Parliament that the regulation be disallowed.
Mr President I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Committee members for their work in reviewing this and other terrorist organisations. Lastly I would like to thank the Secretariat.
Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.

Mr President, on behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I have pleasure in presenting the Committee’s report entitled Annual Report of Committee Activities 2008-2009.
Mr President, the Committee completed another full and productive year scrutinising the administration and expenditure of the intelligence agencies and completing reviews of the proscription of ‘terrorist organisations’ under Subsection 102.1A(2) of the Criminal Code. Since the last annual report on the Committee’s activities, tabled in October 2008, the Committee has tabled four reports. In addition to the tabled reports, the Committee is currently conducting the seventh review of administration and expenditure.
Four reports on the listing of organisations as terrorist organisations were tabled in the period under review. The four reports dealt with thirteen organisations, all re-listings, although some organisations were listed under different names.
The reports were:
Review of the re-listing of Al-Qa'ida, Jemaah Islamiyah and Al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code Act 1995
Review of the re-listing of Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), Jamiat ul-Ansar (JuA) and Al-Qa'ida in Iraq (AQI) as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code Act 1995.
Review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Islam, AAA, IAA, IMU, JeM and LeJ as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code Act 1995
Review of the re-listing of Hizballah’s ESO as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code Act 1995
Mr President, I previously mentioned the Committee’s work in reviewing the administration and expenditure of intelligence agencies. In relation to the Committee’s review of administration and expenditure No. 6 draft copies of the report had been sent to all agencies by 10 March 2009 and by 22 June 2009 some Ministers had not replied with a final vetting letter. Some letters were only received by the Committee in the sitting week 15-18 June.
The Committee accepts that, due to negotiations between it and agencies, there may be some time before a final vetting letter can be arrived at. However the time frames that have been involved are, the Committee believes, unacceptable and point to an administrative failure by Departments in relation to the vetting of its reports.
It is clearly desirable that these Administration and Expenditure reports are tabled in a timely manner. The Committee believes that, in most cases, a response on vetting should be forthcoming within one month of its presentation to the relevant Ministers. Past experience indicates that any issues of concern tend to be straightforward and uncomplicated.
Reporting on these matters to the Parliament is important. The Committee therefore recommends that procedures be put in place to allow for the Committee’s Administration and Expenditure reports to be vetted within one month of their presentation to the relevant Minister.
The Committee’s sixth Review of the Administration and Expenditure of the Australian Intelligence Community was tabled on 7 September 2009 and, as such, was not commented on beyond the vetting issue I have mentioned in the current Annual Report.
Since 2002, the Committee has sent representatives to the biennial conference of oversight agencies. In 2002 the conference was held in London, in 2004, in Washington and, in 2006, in South Africa. In 2008, the conference was hosted by the intelligence agencies of New Zealand in Auckland between Sunday, 5 October 2008 and Wednesday, 8 October 2008.
In 2008, the following countries sent delegates:
Australia:
Belgium:
Canada:
New Zealand:
Poland:
Republic of South Africa:
United Kingdom:
United States of America:
This conference is invaluable in allowing members of intelligence oversight bodies from different countries to meet and exchange views. I note for the House that the 2010 conference will be held in March in Sydney and will be jointly hosted by the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Committee.
In conclusion, and on behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the work of the Committee during the past year.
Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports</title>,Committees,22,2
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2009-10-28,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, Senator Crossin, I present the report of the committee on the Anti-Terrorism Laws Reform Bill 2009, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS REFORM BILL 2009</title>,<title>Report of Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-10-28,"—On behalf of Senator Ludwig, I seek leave to amend a motion relating to government business notice of motion No. 2.
Leave granted.
—I move the motion as amended:
That the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009 is exempt from the order of the Senate of 13 May 2009 relating to the consideration of legislation, enabling consideration of this bill to proceed in accordance with the standing orders.
This motion is about allowing the Senate to deal with the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009 and is designed to overcome a Senate order of 13 May, originally moved by Senator Minchin and deemed to apply to the bill. This Senate order has the effect of preventing any debate on bills relating to the National Broadband Network until the government produces the ACCC’s formal report on NBN proposals to the NBN panel of experts and the final report to the government from the NBN panel of experts on submissions to the NBN.
This Senate order has been interpreted as applying to the recent telecommunications competition and consumer reform bill on changes to the existing telecommunications regulatory framework. In effect, this means that the Senate will not be able to debate this bill on telecommunications regulatory reform. I think that this interpretation of the Senate order is broader than even perhaps Senator Minchin imagined. I am asking the Senate to support this motion to ensure that important reforms to improve competition and strengthen consumer safeguards can be considered by the Senate independently and separately of any bills which specifically relate to the rollout and regulatory design for the NBN. In other words, I do not believe this bill is captured but, acknowledging the position and the interpretation, I seek to move the bill forward.
The telecommunications regulatory reforms that we have announced are designed to fundamentally reshape and improve competition and consumer regulation in the telecommunications sector as a whole in the national interest. These reforms are required, independent and irrespective of the NBN. They are significant reforms in their own right and are long overdue. The editorial today in the Australian notes:
... the Telco sector in Australia is not a truly open market. It is Telstra’s protected position that is finally being addressed ... after two decades of policy failure.
It goes on to point out that those opposite have no policy, are totally confused and are defending a monopoly position. We have been very clear that during the rollout of the NBN, and after, the existing regulatory regime which regulates the industry as a whole will remain important for delivering services in the interests of all Australians, consumers and businesses.
As we announced on 7 April, the government are committed to addressing the fact that the existing telecommunications regime does not work effectively to achieve its goals and is failing businesses and failing consumers. The regulatory reforms in this bill are critical and are urgently required to inject competition and better consumer service standards into the telecommunications industry now. On this need, the facts speak for themselves.
A report published this month for the US Federal Communications Commission, FCC, showed that Australia came fourth last in price, ahead of only Poland, Turkey and Mexico, on a weighted average of all internet access speeds. It also showed that on a weighted average of all broadband outcome measures—price, penetration, speed—Australia came 18th out of 30 OECD countries. These sorts of results are consistent with the most recent OECD statistics. We cannot wait to improve the state of competition in the telecommunications market. We cannot wait to give the ACCC the powers it needs to regulate the telecommunications sector more effectively. And we cannot wait to put in place a stronger consumer protection regime.
These reforms have been developed as a result of an extensive consultation process over a 15-month period. We have received over 200 submissions, more than even Senator Minchin’s press release tally.
—Surely not!
—Believe it or not, Senator Minchin, someone has done a little more work than you. There was almost unanimous support for the measures in the response to the regulatory reform discussion paper we released on 7 April. The government have listened to these views and we are now taking action. Every day that we delay these reforms is a day of higher prices and less choice for consumers and businesses—less choice and less innovation. It will delay stronger powers for the ACCC to act on anticompetitive behaviour. It will delay the strengthening of consumer safeguards around the provision of voice and payphone services.
Since the measures in the bill were announced on 15 September there has been overwhelming support for these reforms. The Australian Information Industry Association CEO, Ian Birks, representing Australia’s $100 billion per year information technology industry, warned just last week: ‘Obviously, any kind of slowdown in the acceptance of the legislation and the delivery of the NBN has a detrimental effect on how quickly we can achieve the benefits of a digital economy.’ The Australian Telecommunications Users Group said last week: ‘ATUG believes these changes are needed now to deliver better outcomes for end users, better prices, service and innovation.’ A joint industry statement released late last week by Optus, iiNet, Transact, Internode, Vodafone, Primus, Macquarie Telecom and Netspace said:
The communities that will benefit most are those that are most disadvantaged by the lack of competition today, especially rural communities that have seen their choice of communications provider diminish in recent years in the face of resurgent Telstra market power. On the other hand, the cost of a delay is real, immediate and an impost on all Australians. Delaying the passage of the legislation until next year would mean benefits would not flow until 2011 at the earliest. There is also a risk that the legislation might never be passed if the opportunity we are presented with today is not seized.
It is the government’s view that Telstra’s high level of integration has hindered the development of effective competition in the sector. Telstra is one of the most highly integrated telecommunications companies in the world across a range of telecommunications platforms. Its level of vertical integration raises concerns about the extent to which Telstra has the ability and incentive to favour its own retail business over its wholesale customers when providing access to various services—and you know it is true, Senator Minchin. It also owns the only fixed line copper network that connects almost every house, as well as the largest cable network, half of the largest pay TV provider and the largest mobile phone network. The OECD has concluded that Telstra’s horizontal integration has reduced the development of facilities based competition in Australia in comparison to other countries and has contributed to Telstra’s domination in the market. The reforms in the bill address these concerns while still providing Telstra with the flexibility to choose its own path.
The bill also includes the measures necessary to rebalance the regulatory framework, which has been criticised over the years as being overly cumbersome and unable to deliver sufficient certainty to drive proper investment in infrastructure. The operation of this regime has long been problematic. Access seekers have been frustrated by constant delays and disputes. More than 150 access disputes have been lodged with the ACCC in relation to telecommunications, compared to a total of only three disputes across all other regulated sectors. In order to correct this clear imbalance, the bill proposes reforms to the telecommunications access regime that will make the process more streamlined and less vulnerable to opportunistic procedural delays. This will provide greater certainty to both access providers and access seekers.
The failure of the regulatory regime is directly impacting on consumers. As recently as last week the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman released its statistics for the 2008-09 financial year. These statistics indicated a further deterioration in the level of customer service in the telco sector, with a 54 per cent rise in total complaints. There was a 57 per cent increase in internet related complaints and a 40 per cent increase in landline related complaints.
The reforms in the bill are particularly important for consumers and small businesses, including those in rural and regional Australia who rely on these services greatly and are disproportionately affected by the inadequacies of the existing regulations. In developing this package, we have considered the report by the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee, chaired by Dr Bill Glasson, set up by the previous government of which Senator Minchin was a member. The regional review committee’s final report urged the government to consider the separation of Telstra and measures to deal with its horizontal integration, including owning an HFC cable network. So the very committee set up by those opposite said, ‘Go out and do this,’ and those opposite are now turning their backs on their own committee. The regional review committee emphasised that measures to deliver competitive choice to consumers should be pursued as a policy goal and that this is an important element of providing regional Australians with equitable services.
The regional review committee’s report also urged the government to design measures to strengthen the USO and provide a stronger mechanism to deal with the removal of payphones and increase incentives for providers to meet the customer service guarantee standards. There is clear evidence that people in regional and rural Australia stand to gain from the reforms. The most recent ACMA published report for the March 2009 quarter found that, for payphones provided under the universal service obligation, only 59 per cent of faulty payphones in remote areas were repaired within the three-day period specified in Telstra’s standard marketing plan. This compares to 82 per cent repaired within two days in rural areas and 91 per cent repaired within one day in urban areas. For new fixed telephone connections, 84 per cent were provided by the universal service provider within the customer service guarantee time frame for remote areas. This compares to 90 per cent in urban areas. Arguing against considering this bill is arguing against the need to address this unacceptable level of service provided to consumers and businesses in regional Australia.
As I indicated to the Senate yesterday, the government has supplied all of the information it can responsibly supply to comply with the order. I understand the concerns of Senator Ludlam and the crossbenchers because the previous government abused the process of commercial-in-confidence to hide what they were up to. It was unacceptable. I understand very much why there are concerns about this and there are important issues at stake here. Even as I accidentally tabled information which should not have been tabled, information that was blacked out, it demonstrated exactly why the government has concerns it has in this area. Telstra was required to make a statement to the Stock Exchange after inadvertent information came to light, but both of the issues can be separated out. I accept and acknowledge that commercial-in-confidence has been abused in the past and senators are right to ask questions about this and want to ensure that they are getting genuine commercial-in-confidence excluded and not material that the government does not want. I absolutely accept that.
One of the other issues that was raised is the processes that will be followed going on from this. I give a commitment to the chamber that the government will not be looking to bring on the second reading debate until the first week back after the break. The second reading debate will take place then. I will be in Egypt at a UN conference that week, so we will not be seeking a vote that week. We will be seeking a vote the following week when I return. I want to outline for all that there are some natural constraints as well as some Senate procedure constraints about the process.
—You’re not seeking ideas from the Egyptians on broadband, I hope.
—I say quite genuinely, Senator Minchin, that there is genuine worldwide interest in what we are doing, and a number of countries have spoken to me about our broadband project, our regulations and our changes. I can tell you that there is genuine interest around the world.
There was one other issue that was concerning the crossbenchers and I want to make sure I address it. I want to assure senators that the reports to the government contain extensive commercially sensitive information provided by the NBN proponents on the understanding that it would be kept confidential. A disclosure of that information might discourage future participation in government tender processes. The report of the panel of experts contains detailed descriptions of the proposals received and a detailed assessment of each of the three national proposals against the evaluation criteria. It includes references to funding required to deliver on the proposal, proposed structure and financing arrangements, ownership, commercial feasibility and financial models, technical capability, pricing and business strategy. Release of the commercially sensitive information by the government would cause proponents commercial harm. Proponents involved in the tender process have confirmed that release of the parts of the panel’s reports to government that reveal and discuss their proposal would cause them commercial harm. The release of such information would be particularly harmful in the current environment where a range of parties are entering into commercial discussions on how they wish to participate in the NBN.
The National Broadband Network request for proposals was a robust process conducted in accordance with the requirements of the RFP and the Commonwealth procurement guidelines. The government’s decision to terminate the NBN RFP process was on the advice of the panel of experts that none of the proposals offered value for money. I am confident that the process has been run to a high standard and in accordance with the relevant guidelines. I also note that after the Senate order came into effect the Auditor-General announced that the Australian National Audit Office would conduct an inquiry into the RFP process. The government welcomed the Auditor-General’s announcement that the ANAO would conduct a performance audit of the National Broadband Network RFP process. The audit commenced in late June 2009 and will be completed in the coming months. I am afraid the Auditor-General’s office have not told me when they are going to finish, so I cannot pass on the information.
I want it to be clear that there are genuine commercial reasons why we cannot comply with the order to the extent that is being requested. The explanatory memorandum of this bill and the second reading speech given in the other place talked about the NBN in the context that, once it is rolled out as a wholesale-only network, it will fundamentally transform the competitive dynamics of the telco sector. Both of these documents acknowledge that this historic nation-building investment will help transform the Australian economy and create the jobs and the businesses that we need to succeed in the 21st century. So I urge the Senate to support this motion. It is not an attempt to subvert the will of the previous motion, as I think Senator Minchin would even acknowledge. The interpretation placed was a broad-ranging interpretation. I do not believe that resolution ever intended to capture this bill, so I seek the support of all senators in voting to bring on this bill.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,25,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-10-28,"—I inform the Senate that it is the opposition’s very strong view that the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009 should remain subject to the Senate’s order for the production of documents, that the order has not been complied with and that the Senate should not consider this bill until the government does comply with this order. Therefore, the opposition will oppose this motion. The government has treated the Senate with contempt over this matter and should not be relieved of the burden of complying with this order. The Senate order from which the government is seeking to exempt the current bill was adopted by the Senate on 13 May 2009. The order noted that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy had shown contempt for the Senate as a result of his failure to comply with the Senate order of 4 February 2009 which called for the production of documents relating to the National Broadband Network tender process. The order then called on the ACCC’s formal report on the NBN proposals to the NBN panel of experts and the final report provided to the government from the NBN panel of experts on submissions to the NBN process to be provided to the Senate by 6.50 pm on 13 May 2009.
The Senate agreed that, should the minister fail to comply with this deadline, further consideration of NBN related legislation—any NBN related legislation—would be listed for debate on the sitting day after these documents were provided. The Senate’s motivation for adopting the May order was quite straightforward: the government’s justification for breaking its election promise to contribute $4.7 billion to a fibre-to-the-node network and committing no less than $43 billion to a fibre-to-the-premises rollout was that the expert panel, with advice from the ACCC, had recommended that it do so. The government went out of its way to rely on the expert panel and its report as justification for this dramatic and extraordinarily expensive policy change. Thus the Senate properly decided that it wanted to examine the documents before considering any NBN related legislation.
Until this week, some five months after the Senate agreed to this order, the government has not even mentioned this Senate order aside from calling it a stunt. They have not pushed the case for urgency on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures—Network Information) Bill 2009 before the Senate nor discussed with any senators how they could meet the terms of this order within the constraints of commercial sensitivity. Upon introduction of this bill in the Senate, its consideration was adjourned until the provision of the documents specified in the order.
Now the Clerk of the Senate has had a look at the content of the second reading speech and concluded, as has the coalition, that there is absolutely no doubt that this bill relates to the National Broadband Network. For a start, the government itself asserts that this bill stems from its discussion paper entitled ‘A National Broadband Network: regulatory reform for 21st-century broadband’, which was released on 7 April this year when it announced its NBN mark 2 proposal. Secondly, the government is now arguing that this NBN discussion paper satisfies the requirements of the statutory review required of Telstra’s operational separation. So it has deliberately linked the structure of Telstra, the subject of this bill, to its NBN. Thirdly, there are over 150 references to the National Broadband Network and NBN Co. in the explanatory memorandum and second reading speech.
This evening the minister himself could not help but refer repeatedly to the National Broadband Network in arguing that this bill had nothing to do with the National Broadband Network. So there can be no denying that this bill is related to the NBN. Everyone knows this bill is about holding a gun to the head of Telstra in order to force it to help make the NBN viable. We all know that the government cannot afford to have its NBN compete with Telstra and that it needs to acquire Telstra’s assets for its NBN to work—hence this bill.
When announcing the introduction of this legislation and the extraordinary change of policy in regard to the separation of Telstra, Senator Conroy gave us no doubt about the link between this legislation and the NBN when he outlined Telstra’s very dubious choices under this bill. Senator Conroy stated:
For example, it—
structural separation—

may involve the creation of a new company into which Telstra could transfer some of its fixed-line assets.
Alternatively, it may involve Telstra progressively migrating its fixed-line traffic to the NBN over a period of time and under set regulatory arrangements, and for it to sell or cease to use its fixed-line assets on an agreed basis.
He went on to say:
This approach will ultimately lead to full structural separation over time.
Such a negotiated outcome would be consistent with the wholesale-only, open access market structure to be delivered through the National Broadband Network.
Minister Albanese in his second reading speech on this bill in the House of Representatives said:
Our commitment to a wholesale-only model for the NBN will deliver structural reform in the industry in the longer term. However, the government considers it vital to ensure that, during the transition to the NBN, the existing regulatory regime generates outcomes in the interest of consumers and businesses.
He also said:
The government has commenced constructive discussions with Telstra on how NBN Co. and Telstra could work collaboratively towards the NBN. We believe that we can work towards achieving a solution in the national interest that also meets the interests of Telstra and its shareholders.
The link between this bill and the NBN is paramount. The explanatory memorandum, on page 8, is clear about the government’s intentions:
As the nation moves to superfast broadband it is the Government’s clear desire for Telstra to vertically structurally separate, on a voluntary basis—
hear, hear!—
in the transition to the NBN to be consistent with the structure of NBN Co.
I could go on with, as I said, more than 150 examples from the explanatory memorandum about how this bill relates to the NBN. It is therefore clearly subject to the existing order of the Senate and should not be excluded.
Senator Conroy has only realised in the last week that the Senate cannot be taken for granted and that it will not be a rubber stamp for his poor policy decisions, especially given the significant lack of detail. It is only within the past four days that Senator Conroy has started to nuance his discussions about this bill away from the NBN, although he failed miserably tonight to separate his bill from the NBN. Until last week, Senator Conroy was quite explicitly tying this bill to his National Broadband Network. In a doorstop interview last week Senator Conroy said, in relation to the legislation:
What we need is certainty for Telstra investors, the market in general so that we can get on with delivering a world class broadband network to all Australians.
As we have seen through the Senate inquiry into this bill, it is not just the coalition and the Clerk of the Senate who recognise that this bill is inextricably linked to the NBN. The evidence presented to the committee from those supportive of the legislation left coalition senators in no doubt that these legislative proposals are inextricably linked to the NBN. The Executive Chairman of the Competitive Carriers Coalition, David Forman, confirmed this during the Senate committee hearing when he said, in response to a question from Senator Birmingham, who is in the chamber tonight:
If you suggested to me that the NBN was likely to succeed in the absence of this legislation I would suggest that that is a pretty big bet.
The investment company Maple-Brown Abbott described this bill as:
… a high risk strategy to deliver the NBN and more competition in the telecommunications sector. It runs the risk of damaging Australia’s sovereign risk rating as well as stifling investment and innovation in the telecommunications sector. It places too much power in the hands of the ACCC.
The reason that we, the opposition, lodged this return to order initially in February is that it was obvious that the government was hiding behind its tender process to avoid answering any questions about its now abandoned $4.7 billion fibre-to-the-node election commitment. The minister took on notice at estimates question after question about the NBN mark 1, using the cover of the tender process to avoid answering any questions about the $20 million tender process. When the government officially abandoned NBN mark 1, it announced NBN mark 2 and made it explicitly clear that it had, in large part, based its decision on the report of the expert panel, as advised by the ACCC.
On 7 April, when announcing its abandonment of its election commitment to a fibre-to-the-node network, the government released just a three-page extract from the NBN expert panel’s evaluation report, despite asserting that its decision was based on that report. Of course, in attempting to comply with this order of the Senate, Senator Conroy has this week tabled some additional information, which the whole world now knows about, with his extraordinary mistake in tabling highly sensitive ACCC information on the network. So he tabled information that he should not have but monumentally failed to table information that he should have to comply with this order. What the minister has now done is again tabled the three-page extract previously released plus, in his great generosity, an additional 13 pages of the evaluation report. Of course, the additional material supplied, paltry as it is, provides very little further detail.
During Senate estimates in May, it was revealed that the evaluation report totalled no fewer than 893 pages, and the flimsy document that the minister has tabled consists of just 16 pages from those 893 pages. He has tabled just 1.5 per cent of the report’s contents. He has omitted 98.5 per cent of the contents of the evaluation report on which he said the government had decided to move from a $4.7 billion commitment on behalf of taxpayers to a $43 billion commitment on behalf of taxpayers. There is absolutely nothing in the material released by the government to confirm that the panel advised the government to commit to a $43 billion fibre-to-the-premises rollout, let alone the reasoning and rationale for such advice. The only hint of any further advice was observation 10, which was released to us:
The Panel can see a way forward to achieve the outcomes sought by the Government and has provided that advice in confidence to the Government because of the commercial sensitivities arising.
We, with our experience in government, never expected that this government would provide commercially sensitive information, but this incompetent minister has, of course, inadvertently done so. As he said, despite releasing that information, it is important to protect information that is genuinely of a commercially sensitive nature. But we do and did expect that the government would table in the Senate the relevant sections of the expert panel report on which the government relied in deciding to announce a $43 billion commitment to build, own and operate a fibre-to-the-premises broadband network. It is quite unbelievable for the minister to claim that 98.5 per cent of the evaluation report contains commercially sensitive information which cannot be released to the Senate. Who does he think we are? That is a ridiculous assertion.
In the Senate yesterday, Senator Conroy, in an effort to deflect attention from his extraordinary incompetence, tried to allege that it was because the Senate asked for this information that he stuffed up and tabled commercially sensitive information. Apparently it was all the Senate’s fault for holding the government to its own commitment to openness and transparency. The minister has used the excuse of commercial confidentiality as the reason not to keep the public informed about his NBN plans. In his statement provided to the Senate yesterday, Senator Conroy stated the release of such information would be particularly harmful to the current environment, where a range of parties are entering into commercial discussions on how they wish to participate in the NBN—or, in the case of Telstra, how they will be told to participate in the NBN. The paradox is that, as I said, yesterday the minister tabled the most confidential information of all but failed to table the information the Senate reasonably expects to see before considering NBN related legislation. As I say, to assert that 98.5 per cent of the contents of the evaluation report on which this decision was based cannot be released for commercial reasons is an absolute nonsense.
The coalition will not support this attempt by the minister to exempt this bill from the Senate’s order for the production of documents. The government has made it very clear that this bill is about how it can make its NBN work, and the minister gave the game away tonight when he spent half his time talking about the NBN in arguing that this bill had nothing to do with the NBN. I must say that until the government cooperates with the Senate order in good faith we will not be supporting any attempts to exempt the government from its obligation to provide the Senate with open and transparent information about its decision to commit up to $43 billion of taxpayers’ money to its National Broadband Network. We in the Senate are the guardians of the taxpayers’ interests. This government is expecting the Senate to consider and, in its view, pass NBN related legislation that will commit taxpayers to a $43 billion infrastructure project. This Senate has a right to have available to it the information upon which the government has decided to make such an extraordinary decision before it considers legislation to give effect to the government’s wishes. If the Senate were to agree to waive the application of this order to this bill, this government would continue to treat Senate orders with the contempt that it has displayed so far.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,25,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-10-28,"—We are listening to both sides of this debate and there is no doubt that the NBN legislation, when it comes, will be predicated on a motion from the Senate requiring information—not all of which the government has furnished to the Senate. The progress of the legislation, which this motion clears the way for, is not guaranteed by this motion passing—if it were to—tonight. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy is not here, which I think is not a good situation. It would help if the minister were able to reiterate the government’s concession in terms of providing information to the Senate, but it does raise the question of commercial in confidence.
Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, you will know that the current opposition when in government was never inclined to be forthcoming with information of this sort—not ever. As soon as it was in the commercial interest to keep something under cover, it was not available. Here we now have the Labor government doing the same thing and the opposition is cavilling about that. There needs to be an in camera process for senators and staff to be able to look at commercial-in-confidence information when it is important for deliberations on processes, such as those we are engaged in here, which are important for the whole nation.
In all of my parliamentary life one bane that has been consistent is governments of both persuasions resorting to commercial-in-confidence excuses for blocking from going to parliament information that is required for proper decisions to be made. The coalition cannot escape responsibility for being part of that block. When it comes to freedom of information legislation and indeed to questions on notice to parliament one of the most frequent guises for not supplying information, one of the greatest excuses by ministers for not giving information, is that it is commercial in confidence. One knows there is a reasonable limit in which secrecy of, for example, patents and sometimes resource bases are necessarily critical to a company’s wellbeing, but that is very often not the case when it comes to commercial-in-confidence matters. It is simply that the private sector does not want to have the same scrutiny that they expect of the public sector.
Freedom of information ought to have been legislated long ago for the private sector as well as for the public sector because the private sector—as we have just witnessed from the global financial crisis and the need to put its way billions of dollars from the public sector as with the stimulus packages, which are getting up towards $100 billion of taxpayers’ money—is very, very dependent upon the largesse of taxpayers. It cannot resort to secrecy then when taxpayers’ representatives in the form of senators want to look at information which is critical to making decisions. The government has released some information but it has not released a great wad of other information on the basis of commercial-in-confidence reasons and it puts us in an impossible position. We do not want to hold up legislation that is essential to the delivery of good telecommunications to this nation. On the other hand, we do not want to have to debate issues where we do not have basic information that is fundamental to that decision making.
As advocates of full and open disclosure at least to the people making the decisions, we do not find the commercial-in-confidence excuse washes. I think the government should look at that again. The minister is absent from the chamber at the moment—I am sorry; he has come into the chamber and he is involved in discussions. We are in a really difficult position here. The Senate has made an order for the delivery of documents. Those documents relate to the National Broadband Network, not specifically to the legislation the government wants to bring on now. Yet we ought to have that information by now. We will continue to look at the merits of both sides and we will make our decision, if not before, when the bells ring.
Debate (on motion by Senator Xenophon) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,25,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-10-28,"—I was talking about the Greens’ position on the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009 and the establishment of this agency. At the time, I think, I was outlining the Greens’ concerns about the bill and why we thought it was important that amendments were made. As I was articulating yesterday, we believe this is a significant step forward. However, I must admit that I am doubtful as to the government’s commitment to this agency, as to whether they actually want it to succeed and whether they actually want to get it through this chamber.
To date we have had what I would say are fairly lukewarm discussions with the government about this bill. We have not, we think, made excessive claims or requests; we have genuinely been negotiating for a successful outcome, and I am exceedingly disappointed that the government have not, I think, participated in those discussions in a meaningful way. I am exceedingly disappointed with some of the feedback that the Greens have been getting, and I think the government think that we will vote for this bill regardless of how they negotiate with other parties. I tell the government that they are wrong and that we will not be supporting this if they do not negotiate with us in good faith. They cannot assume that they can do what they like to the Greens and that we will support this bill.
We are very genuine in our attempts to pursue good health outcomes for this country, but we will not be treated in the way that this government thinks it is acceptable to treat the Greens. The message to the government is that we will not be voting for this bill unless the government negotiates with us in a meaningful manner on the outcomes that we think are appropriate and the amendments that we have put up in good faith. When we negotiate with the government, we expect it to stick to the promises that it has made and not go back on them. As I said, the message is: do not expect that we will be voting for this bill if the government does not engage with us in a meaningful way. The government needs the Greens, Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding to get this bill through if it does not have the coalition. I ask the government to bear that in mind. We have put up amendments in very good faith. We have put up amendments to include alcohol in the range of issues that the agency deals with to amend objectives and to put some more independence in the authority. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2009-10-28,"—It is a pleasure to rise to speak on the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009 and to outline some of the concerns that I have both with the nature of this bill and, indeed, with some of the broader subject matter and policies that it encompasses. I say at the outset that, as my colleague Senator Cormann has argued so strongly, this bill is very much a case of the government seeking to put the cart before the horse. This is a case of the government deciding that it is about serving the Public Service and creating a bigger bureaucracy before it actually gets on with talking about policy decisions and policy actions. These are the great disappointments that lie in its decision to introduce this bill in response to an inquiry and a report. That is the only significant response the government has made, and the response is simply to set up an agency—not to consider any of the other substantive recommendations of the report but to swell the ranks of Canberra’s Public Service a little bit more by setting up an agency.
This is one of the many, many reports that this government has commissioned in its two years in office. Report after report has piled up through this time, including in the health portfolio. There are so many reports and reviews and yet there has been so little substantive policy action on the recommendations or findings of the reviews. We see in the health area the classic example. The government promised big before the last election. On public hospitals it promised that it would take over management by July this year—the July that has already passed—if the states had not got their acts together. Of course, that promise has been thrown out the window.
We have seen a review come back to the government on the public hospital system and the health system. They have had their review and it has reported. What have they done in response to that report on the public health system and the many, many recommendations contained within it? They have gone to consultation. We had a review into the public health system and our hospitals, and they have now gone to consultation.
—And reviews into the review.
—As Senator Cormann says, it is a review into the review. They have gone to consultation. Little wonder that yesterday in question time government senators appeared to look so dispirited, worn and tired, because I understand that the consultation strategy proceeded yesterday with the Prime Minister in the Labor Party caucus giving a PowerPoint presentation on the consultation strategy. People like to talk of death by PowerPoint. I can only imagine what a PowerPoint presentation by the Prime Minister would be like. I understand he inflicts these presentations on the Labor Party caucus on quite a regular basis, which must be a most painful activity for all and sundry who have to go through it. I can only imagine that in this instance the Prime Minister would have stood there and there would have been a picture of the Prime Minister and Minister Roxon with some nurses and then another picture of the Prime Minister and Minister Roxon, perhaps in surgical gowns—some nice photos that could, perhaps, go in their electorate publications as long as the Department of Finance and Deregulation approved the content as not being electioneering. I can see slide after slide of the Prime Minister’s holiday tour around the nation’s hospitals as part of his review into the review and his consultation strategy.
It is a strategy that is so light on action and detail. All he is doing is talking and running around the country. What he is not doing is fixing the hospitals, hospitals that state Labor administrations have neglected and worn down for so many, many years. He is now failing to show the courage to stand up to those state Labor administrations and actually ensure there is some action in this area rather than an awful lot of photo opportunities.
In my home state of South Australia recently one of these consultations took place. The Prime Minister went to Murray Bridge. He wanted to talk about regional health, apparently, and visit a regional hospital so he very carefully chose Murray Bridge. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing know all too well that just there in Adelaide’s north lies the Gawler hospital. Hidden away in the budget details this year was a rezoning, a reclassification, of the Gawler hospital away from being treated as a regional hospital to being treated as a metropolitan hospital. The Prime Minister could have chosen to go to that semiregional, outer metropolitan area and talk to people there, but of course, no, he would not go there. He has not gone anywhere near the Gawler hospital in these consultations, because he knows the community there are very angry that the sneaky budget decision of this government last year is going to cost that community their health services and make it a whole lot harder to attract doctors to that area of Adelaide’s north.
This is the type of decision that the government are making. We have seen it on cataracts, as we have discussed at length today. There are sneaky decisions in the health budget that take away services and benefits from communities, whilst the government conduct roadshows and PowerPoint presentations talking about what they might be able to do and trying to once again convince the Australian people, as they did before the last election, that they stand for something, even though there is no action behind all of those words.
That was the review into the public health system, which has gone off to its consultations and review. Then we had the Preventative Health Taskforce review. I think 134-plus recommendations came from the Preventative Health Taskforce review. There were a stream of recommendations there, and what has the government decided to do? What is its action out of this? Its action is contained in this legislation. That action is the Australian National Preventive Health Agency. I am sure we all look forward to having yet another agency in Canberra, yet another bureaucracy established, yet more public servants being paid.
—They grow like rabbits!
—Indeed. There is no shortage of public servants. What we have seen in state Labor government after state Labor government around the country is a ballooning of public service numbers. They do not even know, half the time, how many extra they are getting. In South Australia they have thousands more public servants than even the Labor government ever budgeted for. They just woke up one day and had all these extra public servants. Quite clearly, this federal Labor government is going to go down the same path. Numbers will slowly creep up in all of the existing agencies and, on quite a regular basis, we will have new agencies coming into power. The Australian National Preventive Health Agency will of course be one of them.
What we need is health outcomes, not health bureaucrats. What we need are actions, funds and policies on the ground and in communities around Australia that provide real, tangible health benefits, not more health bureaucrats sitting in Canberra trying to tell people how to live their lives. This agency is going to have a $133 million budget. It will spend $2 million this year on marketing campaigns—and I will come in a moment to some of those ideas of marketing campaigns and agencies telling us how to live our lives. That figure will balloon out to $33.8 million in 2010-11. So there will be nearly $34 million that year in marketing campaigns by this new government agency, with all of its bloated bureaucrats and so on adding to the great Canberra bureaucracy.
Thirteen million dollars over four years will go into what is euphemistically described as ‘translating research into practice’. It would be interesting to see just what that actually meant. It may well mean yet more research, or it may mean—and this is the great fear out of this—that the government will hand over policy powers, some level of arbitrary decision making, to an unelected body. We believe that the government should respond to the Preventative Health Taskforce report in its entirety. That is what the second reading amendment to this bill, sensibly moved by Senator Cormann, calls for, and I hope that this chamber will support it. The second reading amendment would ensure that the government actually gave a response to all of the recommendations in the Preventative Health Taskforce report and that the government set the policy and did not handball the policy decision making off to unelected health bureaucrats. That is the risk in establishing these types of new agencies—that is, that the government takes decision making out of the hands of this parliament, out of its own hands, and gives it away because it finds it easier to let other people make decisions and finds it easier then not to have to front up for the blame for the types of actions and decisions that these agencies might follow through with.
This whole agenda around preventative health is an interesting one, because it is an area where, with too many powers, agencies such as this one could have very profound impacts on the way people choose—quite knowingly—to live their lives. It is not a news flash, it is not some earth-shattering, groundbreaking news, to tell Australians that smoking is bad for them. It is not earth-shattering news to tell Australians that drinking to excess is bad for them. Equally, it is not earth-shattering news to tell Australians that gorging themselves on fatty foods is no good for their ongoing health. These are not groundbreaking bits of news—far from it. These are facts that the overwhelming majority of Australians already understand.
I would hazard a guess that, if you asked that question—whether smoking was good or bad for them, drinking to excess was good or bad for them or eating an unhealthy diet was good or bad for them—of 99 per cent of Australians, they would all know that each of those things was bad for them. Yet they continue in some instances to do it. That is not to say that it is good that they do it but it is to say that no number of marketing campaigns, no number of budgets in these areas will enable you to convince or stop people from making what in the end to some extent are free choices to be able to actually decide how they lead their lives. Unhealthy lives we would all like to discourage, but there are limits to how much government should interfere in people’s lives to discourage them from leading unhealthy lives. Government is not some nanny state that is there to hold the hand of everybody each time they go to the supermarket, to tell you, ‘No, you should not put that in your shopping trolley.’ That is not the role of government and that is not what we should be seeing out of these types of preventive health agendas.
Preventive health is far wider an issue than the government has chosen to pursue in this particular taskforce report and indeed the working of this agency. Preventive health relates to the overall avoidance of disease development, supporting early diagnosis and reducing negative impacts or complications of established diseases—all very worthy aims. Using condoms, washing hands, cleaning areas of food preparation and providing immunisations are all quite worthy aspects of preventive health. These are things that seem to be overlooked in the remit for this agency and seem to be overlooked in the approach of the task force. Yet early screening, testing for a range of diseases and more work on family history are all important things that the government should be putting high on the priority list. But no, it chooses to go for the sensationalist aspects that get good, cheap headlines: those things to do with smoking, drinking and fatty foods. The media lap up the stories on clamping down on these things. They love to hear the stories of inflated estimates of just how much these types of activities might actually cost.
Let us look at how much some of these things cost, not in terms of overall economic loss that takes in a whole range of extraneous factors that those who like to sensationalise put together but let us actually look at cost to hospitals. We will pick on smoking because everybody else picks on smoking. I do not see why I should not as well. A federal government report in 2005 found that the cost of smoking to the hospital system was some $670 million. That is a significant cost of smoking to the hospital system, and I acknowledge there would be other direct costs to the health system from smoking that would add to that very significant price tag. But what do we collect in tobacco excise? It is $5.5 billion, with GST on top of that. There is $5.5 billion in tobacco excise collected every year. We are already taxing smokers and drinkers quite significantly to pay for their sins of smoking or drinking to excess, to make sure that they pay for the additional cost that they put on the health system and our health services, to make sure that there is a financial disincentive as well. A financial disincentive is welcome and is an important part of the types of measures the government has pursued over the years. These are reasonable measures that have been built up over a long period of time.
Taxes on tobacco and alcohol have their place. They have been growing over many years to the level we have today and they act as a deterrent. There comes a point where you push beyond that deterrence level and you start to encourage, in the case of tobacco, the use of chop chop, illegal activities, activities by bikie gangs or others. You end up with government policies that encourage the types of underground businesses that prohibition for time immemorial has been seen to foster that society should not encourage. That is why getting the right balance in these policies is so important.
It seems that very little of this debate has actually focused on when we cross the line of unnecessarily telling people how they should live their lives or unnecessarily instructing businesses on how they should run their businesses. There is no way that in those types of interference we should be handing power over to an unelected body like the Australian National Preventive Health Agency. We should be ensuring as a parliament that we set the policies in these areas; that we make sure that the tax rate applied to these areas is correct, not too much, not too little; that we make sure that the public education campaigns applied to not smoking, not drinking to excess and having a healthy diet are not too much, not too little; that we make sure that the parliament and the government and the elected officials are actually the ones who have the total control over these very important policy areas that impact directly on how people choose to live their lives. It is not up to unelected bureaucrats, and indeed we as elected officials should be very mindful that we do not cross that line of unnecessarily impinging on people’s freedom of choice to be able to live their lives as they reasonably see fit so long as they do not cause harm to others. That needs to be the prerequisite. We of course need to pursue the types of policies that have been pursued over the years in relation to smoking and in relation to drinking that minimise the harm caused to others, that seek to eliminate the harm caused to others. But in the end people’s choice to do these things for their own selves, in their own body, needs to remain their own choice.
There are some reasonable ideas contained in the Preventative Health Taskforce report. Increasing the provision of fresh food to remote Indigenous communities is something government should be actively addressing. Working to reduce tobacco and alcohol abuse, particularly in those communities, is something government should be addressing. Tackling obesity and diabetes and providing for better sports and encouraging active, healthy lifestyles in schools is something government should be addressing. But government should be addressing those things before they ask us to vote on this bill. We should be expecting that this government and this Senate defer consideration of this bill rather than handballing another report off to another agency that will probably undertake another review. Let us hear your comprehensive responses to the Preventative Health Taskforce. When we hear your comprehensive responses, we will happily debate this bill. When we know what the agency may or may not be undertaking on a policy basis, we can make a considered decision. Until then, this bill should lie on the table or be defeated.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-10-28,"—I support the second reading of the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009. I understand the coalition’s criticisms of this bill, but I believe that it is an important way forward. It is important because having a preventive approach to sickness is pretty fundamental to any good health system, and I commend the Minister for Health and Ageing for going down this path. The fact that this will be a statutory body is welcome as well, but I think that it also needs to be independent and to give advice that it is clear, unbiased and free of any government interference. That is why I believe that the amendments to be moved by the Australian Greens have a lot of merit when it comes to the independence of this body.
Australia does not need a bigger health bureaucracy without more information and better advocacy. That is why it is important that the focus of this agency be on making robust recommendations on bettering the health of Australians in order to prevent illness and disease. It is important that the agency provide leadership on preventive health surveillance and data and to promote standards of preventive health. This body has an enormous opportunity to do a lot of good in the community when it comes to health, and I commend the health minister for introducing it, but I believe that it could be more independently structured. I note that the Australian Greens have proposed amendments to the bill that relate to the agency’s scope for looking at alcohol and tobacco. I also note Senator Fielding’s very genuine concerns about alcohol abuse in the community. It is important that this body look at preventive strategies in that area. Other substance abuse also needs to be covered. We cannot underestimate the devastation that substance abuse such as crystal meth and heroin abuse causes to individuals, families and communities. That is why this bill must have a clear focus on dealing with other substance abuse.
I have a concern about the independence of the body, which should be embedded structurally. I also have concerns about the recommendations that this body makes, which should be as transparent as possible. After all, if we are dealing with an issue of public health, those recommendations ought to be transparent and subject to public scrutiny. That is why I will be moving an amendment that will ensure that recommendations made go on the web. That does not require the government to actually implement those recommendations, but it does require a degree of transparency and robustness in the debate on this.
I expect that I will have much more to say about this in the committee stage. I support the second reading of this bill. It is important that we get it right. It is also important that the government be transparent in any negotiations that it has undertaken with all parties on this bill and that we do not lose this opportunity to make some significant advances in preventive health in this country. I commend the minister’s focus on that. I also commend Senator Cormann for his forensic and robust advocacy of his concerns—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—I think that Senator Cormann is doing what a shadow spokesman should be doing: keeping the government to account. The government’s failure to provide details of recommendations should be condemned, and I supported the opposition on that. I agreed that those details should be provided, but I do not agree with the opposition’s belief that the government’s conduct on the recommendations is a reason to stop this body being set up. That is my fundamental difference with the opposition. I look forward to a robust committee stage and hope that the government acknowledges the merit of a number of amendments that are being moved, so enabling this bill to be passed.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-10-28,"—I thank the senators who have contributed to the debate on the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2009 and confirm for those who may be listening to this debate that the government absolutely acknowledges that our health system is in desperate need of reform and that we need to deal with the health issues of the 21st century. I am not going to dignify Senator Birmingham’s contribution—some of the nonsense that he put forward was quite ridiculous. We could only begin to wonder how the coalition’s consultation process would have played out given the intensity of the issues and the concerns that Australian people have about our reform agenda and the situation with respect to health in Australia at the moment.
It is very clear that the Australian people understand that the Rudd government has a very ambitious three-pronged health reform agenda. It is a complex issue, one that the previous government shirked and short-changed for over a decade and one that our government has said it is determined to tackle. In opposing the passage of this bill today, those opposite have disgraced themselves on the issue of health. The government has undertaken three interlocking and complementary reviews via the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission and the national Preventative Health Taskforce.
A key part of their recommendation is the establishment of some infrastructure to guide, oversee and build the evidence base for more effective preventative health measures. The agency was scheduled to start work on 1 January next year, with $133 million allocated for its immediate work to fund research, to conduct public health campaigns and to develop contemporary national guidelines, standards, codes and other activities. One of the first tasks earmarked for the agency was to run a new, focused antismoking campaign and to conduct some translational research to reduce obesity—the scourge of the 21st century around the modern world. Just five days ago, we had Liberal Party support in the other place for this agency. The member for Dickson said:
The objective of preventative health measures to alleviate pressure on the public hospital system is rightly supported by both sides of politics.
But today what have we seen? We have seen Senator Cormann come in here and undermine his health spokesperson and move an amendment that is effectively about blocking the establishment of this agency.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. The speaker for the government is misleading the Senate. Obviously she has her talking points from the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is getting so desperate given that she is not making any inroads in her health portfolio that she now has to perpetuate these sorts of lies.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—There is no point of order.
—Senator Cormann’s amendment moved today to delay and effectively block the establishment of the agency has a purpose. It defies logic that, 12 months after this was announced, months after it has been publicly debated and only days after it was supported as noncontentious by the Liberals in the Main Committee, they are now against it. It makes no sense.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2009-10-28,"—I rise this evening to thank the community of Geraldton and the surrounding region for their support for the recent community cabinet held on 1 October. This was the third community cabinet held in Western Australia. There was a great turnout, with around 360 community members attending the public forum with the Prime Minister and cabinet members. This was followed by a series of meetings between ministers and representatives of the community.
Music students from John Willcock College, Geraldton Secondary College, Geraldton Grammar School, Geraldton Primary School, and the Allendale, Beachlands and Mount Tarcoola primary schools all entertained the gathering before the arrival of the Prime Minister and ministers. We were welcomed to John Willcock College, the venue for the community cabinet, by Principal Julie Campbell. Yvonne Radcliffe, a Naaguja elder, gave the welcome to Yamatji country. Ashleigh Websdale, a year 9 student from John Willcock College, sang the national anthem. Well done, Ashleigh; you did a beautiful job. I would like to thank all these people for helping to make the community cabinet a success.
As the PM highlighted at the community cabinet meeting:
It’s very easy for somewhere as remote as Canberra from this community of Geraldton and this region, for governments, whatever their good intent, to simply become detached from the reality on the ground. That’s why every six weeks or thereabouts the Government goes out to a different part of Australia. It’s the first time a Commonwealth government has done this.
It is a very important initiative. Ministers gained firsthand insights into issues in the region through their numerous local meetings, before and after the community cabinet, and from the forum itself. Issues raised at the forum included progress on local projects, such as the Oakajee port development; Australia’s bid for the Square Kilometre Array project; changes to the youth allowance; native title claims; climate change and energy efficiency; and funding for the rock lobster industry. The community cabinet process highlighted what a dynamic and growing place Geraldton is.
Geraldton holds an important key to growth for the state and the country: from iron ore and magnetite resources to the big wheat crop that is expected this year; from the fishing industry to the growth of the wild goat harvest, with its significant economic and environmental benefits; from the incredible opportunities for science that the Square Kilometre Array represents to the important dynamic community services that cater to the city and the region with their innovative programs. Geraldton’s strong and active community works hard to make the most of its opportunities and seeks to share these opportunities with everyone.
Here are some of my highlights that really illustrate Geraldton’s drive and community spirit. It was terrific to visit the Geraldton Street Works Corporation with the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin. Geraldton Street Works, otherwise known as ‘Streeties’, started in 1991 in response to the needs of young people who were roaming the streets of Geraldton late at night. Streeties provides innovative youth services to both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children and young people in Geraldton. In a short time I was able to get a glimpse of what a terrific community force this organisation is, providing programs for young people that develop in them a sense of respect for themselves and others, confidence, resilience and security. It was great to meet some of the young community leaders that Street Works is developing. I would like to thank you, Streeties, for the delicious kangaroo tail stew and damper.
I was also moved by the work undertaken by the Geraldton Womens Health Resource Centre. The centre has just commenced a program to support women with post-natal depression. I thank the centre for their commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of local women, especially those who are experiencing domestic violence or social isolation.
I was also very pleased to visit the Geraldton Legal Aid Office. The agency explained to the Attorney-General and me the difficulties they face in providing remote and outreach legal services. Along with the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator the Hon. Mark Arbib, I met with the Salvation Army’s Employment Plus service. The service staff talked to us about the importance of Indigenous employment programs and about how their new service rollout was going. I am pleased to report they are off to a good start.
While in Geraldton, Senator the Hon. Kim Carr, Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, announced $4 million for the CSIRO Murchison Radioastronomy Observatory Support Facility. This initiative capitalises on Geraldton’s unique location. It enables it to serve as a major link between the proposed SKA bases at Boolardy Station in WA’s midwest and Perth. The facility will link Geraldton based researchers with the world-class $80 million Pawsey High-Performance Computing Centre for SKA Science to be built in Perth. Geraldton will also significantly benefit from the National Broadband Network, as the Geraldton to Perth link has been named as a national priority for the NBN. The link contains additional capacity to accommodate the SKA. Geraldton and the surrounding region is set to play a key role in Australian and international astronomy. It will be exciting to watch this unfold in coming years.
While in Geraldton, the Prime Minister announced funding for new cycling facilities in the city. This project will support local jobs as well as build permanent facilities to encourage healthier lifestyles and a more sustainable community. These include the construction of new bike racks, new off-the-road concrete bike paths and the establishment of three bike lanes along key roads. These facilities will complement the foreshore that the Gallop government revitalised, which is now looking terrific.
The Rudd government is committed to understanding the issues confronting Geraldton as a dynamic, important and growing regional city. This is underscored not only by the community cabinet visit but also by the fact that Kevin Rudd is the first prime minister to go to Geraldton in 55 years. He has been not once but twice in the last year. Finally, thank you to the many hundreds of people from Geraldton and the wider region for taking time to raise your issues with the Rudd government and for sharing your vision for your community. In partnership with you, the Rudd government can help your vision be realised.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Geraldton Community Cabinet</title>,Adjournment,28,1
