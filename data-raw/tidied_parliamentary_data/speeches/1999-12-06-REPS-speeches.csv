"Andrew, Neil, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I would remind members on my right that the Speaker wishes to make a report to the House and that would be facilitated by them resuming their chairs.
I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Greece, Turkey and Cyprus in July 1999. The report records the impressions of the Australian parliamentary delegation which visited Greece, Turkey and Cyprus in the period 6 to 21 July 1999. I had the privilege of leading the delegation and was accompanied by the Hon. Duncan Kerr as Deputy Leader, Senator Brian Gibson, Mr Joel Fitzgibbon, Mr David Hawker and Mrs Danna Vale. The delegation secretary was Mr John Kain from the Department of the Parliamentary Library.
The visit took place at a time of some turmoil in the eastern Mediterranean region. It was in the immediate aftermath of the Kosovo war and just prior to the devastating earthquakes which struck Turkey and, shortly thereafter, Greece with tragic loss of life and major property destruction. Australia has long-established and valuable associations with all three countries, both social and economic, as well as military. Members of the delegation felt a special feeling of kinship and familiarity with the people and the parliaments of this region. This was hardly surprising as migrants from the region have indeed made an invaluable contribution to Australia's rich and diverse cultural fabric over the last 50 years. These cultural connections no doubt contributed to the overwhelming warmth and friendliness of our reception by parliamentary and other national leaders in each of the countries.
While none of these countries ranks among Australia's major trading partners, they do offer important export growth and investment 
 opportunities. As the record attests, there has been quite significant growth in our trading relationship with Turkey, in particular, over recent years. Every listener will know that there are marked similarities between the climates of temperate Australia and the eastern Mediterranean countries. Not surprisingly, our primary producing industries have much in common and share many of the same production challenges. This is true particularly in agricultural production in semiarid areas. These similarities mean that there are opportunities for increased trade and investment and the pooling of experience and expertise to our mutual benefit. Some Australian interests are already heavily involved as joint partners in a number of irrigation and agricultural projects in the region. The rapid growth in sales of Australian fast ferries to both Greece and Turkey is a noteworthy example of Australian manufacturing export successes in the region.
Further emerging opportunities for Australian trade and investment in Greece are appearing in the lead-up to the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, and the Athens organisers are working closely with their Sydney counterparts to help make both events an international success. Although large Australian construction companies are already aware of these opportunities, the sporting events offer further openings for smaller companies which will emerge. These will not be limited to the construction industry but are likely to extend to the provision of an array of other goods and services and design support. The delegation was struck by the fact that, like Australia, all three countries visited are going through rapid economic transformation and structural change. With the breakdown in international trade barriers over recent years and declining international transport costs, Australian investors and traders would be wise not to neglect this vital and rapidly growing part of the world economy.
Of course, the eastern Mediterranean region has long been of prime geostrategic importance to Europe and Asia. This military importance was demonstrated most recently by the central support roles played by Greece and Turkey in the Kosovo conflict. The support of 
 the region was also crucial to the effective conduct of the allied effort in the Gulf campaign of the early 1990s. The military links between Australia and the region date back many years and provide the foundations of some strong bilateral bonds between Australia, Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. During the Second World War, Australian troops were involved in the defence of Greece and many Australian service personnel died in the Battle of Crete.
The delegation noted with gratitude that these events are commemorated by both Greeks and visiting Australians to this day. The lasting legacy of Gallipoli in the collective national memories of both Australia and Turkey cannot be overestimated. Its importance to the Turks was continually emphasised to us by Turkish national leaders. The symbolism of the ANZAC connection is very real and the delegation felt especially honoured to visit the historical sites and memorials of Gallipoli where, in 1915, Australia and Turkey first met. While adversaries at this time, the bravery and gallantry of both sides in the Gallipoli campaign has shaped the way both Turkey and Australia see themselves in the world today.
Australia's longstanding civil police function undertaken in support of the United Nations peacekeeping forces on Cyprus has represented a very significant commitment of Australian resources over the past 35 years. It is a valuable indicator of the importance which successive Australian governments have placed on the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.
The delegation was pleased to have the opportunity to meet with Australian Federal Police members stationed on Cyprus. We learned at first-hand the nature of their responsibilities along the UN buffer zone which delineates the northern Turkish Cypriot controlled part of the island from the Greek Cypriot portion of the south. We were impressed with the capacity the AFP members have shown to uphold the Australian tradition, particularly in the circumstances in which they work.
During the course of its discussions with parliamentarians in Greece and Turkey, the 
 delegation was continually reminded of the interdependence of these two regional neighbours and of the complex web of social, political and religious factors which, over the generations, have tended to keep relationships between the two countries at best `cool' and at worst `hostile'. Although the Cyprus problems lies at the heart of many of these difficulties, there are other areas of longstanding dispute, such as territorial claims in the Aegean Sea and conflicting claims over air rights.
A lasting impression from our discussions with respective national leaders is that the prospects for immediate resolution of these difficulties are not at all clear, notwithstanding some recent thawing in Greece-Turkey relations. The apparent intractability of the Cyprus problem is a continuing concern. However, there have been some recent positive moves by the EU to accept Turkey as a candidate for EU entry. The support that Greece has given to this accession is to be lauded. The possibility of full EU membership may offer greater long-term prospects for resolving some of the historic differences than have existed for many years.
I express the delegation's deep appreciation to the parliaments of Greece, Turkey and Cyprus for welcoming us so warmly, to the heads of mission and staff in the Australian posts in Athens, Ankara and Nicosia—particularly Ambassadors Burns and Forsyth, and High Commissioner Brown—for their strong support, and to those officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Parliamentary Library for the thoroughness of their briefing material prepared before the delegation's departure.
I conclude by recognising the cohesiveness of the delegation which I led, and I express my particular appreciation to all delegation members for the way in which they operated as a team and so effectively represented Australia in what was quite a lengthy overseas visit. I offer my particular appreciation to the deputy leader of the delegation, Mr Kerr, the member for Denison, for his support throughout the events.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Delegation to Greece, Turkey and Cyprus</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—Mr Speaker, might I reciprocate by firstly saying 
 that this was certainly the most harmonious of delegations, and your role in that regard I think warrants the recognition of all members of the delegation. You have canvassed most of the issues that the delegation addressed. Simply to put some personal reflections on the record, might I say that I particularly welcome the new warming in relations between Greece and Turkey that seems evident in the aftermath of the response to each country from the tragedies that arose from the recent earthquakes. That has been followed by, or was associated with, a withdrawal of Greek objection to Turkey's membership of the EU. And there are, I understand, currently talks in New York between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities which may have some prospect of addressing the otherwise intractable separation between those two communities.
It is very plain that, unless there is either substantial change in terms of international intervention in relation to that matter or a willingness for cooperative solutions between the two parties, the status quo is likely to remain. That was made very clear to us by our Turkish interlocutors who plainly indicated that they regarded the status quo where the Turkish component of Cyprus essentially asserts its right to independent statehood to be supported by the Turkish government. The opportunities therefore that might emerge for agreement in New York are to be welcomed.
I might indicate that plainly, of the things that struck home with all of us, one was the real sense of mutual interest in the celebration of Gallipoli. I do not think people who have not been to Turkey would have had that sense. It can be spoken of, but nothing really can lead you to the kind of emotional response you have when you stand beside the monument that has been erected and is inscribed with the words of Kemal Ataturk recognising the tragedy of the lives lost on both sides, but doing so in terms which commend all to the soil of Turkey and seeking to show that, in this one conflict perhaps uniquely in the world, people emerged more closely as friends rather than as bitter enemies. 
There are, however, areas of misunderstanding. One of those was brought home to us in a tense meeting with the Turkish Speaker of the Grand National Assembly where he raised concerns about the New South Wales parliament commemoration of claimed instances of Armenian genocide. There does need to be some work done in order to make certain that there is no misunderstanding in relation to what now is, I think, a well-known instance where there was massive loss of life—whether it could properly be termed a genocide or not is a matter of contention but no doubt it was a massive loss of life—when Turkey was not the Republic of Turkey but the last of the Ottoman Empire.
Why this should now be such a contentious matter in bilateral relationships was difficult for me to understand, but nonetheless it is, and it is an issue where we need to be sure that those who have dealings with us on the other side of the Australian Turkish negotiating positions understand that there will be a wide range of views expressed in the Australian community, not always a single voice, and that that is inherently part of that process, notwithstanding the disquiet the government may have.
Nonetheless, there were some very rewarding signs that our views in relation to human rights issues were being seriously considered. There were some substantial improvements that the delegation noted in relation to the way in which the Ocalan matter was addressed and a very important recognition that there needed to be an engagement with the international community, notwithstanding what we all have to accept is a very difficult on-the-ground situation with respect to the separatist interests of the PKK and the role it has played in disrupting Turkish society. I will conclude my remarks there to allow other members of the delegation to express their views.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Delegation to Greece, Turkey and Cyprus</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I would like to join with you, Mr Speaker, and the member for Denison to say a few words about this report. I will start by echoing some of the words that you and the member for Denison have already expressed, that is, that it was a very successful visit: it was a very 
 good and cooperative delegation, and a very well led delegation. It should be noted that your efforts, Mr Speaker, bore fruit as far as making sure it was a very successful and cooperative visit.
Many of the issues have already been canvassed, but I would like to revisit a couple of them. We were very fortunate with the level of contact we had in all three countries. We were certainly given the opportunity to meet with people at the highest level, including the President of the Hellenic Republic in Greece, the President of the Greek Chamber of Deputies and Mr Papandreou, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Likewise, in Turkey we had the opportunity to meet with the Speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the Prime Minister and also the President. This occurred again when we went to Cyprus and we were given access to the President of the House of Representatives and the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr Clerides. That shows the feeling towards Australia and the recognition that we received there.
It is also worth echoing the words that have already been uttered about the fact that the delegation did have an opportunity to see first-hand the relationships between the three countries and also the growing cooperation that has occurred, particularly following the absolute tragedy of the earthquakes in Turkey just after our visit. It seems that sometimes out of adversity comes new opportunities and I dare say this was one that we were rather pleased to see develop.
The role that Australia is playing in the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus is to be commended. The commitment and quality of the people we send over there is always a credit to Australia. They always make sure that they acquit themselves in a very fine way and in their own way they are ambassadors for Australia and certainly make a contribution. The intractability of the Cyprus problem has already been mentioned and it is of continuing concern. As the report concludes, we do not see any easy solution there.
One would hope that, with Greece hosting the Olympic Games in the year 2004, Australia will be in a very good position to help in many ways from our own experiences with 
 the Sydney Olympics next year both in a supporting role and in a tangible way. We should be able to use that opportunity for the mutual benefit of both countries.
I would also like to congratulate the diplomatic staff on the excellent support we received from Ambassador Ross Burns in Greece and Ian Forsyth in Turkey, and High Commissioner Howard Brown in Cyprus. All of them gave tremendous support and were very professional in their approach.
The final point I would like to make is that the importance of parliamentary delegations cannot be overestimated. This delegation demonstrated yet again that it is of significant benefit to the nation to have these visiting delegations. There is no doubt that it not only helps promote Australia in a diplomatic way but also helps promote some of the trade opportunities that can come from greater cooperation between countries. Members of the delegation took that responsibility very seriously.
I conclude by again endorsing your words, Mr Speaker, for the support the delegation received and also particularly mentioning John Kain, the secretary to the delegation, who did an outstanding job. He was highly professional in his approach and very dedicated. The way he supported the delegation in such a professional manner was a credit to him, and he assisted in so many ways to ensure the success of the delegation.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Delegation to Greece, Turkey and Cyprus</title>",Delegation Reports,0,1,speech
"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled World debt—a report on the proceedings of a seminar, 27 August 1999 , including evidence received by the committee and the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I am pleased to present this report of the proceedings of a seminar on world debt hosted by the Joint Standing 
 Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on 27 August of this year. The seminar was opened by the parliamentary secretary responsible for Australia's aid program, the Hon. Kathy Sullivan MP. The panel of speakers on the day included representatives of Jubilee 2000 and several other non-government organisations. The seminar was balanced by the inclusion of academics and officers of government departments and was very well attended by members of the diplomatic corps, representatives of government and non-government organisations and other interested parties, as well as members of parliament.
The debt of the world's poorest nations is an issue that all sides of politics have a great concern for, a concern shared by many people in Australia and around the world. The petition of 385,000 signatures from Australians presented to members of parliament clearly demonstrates the depth of feeling in the community about the debt issue. The Australian petition formed a part of the global petition of some 17 million signatures which was delivered to the June 1999 meeting of the G7 nations in Cologne. The debate about development has evolved in recent years. Debt is one of the fundamental problems inhibiting growth in the poorest nations of the world. There is the belief that debt and a failure to develop are intrinsically linked. Indeed, indebted nations are unable to attract investment or to invest in their own social capital, because of the debt burden they carry.
In 1996, the World Bank and the IMF launched the Highly Indebted Poor Country initiative to alleviate some of the debt of the poorest nations. Criticisms have focused on the initiative's strict qualifying criteria, the limited amount of debt forgiveness and the long compliance period that countries must adhere to before debt forgiveness is offered. In response to the continuing debt crisis and the perceived shortcomings of the HIPC initiative, a broad coalition of interested parties began campaigning for greater debt forgiveness for the poorest nations by the year 2000 on moral and ethical grounds. In June 1999, G7 leaders agreed to the Cologne debt initiative, which would relax some of the criteria for access to debt relief and, most 
 importantly, substantially increase the amount of money offered for debt forgiveness.
Australia bears little responsibility for the indebtedness of other nations. We accept that the scope that the Australian government can play in reducing the debt of developing countries is somewhat limited. The committee report, therefore, focuses on the concrete objectives that Australia can pursue to reduce poverty in the world's poorest and in other developing nations. In our report, we recognise the need for a fine balance between the monetary cost of the Jubilee 2000 proposal for debt relief and the human costs of doing nothing and the debt crisis continuing. It is on this basis that the committee recommends that the government continue support of the HIPC initiative.
Australia does not have a great deal of bilateral debt owed to it by other nations, and even less of that debt is not being serviced. This is largely a result of prudent decisions to offer development assistance in the form of grants, not loans. At the seminar, the committee was told that the size of these debts totalled less than $80 million. In the spirit of the HIPC initiative, the committee recommended that Australia offer this bilateral debt to be considered as part of any future contributions to the revised HIPC initiative where those countries are permitted to agree to meet the HIPC conditions.
Despite the IMF proposal to revalue some of the reserves of gold in order to pay for the HIPC initiative, the initiative will not be fully funded. It is on the basis of this expected shortfall that the committee recommended the Australian government give consideration to additional contributions towards the HIPC initiative, in line with Australia's level of obligation to the IMF and World Bank. Debt relief may be a circuit breaker, but it is not a panacea for the development of the world's poorest countries. Development will flow only from a genuine commitment to improving material conditions of its people, along with basic policies and robust institutions that are essential to growth. I commend the report to the House.

"O'Byrne, Michelle",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I rise today to offer my wholehearted congratulations to the organisers of Gone South, which was a youth orientated musical festival held in Launceston on Saturday. This concert showcased the talents of local high school bands and big name acts such as Killing Heidi, Grimspoon, Paul Kelly, Powderfinger and silverchair. It is the first concert of this size to be held in northern Tasmania and was much appreciated by the some 12,000 people who attended it. I want to point out that of those 12,000 people the majority were aged in their teens or early 20s, so some members of parliament felt particularly old. Particular congratulations must go to those people in the audience who were impeccably behaved during the 13-hour concert in quite some heat and quite some queues at times.
The Launceston City Council is to be congratulated for supporting the event, which was held at the Inveresk rail yards, a site that has emerged as a social hub of Launceston thanks to its development funded originally by Better Cities funding. In particular, I must pass my congratulations to the promoter, Charles Touber, and the coordinator, Mark Walsh, all of the security and the catering staff and especially St John Ambulance for 
 their hard work and commitment to this youth event. Young people are often criticised in our community and their normal answer is: `You don't give us enough to do, so this is probably why you have problems with us.' This event showcased just how much they appreciate access to youth orientated events.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Do you recall saying on 28 October in relation to the recent cash for comment controversy:
I stated a principle which remains valid today, and that is that I have always assumed that, when I hear 
 somebody expressing a view on something, it is their own view and it is not in any way instructed by financial reward.
Does this principle continue to remain valid today?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Prime Minister: Cash for Comment Principle</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I was asked, when I was in New York in the wake of the allegations that appeared on, I think, the Richard Ackland program, Mediawatch , what I thought of the allegations. I think on that occasion I said that I was not going to get into the detail of holding judgment on individuals, but I thought the most appropriate thing that I could do was to state a principle in relation to people who make comment on talkback radio or television, or in the media generally. I am happy to stand by what I said in New York. I think it is a sound principle. When I hear somebody say, `I think what the government has done is right' or `I think what the government has done is wrong' or `I think the opposition is right' or `I think the opposition is wrong,' I assume that they say that because that is the view they hold. I am prepared to state that as a principle and let its application in relation to individuals fall where it may. I have not as yet been apprised of the findings of the ABA for the very simple reason that I do not think they have made any. I have watched the inquiry with interest, as no doubt all honourable members have. The principle that I stated in New York remains my view and we will see how it applies to the findings of the inquiry.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Prime Minister: Cash for Comment Principle</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—The week before last, the Leader of the Opposition questioned me about a phone call I had had on Perth radio from Shirley, and I said at that time that I had not heard from her. But the ever vigilant Prime Minister's office got in touch with her. We did find the lady and we had a very pleasant discussion with her. The facts are as follows—and I thought, as the Leader of the Opposition asked me the question, the House, particularly his own followers, would be interested to hear the answer.
The details were provided to my office by the lady. The essence of her concern, as stated to us, is that she was quoted a GST-inclusive price of $5,500 for a basic prepaid funeral. She was concerned that this price was excessive as a relative of hers had been quoted a 
 price elsewhere which was substantially lower. I am advised that she has since spoken to others and purchased a prepaid funeral which suits her requirements for $3,500. I would remind the House that the government has enhanced the powers of the ACCC so that businesses that engage in any price exploitation in the lead-up to the introduction of the new system will be liable to penalties of up to $10 million for corporations and $500,000 for individuals.
I should also inform the House—parallel with this but not arising out of this—that there were discussions between the Australian Funeral Directors Association and the government. The government proposes to amend the legislation applying to the GST transitional rules for prepaid funerals. The effect of the amendment is to make a prepaid funeral purchased before 1 December 1999 and fully paid before the year 2005 GST free no matter when the funeral occurs. However, a GST will apply to prepaid funerals purchased after 1 December 1999, and the funeral operator will of course be required to pay a refund if the funeral takes place before 1 July 2000.
I also want to add to an answer I gave to the Manager of Opposition Business. The Manager of Opposition Business asked me a question about sales tax on cars. I did state the obvious—that if you cut the tax on cars they become cheaper—although the shadow minister does not accept that. I was handed a document that contains the following statement:
. . . the recession has had a severe effect on motor vehicle sales.
From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent—
that did not actually turn out to be the case; it was not very permanent—
a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800.
With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries.
At least the author of those words thought that if you cut the tax you got a cheaper car—that is, P.J. Keating's One Nation statement 
 of 26 February 1992. As a footnote, it was not very permanent. He took it back to 22 per cent after the 1993 election.",REPS,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Prepaid Funerals</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech

—I move:
That the House:
(1)	 commends the Government for its efforts in promoting domestic and international tourism which has resulted in a 7% increase in international visitors during the last 12 month;
(2)	 notes the significance to the economy of the number of jobs created by tourism; and
(3)	 notes the foreign exchange earnings resulting from international visitor travel to Australia.
There is no doubt that we are in the golden era of Australian tourism. At the beginning of the new millennium, the industry is well placed as the largest employer in the country and the second largest earner of foreign exchange earnings. Let us consider how far this industry has come. In 1975, we had half a million international visitors to this country. By 1985, the number had shifted to one million. In 1988, it was two million. By the time we finish this year, we are expecting 4.5 million international visitors to have come to Australia. There are now close to 700,000 jobs in Australia provided directly by tourism and some 300,000 provided indirectly. Foreign exchange earnings amount to some $16 billion, and domestic tourism is worth some $43 billion. There is no doubt that this is one of the most significant contributing industries to Australia's growth and development.
The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that 3.6 million international visitors came to Australia during the 10 months to October 1999. If we extrapolate that number forward to the end of the year, it is 4.5 million, which will be an outstanding result and certainly the largest number of international visitors that this country has seen. If we take it that some 70 per cent of these visitors will visit Sydney, we have almost the population of Sydney dupli 
 cated each year in terms of international visitors. This represents an increase in international visitor arrivals of seven per cent compared with the same period last year. Even more encouraging are the increases in visitor nights and visitor expenditure.
The Bureau of Tourism Research's international visitors survey estimated that visitor nights totalled 104 million for the year ending June 1999—an increase of 13 per cent over the year ending June 1998. The total expenditure by visitors in Australia for the year ending June 1999 increased by almost 19 per cent over the previous 12 months. That, of course, is the most relevant measure because it is not just visitors but the yield that we get and the number of bed nights that we have with accommodation yields. Very often, we focus on numbers alone and that is insufficient. We have what are called volume based results, which is really profitless volume. So we need to avoid that, and that is why it is important that we look at the number of bed nights.
Domestic tourism has seen some decline in recent years, with growth being relatively static. I am pleased to advise that the slowdown in international visitor rates has assisted the growth of Australian domestic visitor numbers. The slowdown resulted from the decrease of Australian visitors to Bali and is reflected in an increased number of Australian domestic visitor nights. The most recent statistics on domestic tourism indicate that in 1998 Australians spent 293.5 million nights away from home on domestic trips and took 153 million daytrips. Expenditure on domestic tourism was $43 billion. No comparison with 1997 is available due to a change in survey methodologies. But, undoubtedly, these statistics are a result of the government initiatives put in place by Minister Jackie Kelly and, before her, by Minister Andrew Thomson and Minister John Moore.
The government has a range of programs and initiatives currently in place to assist the tourism industry. This level of assistance is at an all-time high. These initiatives include the Regional Tourism Program, the Partnerships Australia Domestic tourism initiative and the Regional Online Tourism Program. Funding 
 under the Regional Tourism Program has actually doubled, growing from $8 million a year to $16 million to assist tourism in all of the regional areas. The members in this House from regional areas can testify to the considerable assistance this has provided in terms of real incentives and a real lift to visitor numbers to country areas. Grants of between $30,000 and $100,000 will be made for innovative and worthwhile project proposals that seek to build tourism in regional Australia.
In the 1999-2000 budget the federal government pledged $8 million towards providing and stimulating domestic tourism in this country. This $8 million was matched with $4 million from the private sector and $4 million from the state governments. This has done much towards the setting up of a company, Partnership Australia Domestic—in which all of the players are involved: the various tourism authorities in each state, the private sector and the federal government—to encourage Australians to travel around their own country first to assist in the stimulation of the Australian domestic tourism market. The Regional Online Tourism Program provides $2 million over two years to help the regional tourism industry set up its own web sites to provide direct linkages for people who go to the Internet to seek more information. It is a direct initiative of Minister Jackie Kelly.
The Australian Tourist Commission receives $90 million a year. In real terms, whichever way you want to cut it—even if Labor went back to their halcyon days with Paul Hogan—there was never this level of assistance, that is, $90 million. This is also the first time we have seen any assistance for domestic tourism initiatives. This is a first for any federal government: $8 million matched by the other amounts from the states and the private sector. The $90 million represents an increase of $50 million over four years. As part of that, $9 million is being devoted to maximising the opportunities from the 2000 Olympic Games. The Australian Tourist Commission has provided its marketing strength in past years in terms of the Asian market, as the focus has shifted to that, and the traditional markets of the UK and the USA. We have 
 seen a substantial growth in both markets, with both showing increases of over 10 per cent over the past 12 months. That has been a very significant increase.
It is forecast that for the Olympic Games we will see some additional 1.6 million visitors and $6.1 billion in foreign exchange earnings to Australia, and of course some $9 million of the amount allocated by the government to the Australian Tourist Commission is going to promote the benefits of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. In terms of significance to the economy of the number of jobs in tourism, as I mentioned, some 670,000 jobs—8.4 per cent of the total employment of this country—relate directly to tourism. They are directly dependent on it. Tourism is the largest employer in the country. Some 90,000 indirect jobs relate to tourism as well. Close to one million jobs in this country are tourism related. That is why it should be taken very seriously. Tourism is a major source for youth employment. There is a major opportunity for regional, rural and indigenous communities and for ethnic Australians to be involved in the tourism sector.
In the last financial year, foreign exchange earnings represented 14.5 per cent of Australia's total export earnings and 61.9 per cent of services exported. Some $16.2 billion in foreign exchange earnings came directly from the tourism sector. This leads to our improvement in the balance of payments overall. Of course $2.1 billion goes to regional Australia alone—to all of those various areas, which include the Gold Coast, tropical North Queensland, the Whitsundays, the Illawarra, the Northern Territory and the areas surrounding Uluru. It is therefore significant to recognise, firstly, the importance of jobs that come from the tourism industry in this country. It is the number one job supplier and the second largest earner of foreign exchange earnings in this country. The government's level of assistance to this industry has provided significant dividends. The $90 million it provides to the Australian Tourist Commission pays off in international visitors, and the new amount of $8 million for domestic tourism has provided a real stimulus that has not been seen in this country before.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—It would be negligent indeed to start a speech in this House on the question of tourism without commenting on its importance to my electorate. My electorate of Lalor covers a number of very important tourist facilities in Victoria, including the Werribee Park Mansion, the State Rose Garden, the Werribee Open Range Zoo, the Point Cook Metropolitan Park and Homestead, the National Equestrian Centre and the Point Cook RAAF Museum, about which I have spoken in this place on other occasions. Indeed, I suspect that my electorate is the only place in Australia where literally 45 minutes after leaving an international flight at Tullamarine airport you can be in an open range zoo environment eye to eye with a hippopotamus or, if that is not your style, at the Werribee Park Mansion, a very beautiful old building which is currently being developed by a former Prime Minister into a prestige hotel and conference facility. So tourism is very important in my electorate and, as the previous speaker has said, very important to this nation.
Before moving on to talk about other aspects of this motion, I would note how important the tourism industry is to Australia economically. Our Australian national accounts do not measure tourism as an industry. That is understandable, given the diverse nature of the activities that would be covered under the umbrella of tourism. However, the Bureau of Tourism Research has made endeavours to measure the value of tourism to our economy. The bureau, in 1996-97, estimated that total tourism expenditure in Australia was valued at $59.4 billion, of which about three-quarters came from domestic tourism and the balance from overseas sources. The added value of the tourism industry—that is, the value of tourism output less the cost of materials used to produce that output—was $24.2 billion. Consequently we can say that 5.4 per cent of GDP is directly accounted for by the tourism industry. This 
 makes it larger than the mining industry, significantly larger than agriculture, forestry and fishing and roughly equivalent in size to industries such as wholesale trade, transport and storage, and education.
International tourism makes a significant contribution to Australia's export earnings. In 1997-98 international tourism generated $16.4 billion in export earnings; it accounted for 14.4 per cent of Australia's total export earnings and 64.1 per cent of service exports. In 1996-97 tourism expenditure in Australia was responsible for the employment of close to one million people, or 11.5 per cent of total employment. This comprised 670,800 persons employed directly in the tourism industry and a further 291,000 persons employed indirectly. Domestic tourism expenditure generated the most jobs at 510,000 compared with 171,000 created by international tourism.
Against this backdrop of impressive statistics, we have to note that not all has gone well with this industry in recent years. Clearly there was a difficulty with our international tourism given the Asian economic meltdown; in fact, international tourist arrivals fell by 3.5 per cent in 1998. Fortunately, the falling visitor numbers from Asia were partly offset by increases in arrivals from North America and Europe. But we did see a fall in international tourist arrivals and, at the same time, we saw the continuance of the trend where more Australians holidayed overseas than ever before. Clearly, the figures for this year have been better. We can expect an upsurge in international tourism arrivals, given the Olympics next year and the number of people who will be attracted to that.
Against that background of an industry that is vital to our economy but which has had its stresses and strains in view of the Asian economic crisis, one has to question what is the appropriate government policy and response. The government has allocated resources to an advertising and promotion campaign. But promoting and nurturing an industry is more than just promoting in the form of advertising in the various media; it is also about getting the policy settings right. In that regard I would have to say that this 
 government's answer to nurturing our tourism industry in the form of the imposition of a GST is not an appropriate policy setting if we want to facilitate growth, jobs and export earnings through tourism.
It is important to note that the GST does not cause tourism just one problem; it engages in a quadruple whammy on the tourism industry. There are four distinct blows that the GST package makes to the tourism industry. First, 75 per cent of our tourism industry is domestic. As people travel as domestic tourists, once the GST is in, basically all parts of their holiday will be GST affected, whether it be accommodation, restaurant meals, tour fees or fees for entrance to tourist attractions like the Werribee Open Range Zoo or what have you. That is blow number one to the industry.
Blow number two is that, for inbound international tourists, international air and sea travel as well as domestic air travel purchased by non-residents offshore will be GST free but international tourists will face the GST on accommodation, entertainment, food and transport. It is important to note that this is a highly competitive international industry. Tourists do not have to come to Australia. When in their home countries they are considering a range of holiday options, clearly Australia is one of those options, but it is not the only option. And this is an industry which is notoriously price sensitive; it has a very high reaction to movements in price. As the industry noted in the course of the GST debate, there is no doubt that the GST will create additional costs for international tourists travelling in Australia and it will make Australia a less attractive tourist destination than it was previously.
Blow number three to the tourism industry arising out of the GST package is the fact that international airfares for outbound Australian tourists will remain GST free. On the surface, that looks like a benefit in that people can go overseas without the GST applying to their travel to get there. But there are substitution issues in the tourism industry. When you are considering your holiday options, many people will look closely at the price of a domestic holiday—going to Cairns, for example—versus the price of going overseas to 
 Bali or some such destination which also offer sea and sun and those sorts of holiday options. In considering that price effect, the fact that international travel will not attract a GST will mean that the relative costs for Australians of going overseas will be more attractive as a result of the GST being on domestic travel but not on international travel. We will see the government, through this package, sending a price signal to Australian tourists that they ought—on a price basis—to consider going overseas. That fact has been noted by expert commentators on the tourist industry.
The fourth blow from the tax package overall to the Australian tourist industry is that it is noted in Treasury estimates—for whatever they are worth—that we are likely to see an appreciation of the Australian dollar of 4.6 per cent as a result of the effect of the government's tax package. The effect of the appreciation of an Australian dollar on tourism is clear: it makes inbound tourism, which is people coming to Australia from overseas, more expensive; and it makes outbound tourism—that is, Australians holidaying overseas—cheaper. Once again, another blow to our tourism industry.
All of these effects were the subject of quite detailed evidence when the GST was considered by the Senate select committee and other Senate committees. Indeed, the Chief Executive Officer of the Tourism Task Force, Mr Chris Brown, ended up describing the whole package as a `$1.2 billion kick in the guts to the industry'.
—A very expensive kick in the guts.
—That is right. Through modelling that his task force has done, he anticipates that we will see a contraction of seven per cent in the tourism work force in the first year of the new package. When he gave evidence before the Senate select committee, he referred to quite detailed economic modelling undertaken by his task force which showed that 59,000 full-time and part-time jobs were in jeopardy. It indicated that the tourism industry would contract by 59,000 full-time and part-time jobs as a result of the government's tax package. Clearly, in the tourism industry, this tax package is living up 
 to its reputation as a job destroyer. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Tourism</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I support the motion moved by the member for Cook which seeks the House's support in commending the efforts of the Howard government in ensuring that Australia has a strong tourism industry. The motion also recognises the vital role that tourism plays in generating jobs for Australians as well as much needed foreign earnings. As the motion rightly states, there has been a seven per cent increase in the number of international tourists visiting Australia over the past 12 months. This has been despite the Asian economic crisis that has dampened demand in some of Australia's markets. The previous speakers have also spoken about that.
As with some other export industries, the tourism sector has been quick to respond to changes in the international economic environment. It is good to see that we have gone back to those traditional markets of the United Kingdom and the United States and that this has delivered more tourists from those markets. The industry must be applauded for its adaptability and receptiveness to changing circumstances.
The government has played no small part in this. The announcement in May of a $995 million funding boost to the Australian Tourist Commission for overseas promotion will no doubt play a significant part in maintaining this momentum. The significance of tourism for Australia cannot be underestimated, particularly in my home state of Queensland. For instance, in 1999, 4.2 million international tourists came to Australia, and they spent some $7.8 billion. In terms of jobs, the sector as a whole employs 700,000 people. That is 8.4 per cent of the country's total work force. The member for Cook quoted some of those figures earlier.
But it is domestic tourism that plays a crucial role in Australia's tourism industry. It accounts for three-quarters of all visitor nights and expenditure in Australia, according to the publication Tourism Industry Trends. On Saturday I was very proud to launch on behalf of the Minister for Aged Care a booklet called Get Up and Go. The federal government has 
 spent $100,000 to encourage domestic tourism in the over-65s market. It encourages Australian seniors to travel domestically in Australia, and that market alone accounts for 2.97 million seniors. You can see the boogie board on the front of this booklet. I hope I am as active as that at the age of 65.
Being a Queenslander, I recognise the importance of both foreign and domestic tourism in creating jobs and wealth for the country. I wish to congratulate Club Crocodile, which operates resorts and river cruises in Queensland, for winning a recent Jobs Pathway program. The work that they do in training students in the hospitality industry needs to be applauded. That trend seems to be continuing.
There has been a huge change in the communities that rely on tourism. I have seen that happen in the city of Redcliffe that I represent. The Redcliffe Peninsula used to be the tourism mecca before the Gold Coast took off when people would travel to the peninsula and holiday there. Sutton's Beach was long favoured by Brisbane families as a place to get away and relax with a swim in Moreton Bay, but now it cannot compete with Surfer's Paradise. Tourism had all but died on the Redcliffe Peninsula—until recently.
We now have a world-class jetty, and I am involved at the moment in promoting with the council daytripping to the region. I must commend the regional tourism funding that has been provided for areas such as Redcliffe. The member for Lalor did mention the effect of GST. She did not mention, however, the benefit that visitors to New South Wales and also to Cairns and the Northern Territory will have when the bed tax is removed—the very same bed tax that was introduced by the New South Wales Labor government. That was not mentioned. Clearly it is inequitable when Australians holidaying overseas have to pay for the facilities they use in visiting other countries when international tourists to Australia do not. International tourists should pay for the facilities that they use when they are travelling throughout Australia—the roads and the infrastructure have to be funded from somewhere. 
I would like to support the motion further by saying that the federal government's commitment to tourism and sound economic management will make sure that we put in the right conditions so that all of Australia can take advantage of tourism. More jobs and stronger growth mean that more Australians can enjoy our particularly wonderful scenic beauty, and I wish to commend the benefits that it will have for regional Australia, particularly for the electorate of Petrie. I commend this motion to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Tourism</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I am astonished that the member for Cook and the member for Petrie would come into this House proposing and seconding a motion which congratulates the government on its policies in relation to tourism. It is well known that the GST will come into force on 1 July next year. My colleague the member for Lalor spoke eloquently of the impact that the GST will have on tourism. I will expand on that in a moment. I was equally astonished to hear the member for Petrie talking about the replacement of a bed tax in Cairns with the GST when, in fact, there is no bed tax in Cairns; there is no bed tax in Queensland at all. There is a small bed tax in New South Wales and the Northern Territory. Members opposite should actually have a look at their own documentation, which they released before the election.
The member for Lalor also spoke eloquently about some of the great contributions that tourism makes to this country. I refer in particular to some work that has been done by the Bureau of Tourism Research, which estimates by using, coincidentally, the Monash model—about which I will speak a little bit more later—that tourism adds value: it contributes to the national income of this country to the tune of about $24 billion, which equates to about 5.4 per cent of the country's national income. That makes tourism larger than the mining industry and roughly equivalent to the size of wholesale trade, transport, storage and education.
On export earnings, the tourism industry makes an extraordinarily valuable contribution to this country with earnings of about $16.4 
 billion, which is considerably more than the $10.8 billion earned by, for example, mineral exports. On employment, the tourism industry contributes close to a million jobs in Australia, which is a wonderful contribution by this industry and a contribution that we on this side of the parliament do not want to see jeopardised by the introduction of the GST.
I have here what has really become the bible, the fount of wisdom, on the GST, and that is the main report of the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System. In it, the tourism industry argues very strongly that at least a major component, that is, inbound tourism, should be exempted from the GST. Although organisations such as the Tourism Task Force and the Tourism Council of Australia argued for that, the government was completely unreceptive. As a result of that, the GST will apply to the entire tourism industry, including inbound tourism. As my colleague the member for Lalor has indicated, there is incredible price sensitivity on inbound tourism because people can shop around all around the world. The GST will in fact apply to that important component of the tourism industry, along with all the other components. All restaurants, meals, drinks and domestic travel will be subject to GST.
The Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia was another organisation that argued unsuccessfully for the exemption of at least part of the tourism industry—inbound tourism—from the GST. A study prepared by the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University had a look at, and tried to quantify, the impact of the GST on tourism. It came up with a figure which predicted job losses at 4.3 per cent or 19,880. We have the government coming in here and saying, `Look at all of our pro-tourism policies.' How can they be proud of presiding over a policy that will lead to the loss of around 20,000 jobs in an industry which has among the greatest growth prospects in Australia? This is absolutely perverse economic policy.
We are talking about the replacement of bed taxes. A small bed tax in New South Wales and in the Northern Territory will be replaced by a bed tax on every hotel and motel in Australia—that is, the GST. What 
 hypocrisy when people come in here and say, `We are getting rid of this bed tax.' Yes, they are, but they are replacing it with a bed tax on every hotel and motel in Australia, including in regional Australia. I thought these people were the champions of regional Australia. Where is the member for Herbert, the member for Leichhardt, the member for Hinkler and the member for Longman on this? They all voted for a bed tax on every bed in Australia. (Time expired)

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—The number of illegal immigrants entering Australia has been unprecedented. Almost daily, we see images on our television screens and in our newspapers of overcrowded boats filled to capacity with people intending to claim permanent refugee status in Australia. It seems that not only is the frequency of these arrivals increasing but so too is the number of people aboard each vessel. There are also many hundreds of illegal arrivals that enter this country by air.
To many of us, these images are reminders of the thriving trade in people-smuggling, a trade which feeds on human suffering and the misfortune of fellow human beings. The first priority of the operators of people-smuggling rackets is not to provide a safe haven for refugees but to profit from human misery. Australia is a friendly and welcoming nation for migrants from all races. This year the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs set aside 12,000 places in the humanitarian program for entry into this country and thousands of people around the world are waiting for one of those places—and many of those people have close family ties with Australia. 
Their wait has now been made much longer due to the priorities of people smugglers, who continue to move people by the boatload into Australia promising a new life and, to refugees, safe haven for a significantly large fee. I call this queue-jumping. I would like to express that I grieve for the migrants of this country who are now enduring long periods of separation from their families because they took law-abiding steps to migrate to Australia. These people are the ones who are most affected by the dumping of illegal immigrants into this country by the people-smuggling rackets.
In my electorate of Prospect, 52 per cent of the population were born overseas. Many of these people came to Australia under the government's humanitarian program to start a new and successful life. These migrants endured years of waiting to start their new life here in Australia. They abided by the immigration laws of this country, and their wonderful contribution to society has been essential to the cultural make-up of our nation. Many of those people have had to separate from their families. Many family members are still waiting overseas for one of the places that Australia sets aside each year under the migrant and refugee intake. In the meantime, their wait is being extended due to the influx of illegal immigrants who arrive via people-smuggling rackets and who expect to jump the queue to receive permanent residence in Australia.
The government received bipartisan support for its legislation to crack down on illegal arrivals by ceasing to grant illegal immigrants permanent resident status, instead granting them a three-year temporary visa. While this is an effort—I must admit, a very belated one—to curb the influx of illegal immigrants into this country, the government still has a long way to go before it has fully addressed the problem. Refugees will continue to arrive in Australia via people-smuggling rackets for as long as those involved in these areas believe that the penalties, if they are caught by the authorities, are negligible and for as long as the potential illegal immigrants believe their chances of success are high.
People-smuggling is a lucrative trade which thrives in areas where the risk of being caught is low. Rackets are often the work of highly skilled criminal organisations that make a very large profit out of human misery. The International Organisation for Migration estimated the proceeds worldwide for people-trafficking to be in excess of $10 billion a year. They also estimate that there are about four million people becoming illegal immigrants in the world at any one time.
The government has clearly failed in its efforts to enforce protection of Australia's coastline. As a result, Australia is being seen as an easy target by these people smugglers. Australia's immigration laws are being blatantly disregarded by criminal syndicates. These rackets are not only allowing people to jump immigration queues; the cost of detaining and removing illegal arrivals has also certainly increased—taxpayers' dollars which could be redirected to other areas.
A Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs fact sheet on people-smuggling states:
. . . it costs the government on average $50,000 for every unauthorised arrival from the time of arrival to the time of departure.
If we are to believe the figures, the boat people who have arrived in this calendar year alone are estimated to be close on 3,000. One only has to multiply to realise what that is costing the Australian taxpayer.
In June this year, the government announced a further $124 million to increase surveillance for coastal protection. It remains to be seen whether this money will be well spent. Currently, the responsibility for protecting our 37,000-kilometre coastline is shared among a mix of defence and government organisations. This money does little to deter the large number of illegal immigrants also entering our country through our airports. The opposition has been calling for a dedicated coastguard service to patrol Australia's coastline. The message needs to be loud and clear, that is, that we have to tell those smugglers that Australia's coastline is being effectively monitored and that they will be caught. Australia must not be seen as an easy target 
 for illegal immigration and people-smuggling rackets.
Reaction from some members of the public and the media to our support of the changes in legislation was to claim that the new measures were too harsh on illegal immigrants. Some people even accused the legislation of being racially biased. I will give those people some background to those involved in the people-smuggling rackets. The Age reported on 18 November this year that one particular syndicate was offering, for the rate of $12,500, hotel accommodation in Indonesia, transfer to a fishing or cargo vessel and a drop-off point along the Australian northern coast. At $12,500 per person to jump the queue, and boats arriving with more than 300 people on board, there is evidence of a roaring trade in people-smuggling.
There are also departmental reports of illegal immigrants entering the country who have already received refugee status in other countries. The Herald Sun reported on 13 October 1999 that the immigration department had confirmed the case of a woman who had gained refugee status in the United States and then attempted to enter Australia illegally with the aid of the people-smuggling racketeers. I have to say in this House that for once I agree with the minister for immigration. He said in his media release:
. . . for the Government to remind people of the tough new penalties for people smugglers, such as the recent introduction of 20-year jail terms for traffickers and fines of up to $220,000 . . . 
In addition, unauthorised arrivals who are found to be refugees will now be granted a three-year temporary protection visa. People who are not refugees will be sent home as soon as possible.
Other recent measures include legislation introducing tests such as fingerprinting and palm recognition, to ascertain the true identity of asylum seekers and to ensure that they do not already have protection elsewhere . . . 
We will need to implement those words and turn them into very forceful action. I believe that people-smuggling is a most deceitful and unscrupulous trade. The racketeers are feeding off the misery and desperation of people. While people-smuggling rackets continue to thrive, potential migrants and refugees are being pushed further down the government's 
 waiting list. Their wait to be reunited with family members or to start a new life in Australia is being prolonged by others queue- jumping. The rackets are operated by people who generally have little or no respect for Australia's laws or for human dignity, and they are to be condemned. No-one should be sympathising with people smugglers.
Critics of Australia's approach to the issue must realise that Australia does have laws—laws which regulate the flow of migrants into this country. These laws must be upheld and they must not be compromised by the dollar driven profiteers of people-smuggling rackets. Time and time again, I have had meetings with constituents in my electorate who have come to me in tears when their family has been refused entry to Australia or they realise they will have to wait another two or three years for consideration of their particular application.
As you realise, it is very difficult under the points system to have family members reunited in this country, and a lot of them try to see if they qualify for humanitarian and refugee status. In doing so they obey the laws of this country. They are the ones who are being affected the most when these smugglers bring these people to these shores and then we, for one reason or another, grant residence to those people who come to our shores illegally.
It is very difficult to explain it to constituents who abide by the law and virtually feel that they are now being criticised or, more importantly, have not been justified in what they are trying to do correctly. I say to them, and I say to all the other people around this country who have family members overseas with whom they are trying to be reunited, that we—both the government and the opposition—must crack down on these illegal people-smuggling rackets.
I believe also that the message must get across loud and clear to other nations that we in this country will have people come to our country but under our laws and under our invitation, not because someone feels they can make a quick buck and can profiteer from misery and despair. I condemn them for their actions and say to the government that they 
 must keep up the work to make sure that the message is getting around to the other countries very loudly and clearly that we will not tolerate this action any further.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I move:
That the amendment be agreed to.
The objective of the amendment is to ensure that part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 applies to any scheme which would allow a taxpayer to convert an amount of income into a discount capital gain. While the government believes that part IVA would already cover these types of schemes, the amendment will avoid any doubt. The amendment will apply to assessments for the year of income, including 21 September 1999 and later years of income. Following the passage of this amendment and royal assent, the first group of bills implementing the government's landmark business tax reforms will have been passed. The government's business tax reforms have benefited from the input of the Australian business community through the consultations which were part of the Ralph review of business taxation. This has contributed to the new business tax system receiving widespread support within the community.
Following the implementation of the government's reforms, Australia's business tax system will be internationally competitive. It will stimulate investment, economic growth and job creation. Company tax and capital gains tax rates will be lower. Small business and farmers will particularly benefit from the expanded and simplified capital gains tax rollover and retirement exemptions, and the investment in venture capital will also be boosted by the government's capital gains tax reforms. Other reforms announced by the government will be legislated progressively. I am pleased to commend the amendment to the chamber.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise to speak on this message from the Senate in lieu of my colleague the member for Hotham, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow treasurer, who is unfortunately unavoidably detained. He asked me to say a few words about this amendment, which the opposition welcomes because the amendment to the New Business Tax System (Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 1999 reflects the consideration 
 in detail debate held in this House on this bill on 24 November, conducted by the Treasurer and shadow treasurer. It was one of those more unorthodox circumstances in this House in which some of the debate that took place in this parliament actually affected the outcome of the laws of the land. This is not a precedent that executive government necessarily welcomes, but in this instance I think Australian business certainly welcomed the outcome. I congratulate my colleague the shadow treasurer for the negotiation which he undertook overall and, in particular, as it relates to the amendment that is before us today.
As part of the agreement between the government and the opposition on the passage of this bill, the government agreed to amend the general anti-avoidance provisions of the income tax legislation, generally known as part IVA, in order to deal with a potential problem that arises from the government's capital gains tax provisions. The underlying policy objective is to strengthen the current part IVA provisions of the income tax legislation to ensure that schemes entered into which have as their purpose a tax benefit by conversion of income to capital gains should be caught. This measure is necessary because of the potential in some circumstances for a widening of the gap between the effective capital gains tax rate and ordinary marginal tax rates. Of course, there will also be circumstances where the effective capital gains tax rate on investments will rise because of the government's changes, but that is not the situation that this amendment is aimed at.
When there is a widening of the gap there is added incentive to enter into schemes to avoid tax. Accordingly, there needs to be a stronger anti-avoidance measure to deal with such an incentive. The need for this measure has been demonstrated in the evidence before the Senate inquiry into the government's tax package. The government, in our view—and it was the finding of the Senate inquiry—has seriously underestimated what is referred to as the `conversion effect' from introducing the CGT changes without this anti-avoidance measure. They say that it will cost only $20 million in year 1, rising to $180 million in 
 year 5. We cannot know what the actual amount of the leakage will be, but even the government admits there will be some.
Tax experts who came before the inquiry—for example, Professor Rick Krever, who worked on the Ralph review as an expert consultant, Professor Evans and Dr John Edwards—consider these estimates by the government to be ludicrously low. The tax practitioners themselves were very critical of the potential for avoidance that comes from such a measure when the anti-avoidance provisions were not being strengthened. Peter Poulos from KPMG said:
. . . if you are going to have a lower rate of capital gains tax as distinct from ordinary income then you are inviting people to look at trying to structure their affairs so that they can take their profit in a capital form rather than an income form.
Paul McNab from PriceWaterhouse said:
So the government's faced with the possibility that reducing the rate on capital gains might lead to what could be described as domestic avoidance behaviour.
Professor Robert Deutsch from the University of New South Wales said:
It will push the taxpaying community back to trying to turn income into capital where possible.
The Treasurer has accepted the proposal to strengthen part IVA—to plug this hole—resulting in this amendment, which is merely a redraft of the one moved earlier by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is interesting to note that in his letter to the shadow Treasurer on 24 November, the Treasurer said:
I have received advice from the Australian Taxation Office that your proposed integrity measure would not add to the government's proposed strengthening of part 4A.
Consequently, as that `proposed strengthening' is not yet before the House, it is especially appropriate that the House agree to this important measure today. We need to remember that, when addressing the Senate inquiry looking at these issues, senior tax officials stated that it was unclear whether the new part IVA would apply to these conversion schemes. If it does not add to what the government is proposing to do by way of strengthening part IVA, then the opposition is 
 heartened that the government is genuine in its efforts to strengthen part IVA.
Labor welcomes the fact that the government has conceded the need for an effective measure to stop the contrived schemes whereby people would convert their income into capital gains thus, for the purpose of the exercise, attracting a lower rate. (Extension of time granted) We should remember that this amendment on its own will not plug all the business tax revenue holes identified by Labor in this package. Those revenue holes can only be filled by the government doing what it has committed itself to doing—implementing all the measures in full that are not yet before the parliament and doing so in a way that can be demonstrated to reap the revenue which has been estimated in the costings.
The Treasurer has now pledged in writing that the government will introduce all the business tax changes announced in full. We will hold him to that. He cannot afford to be tagged as being any softer on tax avoiders or any softer on the revenue base, particular after his GST deal with the Democrats has shaved the cash surplus to a wafer-thin $500 million. The Treasurer's written guarantee to deliver these measures in full is therefore a crucial concession. It is in that context, and on the basis that the amendment that we are accepting is merely a technical redrafting of the amendment which was initiated and introduced by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we support these amendments.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—Labor fully supports this amendment because it, in fact, reflects accurately one of the three requirements that the opposition applied in relation to its support for the passage of the government's business tax legislation. This particular requirement is one that the government must accept. It is an anti-avoidance amendment specifically directed at the possibility of contrived schemes being entered into to falsely convert income into capital gains and, thereby, for those entering those schemes, to avail themselves of the discount capital gains tax rate, which is a halving of the ordinary personal income tax rate.
Labor is very concerned about any prospect of tax avoidance. It is for that reason that we insisted on this particular amendment because, when that gap between the income tax rate and capital gains tax is opened up, as it is under the business tax legislation, then there must be some potential for avoidance. The issue of the potential for avoidance was the subject of a lot of debate at the Senate inquiry, and no consensus was reached. We were concerned that the projected leakage from what is called either `conversion' or, to use Treasury terminology, `arbitrage', was really dramatically increasing over time to the point where it reached $180 million after the fifth year.
As the member for Fraser has pointed out, there was a range of experts who regarded that estimate of leakage as very low. So it was critically important that Labor initiate an action which resulted in an anti-avoidance provision relating specifically to the capital gains tax. That provision was drafted by former Taxation Commissioner Trevor Boucher working with me and the deputy opposition leader. The Treasurer pointed out that he believed there were some minor amendments to that which would make it operative and more effective. We accepted those minor amendments, and they are now reflected in the amendments that have come from the Senate.
It is interesting that, when we asked the tax office officials in this inquiry whether in fact the general anti-avoidance rules that were in place and, more specifically, the ones that were proposed and contained in a one-page statement, related to the capital gains tax, they replied that it was unclear. That was really quite a worry for us because it is not clear what the government's new general anti-avoidance rules will contain. Basically, there is a precis in a one-page document, but it is absolutely unclear to us as to what it will actually do. We do, however, accept in good faith the government's word that it will be bringing forward tougher anti-avoidance rules in legislation next year.
After all, that is absolutely critical because the criterion that we applied in relation to our acceptance of the passage of this legislation 
 is that the whole package be revenue neutral. The government said it would, in fact, bring forward the stage 2 measures and implement those. Again, we have accepted the government's word on that. If this tax package is not revenue neutral, then the heat will come on to education and health in subsequent budgets. We do not want to see that happen, and that is why we are insisting on this amendment and fully support it.",REPS,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (INTEGRITY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—This is an important Labor amendment to the government's business tax reform package. It is important because one of Labor's stated and fundamental preconditions for the passage of the Ralph legislation is that the anti-avoidance measures contained within the legislation be as robust as possible. Anti-avoidance is important not just because it is a question of fundamental taxation justice but in addition because of our overall concern about the overall revenue neutrality of the package as a whole.
This Boucher amendment is designed specifically to strengthen the provisions of part IVA of the act. Mr Boucher, the former Tax Commissioner, is no slouch on questions of anti-avoidance. He is a gentleman who takes this matter seriously.
—Boucher's no sloucher!
—Boucher, as my colleague the member for Rankin notes from these benches, is no sloucher. His language was put forward to the Treasurer and, subject to some deliberation on the part of the Senate, it has come back to us in the form of the language contained in the current amendment, which is acceptable to the opposition. This exercise demonstrates what constructive opposition can be all about, and we have taken that responsibility most seriously.
The Senate inquiry, recently concluded, into certain aspects of the business taxation package has also dealt with the specific issue of anti-avoidance and arbitrage in some detail. There is a specific recognition of this problem in the Ralph report itself. In the printed text of the Ralph report, there is a recognition that losses to revenue of $20 million, occurring as a consequence of arbitrage between income and capital gains, would occur in the first 
 year, but rising most seriously—at their admission, in their numbers—to $180 million in year 5. That is a total of some $500 million in revenue lost to the Commonwealth as a consequence of arbitrage activities over five years. Again, I emphasise these are the government's own figures. We are talking about those which the Treasury prefers as opposed to the commentary which has come from beyond the Treasury which has been highly critical of these assumptions.
In looking briefly at some of the commentary on this question which has been referred to in the Senate committee report, we look at the observations of Professor Chris Evans. I will quote from page 32 of the Senate report because I think it is instructive to the debate. The report says:
Professor Chris Evans addressed the issue of conversion of income to capital in his submission to the committee and noted that it seemed `highly contentious' that the arbitrage effect related to the conversion of income to capital would be as low as $500 million over five years. He pointed out that there was very little detail in the Ralph Report to show how the figures were arrived at. He assumed that the figure was based entirely on the increased incentive for shareholders to realise capital gains on shares rather than to receive the income as dividends. He therefore concluded that the Ralph Report figures did not include the impact upon PAYE receipts.
That is a most significant observation from Professor Chris Evans and creates some of the basis on which we as a constructive opposition acted in proposing the amendment which we have put forward. Professor Krever also in the Senate committee report has noted in his evidence the additional potential impact of Australia's negative gearing regime, noting that the majority of overseas countries with which this package has been compared do not allow for such a negative gearing regime.
In fact, when you look at the overall implications for revenue and you take both these sets of measures together—that is, the questionable level of realisations from the changes in the capital gains tax regime, which has been the subject of considerable debate in this chamber, as well as doubts over the leakage arising from the conversion of income to capital—there is in fact the beginnings of the emergence of a significant problem in terms 
 of the overall revenue neutrality of the package. Again, it is worth reflecting on some of Professor Evans's observations on page 30 of the report where he submitted that:
. . . by varying the assumptions about responsiveness of CGT realisations to changes in the CGT rate (and by adopting different assumptions about the propensity of taxpayers to convert highly taxed income to preferentially taxed capital gains) very different revenue outcomes are achieved.
A sensitivity analysis has been conducted which shows that over the five year period covered by the Review, the estimates of the small (positive) revenue impact of $350 million could be transformed (in a worst case scenario) to a very significant revenue leakage of up to $5.5 billion.
These observations and conclusions of the Senate report demonstrate the wisdom of this amendment moved by the Labor Party and why we support it.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I have listened with interest to the contributions made by honourable members opposite. I do, however, want to point out that this is not an important amendment as the government believes that the existing part IVA already covers the types of schemes about which concern has been expressed. However, having said that, the amendment does indeed remove any possible doubt and it does strengthen to that extent the proceedings, but the government is of the view that those schemes are already covered by the existing part IVA. The realities of politics are that, to get the business tax reform through the Senate, it was necessary to have discussions with the opposition. As a result, we are supporting this amendment in this chamber.

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—Two weeks ago when I was speaking on the Crimes at Sea Bill 1999  I highlighted the treatment of many foreign crews and their pay and working conditions as an international scandal and made the point that this could be solved only by a concerted international response. Australia can begin by immediately ratifying ILO 147. ILO 147 is a broad convention covering wages, working conditions, certification, training and health, which are vital to the welfare and rights of international seafarers. We could do that without this particular legislation we are talking about—it would only add to this. It is a scandal that Australia, having taken the lead in exposing substandard shipping, has not ratified this international convention on a mere technicality.
Although supporting the legislation in the main—and I am not sure whether or not we will proceed with our amendment because while we were speaking on the legislation a government amendment was circulated, picking up the points that were concerning the Labor Party—the legislation will have little impact on international seafarers, and to prove this I started to highlight the example of the Glory Cape. The Glory Cape is a vessel that loaded iron ore and departed Port Hedland on 31 October 1995. On the night of the departure, five of the crew members who were Indonesian were attacked by officers and other crew of that vessel. There had been a dispute over non-payment of wages, which often happens on these vessels. The five Indonesians had sought the assistance of the International Transport Federation and the Australian Maritime Union in Port Hedland in obtaining their underpayment and unpaid wages.
At about 2.30 in the morning of 31 October 1995 the radio operator, Budi Santose, was held by Chinese cooks while he was beaten with iron bars by the Korean officers. Ulti 
 mately, he managed to escape. According to the depositions from the crew that I have read and an affidavit sworn at Dampier on 3 November 1999, there were a number of altercations and brutal beatings. The five crew members went over the side with lifebelts, spent the night at sea and were rescued the following morning at daybreak by local authorities. The radio operator, Santose, died in the water. What really happened was that he was murdered by the Korean officers of the Glory Cape—a crime in anyone's language. This is only one example of what is happening in international shipping in Australian waters.
For too long, because of the mishmash of laws—for example, it was claimed in the Glory Cape incident that it was a matter for the Western Australian police and, incidentally, there has still been no coroner's report—criminal activities are still going unpunished. Although this bill seeks to extend the criminal jurisdiction of the Australian states beyond Australian coastal waters to the limit of the continental shelf and beyond so as to provide a legal basis for more effective control over crimes at sea, it seems it will have little impact on crimes such as those committed on the Glory Cape. Incidentally, the Glory Cape avoided Australia for some time after the Port Hedland incident but, having changed its name to CD Glory, has in recent months been back in Australian waters once more.
Although supportive of this crimes at sea legislation, I must in all honesty say that it does not help the seafarers. Access of foreign seafarers to Australian civil law is always difficult. Take, for example, the Glory Cape. No-one has been charged. The seafarer who has been aggrieved has great difficulty in getting access to the domestic legal situation. This is even more difficult if he is a seafarer from a Third World country. The legislation will clarify some issues and it will make it easier to sort out problems. But, as I say, it will do nothing for the seafarers from the Third World.
No longer should foreign shipping corporations be permitted to evade their international moral obligations for safety at sea and treatment of crew. This is a bill to give Australia 
 a `modern crimes at sea' scheme. The increasing incidence of people smuggling in the last year has highlighted the importance of having an effective legal regime to govern the seas around Australia's coastline. It is interesting that for many years there have been horrendous crimes committed against foreign nationals mainly from Third World countries on ships within Australian waters, and nothing has been done. It was not until people smuggling started to concern middle Australia that anything was done.
This bill complements the important measures that the government has announced in the coastal surveillance context, but we as a parliament must make it easier for seafarers to gain access to Australian domestic law. Only then can we start to address the real meaning of crimes at sea. In this regard, it was very disappointing that the government response did not agree with recommendation 14 of the Ship Safe report presented to the Australian parliament in August 1998, with the unanimous support of all sides of parliament that served on the transport committee. Had that recommendation been picked up, it would have given seafarers from the Third World in many cases through organisations such as Stella Maris, a mission to the seamen, better access to Australian domestic law. That is really what is happening: seafarers from the Third World are not getting access to Australian domestic law for crimes committed against them within Australian domestic law jurisdiction. Until we start dealing with this problem, there will be no justice for so many people who have been aggrieved in Australian domestic waters.",REPS,<title>CRIMES AT SEA BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—Australia has one of the longest and most isolated coastlines in the world. With 37,000 kilometres of coastline and nine million square kilometres of ocean within our jurisdiction, there is a myriad issues to be considered and covered by legislation—matters of border protection, coastal surveillance, fisheries, illegal immigration, customs, quarantine, defence and the like. These issues are of particular concern to Western Australia with our vast coastline, a sparsely populated coastline, and where the majority of unauthor 
 ised sea landings occur, where the majority of unauthorised arrivals occur and where the incidence of both has increased dramatically over the past decade.
Given the recent initiatives of this government in relation to illegal immigration, one could assume that the impetus for the Crimes at Sea Bill 1999  is the current incidence of people smuggling and illegal entry, as well as the difficulties we face in enforcing laws over foreign ships outside our coastal waters. In fact, it is part of an overall approach to ensure that our maritime enforcement legislation implements fully the powers available under international law, including the maritime investigatory powers and enforcement powers against both Australian ships and vessels registered under the law of a foreign country. This bill will replace the Crimes at Sea Act 1979. Under that act, we already have legislative provisions that deal with crimes at sea, together with complementary state legislation in most states which apply state criminal law to Australian ships, Australian citizens and foreign ships in connection with crimes committed at sea.
This bill seeks to enact the Commonwealth elements of a new cooperative scheme agreed to by the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory to provide a regime of criminal law applicable in Australia's coastal seas and, in certain circumstances, beyond the coastal seas. While it is true that the increasing incidence of people smuggling in recent times has highlighted the importance of a requirement for efficient and effective legal regimes to govern the seas around Australia's coastline, this bill is necessary to fix the defects in the existing regime governing crimes at sea. It is timely that it comes as part of a number of important measures that the government has introduced in relation to coastal surveillance, illegal immigration and illegal entry vessels.
To digress for a moment, on the last occasion that this bill was before the House the previous speakers from the opposition benches ignored the fact that the government had foreshadowed an amendment to the bill prior to the commencement of the debate. That amendment was to omit part 4 of the bill and 
 the reference to the Australian-Indonesian zone of cooperation. If one had listened to the remarks of the member for Denison in particular, one could have been forgiven for assuming that he had not been made aware of the foreshadowed amendments. Given the sensitivities of the Timor Gap Treaty and the issue under international law of the successor party to the rights of Indonesia under the treaty pending the emergence of East Timor as an independent nation, it was a particularly disappointing piece of political posturing by the opposition. It was fortuitous that the timing of the debate was such that the member for Hughes was able to indicate to the House before the debate was adjourned that the government had responsibly, sensibly and appropriately foreshadowed an amendment to omit part 4 of the bill.
The existing legal regime in relation to Australia's jurisdiction over its seas is complex. Ambiguities and anomalies abound, and currently there are inconsistencies between various state laws and Commonwealth laws as they might apply to customs and migration issues and crimes at sea. Perhaps one of the more interesting aspects of my research into this bill concerns the various sources of power for Australia's maritime jurisdiction—somewhat complex but interesting. The original source of power in Australia to cover crimes at sea was derived from the British Admiralty jurisdiction, the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878, which gave jurisdiction over persons on British ships anywhere, including jurisdiction over foreign subjects on board British ships. This jurisdiction was incorporated into the Australian colonies, but its limitations were—self-evidently perhaps—that the jurisdiction was attached to the concept of a British ship, which all Australian ships were considered to be for the purposes of the act.
This anomaly gave rise to numerous judicial statements. Perhaps the most notable is that of Chief Justice Barwick in the case Reg. v. Bull in 1974, reported in the Commonwealth Law Reports 131 at 203, where he said:
It is anomalous that the distinction between the jurisdiction of the Admiral in respect of the high seas, and that of the courts of law, should be maintained as it is at present. It is highly incon 
 venient that in a matter of criminal jurisdiction complexities disclosed in this case should remain. It is also inappropriate at this time that, on the one hand, the power of a court of Australia to try extra territorial offences should be derived by imperial legislation, and on the other hand that such a court should have jurisdiction to try persons for imperial offences committed anywhere on high seas, or where the Admiral has jurisdiction.
Chief Justice Barwick acknowledged that there was room for a more specific investiture of state courts with a jurisdiction to try federal offences committed on the high seas. Such judicial comments, together with other issues arising at the time, led to new Commonwealth legislation. A separate Australian nationality and registration scheme was implemented under the Shipping Registration Act 1981 which overcame the concept of the British ship, but the anomaly still remained. The substantive criminal law, applicable under the Admiralty jurisdiction, was English law, with the curious result that offences committed off the shores of the Australian states had to be laid under British legislation, not the criminal laws of the relevant states.
There were also diverging views about the common law and its application to the territorial or extraterritorial seas. Over time, the issues of jurisdiction over crimes at sea increased amid the growing interest in the exploitation of offshore natural resources and the exercise of exploration and mining rights offshore under international law. International law recognised sovereignty, sovereign rights and certain powers over offshore waters, but there was uncertainty as to how the powers could be exercised in Australia as the issue of sovereignty had not been resolved as between the Commonwealth and the states. So we had international law recognising Australian sovereignty over internal waters and territorial seas and sovereign rights over the continental shelf.
Commonwealth legislation emerged in the 1970s to address the complexities and conflicts in the state and Commonwealth laws. The Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 asserted `for the Commonwealth, territorial sovereignty over the territorial sea and sovereign rights over the continental shelf'. The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act extended 
 Commonwealth control over offshore petroleum exploration and extraction by extending the limits over the adjacent areas. So, while the states arguably retained their extraterritorial jurisdiction under common law, negotiations commenced between the Commonwealth and the states as to their powers and responsibilities, and these negotiations resulted in the Crimes at Sea Act 1979. This attempted to overcome the defects in the Admiralty jurisdiction and the ambiguity surrounding the common law. No doubt the Commonwealth was prompted by the various judicial comments regarding the source of power, which Barwick had described as `inappropriate' and the Privy Council later described as `surprising'.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—Before the dinner break I was reminding the House of the forerunner to the Crimes at Sea Bill 1999 : the Crimes at Sea Act 1979. With complementary state legislation, that act formally applied state criminal law to the limit of the territorial sea and, beyond that limit, to the limit of the adjacent area for foreign ships en route to Australia. The act also extended the jurisdiction to crimes of piracy and crimes pertaining to exploration of the continental shelf.
The Crimes at Sea Act 1979 focused on acts by Australian citizens, acts aboard Australian ships and acts aboard foreign ships outside the territorial sea where the offender entered Australia. However, the Crimes at Sea Act has proven to be somewhat complicated and confusing. First, the identification of jurisdiction has been difficult. The law to be applied to foreign ships depended on the ship's first port of call in Australia. The law to be applied to Australian ships depended on their registration, regardless of where the offences occurred. This led to potentially anomalous results. For example, an offence committed on an Australian ship registered in Victoria would have to be tried under the law in that state, regardless of whether the offence occurred elsewhere—such as off the coast of Western Australia.
Secondly, the complementary state legislation introduced at the same time as the 
 Crimes at Sea Act 1979 was considered to be invalid because it was inconsistent with the imperial legislation that I referred to earlier—the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878. We of course remember that the states did not acquire a power to enact laws overriding imperial legislation until the passage of the Australia Act 1986. So the overall existing scheme under the Crimes at Sea Act 1979 was, and is, inconvenient for law enforcement. This is essentially because the law that applies to a crime at sea depends upon the state with which the vessel is connected and that is usually the state in which the vessel is registered. This body of law is `carried', if you like, by the vessel. So, even if a state has no relationship with the place at which an offence occurs, that law must be applied.
The existing scheme has also proven increasingly inconvenient for law enforcement with the increasing traffic on the seas and around our coast because the unfamiliar law of one state must be applied by the law enforcement agency of another state that is investigating the matter. It is also increasingly ineffective due to an absence of intergovernmental arrangements settling the responsibility for enforcement action. Under the proposed new scheme, the applicable law would therefore be determined on the basis of geography. A single body of law will apply in each sea area of the states and the Northern Territory out to 200 miles or the continental shelf—whichever is greater. This body of law will apply as state law to 12 nautical miles and be applied as Commonwealth law beyond that point.
The underlying simplicity of the new choice of law rule based upon geography ensures that much of the ambiguity and complexity of the existing scheme is removed. In my example, where a crime—or alleged crime—is committed off the coast of Western Australia, the police investigating it will do so according to Western Australian laws and procedures and not those of the state under which the ship was registered, as is currently the case. If the offences are both a state offence and a Commonwealth offence, the investigating authority will follow the more stringent regime or procedures.
The key issue for this legislation is the power to enforce criminal laws. The source of Australia's enforcement jurisdiction can be found in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This convention came into force in November 1994 and follows the principle of customary international law that each country has jurisdiction over ships that sail by its flag. So every country may exercise powers over its own ships anywhere in the world, except in the territorial sea of another country.
The convention does provide exceptions, depending on the maritime zone a ship is in. I think it is useful in the context of considering the enforcement aspects of this bill to take into account those exceptions to the basic principle of international law, particularly as the member for Throsby is so concerned about the extent of our enforcement powers and how this fits with the regime to be introduced. Under this convention, Australia has full territorial sovereignty to the limits of the `internal waters'—meaning the enforcement jurisdiction is absolute. So Australia can enforce laws on any issue within its internal waters, including criminal law. For example, it can arrest any person or investigate any recognised crimes committed within the internal waters, that being the waters on the landward side of the territorial baseline—that is, the low-water line along the coast.
Under the convention, Australia has a more restricted sovereignty to the limits of the territorial sea—that is, the waters extending for 12 nautical miles from the territorial baseline. Within the territorial sea, enforcement is subject to the right of innocent passage. Australia can make laws relating to the innocent passage of foreign ships in terms of conservation, fisheries, customs and drug trafficking, but it can only arrest persons or investigate crimes on board these ships passing through the territorial sea where the consequence of the crime extends to Australia or where the crime is of a kind such as to disturb the peace of the country or the good order of the territorial sea or it is directed to the drug trade. Australia can exercise a complete criminal jurisdiction over foreign ships passing through the territorial seas after 
 leaving the internal waters. It can also exercise a complete jurisdiction over foreign ships for crimes committed beyond the territorial sea—but only after the vessel has entered the internal waters.
Beyond the territorial sea, a state has certain sovereign rights which it may exercise to the contiguous zone. Within this zone, which extends from the 12-nautical-mile mark to 24 nautical miles from the territorial baseline, Australia can exercise the control necessary to prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within Australia or our territorial seas or to punish infringement of these laws and regulations committed within Australia or our territorial sea. A smaller set of rights applies to the edge of the exclusive economic zone. That is 200 nautical miles from the territorial baseline where Australia can exercise a limited criminal jurisdiction while exercising sovereign rights to explore, exploit, conserve and manage the living resources in the exclusive economic zone. We can exercise powers of arrest and detention of foreign vessels for violations of fisheries laws and regulations, but we cannot imprison persons without specific agreement with the flag state—that is, the ship's country of registration.
Altogether, with the new regime envisaged by this bill, our enforcement powers will be extensive. In summary, the centrepiece of the bill is a cooperative scheme which extends the criminal jurisdiction of the Australian states beyond the Australian coastal waters to the limits of the continental shelf and beyond so as to provide the legal basis for more effective control over crimes at sea. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CRIMES AT SEA BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I speak tonight on the Crimes at Sea Bill 1999 . We know that this bill seeks to replace the existing Crimes at Sea Act 1979, which at present makes enforcing crimes committed at sea complicated and confusing. To some extent, the Crimes at Sea Bill will simplify the application of law enforcement in our seas. It is specifically designed to implement a national uniform scheme which ensures that the criminal laws of states, the Commonwealth 
 and territories are applied in a cooperative manner.
Under this bill, state criminal laws are to apply where a crime is committed at sea within a distance of up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline of that state. In fact, the state has jurisdiction over any issue, not just criminal law, within its internal waters. For crimes committed beyond 12 nautical miles up to a distance of 200 nautical miles or the outer limit of the continental shelf, whichever is the greater distance, Commonwealth criminal law is to apply.
In addition, where certain criminal acts are committed outside the new scheme's coverage—that is, outside the continental shelf—the bill will apply the Jervis Bay territory criminal law to those acts. Jervis Bay territory criminal law will be able to be applied in three situations: (1) if a crime is committed on any Australian ship up to the point of the high seas or the territorial waters of any foreign country; (2) if a crime is committed by an Australian on a foreign ship who is not a member of the crew up to the point of high seas or the territorial waters of that country; and (3) if a crime has been committed on a foreign ship which first lands at an Australian port. It must be noted that Jervis Bay territory criminal law will not apply to an offence which occurs in the territorial waters of Norfolk Island covered by the Territorial Waters Act 1926 of Norfolk Island, or coastal seas in the territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Australian Antarctic Territory, Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, Ashmore and Cartier islands and the Coral Sea Islands territory, covered by the Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
It is also important to note that a charge for an offence that arises under Jervis Bay territory criminal law is not able to proceed unless the Attorney-General consents in writing to the hearing and determination of the charge. Before granting consent, the Attorney-General must take into account any views expressed by the government of a country other than Australia whose jurisdiction over the alleged offence is recognised under the principles of international law. Further, if the Attorney- 
 General declines to grant consent, the court in which the suspect, the defender, has been charged must permanently stay proceedings on the charge. In these cases, the procedural rules for investigating and prosecuting offences will be the same as those applying to any other offence under Commonwealth law.
This arrangement and intergovernmental agreement will simplify the process of determining investigative procedures and jurisdictions to deal with offences effectively. It is important to have recorded in this House that crimes of a serious nature committed at sea such as theft, assault and murder are adequately covered by the bill.
I turn for a moment to the member for Hughes's comments in relation to part 4 of the bill when she spoke in this House on 25 November last. Part 4, as we know, deals with cooperation between Australia and Indonesia in the enforcement of criminal laws on any oil rig, or any criminal act committed which is associated with petroleum exploration and extraction within area A. The reason for my opposition to part 4 of the bill is that those sections pertaining to area A were formerly based on Australia's obligations under the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation Treaty. Area A was determined in an agreement with Indonesia and Australia in 1989.
The government was prepared to shamelessly ask the Australian parliament to acknowledge and reaffirm Indonesia's sovereignty in the Timor Gap, until my colleague the member for Denison pointed out to the government the inappropriate nature of supporting this section of the legislation. I further note that it was only today that the foreign affairs minister told this House that Indonesia has confirmed that it is no longer a party to the Timor Gap treaty, meaning that part 4 must be amended if the legislation is to work at all. That is a good thing.
I wish to state that I categorically oppose part 4 and sections 7, 8 and 9 of the bill as they now are, in the light of recent international events between Indonesia and East Timor. The government's lack of sensitivity in tabling this bill for debate at a time of crisis in the newly independent East Timor and displayed throughout this bill is appalling. 
 I find it extraordinary that, when the bill was originally introduced on 30 September 1999, a month after the ballot for independence in East Timor occurred, the member for Hughes would say in her speech:
The government decided to remove part 4 well before the unhelpful intervention of the member for Denison.
The member for Hughes has been ill advised. I do not blame the member for Hughes because she is quite a lovely lady; she also has a lovely husband, Bob. But I am not here to speak about that. Rather, I think she has been badly advised in this particular case. I will just go through, for the benefit of the House, a chronology of events I have been able to obtain from the shadow minister for justice and customs, the member for Denison, the Hon. Duncan Kerr.
On 30 September 1999, the Attorney-General introduced the bill into this House; that was one month after the East Timor ballot. On 15 October, the opposition drafted its amendments to oppose part 4 of the bill. About 18 October, Senator Vanstone's office advised the opposition of the government's proposed amendments and provided a confidential copy which described the amendments as having arisen `because OPC have identified a number of minor language differences between the Commonwealth bill and corresponding legislation in the model state legislation'. Those amendments did not touch the Timor Gap issue.
Then, on 21 October, the bill was scheduled for debate. However, the House adjourned until 22 November without debate on the bill having resumed. On 11 November, we received a draft weekly program for this House which listed the bill for debate on Wednesday, 24 November. On the morning of 23 November, Senator Vanstone's office contacted the office of the member for Denison to see if the opposition had any problem with the bill. In the afternoon, the opposition indicated to Senator Vanstone's office that, yes, we had problems with part 4 and that we would be moving amendments to oppose same.
Later on the evening of the 23rd, Senator Vanstone's office delivered an advance copy 
 of unrelated bills to be introduced into the House the next morning. Duncan Kerr's office asked what was the minister's view regarding part 4. I want to make this quite clear: the government indicated that there may be a government amendment to omit provisions in part 4 and that drafting was in progress. The opposition insisted that it was still opposing part 4 and that it would be pressing on with the amendment to that effect.
Duncan Kerr's office had a clear understanding that it would hear from Senator Vanstone's office the next morning to put their heads together and discuss this. The opposition also asked further whether the bill would remain listed for debate and suggested it may be sensible to delay its consideration until the new year. The government replied that it remained listed for debate and that there was a slim chance it would come back on Wednesday but more likely Thursday of that week.
On Wednesday, 24 November at about 1.30 p.m., having not heard from Senator Vanstone's office, the shadow minister was quite entitled to hold a doorstop interview and then put out a press release about this matter. For the benefit of the House, I will read that press release:
""The Howard Government has again displayed an astounding level of bad timing and political and diplomatic insensitivity in respect of East Timor,"" Duncan Kerr, [Shadow] Minister for Justice and Customs, said today.
It continues:
The Crimes at Sea Bill, which the Government introduced in the Parliament on 30 September—a month after East Timor's ballot, was listed for debate this week.
The timing of the introduction of this legislation has meant that the Shadow Ministry has had no choice but to oppose a significant part of the Bill which, based on Australia's obligations under the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation Treaty, provides for cooperation between Australia and Indonesia in the enforcement of criminal law in the Timor Gap.
By introducing this legislation when it did, and then listing it for debate, the Government is asking the Australian Parliament to acknowledge and re-affirm Indonesia's sovereignty in the Timor Gap.
This is extraordinary given that Indonesia has formally renounced control of East Timor. 

That the Government introduced this Bill during East Timor's struggle for independence is hard enough to fathom. It almost defies belief that now, when Minister Vanstone has had almost two months to realise the possible ramifications of the Bill, is listed for debate today without amendment.
My office asked the Minister to reconsider the timing of debate on this Bill. In good faith and in Australia's best interest, we pointed out to the Minister that it is not appropriate to be passing legislation which could be cited as an Australian acknowledgment of a continuing Indonesian claim to parts of the Timor Gap.
Minister Vanstone neither accepted this advice in the spirit it was given, nor was able to understand the political and diplomatic sensitivities involved.
The Government has demonstrated that it is sloppy, politically insensitive and just plain dopey if it really expects the Australian Parliament, at this point in time, to pass legislation which would reaffirm Australian recognition of Indonesian sovereignty in the Timor Gap.
This can only be described as a first-rate stuff-up. It is bound to embarrass Prime Minister Howard when he visits East Timor this weekend.""
Mr Slipper interjecting—
—The member for Fisher, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, who is at the table, is obviously not listening to what I am saying. I am just setting the record straight for this House. The member for Hughes—it was no fault of hers—had the foreshadowed amendments stuck under her nose when she was speaking on Thursday, 25 November. I was in the chamber and I think it was by the Chief Government Whip. That was only after the member for Denison had made it quite plain that we on this side of the House were not going to cooperate unless something was done in relation to part 4 of the bill.
I have carefully gone through that chronology for the benefit of the member for Fisher. If he wants to have a discussion about it, I will be more than happy to go along with him to Duncan Kerr's office and take him through it, because Senator Vanstone badly let down the government and badly let down the member for Hughes who innocently misrepresented the situation to the House. Duncan Kerr was quite within his rights to give a doorstop at 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, the 24th when he had not heard anything 
 more from Senator Vanstone's office about the foreshadowed amendment from this side of the House.
I am pleased to learn now that the government is moving that way and will be doing something about it, after the member for Denison brought it to the attention of the House. It will have the support of all of us on this side of the House. Enough said about that; I support the foreshadowed amendment to be moved by the member for Denison in terms of part 4.
I would now like to digress in the remaining minutes to discuss the current public scrutiny over the issue of people-smuggling and illegal arrivals in Australian territorial waters. I note that, in her speech on 30 September, the member for Murray talked about the increasing incidence of `people-smuggling' highlighting the importance of having an `effective legal regime to govern the seas around Australia's coastline'.
It is my opinion that the resolution of current issues faced by Australia, such as protecting and reducing illegal activities in our territorial waters, should include: firstly and most importantly, establishing an Australian coastguard; secondly, increasing funding for the Australian Customs Service; and, thirdly, creating one overarching piece of legislation written specifically to deal with the protection of our borders, our waters and our activities within this area.
The member for Murray should not be marketing this bill as a measure against people-smuggling. This is yet another case of the government using rank political opportunism to gather support for a bill that is fundamentally flawed in this respect. The difficulty with the argument of this bill as a measure against people-smuggling is that of transnational organised crime. While the bill encourages states to fully exercise their jurisdiction, the bill does not enable states to exceed their jurisdiction under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Under this bill, states will be encouraged to exercise personal jurisdiction rather than the prescribed physical jurisdiction—which, I might add, is how the bill is supposed to operate—over any of their vessels engaged in people-smuggling.
The member for Murray might also wish to note that the application of this legislation to the case of people-smuggling will create only confusion because there are already measures in place in the  Border Protection Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 , which was passed by this House on 22 November and was a debate that I participated in. Adequate amendments were made to the Customs Act and the Migration Act to deal with some of the problems faced in policing 11 million square kilometres of water.
I believe this bill displays a great deal of merit in that it simplifies the procedures and jurisdictions of courts over prescribed areas. The bill also clearly amends some defects in existing crimes at sea legislation. I believe that the bill represents a genuine attempt to meet the new challenges faced by state and federal authorities in fighting criminal activity on our territorial seas. As the member for Denison said in his speech in this House on 25 November, this is a complex issue, for which finding a solution has been problematic. Apart from part 4 as it now stands, I have no hesitation in supporting the bill. It seems obvious now that the government are going to make the appropriate amendments, and I will acknowledge that in the House—even for the benefit of the member for Fisher—because it is a good thing, and I am sure he agrees with it.
—But we told Duncan Kerr earlier.
—You did not, actually.
—Order!
—Madam Deputy Speaker, the member for Fisher is quite wrong and he persists in interjecting. We can demonstrate quite clearly from the communication between Senator Vanstone's office and Duncan Kerr's office that, on this occasion, we are being misrepresented. I stand by Duncan Kerr's press release of 24 November because he was entitled to put that out when Senator Vanstone's office had failed to come back to him and to let us know that they shared our concerns about part 4 of the bill.
In conclusion, I want to congratulate the member for Denison. He has obviously done a terrific job in relation to that part of the bill that we had some concerns about, and the government, to its credit, has come to the party and will now, through the committee process, deal with this so that, when it comes back to the House, the appropriate amendments will be made and we will be able to get the outcome we on both sides of the House want. I salute the member for Denison for doing a good job on this one.
—And the government!
—I will reluctantly congratulate the government on getting it right. It is a good thing that we can sometimes work together and get a good outcome for the benefit of all who are affected by this legislation. It has been very complex and difficult to deal with. As the member for Denison mentioned some time ago, its genesis goes way back, well before the government came in.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I would also like to mention the bipartisan support that has been shown. The previous speaker, the member for Lowe, was quite correct to acknowledge that support. It is a rare thing, but it has been happening in the last few days. Tonight, though, I speak on the Crimes at Sea Bill 1999 , which was introduced on 30 September. The bill seeks to extend the criminal jurisdiction of the Australian states beyond Australian coastal waters to the limits of the continental shelf and beyond so as to provide a legal basis for more effective control over crimes at sea. It will give effect to a cooperative scheme developed by the Commonwealth and state and territory governments over crimes at sea within the adjacent area and to a complementary regime developed by the Commonwealth government over crimes at sea beyond the adjacent area. A regime agreed to by the Commonwealth and Indonesian governments for dealing with crimes at sea within area A of the Timor Gap—as the previous speaker alluded to—has also been considered.
There is some background to this crimes at sea legislation, and it is important to highlight some of that background. The Commonwealth 
 already had some legislation in place with crimes at sea in the Crimes at Sea Act 1979. It also had complementary legislation in most states, which applies state criminal law to Australian ships, Australian citizens and foreign ships in respect of crimes committed at sea. However, the legislative regime does have defects and was the target of a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission nearly a decade ago. The defects were examined in the context of a discussion of Australia's jurisdiction over crimes at sea.
People-smuggling has increased in recent times, which probably has been the catalyst for this bill being brought to the attention of the House. It is an insidious thing. One has to look at people-smuggling in its contextual scenery. We may think we have a difficult problem. Recently I spoke to some members and officials of the Italian government who complained to me that they had 1,000 people smuggling from Albania to Italy. So, in the scheme of things, they thought that we had a relatively small problem. I guess we should be happy that our problem is not as extensive. Nevertheless, it is not something that should be ignored, and there has been an increase in people-smuggling.
Sea landings and unauthorised arrivals in Australia have been particularly noticeable since those first landings on 12 April 1999 when an undetected landing went as far as the east coast of Australia. This has led to a number of positive things emerging, including a coastal surveillance task force. It reported in June 1999. It noted that current maritime enforcement legislation does not fully implement the powers available under international law. On 27 June 1999 the Prime Minister indicated that the government would implement all the recommendations in the report and announced a commitment of $124 million over four years to strengthen Australia's capacity to detect and detain these illegal arrivals.
International people-smuggling has become a hot topic, not just for Australia but for many countries. It has received the attention of various international bodies and people, including the General Assembly, the Secretary-General, the Economic and Social 
 Council and the International Maritime Organisation. It is the subject of a proposed protocol to a draft international convention on the control of transnational organised crime. The common theme here is that nation states are being urged to look at their own domestic legislative powers to establish jurisdiction over people-smuggling offences and to focus that more carefully.
In relation to jurisdiction over crimes at sea, it is very important to note that a distinction should be drawn between Australia's prescriptive jurisdiction and its enforcement jurisdiction. This prescriptive jurisdiction is where common law gives the Commonwealth and the states power to enact laws having an extraterritorial effect. The Constitution also gives the Commonwealth a power to enact laws with respect to matters that are external to Australia. Whether or not these laws are enforced, though, is yet another issue. Enforcement jurisdiction looks at international law which gives Australia a physical jurisdiction to enforce its laws within a prescribed distance of its coast arising out of its territorial sovereignty and sovereign rights. This has been recognised in international law. It also recognises a personal jurisdiction to enforce laws upon its own citizens or ships arising out of the nexus between a sovereign nation and its citizens.
A distinction needs to be made among the various jurisdictional zones recognised under domestic and international law. This guide is given by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A number of speakers have spoken about that here today. Internal waters are waters on the landward side of the territorial baseline. There are also territorial seas, which are waters within 12-nauticalmiles of the territorial baseline. The contiguous zone is waters from 12 to 24 nautical miles. There are a number of exclusive economic zones, which are waters behind 12 nautical miles and within 200 nautical miles of the territorial baseline. The continental shelf is the seabed and subsoil up to 350 nautical miles or as agreed between two state parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
These particular regions did not always exist in international law and they were not always reflected in domestic law. At common 
 law it was widely thought that the territorial sea was limited to three nautical miles, and it was not until 1990 that Australia formally incorporated the 12-nautical-mile limit into domestic law. Much of our law is very historical and deals with things such as Admiralty jurisdiction which goes as far back as 1878 and deals with British ships and their jurisdiction over foreign subjects on board British ships. Common law also has a large part to play in the development of this legislation. The first view was that Australian states have power to enact laws having an extraterritorial effect.
I have to say that it is a good thing that we are looking at this legislation, particularly Australia's enforcement jurisdiction with full sovereignty to the limit of internal waters and a much more restrictive sovereignty to the limits of territorial water. It is very important that we look at sovereign rights, which may be exercised to the edge of the contiguous zone, and the smaller set of rights applying to the edge of the exclusive economic zone which is reduced further within the continental shelf and the non-existent high seas. Within the territorial sea, enforcement is subject to the right of innocent passage and foreign ships often have the right to passage through territorial water that is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal state. The state may exercise its criminal jurisdiction to arrest people or investigate crimes on board these ships passing through territorial seas where the consequences of the crime extend to the state, where the crime is of a kind to disturb the peace of the country or the good order of the territorial sea or if such measures are necessary for the suppression of illicit trade in narcotic drugs or substances. It may also exercise complete criminal jurisdiction over foreign ships passing through territorial seas after leaving internal waters. It also can exercise a complete jurisdiction over foreign ships in respect of crimes committed beyond the territorial sea but only after the vessel has entered internal waters.
It is important also to note that the government has signalled a desire to achieve bipartisan support. A number of speakers from the other side have also spoken about the bipartisan support for the whole of this package and 
 the legislation for coastal surveillance. It is a problem that we, as a total government, have to deal with, and it is a problem that will not ease. In fact, its severity over a number of months and years has been increasing.
The opposition has shown that it supports the package. It has been critical of some of the previous aspects of the package, but I understand now that it is happy with some of the amendments it has made. I am pleased that this legislation will give effect to a cooperative scheme developed by federal, state and territory governments over crimes at sea. I am happy that it also has a complementary regime developed by the Commonwealth government over crimes at sea beyond the adjacent area. It is also a regime that has been agreed by the Commonwealth and Indonesian governments for dealing with crimes at sea within area A or the Timor Gap.
The perceived need for this bill originates with the recent spate of people-smuggling, as I have said, and we need to keep focused on that. On top of this, it is good to see that the recommendations of the coastal surveillance task force, which was established by the Prime Minister in April, will continue to be followed through. The task force has also noted that current maritime enforcement legislation does not fully implement the powers available under international law. It is therefore recommended that comprehensive amendments be introduced to the legislation to further strengthen the maritime, investigatory and enforcement powers against both Australian and foreign flag vessels. This is essentially what this bill seeks to do and it well enable us to better intercept and police people-smuggling. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CRIMES AT SEA BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I rise tonight in support of the Crimes at Sea Bill 1999 . It is important that we recognise the work of the minister in bringing forward this legislation. It is obviously a reflection of events of recent weeks and of the whole illegal immigrant trade, which has been going on for many years. This bill is a way of overhauling the way the government polices its coastlines and surrounding territorial waters. Further to the border protection legislation, which was introduced on 21 
 October, this bill will increase the effectiveness of law enforcement around our coastline. The bill has the full support of the Attorney-General's committee, of which I am the secretary, so I am pleased to support it.
There is undoubtedly current uncertainty as to which legislation applies and which jurisdiction applies to illegal activity on our waterways adjacent to the coast. The question goes to which justice system has jurisdiction over investigating and trialling offences. Such technicalities can mean that justice may not be served on an offender. Of course, this is the very opposite of what we would want to achieve in terms of the law enforcement agencies in this country.
Under current laws relating to criminal offences at sea, the law must consider the registration of the vessel involved—whether it is an Australian or an overseas registered vessel, from what Australian state it originates and is registered in, and whether the offence occurred during a trip between states or between areas of the same state. Of course, that is clearly a nonsense. One might raise the question of why it has taken until 1999 to remove some of the absurdities that relate to this legislation and this bill.
Different law enforcement laws and procedures apply to different state police agencies and, while officers would be well versed on the requirements of their own state, they may not be so well versed in the complexities that relate to other states and other jurisdictions. The states and territories have agreed to introduce uniform crimes at sea acts which will govern activities within an offshore area up to 12 nautical miles. Beyond 12 nautical miles and up to the 200-mile limit would be the responsibility of Commonwealth law.
The investigating authority will need only to have regard to the state in which they are operating and the laws of the state in which the vessel is apprehended. In fact, it does not need to consider the state in which the vessel was registered, and that will certainly make it much simpler. Where an investigation of a state and a Commonwealth crime is being conducted, the investigation will follow whichever system has the more stringent procedures. 
This legislation will require that, under the new system, the Commonwealth, state and Northern Territory bills all provide that the Commonwealth Attorney-General's written consent be obtained before a prosecution can proceed in cases in which the alleged offence also falls within a foreign country's jurisdiction. This requirement is necessary to promote compliance with Australia's international obligations. Before the Commonwealth Attorney-General takes any action, he must seek the views of the foreign state or country concerned. The absence of consent, however, will not prevent preliminary steps such as an arrest, charges being laid or extradition proceedings from beginning.
Of course, that is an important aspect because some offences have been committed which have been prevented from further follow-up because of the failure of the jurisdiction concerned or the foreign country concerned to give consent for the action to be taken or for some other reason, such as that in the Balkan peninsular conflict where states no longer existed. This would certainly clarify the situation and provide clear jurisdiction for the Attorney-General, having got the agreement of the state concerned or a request having been made that he can sign, having made an attempt to get the agreement of the state involved.
I would like to give two factual scenarios illustrating how the proposed uniform crimes at sea law improves the existing crimes at sea legislation. Imagine that a cruise ship is off the coast of Queensland and is travelling from Cairns to Sydney and a rape occurs on board that ship. Queensland police are alerted to the rape and make arrangements to come on board and investigate the offence. Naturally, these police will want to question the suspected offender as soon as possible and may want to search for incriminating evidence.
The Queensland officers, wanting to move quickly, turn to the Commonwealth Crimes at Sea Act 1979 to decide what powers they can exercise. They discover that the answer to this question depends upon the state to which the ship is connected. Even though the ship is travelling from Cairns to Sydney, its home base may be Melbourne. Queensland police operating off the Queensland coast would 
 then have to exercise Victorian powers, and that clearly is a nonsense.
This is not the only problem that may be faced. If the ship is a foreign vessel which has travelled from a foreign country, the applicable investigatory laws may be those of the ship's next port of call. So the police, who are trying to get on with their investigation, would have to ascertain the ship's next port of call. If the captain is continuing direct to Sydney, the Queensland police will then have to exercise New South Wales powers. If the captain decides to berth in Brisbane, then of course the Queensland powers will be invoked. Obviously, the Queensland police will not really know where they stand on this issue.
Yet this is not the end of the potential problem. If the Queensland police turn to the Queensland crimes at sea legislation, they will discover that it is not uniform with the Commonwealth act. The Queensland law lays down some rules that do not align with the Commonwealth provisions, leaving the officers to resolve a complex constitutional question about conflict of laws. Furthermore, for reasons that have been outlined, the police may not know whether the relevant charges will arise under Queensland, New South Wales, Victorian or some other law. This complex set of preliminary questions creates the real prospect of delay and doubt. It also sets up plenty of grounds for the offender to challenge the lawfulness of any efforts at evidence gathering. This is not fair to enforcement officers, victims or the community.
Under the new scheme, the situation would be much clearer. Queensland police would investigate Queensland offences under Queensland investigatory powers, because the ship is in the Queensland `adjacent area', out to 200 nautical miles. Neither the ship's home port nor its destination would be relevant. There would also be a rebuttable presumption that the offence occurred in the adjacent area of the state in which it is believed to have occurred. State law enforcement officers will be able to investigate suspected offences in the adjacent area for their state, under their own state laws and without worrying about any conflict between Commonwealth and state legislation. This is a commonsense outcome. 
 Scenario 2 is where we require the Attorney-General's consent. Under the current Crimes at Sea Act, the Attorney-General can only consent to a prosecution relating to an alleged offence by a foreign national on a foreign ship once the prosecution consent of the country of the foreign national has been obtained.
—Absurd!
—That is absolutely right. The new scheme streamlines the requirement, requiring the Attorney-General to take into account any views of a foreign country in respect of the prosecution but without requiring the explicit consent of the foreign country. The existing foreign consent requirement has caused considerable difficulties and has the potential to prevent the prosecution of a person who commits a serious offence.
One example of the problems that prompted the removal of the foreign consent requirement occurred in the early 1990s. A serious offence was believed to have been committed by a national of Yugoslavia while he was travelling on a ship in Australian waters. The investigation of this person revealed sufficient evidence to warrant prosecution for a serious criminal offence. However, consent was required from Yugoslavia before the prosecution could proceed. During the early 1990s, Yugoslavia was experiencing a bloody civil war, with such regions as Croatia and Bosnia attempting to break away from the Yugoslav state. At the time of the Yugoslav national's arrest, Yugoslavia did not exist in the sense that it had previously and it certainly lacked any executive government which could give high priority to considering the prosecution of one of its citizens in Australia.
There is also potential under the existing law for a rogue terrorist state to deliberately fail to respond to a request from Australia for consent. If a crime remains unpunished because of Australia's failure to gain the consent of a country facing internal turmoil or ostracised from the international community, there may be little chance that punishment will follow as a result of the laws of that other country. The new crimes at sea scheme will allow the Attorney-General to grant his or her consent to a prosecution where Australia has jurisdiction, after taking into account 
 the views of another country which also has jurisdiction over an accused foreign national. If the foreign country is willing and able to express a view, this will be considered. If the foreign country fails to express a view, the alleged offender will not gain effective immunity from prosecution.
The final aspect relates to the Timor Gap. The bill contains measures relating to Australia's obligations under the Timor Gap Treaty, to which the Indonesian government has just indicated it is no longer a party. When this bill was drafted, the Timor Gap Treaty between Australia and Indonesia had not suffered the strain that currently exists as a result of events in East Timor.
The bill contains special provisions which apply to the Northern Territory's criminal laws governing criminal acts associated with oil exploration and exploitation of oil in the zone of cooperation. On the other hand, the investigation and prosecution rules for offences applied by this bill in area A of the zone of cooperation will be the same as the rules applying in the cooperative scheme area. Put simply, this means that if Northern Territory authorities are investigating or prosecuting an offence, Northern Territory procedural laws will apply. If Commonwealth authorities are investigating or prosecuting, then Commonwealth procedural laws will apply.
So the new scheme is easier to understand and easier to apply, making the work of law enforcement officers that much more efficient. This scheme will give Australian authorities the legislative basis they will need to enforce the criminal law off Australia's coastline. In terms of this piece of legislation, we are removing the anomalies that exist because of the requirement that you need to look at the state in which the vessel is registered or at its next port of call; and we are removing the complexities in terms of getting approval from a foreign national government where that government may no longer exist or may be a rogue government which may not wish to comply.
This is a sensible piece of legislation which should undoubtedly have been enacted some time ago, but I am very glad to see that, given the events that have occurred in recent weeks and also over some period of time in relation to illegal immigrants, this will simplify the 
 action being taken by our law officers around the coast of Australia and will do much to assist in the prosecution of those individuals who are simply flouting Australian requirements and breaching Australian laws. It is my pleasure to commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CRIMES AT SEA BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—In recent weeks, the issue of illegal immigration into Australia has become a media favourite, but the problem of illegal immigration, including the so-called boat people, has been on the coalition government's agenda for a considerable period of time. In April, the coalition government established a coastal surveillance task force to consider the principal issues involved with illegal immigration and people-smuggling. The report was completed in June and it noted that current maritime enforcement legislation does not implement fully the powers available under international law. The report recommended that comprehensive legislative arrangements be introduced to further strengthen maritime investigatory and enforcement powers against both Australia and the foreign flag vessels.
Some other findings contained in this report were the impetus for a number of the provisions in the Crimes at Sea Bill 1999  presently before the House. These measures will address some of the problems in enforcing laws over foreign ships outside Australia's coastal waters, including ships involved in the practice of people-smuggling. People-smuggling is a scourge of the most tragic kind on the international community. People in countries with fewer opportunities than Australia, who understandably want to make a better life for themselves and their families, are courted by professional organised people smugglers. People smugglers do not apply their craft out of any altruistic motive. They are preying on the vulnerable with the sole intention of maximising their own personal gain.
Those behind the people-smuggling rackets are using sinister means to induce people into illegally migrating to Australia. They play on the hopes and aspirations of their victims with false promises. The promise that they will find instant employment upon arrival is common fare. Some organised people smugglers go so far as to tell their prey that they can immediately earn between $20 and $30 
 an hour working in Australia. They allay their victims' fears of being caught by falsely assuring them that Australian authorities are powerless to extradite them and that it is easy to qualify for permanent residency. In some circumstances, they are told that they will be welcomed into Australia.
With limited options and no other information readily available, those desperate for a better life submit to the terms and conditions imposed on them by organised people smugglers. In effect, they are unwittingly committing themselves to a life of slavery. For the organised people smugglers it is all about debt bondage: the practice of smuggling people into a country such as Australia and making them pay off the debt when they arrive in the country. Realistically, this is not a debt that can ever be settled. In real terms, the debt can be equivalent to $A50,000.
In practice, repayments can only be made by working off the debt through illegal activities such as prostitution and drug smuggling on behalf of the organised people smugglers. But their rate of pay is negligible and their payments to their employer for living costs are so exorbitant that it is virtually impossible for them ever to pay off their bondage debt. They face a life of servitude at the hands of organised crime gangs. Their servitude can also take such forms as loan sharking, protection rackets, money laundering operations, importation and distribution of narcotics, kidnapping, fraud, vice, extortion, contract killing, slave trading and the tragic practice of child prostitution.
As the world's largest island nation, it is imperative that Australia has the capacity to adequately protect its borders from people-smuggling. The bill presently before the House is just one plank in the government's strategy to minimise the penetration of people-smuggling into Australia. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has worked assiduously with international authorities to fight this problem at its source.
—And he has done a great job.
—And he has done a most commendable job. The minister recently informed the House that he visited the People's Republic of China, meeting with senior representatives of their government. 
 The product of this meeting was a strengthening of the commitment to cooperate in the detection and prosecution of people smugglers. The outcome of the minister's visit to Bangkok was similarly positive. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also pursued these matters with the Thai government when he was there.
An important facet of this international campaign has been the dissemination of information to increase overseas awareness that illegal immigration will not be tolerated by the Australian government. Cooperative efforts have also been established with authorities from other countries to control the problem at its source. Jakarta police recently broke a passport forgery ring and seized 180 passports, 55 visa stamps and other material used in the people-smuggling process. Thai authorities also recently seized over 1,000 counterfeit passports as well as document producing equipment.
The border protection legislation, which we recently debated in this House and upon which I spoke, will give customs officials extra power in policing our coastal border, but this legislation also complements new antismuggling vessels that have the latest technology to protect our borders. These vessels can sail in extreme conditions and can be at sea for up to 23 days. The new vessels will also make our border protection efforts more cost effective and allow officials to redirect resources to other areas in the fight against people smuggling.
The Criminal Code Amendment (Slavery and Sexual Servitude) Bill 1999 is another measure introduced by the government which fights one of the symptoms of people-smuggling—debt bondage. The bill prescribes penalties of up to 25 years imprisonment for those convicted of intentionally owning a slave or exercising power over somebody that is equivalent to slavery. That includes debt bondage and associated practices. Other legislative measures now impose penalties involving 20 years jail and fines up to a maximum of $220,000 for those convicted of smuggling five or more people into Australia. At present, approximately 60 crew from people-smuggling boats are awaiting trial under these tough new provisions. It is the professional people smugglers and the organ 
 ised crime gangs behind them that our strategy is attacking.
Organised crime has an incredible ability not only to adapt to change but also to then expand. We are all aware that globalisation has rationalised, centralised and modernised national economies, but it is also true that globalisation has rationalised, centralised and modernised organised crime groups. Organised criminal activity has become a growth industry and is manifested in myriad ways. That is why illegal immigration and the debt bondage it brings is so important to organised crime gangs. They are able to use the people they smuggle into a country as dispensable foot soldiers. It is an effective way of putting an extra barrier or firewall between the organised crime bosses and the law enforcement agencies.
It also reinforces the fact that organised transnational crime can only be effectively tackled through a coordinated international approach. To that end, Australia joined more than 140 countries at the World Ministerial Conference on Organised Transnational Crime which was held in Naples almost five years ago.
—An appropriate location.
—Yes, Naples would have been an attractive location but, of course, we are talking about the serious matter of organised crime. Nevertheless, now that I have got your attention perhaps you would like to listen to the rest of my address on the Crimes at Sea Bill 1999 .
Opposition members interjecting—
—I will have to ignore the honourable members. The outcome of the conference was an action plan to develop a holistic approach to combat transnational organised crime by the harmonisation of national legislation. Central to the action plan is the tenet that all countries must work together in responding to this threat. Further conferences will deal with illegal immigration and associated issues. Two more convention conferences planned for October and December this year will canvass additional instruments to deal with trafficking in women and children, the illegal transportation of migrants, and the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking 
 in firearms, their components and ammunition. The combination of these measures will not only assist in controlling the illegal immigration problem at its source but will also have the supplementary effect of suffocating the labour source of the organised crime gangs that are currently operating in Australia. This would be a small but significant step in the fight against organised crime at a domestic level, particularly organised crime with overseas links.
There are also concerns that any further increases in illegal immigration may threaten the integrity and sustainability of Australia's refugee program of which both sides of the House can be proud. As the number of illegal immigrants being caught and detained increases, a strain is being placed on our financial and logistical capacity to service our refugee program. This great humanitarian program assists about 12,000 genuine cases every year. At present it costs Australian taxpayers about $20,500 for each illegal immigrant to be located and removed from Australia.
—How much?
—$20,500 was certainly a figure that leapt out at me. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs estimates that by next year it will cost about $20 million a year for the government to fight refugee claims from illegal immigrants.
Illegal immigration also presents other problems for Australia. Unlike legal immigrants who undergo extensive medical tests, illegal immigrants do not necessarily come into Australia with a clean bill of health. Some illegal immigrants have arrived with life threatening diseases like cancer and motor neurone disease. This situation has enormous potential to create a serious challenge to our health system. This is not to say that illegal immigrants who enter the country legally and overstay their visa are more welcome than boat people. Both classes of illegal immigrants are exactly that—illegal.
Credible estimates indicate that in Australia there are just over 50,000 people who have overstayed their visas after arriving legally. A considerable proportion of these illegal immigrants are people from Britain, the United States, and New Zealand. This is an enormous figure compared to the relatively smaller 
 number of boat people who have been detected entering Australia. In 1997-98, 157 boat people arrivals were detected. In 1998-99, this figure jumped to 921. In only five months of this financial year, the statistic has dramatically increased to 1,789 detected boat people. Whilst we would rather not see any illegal immigration occurring in this country, we have to be pragmatic without being defeatist. The reality is that there will always be illegal immigration in countries as lucky as Australia and the United States—or Japan, which is also experiencing similar problems.
A paper produced by the Institute for the Study of International Migration, which is based in Georgetown University in Washington, noted that `stabilising economic growth and democracy may be the most effective long-term means of reducing migration pressures'. This confirms the sensible approach of the Australian government's commitment to assisting our neighbours in various capacities. As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have often indicated, a stable Asian region is in the national interests of Australia.
It is also worth considering the illegal immigration problems experienced in the United States, specifically those related to patrolling the United States-Mexico border. Despite the enormous financial and technological resources at the disposal of the United States government and the comparatively small border with Mexico, the number of illegal immigrants who penetrate this border is an issue that has been a running sore in American politics for decades. About 60 per cent of all illegal immigrants in the United States are from Mexico. Cuba is another border management problem for the United States. The United States grants asylum to 20,000 Cubans every year, and yet the number of illegal immigrants from Cuba is presently on the rise. In the nine months from January to October 1998, just 615 Cubans reached Florida to seek asylum. In the nine months following, this figure more than tripled to 1,690.
The US Immigration and Naturalisation Service estimated that there were approximately five million undocumented immigrants living in the United States in October 1996. This figure of five million would be closer to 
 eight million if it were not for the 1986 legislation that legalised two classes of undocumented migrants in the United States. The immigration service estimates that approximately 275,000 illegal immigrants enter the United States every year. One of several reasons why the United States is struggling to stem the tide of illegal immigration is the lack of integration and consistency between state and federal policies and strategies to combat the problem. For instance, in the early 1980s the state of California introduced proposition 187 which provided for the barring of illegal alien children from public schools. In 1982, the United States Supreme Court examined the provision and held it to be unconstitutional. Another inconsistency with the United States management of illegal immigration is work site enforcement. Various United States governments have failed to adequately police this area, partly because many industries rely on this form of cheap labour.
There are other lessons for Australia from the United States experience. As border management improves through better technology, people smugglers are employing even more recent and superior technology. Professional people smugglers based in Florida are now using powerful speedboats which are capable of reaching high speeds to either reach American shores without detection or, if detected during their journey, outrun coastguard boats.
The provisions of this bill, in conjunction with other initiatives that I have mentioned that the government has introduced already, will help in the fight against illegal immigration and all the problems that it brings to Australia. But we also need to consider longer-term strategies to keep future influxes of boat people at manageable levels. Since entering the South Australian parliament, Liberal parliamentarian Martin Hamilton-Smith has spoken at length about the escalating problem of boat people. As a former member of the armed services, Mr Hamilton-Smith is familiar with the logistics of protecting Australia's vast northern coastline.
He has called for a proactive approach to protecting our border. Specifically, he advocates a firm policy against illegal immigrants in conjunction with a population policy to help populate northern Australia with legal 
 migrants. Mr Hamilton-Smith argues that a more densely populated northern Australia would lend itself to improved border security, in addition to being a boost to regional development. He also identifies it as a measure that would relieve some of the urban planning problems that are currently being experienced in some capital cities.
Innovative ideas similar to the one put forward by Mr Hamilton-Smith need to be developed and considered in further detail. This must include a consultative process that includes rural and regional Australia. It is important that we give the broader community ownership of the outcomes of a population policy debate. I would hope that, in the future, the opposition might be able to accept the need for a bipartisan approach to population policy. Clearly the question of Australia's population levels is one about nation building. Surely the Labor Party can see the need to work with the government to create a sensible and measured approach to achieve an optimum population level in Australia achieved by way of both fertility and immigration. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CRIMES AT SEA BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I would at this time like to thank honourable members for their careful consideration of the Crimes at Sea Bill 1999  and their valuable contribution to this very important debate, and I include the honourable members for Denison, Throsby, Lowe, Hughes, Curtin, Petrie, Cook and Sturt within that particular description. This is a particularly important measure designed to enhance the certainty and effectiveness of Australia's criminal laws in the seas surrounding Australia.
Since the bill was introduced into the House, there have been two developments which have required amendments to the bill. Firstly, a government amendment was made to reflect an agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the state parliamentary counsel to overcome minor discrepancies that had emerged in the wording of the bills in each jurisdiction. Slight changes of wording—for example, `territory' to `area'—have been made so that the wording of the Commonwealth bill will accord precisely, as indeed it 
 should, with the agreed form of wording for the uniform scheme.
The honourable member for Denison has put forward an amendment concerning part 4 of the bill, which was to regulate the enforcement of criminal laws in area A of what was known as the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation in the Timor Gap. The government agrees with the honourable member for Denison that part 4 should be removed but for reasons that are completely unrelated to the mischief making that lies behind the opposition amendment.
The government had discussions with the honourable member for Denison and part 4 was premised on Australia's treaty relationship with Indonesia governing cooperation in the Timor Gap. It is pretty clear that, in view of recent developments in relation to East Timor, part 4 no longer reflects the current position in relation to the Timor Gap. While amendments are being developed to deal with criminal law enforcement in the Timor Gap to take into account changed circumstances, it is proposed that part 4 be omitted as an interim measure.
This was the first opportunity since the introduction of the bill for the amendments to be introduced. I would emphasise that the government had decided to remove part 4 well before the unhelpful intervention by the honourable member for Denison. In fact, the honourable member for Denison has missed additional amendments consequential to the omission of part 4, and the government will supplement the omission of part 4 with these additional amendments. Provisions to replace part 4 will be formulated as soon as possible.
I would now like to turn to a number of the points made by the people who contributed to the debate. The honourable member for Denison, who is now present in the chamber, was kind enough to praise the government's bill as an instrument promoting uniformity and certainty in determining the applicable criminal law and law enforcement in this country. The government emphatically agrees with him and with other honourable members who made similar comments.
In fact, the criticism of the bill by the honourable member for Denison was restricted to the inclusion of part 4 of the bill, which 
 was based on the presumption of Australian-Indonesian cooperation in the Timor Gap. I have already outlined the response of the government to the amendment by the honourable member for Denison to omit part 4 and his related amendment items 2 and 3. However, I just want to stress—and I want to put the record straight for anyone who happens to be listening—that the government had indeed intended to omit part 4 at the earliest opportunity following recent developments in relation to East Timor.
The honourable member for Lowe tried to suggest that the government had not appropriately informed the honourable member for Denison of the intentions of the government with respect to the removal of part 4. The simple fact of the matter is that the office of the Minister for Justice and Customs had informed the honourable member for Denison of the intention of the government well before his contribution to this debate on 25 November. The honourable member for Denison chose to go ahead and criticise the government for being insensitive to East Timor, knowing full well that the government intended to omit part 4 at the earliest opportunity. It is almost as though his office had done all the hard work preparing the media release and he felt that that hard work was not to be lost. It had to be issued because his staff had worked so hard.
The honourable member for Throsby questioned why the government had chosen to proceed with the bill at this point in time. He suggested that to do so was insensitive to the people of East Timor. The Prime Minister and this entire government has a very proud record in relation to East Timor. We reversed the actions and inaction of governments over many years, and we have taken a world leadership position in recognising and respecting the rights of the people of East Timor. In fact, our nation has grown in stature around the world because of the very strong stand that we have taken.
The honourable member for Throsby suggested that the government should have sat on its hands. I think he said, `Why does the government not wait until the situation in East Timor has stabilised?' The simple answer to this is that the bill should proceed because it is important to put in place a uniform national 
 scheme which will simplify the rules for determining criminal law that applies to crimes at sea and ensure more effective law enforcement.
The honourable member for Sturt, in a very competent contribution, noted that this bill finally updated Australia's legislation with respect to international law. He pointed out that for too long we have had a law which was not entirely appropriate. This bill will improve Australia's ability to prosecute crimes committed at sea which previously has been hampered by less than comprehensive and adequate legislation.
The honourable member for Cook highlighted some ludicrous examples which exist under the 1979 act and which will be redressed by this legislation. The member for Cook pointed out that it has taken some time to take steps to update and improve the inadequacies of the 1979 act, but it is a time consuming process, as most honourable members would appreciate, to achieve a uniform, complementary, Commonwealth, state and territory scheme. The parliament and this government have achieved this. The member for Cook noted the importance of this particular bill, as did other members on this side of the House, in improving the crimes at sea legislation.
The honourable member for Petrie highlighted how important this legislation is, and I want to thank her publicly for drawing attention to the merit of this bill in clarifying the often confusing applications of the law pursuant to the 1979 legislation. The honourable member for Curtin—and she herself is an erudite lawyer—recognised and identified the  myriad issues relating to the law of the sea and in fact referred to its impact on the state of Western Australia, which she competently represents in this place, and its vast coastline.
The honourable member for Lowe—as I said, maybe unwittingly, maybe otherwise—misrepresented the position of the government and suggested that we had not in fact informed the honourable member for Denison. Yet, as I have made absolutely and completely clear, the government was up front, the government was honest and the government approached the opposition and pointed out to the member for Denison our intention, which was to remove part 4 from this bill at the earliest possible opportunity. The member 
 for Lowe also wrongly suggested that the government has in some way created confusion between this bill and people-smuggling issues.
I just want to point out that the coastal surveillance reforms and the  Crimes at Sea Bill 1999  complement each other by removing gaps in the existing criminal law and law enforcement regime. However, the Crimes at Sea Bill does something very important and quite distinct. The Crimes at Sea Bill applies the general criminal laws of the states to their adjacent areas to cover ordinary offences including murder, theft and sexual assault. The coastal surveillance reforms supplement this general state legal regime with special Commonwealth powers and offences to combat matters such as people-smuggling and illegal immigration. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would be aware, although some of your colleagues are not, that these aspects are quite distinct and there is no problem or overlap or confusion.
We all know that we live in a world where people and goods are extremely mobile. Gaps in our system of criminal law and in our law enforcement mechanisms can be exploited wherever they may be found. That is why the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory of Australia have worked together to come up with a uniform and unified crimes at sea scheme. This is why each jurisdiction, regardless of its political complexion, has been able to sit down and agree to enter into an arrangement for the effective enforcement of the scheme. The agreement by the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory to enact the uniform crimes at sea scheme shows what can be achieved when governments work together to achieve practical solutions to practical problems on behalf of the people of this great nation.
It is with a great deal of pleasure that I commend this bill to the chamber. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee on Public Works, I present the 12th and 13th reports of the committee for 1999 relating to the Staff Colleges Collocation Project, Weston Creek, ACT, and the ANZAC Hall extension, Australian War Memorial, Canberra.
Ordered that the reports be printed.
—by leave—The reports I have just tabled give approval for two facilities which will add to the existing range of works projects located in the national capital. These are the proposed construction of a collocated defence staff colleges complex at Weston Creek and a new exhibition hall for the Australian War Memorial at Campbell.
The estimated cost of the collocated defence staff colleges project is $28 million, while the Federation Fund is providing the $11.9 million for Anzac Hall.
The committee has recommended that the works should proceed. Both projects will significantly enhance the value of existing facilities in Canberra and complement the national institution functions of the federal capital.
The first report I have tabled deals with the collocated defence staff colleges. Each of the three single services currently conducts middle level officer training in separate staff colleges. These services colleges are located at Queenscliff, Victoria; Balmoral, Sydney; and Fairbairn, ACT for Army, Navy and Air Force respectively. Collocation of the three colleges onto one site was most recently proposed in the context of Defence Efficiency Review studies.
The Department of Defence proposes to collocate the three existing single service staff colleges in new facilities to be constructed at Weston Creek, ACT, adjacent to the existing Australian Defence College. The works are needed to improve efficiency in the delivery of middle level officer training and thereby realise savings in operating costs. Collocation is also seen as a means of reinforcing an emerging ADF joint culture.
The committee took evidence from Defence officials at the public hearing held in Parliament House, Canberra, on 11 June 1999. In addition, on 17 August the committee met with the councillors and staff of the Borough of Queenscliffe before inspecting historic buildings and a new military instruction facility at Fort Queenscliff. The opportunity was also taken to have informal discussions with members of a large group of local residents assembled at the entrance to the fort who expressed deep concerns about the ramifications of the relocation of the Army Staff College from Queenscliff to Canberra.	 On 2 and 30 September and 21 October, the committee held further hearings at Parliament House, Canberra and took evidence from Defence officials and the Australian Heritage Commission. 
The committee noted the concerns of local residents that collocation of the Defence staff colleges in Canberra would require abandoning Queenscliff, with a modern military instructional facility, and developing a similar institution at another site. The committee therefore sought to quantify the extent of these benefits and, between August and October, sought additional information from Defence to substantiate the decision to collocate the colleges in Canberra.
In its conclusions, the committee has made reference to the future use of the Fort Queenscliff property when the Army college is collocated in Canberra and has stressed the necessity to preserve the heritage value of the property when ownership is transferred. Whilst the committee's inquiry on this reference was unusually protracted, it was felt necessary to conduct an exhaustive examination of the rationale and justification for the location decision.
The second report I have tabled concerns the construction of a new exhibition hall for the Australian War Memorial at Campbell. The importance of this site has been recognised since 1941. Since that time, the memorial has developed and maintained a collection of historic material, conducted research into all aspects of Australia's military conflicts and is involved in other activities such as the dawn service on Anzac Day.
Anzac Hall will provide visitors to the memorial the opportunity to view much of the memorial's collection at the one site, including many of the large relics that have been housed at the Mitchell depository. One such relic is the Japanese midget submarine that was recovered from Sydney Harbour, with the Lancaster bomber—`G for George'—and other assorted tanks and artillery expected to be strikingly displayed in the modern exhibition space at Anzac Hall.
It is proposed that Anzac Hall be constructed on the existing car park at the Campbell site and be connected to the Aircraft Hall in the memorial by way of a glass link at a mezzanine level. The loss of the existing car park will require the development of several new parking areas. The committee is particularly concerned that adequate parking spaces 
 are provided, including spaces for people with disabilities and for buses.
The construction of such a large exhibition hall obviously entails a considerable expanse of roof. At the public hearing, the committee extensively questioned the architect and representatives of the memorial and the National Capital Authority about various aspects of the roof. The committee is satisfied that the nature of the design, being set behind the memorial and sunk into the ground, minimises any visual impact that the roof expanse may have when viewing the memorial along Anzac Parade or from places such as Parliament House.
The committee is also satisfied that the proposed Colorbond roof meets the requirements of the brief. This is despite the fact that both the National Capital Authority and the Australian Heritage Commission have indicated that a better quality material, such as zinc or copper, would be more appropriate. At an additional estimated cost of $2 million, the committee does not believe that a zinc or copper roof represents value for money. However, in recognition of the concerns raised by those organisations, the committee has recommended that the Australian War Memorial and the National Capital Authority resolve the issue prior to the commencement of work.
The committee recognises that as many people as possible should be able to access a building of such national importance. The committee notes the progress of the memorial in this area over the past few years and supports the decision by the memorial to engage a consultant to advise on issues relating to people with disabilities.
It is anticipated that, subject to parliamentary approval, the construction of Anzac Hall will be completed by 31 March 2001 and officially opened on Anzac Day 2001. The addition of Anzac Hall to the memorial complex can only enhance the experience of the visitor; it can only enhance the understanding of the individual sacrifices made in times of war. I commend both reports to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—by leave—I refer to the recommendation of the 
 Public Works Committee tonight to approve the collocation of the staff colleges. It is with a heavy heart that I support this recommendation. I am a member of the Public Works Committee and those other members who are here in the chamber tonight will understand that this was a very difficult decision for the committee to make. Australia's largest Army base is in Townsville in my electorate of Herbert. Many of the people at that Army base have been to the staff college so I sought their views. I asked them what they felt about this proposal to the Public Works Committee. Many of them wanted to see Fort Queenscliff stay because of the heritage and tradition of the place.
It is a magnificent location and the committee certainly put more effort into this decision than many of the other decisions, and rightly put that effort into this decision. But, at the end of the day, it was also right to make this recommendation to the parliament tonight. Having talked to the Chief of the Defence Force and other senior officers I know they are very pleased that the committee is recommending this to the parliament tonight. It was of course also recommended by the former government. I support the chairman of the committee in her recommendation to the parliament tonight.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,1999-12-06,"—by leave—I wanted an opportunity to place on the public record my appreciation for the Australian War Memorial. The member for Pearce introduced two reports from the Public Works Committee here tonight. The member for Herbert has spoken about the first of those. What happens at our War Memorial is something that, as Australians, we ought to have as a focus point as a source of national pride. Over the years I have had the opportunity to visit the War Memorial—before I entered parliament, with my family, and since then with my family—and I have seen the way in which the memorial has changed and modified the way it exhibits the special memorials that are down there.
I place on record a commendation to the Director of the Australian War Memorial, Major General Stephen Gower AO, for the work he has done. I cannot think of a more 
 fitting project that qualifies for support through the government's Federation initiative than Anzac Hall, which the second report addresses. It is a great opportunity to further place on exhibit memorials of Australia's war experience and of our history that are currently not easily accessible for the public to see. Whilst the member for Herbert spoke about the first report, which is really history in the making—a new experiment in terms of collocation in the training of our defence forces and senior ranks—I refer to our proud military history which will be on exhibit at the memorial.
In relation to the issue which the member for Pearce has made reference to, the National Capital Authority's insistence that $2 million be spent on a roof that very few people will look at, that money would be far better spent on an exhibit inside the building. I am hoping that the authority will come to a point and accept the modern material—albeit, Colorbond. It really is only a colour and, with all of the textures available these days, it can be made to be an acceptable perspective from Mount Ainslie.
At the end of the day, it is the memorial itself that we want Australians to have access to. In the last 12 months, 800,000-plus people have visited the memorial. That number is growing every year. It is interesting to look at the statistics of the age groups that visit the memorial. It is not an older generation, as we might expect; it is young people, young children, young families with their children, all on their own search to find something about a father, a grandfather or an uncle's participation in the war experience. I commend both of these reports to the House and thank the House for the opportunity to speak to them.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,22,1,speech

Ordered that the reports be printed.

The second report I have tabled concerns the construction of a new exhibition hall for the Australian War Memorial at Campbell. The importance of this site has been recognised since 1941. Since that time, the memorial has developed and maintained a collection of historic material, conducted research into all aspects of Australia's military conflicts and is involved in other activities such as the dawn service on Anzac Day.
Anzac Hall will provide visitors to the memorial the opportunity to view much of the memorial's collection at the one site, including many of the large relics that have been housed at the Mitchell depository. One such relic is the Japanese midget submarine that was recovered from Sydney Harbour, with the Lancaster bomber—`G for George'—and other assorted tanks and artillery expected to be strikingly displayed in the modern exhibition space at Anzac Hall.
It is proposed that Anzac Hall be constructed on the existing car park at the Campbell site and be connected to the Aircraft Hall in the memorial by way of a glass link at a mezzanine level. The loss of the existing car park will require the development of several new parking areas. The committee is particularly concerned that adequate parking spaces 
 are provided, including spaces for people with disabilities and for buses.
The construction of such a large exhibition hall obviously entails a considerable expanse of roof. At the public hearing, the committee extensively questioned the architect and representatives of the memorial and the National Capital Authority about various aspects of the roof. The committee is satisfied that the nature of the design, being set behind the memorial and sunk into the ground, minimises any visual impact that the roof expanse may have when viewing the memorial along Anzac Parade or from places such as Parliament House.
The committee is also satisfied that the proposed Colorbond roof meets the requirements of the brief. This is despite the fact that both the National Capital Authority and the Australian Heritage Commission have indicated that a better quality material, such as zinc or copper, would be more appropriate. At an additional estimated cost of $2 million, the committee does not believe that a zinc or copper roof represents value for money. However, in recognition of the concerns raised by those organisations, the committee has recommended that the Australian War Memorial and the National Capital Authority resolve the issue prior to the commencement of work.
The committee recognises that as many people as possible should be able to access a building of such national importance. The committee notes the progress of the memorial in this area over the past few years and supports the decision by the memorial to engage a consultant to advise on issues relating to people with disabilities.
It is anticipated that, subject to parliamentary approval, the construction of Anzac Hall will be completed by 31 March 2001 and officially opened on Anzac Day 2001. The addition of Anzac Hall to the memorial complex can only enhance the experience of the visitor; it can only enhance the understanding of the individual sacrifices made in times of war. I commend both reports to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—by leave—I refer to the recommendation of the 
 Public Works Committee tonight to approve the collocation of the staff colleges. It is with a heavy heart that I support this recommendation. I am a member of the Public Works Committee and those other members who are here in the chamber tonight will understand that this was a very difficult decision for the committee to make. Australia's largest Army base is in Townsville in my electorate of Herbert. Many of the people at that Army base have been to the staff college so I sought their views. I asked them what they felt about this proposal to the Public Works Committee. Many of them wanted to see Fort Queenscliff stay because of the heritage and tradition of the place.
It is a magnificent location and the committee certainly put more effort into this decision than many of the other decisions, and rightly put that effort into this decision. But, at the end of the day, it was also right to make this recommendation to the parliament tonight. Having talked to the Chief of the Defence Force and other senior officers I know they are very pleased that the committee is recommending this to the parliament tonight. It was of course also recommended by the former government. I support the chairman of the committee in her recommendation to the parliament tonight.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,1999-12-06,"—by leave—I wanted an opportunity to place on the public record my appreciation for the Australian War Memorial. The member for Pearce introduced two reports from the Public Works Committee here tonight. The member for Herbert has spoken about the first of those. What happens at our War Memorial is something that, as Australians, we ought to have as a focus point as a source of national pride. Over the years I have had the opportunity to visit the War Memorial—before I entered parliament, with my family, and since then with my family—and I have seen the way in which the memorial has changed and modified the way it exhibits the special memorials that are down there.
I place on record a commendation to the Director of the Australian War Memorial, Major General Stephen Gower AO, for the work he has done. I cannot think of a more 
 fitting project that qualifies for support through the government's Federation initiative than Anzac Hall, which the second report addresses. It is a great opportunity to further place on exhibit memorials of Australia's war experience and of our history that are currently not easily accessible for the public to see. Whilst the member for Herbert spoke about the first report, which is really history in the making—a new experiment in terms of collocation in the training of our defence forces and senior ranks—I refer to our proud military history which will be on exhibit at the memorial.
In relation to the issue which the member for Pearce has made reference to, the National Capital Authority's insistence that $2 million be spent on a roof that very few people will look at, that money would be far better spent on an exhibit inside the building. I am hoping that the authority will come to a point and accept the modern material—albeit, Colorbond. It really is only a colour and, with all of the textures available these days, it can be made to be an acceptable perspective from Mount Ainslie.
At the end of the day, it is the memorial itself that we want Australians to have access to. In the last 12 months, 800,000-plus people have visited the memorial. That number is growing every year. It is interesting to look at the statistics of the age groups that visit the memorial. It is not an older generation, as we might expect; it is young people, young children, young families with their children, all on their own search to find something about a father, a grandfather or an uncle's participation in the war experience. I commend both of these reports to the House and thank the House for the opportunity to speak to them.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—I move:
That the amendment made by the Senate to the additional amendment made by the House be disagreed to.
This Senate amendment to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  typifies the attitude of the Labor Party in opposition to this legislation from the very day that it became the property of this government and no longer the invention of the Labor Party, as it was as part of the National Forest Policy Statement. The amendment seeks to replace the Forest Products Advisory Council proposed by the government with a Wood and Paper Industry Council. The government never saw the need to establish any advisory council by legislation, but we have made a commitment to establish such a body as part of our action agenda, and that commitment stands. 
It was our view that legislation was likely to impose unnecessary restraint on an advisory council's activities and limit its flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances in the timber industry. Nevertheless, we have been happy to cooperate with the unions and the opposition and to consider what amendments might be acceptable. When I discussed this matter with the member for Reid, he told me that the principal requirement was to obtain agreement from the CFMEU, so we did that. The CFMEU's national secretary wrote to me on 28 September agreeing to the proposal that the government proposed to put up as an amendment to the original RFA legislation.
This is no longer good enough for the opposition. If you are a spoiler opposition, even your own close constituency has no influence; you are simply opposed to everything. In fact, I think the opposition wants to punish the CFMEU, and I have read to the House in recent times their view of this opposition. They are strongly of the view that the opposition broke their promises before the last election—promises to their own constituency and their own work force. The CFMEU is to be punished by the Labor opposition for having the audacity to look after the interests of their members rather than play the opposition's political games.
We obtained the agreement of the CFMEU to the establishment of a Forest Products Advisory Council—exactly what the member for Reid asked us to do. What has the opposi 
 tion done now? It has cooperated with the Greens and the Democrats in the Senate to pass a series of unwieldy and very constraining amendments to establish a Wood and Paper Industry Council which has no hope of really achieving anything. But I think that is what their attitude has been to the whole legislation—mix it up, mess it up and, in the process, make sure it does not work.
The opposition has even added the representation of the Australian Conservation Foundation to a council designed to promote a forest products industry. The Australian Conservation Foundation's agenda is well publicised: it is opposed to any form of native forest harvesting whatsoever. However, by other amendments, which will be dealt with by further resolutions of this House, the Labor opposition has furthermore effectively thrown the baby out with the bathwater in opposing this piece of legislation and making it unacceptable to the government. Therefore, it cannot be passed.
The government has already created a steering committee under its action agenda and this will become our advisory council. We do not need the opposition's assistance to do that. We do not need a vote of the parliament. We have just invited the CFMEU to provide a member to that committee and I am sure in due course they will accept that invitation. This committee will have the capacity to assist and advise the government in its determination to provide jobs and security for timber workers—and the opposition is clearly intending to do the opposite. In due course, we will give the member for McMillan the chance to come in here and vote again. Last time, he slid out under the carpet, never made a bump and would not even come in here. He writes letters to me saying how interested he is in regional forest agreements and such things, but the member for McMillan is just like another group of people that come into this place.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—The reality is that the government's original Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  made no provision whatsoever for a body to promote industry development measures. It is all right for the Minister for Forestry and Conservation to come in here and grandstand about what is deficient in other 
 amendments, but the fact of life is that the government made no provision for this whatsoever. They were shamed into doing so by the opposition's consistent advocacy of a proper wood and paper industry council. I am pleased that the Senate, after some toing and froing, has now agreed to support Labor's proposal. The minister has come here tonight alleging that somehow this is a Democrat or Green mechanism. Rather, the reality is that in the first vote the Democrats failed to support the Labor Party on these amendments. It is a Labor initiative and the minister well and truly knows that.
I remind the House that the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement encompasses more than just resource security and conservation values. On industry development, it contains quite specific undertakings about the efficient use of wood products, value adding, structural adjustment and international competitiveness. Subsequently, the former Labor government consulted key stakeholders about the development of WAPIS—a wool and paper industry strategy. This strategy was publicly announced in December 1995 and included additional funding of $38 million, in addition to the $107 million previously announced structural adjustment funding under FISAP.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—It is interesting that the Minister for Forestry and Conservation is in the House this evening. I was interested to listen to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in question time today trying to justify their never, ever tax—the tax that Australians voted against at the last election, the tax they do not want but the tax they are going to get: the GST. Try as they might, the government will not dispel the rising wrath against the GST because—
—Order! I am sorry to interrupt the member for Paterson, but there seems to be some misunderstanding in the House. I thought the member for Paterson was rising, not surprisingly, on the regional forest debate and for that reason called him. The matter before the House is the Regional Forest Agreements Bill because the adjournment debate has been negatived.
—Mr Speaker, we voted no to the minister's question, which was that the question be put forthwith.
—I am reassured by the Clerk that my ruling was in order. The question that was put was simply that the House do now adjourn, and we agreed that the noes had it and that the House was not moving into the adjournment stage.
—The minister moved a motion that the question be put forthwith without debate. We understand that we negatived the motion that the minister put and so were moving straight into the adjournment. That was certainly the intention of the House.
—I will rephrase this. I proposed the question that the House do now adjourn and that question was put forthwith without debate and was carried in the negative. The House is not currently in the process of adjourning; the House is in the process of considering the Regional Forest Agreements Bill.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-12-06,"—It was interesting to listen to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in question time today trying to justify their never, ever tax—the tax that Australians voted against at the last election but the tax they are going to get: the GST. Try as they might, this government will not dispel the rising wrath against the GST. As we approach 1 July of next year, the incidence of the GST appearing on accounts for such things as insurance policies or any contract is going to increase, and people resent that component.
I spoke on this matter just two weeks ago. I challenged the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, the Hon. Wilson Tuckey, to explain just how the GST will affect livestock sales. He declined of course, but then he put out a press release in my electorate to simpli 
 fy the matter and explain the issue. The media statement that he put out reads:
""The position is that vendors can advise the auctioneer how they want their livestock sold, either GST-exclusive (meaning the GST is added to the final bid) or GST-inclusive (meaning the final bid includes GST).
""Auctioneers will have the right to state their preference on this regard, however vendors will then clearly have a choice of auctioneer,"" Mr Tuckey said.
That is very interesting. What the minister did not tell us is that there is, of course, another category. In the Hunter and in many coastal regions, there are a large number of hobby farmers in particular, and people do not sell $50,000 worth of livestock a year. They will have the choice of registering for GST or not. So there is going to be a category of livestock that will come onto the market for which GST is not payable.
What chaos, what pandemonium and what an utterly ridiculous situation will exist at any livestock sale after 1 July next year. People will have no idea what they are buying, what they are paying for or whether GST is included or not. That is the state that this government has got one of our largest industries into. It is impossible for a minister of this government to put out a media statement to clarify the situation. All he has done is confuse the issue more.
Another point the Treasurer has tried to make over recent weeks is about the great Australian dream: the Australian home. According to him, it is going to get cheaper. He seems to think that there is a wholesale sales tax on the goods that go into a home. Actually, very few items that go into the building of a home attract the wholesale sales tax. But the Treasurer dismisses it quietly by saying, `But, of course, we're going to give a first home owners grant.' He also takes great pride in the fact that he says, `Interest rates are at a historic low.'
A study done by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute at the RMIT, called Falling out of home ownership: mortgage arrears and defaults in Australia, shows that the default on mortgages is at a record high. Why is it at a record high? It is at a record high because of job insecurity, because of marriage break-up, because of aggressive 
 marketing of loans and because people are going out and incorporating car, boat and all other sorts of loans in their mortgage. The point is that, under the Howard-Costello government, more people are defaulting on housing loans than ever before.
This government can stand up and crow all it likes about how strong the Australian economy is but studies such as this one that I have just quoted indicate that the workers out there in Australia are doing it tough.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-12-06,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1) Yes. The statement ""Safeguarding the future: Australia's response to climate change"" (20 November 1997) included a commitment to bring forward the phase out of leaded petrol, taking equity considerations into account.
In response, I am advised that Environment Australia circulated a discussion paper (December 1998) designed to identify the issues resulting from the complete withdrawal from sale of leaded petrol, encourage stakeholders to raise additional issues they considered relevant, and assist in the development of a national strategy to phase out leaded petrol.
Environment Australia is now reviewing stakeholder comments, and will prepare a strategy for the phase out of leaded petrol for consideration by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in late 1999. This strategy will include implementation details that address social equity issues.
(2) A national phase out date has not yet been set. It is intended to specify a date in the national leaded petrol phase out strategy.
I am advised that Western Australia announced on 2 August 1999 that leaded petrol will be phased out in WA by 1 January 2000. Shell Australia Limited has announced that it intends to introduce a lead replacement petrol (LRP) in Victoria in late 
 2000. Shell has already introduced a LRP at two sites in Perth.
(3) Yes. Motoring organisations and the petroleum industry have been consulted to ensure the availability of a suitable replacement fuel for use in those pre-1986 vehicles that require leaded petrol.
This can be achieved by either pre-blending an anti-valve seat recession additive (ASRA) to high octane unleaded fuel at the refinery; or through the sale of customer-added ASRAs at service station forecourts.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Leaded Petrol</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,28,1,answer
