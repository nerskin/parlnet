"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2010-05-11,"—This resource super tax will hurt all Australians. It will not just hurt those who work in the mining industry; it will not just hurt those who work in the industries that support the mining industry; it will not just hurt those people who rely on income from the mining industry through shares or superannuation. Its tentacles reach into every household in Australia. It will produce higher power bills. It will produce higher house prices because bricks and mortar and sand and gravel will all be affected by this tax. It will increase fertiliser prices for farmers who grow the food for this nation and earn export income. As observed by a journalist in one of this morning’s newspapers, ‘The RSPT actually stands for a really stupid political tax.’ And that is what this is: this is a stupid political tax grab by a government that has lost complete control of its budget, has lost complete control of its debt and has completely lost its vision for the future of this country. The mining industry has been delivered a sledgehammer blow by a government that only thinks in 24-hour spin media cycles and does not think of the impact that this tax is going to have on the future investment in Australian mining, the jobs that that creates and the impact of making Australia’s mining industry so uncompetitive that miners will simply base their new operations overseas.
I am not suggesting there are going to be widespread mine closures in Australia. There is going to be a continuation of those mines, but as most people who understand the mining industry know—and probably the only two people in the government who do are sitting opposite me: the minister for resources and the member for Brand—mines have finite lives. Mines close; other mines open. Miners move from one mine to the next, often only a few kilometres, sometimes hundreds of kilometres, sometimes interstate. The new mines that replace the old mines will, under this tax, be located in Canada, in Brazil, in Peru, in Chile, in Indonesia and in Africa—everywhere else has a lower tax on its mining than Australia as a result of this tax.
The resource industry in Australia has protected us and our economy through many ups and downs and it is Australia’s largest export earner. This year it is estimated it will earn $150 billion in export earnings. It is already paying above the norm in terms of taxes. It is paying somewhere between 37 and 43 per cent—about 40 per cent—in government taxes already. It represents eight per cent of the economy over the last decade and yet pays 18 per cent of the company tax. Yet we have a Prime Minister who has the audacity to say that these people are raping the profits out of Australia and taking them back to their homelands. Most of the companies that operate in Australia either have Australian shareholders or have in fact in the last five years invested more money here than they have taken away. This just highlights the fact that the Prime Minister knows nothing about this industry. He certainly does not understand that Australia was built on a philosophy that, if you invested money and took a risk, you did not ever get an assurance that you would get a return, but if you did then you were entitled to make a profit. This Prime Minister belittles people who make profits. He belittles people who are successful in their own right. He belittles people who are millionaires, and on one or two occasions billionaires, as a result of their own risks and their own efforts.
We have a Prime Minister who demonises foreign ownership, who pulls out the racist card against foreign companies and says that they are not welcome here. That is xenophobia. Foreign investment built this country—it made this country what it is today, along with the blood, sweat and toil of farmers, miners and people in the city going about their day-to-day work. Yet this government, this Prime Minister, has chosen to single out one industry and say, ‘You are already paying 40 per cent tax when the company tax rate is 30 per cent, but we are going to make you pay 57 per cent tax’. In some cases it will be 80 per cent of their profits because the parameters of this super tax are not the same as they are for the petroleum resource rent tax; they are not based on allowing companies to deduct all their costs, particularly in terms of how they deal with those costs. It is a super super tax—a tax that will simply drive investment overseas.
This issue is not just about the future of the mining industry; it is about the future of the jobs of the people who work in it. It is not just about the future of the miners, the men and women who go down these dark holes and drive heavy machinery in open cuts; it is about the men and women who work in the fabrication shops, in the engineering works, in the air-conditioned offices across this country, in Sydney, in Melbourne, in Perth and in Brisbane—the people whose livelihood is linked directly and quite unashamedly to the mining industry and the risks it takes. And it is about the people that they employ—the gardener who works in their gardens when they are at work or the cleaner who assists them in cleaning up the office after work. All these people will be affected by this super tax. It will flow through and affect every city and town in Australia, and particularly it will hurt the regional towns—country towns like Cloncurry, which had a $30 million project cancelled yesterday; Karratha, which in time could see the investment that is going on there at the moment suddenly shift to a new focus; and Ballarat and Parkes. These are towns that rely on significant income from their mining industries. One in eight Queenslanders is employed by the mining industry. We wonder about their future in regional Australia.
This is also about people who have already done their toil for this country and have invested their retirement moneys in stocks and shares or in superannuation funds that are now being decimated by the news of this super tax and the effect that it will potentially have on the country’s resource industry. We saw figures released this week that around 9.3 per cent of Australia’s superannuation is invested in resource industry stock. At the close of trading on Monday, 10 May, yesterday, Australians had lost around $13.4 billion in superannuation earnings and capital in superannuation funds as a result of the fall in stocks.
Abraham Lincoln, that fantastic American statesman and leader—the Prime Minister should look to him at times to see what a leader is—said that you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. Yet this government is happy to weaken the strong. It is happy to do anything that will prop up its excessive spending, its excessive debt and its inability to manage money. I want to quote from people who do not have a political interest in this debate. The
Globe, a Canadian publication, has said that as a result of this tax:
Mining company shares, particularly those with operations in Australia, were roundly pummelled …
Another quote pertinent to this debate states:
Slowing down the development of Australia’s mining and energy resource industries would be a scandalous wasted opportunity to lock in future prosperity and achieve social and environmental goals such as supporting school students in disadvantaged communities, Australians with disabilities, those with mental illnesses and others who are too sick to work, and preserving Australia’s unique biological diversity.
Who said that? A member of the government—a minister, the member for Rankin, said that not very long ago. I wonder what he says today. I wonder whether he has had that thought purged from his mind. Let us go back to what this is doing to Australia. A Southern Cross Equities publication states:
This economic thinking runs counter to everything that made Australia rich over the last three decades: namely, the embrace of competition and capitalism, which rewards high risk with high returns.
The member for Rankin, Craig Emerson, agrees with that. But I bet he is not allowed to say it anymore. Going back overseas, the
Wall Street Journal
says:
It’s a new day Down Under when a government starts setting rates of return for private industry in a nominally capitalist economy.
That is government interference in the economy in a way which is sending shock waves through the industry.
Let us go to a Labor source. What does the Premier of Queensland think of this? She says:
You can’t expect international companies to make those investment decisions unless they’ve got absolute certainty about the costs of doing business.
I could not agree more. There is no certainty anymore—everything changes every day. Again, it is said that Anna Bligh ‘fears the Rudd government’s Resource Super Profits Tax will undermine her election pledge to create 100,000 new jobs’. She says:
… it will not only impact on jobs in Queensland, but jobs around the country.
Let us move to South Australia. This is a quote by Kevin Foley, the Deputy Premier and Treasurer:
… but there are clearly desired issues that need to be rectified to ensure that it—
the resource rent tax—
is not as impacting as it would appear to be on particularly some of the new mines coming on stream.
Kevin Foley can see the damage coming. I have here a transcript that is too long to read. It is about the Prime Minister, who tried to explain this tax on 6PR in Perth last week. I will seek to table that transcript because it is a public document. Clearly the Prime Minister does not understand that tax. He says it is the same as the petroleum resource rent tax. It is not. The red crosses on the document that I am holding up are the things that are not similar.
We have to do something about this tax. We on this side of the House are going to stop this tax, not for our political gain but because of what is in this document I am holding: this is Australia, second only to America at the moment; we are going to move to here, 58 per cent. What has our largest competitor, Canada, got in terms of company taxes and resource taxes? Twenty three per cent. It is any wonder that the Canadian minister could hardly wait to get on the radio to tell Australia what he believes: ‘If you don’t want them there, send them over here.’ Brad Trost says:
Well money goes where the biggest profits are and when you raise taxes profits tend to go down. So I’m sending out the message—Canada wants Australian business.
The final document I have here is by Moody’s, the people who make credit ratings around Australia. They are not a political organisation. They are not stockbrokers. They are an organisation which rates risk. They say:
If enacted, the so-called ‘Resources Super Profits Tax’ would have a negative credit impact on Australia’s resource sector …
This government has gone berserk with this tax. This government has lost complete control of the economic agenda. This government wants to take the money now. It wants to kill the golden goose, take the golden eggs and not worry about what happens in five years time when there is no golden goose, there are no more golden eggs and no more mines being opened.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2010-05-11,"—Firstly, I welcome the member for Groom back to the portfolio. I must say he was very disappointed at being moved out of the portfolio after backing the wrong horse in the leadership challenge of last December. Seriously, I appreciate the opportunity to address what are very serious issues before the chair. I note that the letter from the member for Groom which led to this matter of public importance debate goes to, namely:
The effect of the resources super tax on the future jobs and economic security of Australia.
For that reason, let me go firstly to a page of the government document which was released last Sunday week and is entitled
Tax policy statement: Stronger. Fairer. Simpler. A tax plan for the future. I take the member for Groom directly to page 13. I will quote from it, because this is important as it goes to the heart of the very issue raised by the member for Groom. It says:
Independent modelling by KPMG Econtech estimates that cutting the company tax rate to 28 per cent and introducing the RSPT—
the Resource Super Profits Tax—
combined with the removal of the impact of royalties will expand mining output by 6.6 per cent in the long run (considered by KPMG Econtech to be 5 to 10 years).
It then goes on to say:
All other industries are expected to expand by 0.3 per cent in the long run.
On the same page, the report says:
The combined effect of introducing the RSPT—
the Resource Super Profits Tax—
which effectively removes royalties and cutting the company tax rate by 2 percentage points, is a long run improvement to GDP of 0.7 per cent.
That goes to the crux of this debate. I also appreciate that it is going to be a long, tough tax debate because reform in Australia has never come easy to the Australian community or to this parliament. I have been through a number of very tough debates—some of which are still part of the proposal before the House today—be they on tax, superannuation, infrastructure or a variety of issues in a variety of forms throughout my political and industrial careers.
For those reasons I also remind the House that the Minerals Council of Australia has actually argued itself:
There is a strong argument to reform the basis of determining royalty payments to a profits based criteria from a revenue one.
I could not agree more with the Minerals Council of Australia. But I also appreciate that the devil is in the detail, and that is where we are really at at the moment. The Commonwealth government has announced its intentions with respect to its headline commitment, which is what it believes is a fair return to the Australian community for the opportunity by companies to actually develop our natural resources and, in doing so, gain a fair return for shareholders who invest in those companies. For those reasons we have established a proper public process to enable the individual companies who employ people in Australia to model the government proposal and to open their books to enable us to assess some of the implementation difficulties announced by the Treasurer only last Sunday week. The resources tax consultation panel is led by David Parker of Treasury. I am also aware that since we announced it a number of companies have been—not once but on a number of occasions—to Treasury and to those involved in that consultation process to go through the detail of the government’s proposal. I also note, for the interest of the House, that some companies who have criticised the tax plan have done so before they have actually modelled it themselves, which they have admitted in private discussions with me, and before they have even registered for the consultation process. So I simply say to those companies that you cannot negotiate through the media, that tax is not easy and that they should take the time and do the modelling and sit down with the tax consultation panel for the purposes of informing both themselves and us about any complications arising from this proposal. I say that because in every reform proposal there is actually room for negotiations around the detail. I also say that for those reasons the panel has been told in no uncertain terms that its responsibility is to run the ruler over the new proposal project by project to assess, through a proper consultation process, how you actually get the finer detail right.
I also want to make it very clear that, from the government’s point of view, it is time for tax reform in the non-renewable sector of the Australian resources industry. Yes, the resources sector is part of our future and a vital part of our economy, but resources are also owned by the whole of the Australian community. The responsibility of government is to attract investment and also to make sure that the Australian community gets a fair return for the development of its resources. That is what this debate is about. It is not a debate confined to the Commonwealth government; it is also a debate that is ongoing before state and territory governments on a regular basis.
Just think about what is going on at a state level at this very moment. Last week we saw the Northern Territory Treasurer in the Northern Territory budget bring down an increase in royalties of two per cent because that government considered that the people of the Northern Territory were not getting a fair return on the development of their resources. We also appreciate—and it is public knowledge—that there is going to be a change by the Western Australian government in the iron ore royalty regime for two major companies as of budget day in Western Australia. That has been suggested as being an outcome of the order of $300 million from two companies just through one hit as a result of the Western Australian budget, which will be brought down in the very near future and imposed on two major companies.
Having spent a fair amount of time in Western Australia over recent weeks I can assure you that there are a number of other royalty proposals in the pipeline, which were known to individual companies and sections of the Western Australian mining industry. By way of interest I note that the Premier gave an undertaking only a matter of a week to 10 days ago that, on this occasion, he would not be acting on the gold royalty for this budget but made no undertakings beyond the forthcoming Western Australian budget.
That takes us to why we actually have to front up to reform. I accept that there is a lot of fear in the Australian community about the process of tax reform. That same fear and scaremongering was very much part of the initiatives of the Hawke and Keating governments when they brought in the petroleum resource rent tax 25 years ago. At that time we went through a process to actually get the detail right. That petroleum resource rent tax has proven to be one of the most stable tax regimes in the world. If you have any doubts about that, as I said in question time today, just think about recent investment decisions. In 2007 there was the Pluto Woodside project of $12 billion, and then the biggest ever single investment in Australia’s history by the Gorgon joint venture partners in 2009 of $43 billion.
I remind you that under that system Esso and BHP have extended the life of the Bass Strait for decades. That is because we actually made sensible changes. I also say that the introduction of that tax regime has—as the Prime Minister said today in question time, ‘What we do in this sector is different to other sectors of the Australian economy’—meant for the petroleum industry a reduction in compliance costs, the removal of inconsistencies and the establishment of a consistent, simple and effective tax regime. Compare that to what I have already touched on—the inconsistencies and differences that currently exist at the state and territory level.
I dealt with some of these issues in question time today. Why should there be different royalty regimes between New South Wales and Queensland on the issue of coalmining? There is no good reason. Why should there be different royalty regimes amongst the states with respect to the issue of iron ore mining, which extends across a number of state and territory boundaries? The time has come for the Australian government to actually do something about rationalising the nature of the tax system relating to the non-renewable resources sector in the Australian community and, in doing so, to put in place a consistent outcome which not only gives the Australian community a fair return on the development of its resources but also creates an opportunity for the government to plough financial resources back into resolving some of the pressures that the mineral sector is creating in the broader Australian community at this very point in time.
As far as I am concerned, we will get through this difficult dispute around the appropriate tax take in the development of the resources sector in the Australian community. On the way through we are also setting up our future. It is not just about a short-term change in the taxation regime; it is also about creating the opportunity for the long-term development of the industry associated with ongoing private sector investment in a key part of the Australian economy.
That takes me to some of the Australian government initiatives. I start by reminding the member for Groom of his desire, on a number of occasions as the previous minister, to put in place an incentive regime to encourage exploration in Australia. We might have a disagreement about the nature of the exploration incentive, but what we have in place, despite the failure of the previous government on three occasions to create such an incentive, is what I consider to be a major breakthrough for the smaller companies who face a competitive disadvantage in terms of exploration in Australia. I say that because, with respect to those smaller companies, the losses they generate from exploration often cannot be used to offset other taxable income. We actually had a debate about the appropriate form to developing an exploration incentive for that sector of the Australian community. Our intention is simply to rebate with significant benefits the exploration investment of small preprofit exploration companies at the company tax rate.
The proposal we have on the table with effect from 1 July of next year will also apply to the geothermal sector of the renewable energy industry in Australia. They need some assistance because, to my own way of thinking, that is where we will make one of the breakthroughs in renewable energy. That is akin to a baseload coal fired power station in Australia—reliable energy—which is so important to the future of Australia. We also not only put in place an exploration incentive but extended it to the geothermal industry as part of our energy security debate in the future. The proposal, to my way of thinking, is simpler and more effective and will promote investment, more so, I believe, than a flowthrough share scheme. The fact is that small exploration companies do not receive a tax benefit from their deductible exploration expenses until they have become profitable. This is of considerable assistance to the small end of town.
That also takes me to why we have to do this. I remind the House that the number of exploration meters drilled in 2009 fell 25 per cent, to just over seven million meters. Brownfield drilling in 2009, the year of the global financial crisis, represented 67 per cent—which is a real problem for Australia—of all exploration drilling, up from 61 per cent in 2008. That is why I hope, as a result of this incentive, we will not be putting in any rules as to how the incentive will be applied. I hope and encourage some of those exploration companies to trend away from brownfield exploration to invest in greenfield exploration because that exploration has the capacity to establish the opportunities for the big projects in 20 and 30 years time. A similar exploration, years ago, led to the discoveries of such important resources as Olympic Dam, the new Prominent Hill and the Mount Isa opportunities that Australia is benefiting from now.
I also want to go to the issue of infrastructure. For a long time we have underestimated the need for investment in infrastructure, in the resources sector, at Commonwealth level. The states have not been up to the task. In some ways, some of the difficulties we now confront in infrastructure represent the negligence by both state and territory governments and the Commonwealth government of investment in resource sector infrastructure. We are about making sure—through a $5.6 billion package over the next decade—that we have the capacity, federally, to work with state and territory governments and the resources sector to fund the roads, railways, ports and utilities so necessary to unlock Australia’s resource wealth. If you have any doubts about that you should go to the Pilbara. They have major infrastructure issues, and difficulties for the local people in that the cost of a house up there is $1.2 million because of a failure to put more land on the market for the purpose of residential subdivisions.
In conclusion, there are a variety of other benefits to small business, including facilitating investment in superannuation in Australia. This is a complex debate. The government is committed to getting it right through proper consultation. It is not an easy debate—in the mind of the opposition it clearly is an easy political target which is going to achieve huge political donations out of a particular sector. I commend the consultation process to the House.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2010-05-11,"—Once again, we are presented with a big new tax. This tax purports to be a resources superprofits tax, with the emphasis, no doubt, on profits. By so doing, it sounds good, safe and acceptable to attack the big, rich mining companies, and for good measure we throw in the fact that many of these companies are no longer in majority Australian ownership—a touch of xenophobia, as the shadow minister just put it.
I wonder what the Prime Minister’s motivation might be for this tax. Maybe he wants to be seen as a tough guy. Maybe he wants to show the unions he can slap down the big miners. But I suspect, above all, he wants to create yet another distraction from his broken promises, his woeful performances on such matters as health, the BER, the pink batts, the CPRS, GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch and other debacles—it goes on and on.
But this particular move is so inept that its downside effects and its implementation are creating lives of their own. Let me explain how. As the economist Tim Hughes said in the opening paragraph of his article in the
Courier Mail
yesterday:
The Prime Minister’s resources super profits tax is, without a doubt, the worst tax decision ever made by an Australian government. And the day after announcing it he could not even explain how it worked.
I just pose a rhetorical question: if John Hewson’s fumble on the application of the GST to a cake—to a cake, mind you—became the flashpoint for the 1993 election, how much worse is this tax, striking at the heart of Australia’s currently most successful industry, as a flashpoint for the 2010 election? Worse still, it is an attack on our international reputation as a secure home for investment. It raises important questions of sovereign risk as well as capital investment leaving our shores.
One example is Queensland’s gas resources and the effect of this tax on the development of Gladstone, which I represented for 14 years. The port city of Gladstone was born of industry and its future is industry, but this government has condemned it to the scrap heap. In recent years, investors have poured millions of dollars into the city on the back of the LNG boom which is about to occur. Families have moved there for work and people have set up businesses on the back of the anticipated growth. Because of the uncertainty arising from the government’s actions, we see at least one company, Santos, putting its plans for Gladstone on hold. If it had escaped the Prime Minister’s notice, there are $50 billion worth of coal seam gas to LNG projects in Queensland alone that are now at risk, in varying degrees. I have been told that that is the equivalent of 18,000 jobs a year, and we need every single one of those jobs for our towns, our state and our country.
Further afield, we hear Xstrata is ceasing exploration activities in the great North West Queensland Mineral Province. What does that mean for Mount Isa, Cloncurry and Townsville? Already, the Western Australian miner Cape Lambert Resources has cancelled exploration projects in Australia in favour of Africa. And no doubt, as we are debating this issue in parliament today, more examples of mining companies going cold on this government are emerging. Ironically, just last week we had the ministers of the Bligh government tripping all over Queensland with their new plans for regionalisation. What a cruel irony—when the federal government has effectively put regional Australia, particularly Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, on the chopping block.
Is this government deliberately setting out to kill regional communities and economies with this tax? I ask the question. One would have to seriously wonder about it. Even the premiers of the states cannot hide their disbelief and anger—and two of those premiers are Labor premiers. Honourable members will also be aware of pending coal developments throughout Central Queensland and the Surat Basin. Not only are expanding communities like Dalby, Chinchilla, Roma and Wandoan involved but new infrastructure such as railway lines is depending on these projects going ahead.
The trickle-down effect is even more insidious. Not only do we have miners and tradesmen working in the industry directly on site but we have another cohort of minors who fly in and fly out of Queensland’s provincial cities and towns. They support a vast array of shops and services not only on the coalfields but in expanding provincial cities like Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Rockhampton and Mackay. The mining industry also depends on an expert supply chain of dragline scoops, dozers, heavy trucks, loaders and so on. Engineering firms service equipment. Technicians maintain generators. Small businesses benefit by providing fuel, transport, food and other everyday living items. Health services and education should not be forgotten.
This is a pervasive tax that strikes at the heart of resource based states and—I repeat—particularly Queensland and Western Australia. But it does not even stop there. In the same way that mining is not confined to iron ore, coal and bauxite, this tax affects other forms of mining, such as quarrying and fertiliser extraction. We cry out for better roads and highways, but this tax will vastly increase the costs of gravels and screenings necessary for those roads and highways. Cement for the construction industry will be affected by the tax on the mining of limestone. Here we might reflect again on Gladstone. Not only is it the home of a limestone mine but it has the largest cement works in Australia.
This insidious tax invades the commercial and home construction industries, because not only do we need copious quantities of cement and concrete blocks but we also need bricks, and that involves the mining of clay. Therefore, expect dearer building supplies. Fertiliser is crucial for productive farming and in many instances also for experts. Phosphates are also mined in this country, so there will be a downstream effect on the cost of agricultural and horticultural products.
Some might say, ‘Oh, well: this is the price of progress in and around the mining sector.’ But it does not stop there, either. Let us have a look at the effect on the average investor. It is said that BHP has 400,000 small investors, many of whom would be mums and dads, and even kids, who have extensive or modest holdings in the Big Australian. In less than a fortnight, $90 billion has been written off the value of mining shares and, as such, off the investments of these Australians.
Even more insidious still is the impact on the superannuation sector. The retirement savings of every self-funded retiree and worker in this nation have been struck down by this new tax on mining. At the end of last year, Australian superannuation funds held approximately $1.2 trillion in assets. Around 30 per cent of large Australian superannuation funds were invested in shares. That is the equivalent of $370 billion. Mining shares account for around 30 per cent of our stock market. From that you can extrapolate that about 10 per cent of the assets of superannuation funds are invested in mining shares. This tax will have a profound effect on part-pensioners and self-funded retirees. In electorates like mine, the communities of Hervey Bay, Bundaberg and Bargara will suffer. Why? Because they have one of the highest retirement profiles in Australia. And a lot of the retirees there are self-funded retirees. This tax move will impact severely on them. Since the government’s announcement of this new tax, more than $14 billion has been wiped off the value of the superannuation savings of Australians.
In summary, it is not just a tax—as it has been characterised and as, no doubt, the ALP will continue to present it to their union mates—on ugly mining companies. It is worse than that. It is a slap at national wealth and opportunity and the remarkable industry that has driven this country for so long. It will affect myriads of ordinary Australians, starting from those working in the mining companies—many of which are likely to move their investments to more welcoming environments overseas. It will affect miners and all those working in the downstream industries that flow from mining. It will also affect the regional communities, especially those in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2010-05-11,"—The tax proposal to which we are referring today is the superprofit tax on resources companies. We are having this debate because the government has determined that it would be appropriate to discuss and propose an arrangement for an increased tax on our resources sector. Many years ago—30 years ago—I was a student at the Australian National University doing economics. I first heard of the idea of rent taxes—pure profit taxes—in the late 1970s and early 1980s when I was a student. The idea is simple: you tax the economic rent from a project or an entity and in doing so you do not compromise optimal economic decision making by that entity. It is very simple and it is very straightforward. Normal returns are preserved.
In the mid 1980s, the then Labor government proposed the petroleum resource rent tax. It came in with a long-term bond rate and a five per cent uplift factor on production and with a long-term bond rate plus 15 per cent uplift on exploration. It is a tax that has operated quietly for 25 years. It is wrong to think that its quiet and successful operation was not controversial. At the time of its introduction, we had had a move to global oil pricing in Australia—so-called world parity pricing. We had had the debate among states about their own excise regimes and royalty rates and about what we would do in the face of increased global energy prices. The inefficiencies in the oil taxation system in our country were significant.
At that time the resources minister sat down with his adviser—now a minister in this government, Craig Emerson—under the advice of Professor Ross Garnaut and discussed the proposal for a resource rent tax on the petroleum sector. It was not an easy discussion. The minister at that time has since told me of the reaction of the oil industry. It is true, as the shadow minister reflects, that BHP—nowadays BHP Petroleum but in those days BHP—understood the arithmetic that underpinned the idea of a rent tax, but not everyone did. He tells me of the oil entrepreneurs who would call him to their offices to receive their own corporate view of how damaging this new oil tax would be. He told me of how he as the Minister for Resources would refuse to go to their offices and would ask them to come to his. They came to his office and they received both a lesson in politics and a lesson in economics.
I do not think anyone these days, despite the 25 years of successful operation, seriously contends that the resource rent tax on the petroleum sector is not a good tax. But let me make you aware of this: no-one in the oil industry likes it; everyone in the oil and gas industry hates it. When I was an executive in Australia’s largest exploration and production company we would regularly face tirades from senior executives or board members who wished to get rid of that tax, who spent a lot of money doing research on how to get rid of that tax and who would argue that that tax must constrain the development of projects. But in a decade it was not possible to identify one project—not one project—that would have gone ahead if that tax had been removed.
Of course, the Minister for Resources and Energy has told us today of the investment decision by Woodside to go ahead with the Pluto project in a resource rent tax regime and the decision by Chevron and its partners to go ahead with the Gorgon project, a $40 billion plus investment in a resource rent tax regime. We know that the particular form of taxation that we are proposing here is not an exact replica of the resource rent tax. It is not. It contains a number of elements that are in many ways substantial improvements on the resource rent tax. It allows portability of expenses. It allows for incentives for projects into the future. But, most importantly, I was reminded just 24 hours ago of the review of taxation being conducted for those opposite—the opposition—by Henry Ergas, formerly, as I understand it, a department of finance officer. For 15 months or more the coalition has sat on its own tax review. We are told via media reports—one published in February of this year—that the Ergas report recommends a resource rent tax. We are told—and this is the quote: ‘There are significant benefits to the Resource Rent Tax approach because it tries to quarantine tax to economic rents.’ You would only tax above a normal rate of return.
What does that tell you? It tells you that the coalition’s own economic adviser and author of its own tax review has championed the idea of a resource rent tax. We also know that, of the 25 years of quiet operation of the resource rent tax, 12 were under opposition—coalition—governments. And we know that the tax was not dismantled, removed or taken away. We know that the government appreciated the integrity of that tax and we know that the government enjoyed the revenues from it. How do we know that? We simply look at the record.
I remind people again of the quote from Henry Ergas that there are significant benefits to the resource rent tax approach. What does that mean? The tax is structured so that it does not change any of the fundamental project economics behind an investment or an operation. We know that the Minerals Council of Australia supports the tax model, and we know that the Minerals Council of Australia has supported this tax proposal because it creates harmony of the taxation system between the states. We know that bauxite mining in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia face different taxation regimes. If you are a resource owner looking at tenements in any of those three states, you know that you face different taxation regimes and charges across the board. For iron ore in Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia, different royalty regimes operate. For coal in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia, again substantially different rates of taxation apply. So it is not surprising that the bosses of the mining industry associations in Queensland, in South Australia, in Western Australia and elsewhere have asked for certainty in the fiscal arrangements and not for political squabbling. They have asked for certainty in the way in which the taxation regime works.
In the course of the last seven or eight days since the announcement of these proposals we have also had substantial industry interaction with the government to negotiate, to understand, to get it right—to engage in dialogue to get the taxation system right. I sometimes wonder if members opposite are at all interested in getting the taxation system right. I have thought that for a long time. Sometimes they will find a good tax and just stay with it because it is a good idea, as they did with the resource rent tax in the petroleum sector. But sometimes they just see a good earner and they lock onto it. Sometimes they see a good idea for party fundraising and they get in behind it with both paws. I quote from a story in today’s
Australian:
Senior Liberal Party sources said it would be helpful if mining companies changed their rules to allow political donations to bolster the Coalition’s campaign.
Here we go: we are supposed to be having a debate here about taxes. We are supposed to be having a debate around resource taxes. We are supposed to be having a debate around a resource super tax. But no, what we actually have here is an opportunity to fundraise. Let us not kid ourselves. The debate here is not about a resource tax; the debate here was appropriately pinged in the
Australian
this morning. The angry miners said they were unlikely to tip a bucket of money to the coalition’s war chest. Do you blame them? They said it would be unwise. Of course it is unwise. It is unwise because the miners fundamentally are most interested in getting a taxation system right. They have been wound up into fever pitch sometimes by their own supporters—fever pitch designed to create less serious consideration around the proposition for a tax. If they can, they will knock it out and not pay it. As I said, I worked for a company that worked very hard to try to get this tax ameliorated, changed or removed because companies—guess what?—just do not like paying tax. The other thing we learn from the newspaper today is that they just do not like making donations to the Liberal Party either.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2010-05-11,"—It is good to be able to follow the member for Groom and the member for Hinkler. But I fear for the member for Brand because he talks about fundraising. I have seen the fundraising letters that go out from the member for Brand. We have seen those go out asking for donations of up to $10,000 because they do not have to be declared. So do not let the member for Brand bring on the fundraising stuff. I fear for him because I know how many fly-in fly-out residents he has in the electorate of Brand. You have a lot, and they are hopping mad.
Make no mistake: the resources supertax is already impacting negatively on the lives and the futures of all Australians, and in particular Western Australians. It is real. We heard last week that Western Australian iron ore miner Cape Lambert Resources will pull out of exploration projects in WA and move to Africa. I fear there will be more to follow. What we should ask is: who is next? This government or this Prime Minister decided that any profit above six per cent is a superprofit. How can someone who has been in business—and I know the member for Brand has been in business—arbitrarily say that above six per cent is a superprofit? How can you say that?

Mr Gray interjecting—
—Did he say ‘six per cent’? The member for Brand interjects. Does he say ‘six per cent’?
—It is normal.
—Yes, normal! I say to every business in Australia: beware. If you earn more than six per cent, watch out in the future. This government cannot be trusted to stop at the mining industry to support their superspending program. Big and small businesses in WA have condemned the tax. Large mining companies have also expressed major concerns. It seems the only people not concerned are the government. In this House today the PM refused to rule out further industries being taxed by this government that considers profit above six per cent as super.
As a representative for the people of Swan I am urging the government not to ignore the thousands of people, many within my electorate, asking the government not to bring in this supertax. They are worried about their jobs. This will affect the residents of Swan regardless of whether they are connected to the resource industry. There will be job losses in Swan—and, I am sure, also in Brand—which the Rudd Labor government will be held responsible for. Seniors in particular over the last week have contacted my office about the damage of the Rudd Labor government announcement on their superannuation and about the pain they will feel. The residents of Swan expect real action from their government, real action on border protection, real action on reducing the debt and real action on insulation compensation for homes affected by airport noise—not just a new tax to cover up their superspending program. This is not a tax on superprofits; this is a supertax.
According to the statistics in the WA government Department of Mines and Petroleum website, close to 70,000 people are employed in the local mining sector, and the flow-on effect of many people’s future being in doubt will reverberate not only through the WA economy but through the national economy. Before the 2007 election Kevin Rudd promised WA a fairer share of the take and a $100 million infrastructure fund. To all WA people: we have not got them, and we now only get 68c in the dollar for every dollar we contribute in the GST system from our great state. The member for Batman also talked about a fairer system. This is why they want to introduce this tax: a fairer system. Where is the fairness in Western Australia only getting 68c in the GST system?
This is just a grab by the government to nationalise and to centralise funding out of the mining sector. The PM said WA would get more through this new infrastructure fund from this supertax. Well, Mr Rudd, we in WA do not believe you. You cannot be trusted. I have read through the recently completed Radar Group study commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia,
Institutional investor perception study: impact of the proposed resource super profits tax. All the institutional investors surveyed believe the government’s adoption of this tax was ill-conceived and will have a highly detrimental effect on the Australian economy. We are talking about an industry that over the last 10 years has paid $80 billion in royalties and company tax. The Prime Minister talks about $9 billion a year. Multiply that by 10 and that is $90 billion a year he wants to take out of an industry that has only paid $80 billion over the last decade. This is just a government that has lost control of everything it is involved with.
Even in Redcliffe there is something that you would know about. Here is a picture of a sign there that says: ‘Miners in. Rudd out.’ They are getting it there. They are getting it all about this Prime Minister. They know what it is all about. It is all about him.
—How long did it take you to put up?
—If you want to go down to Redcliffe, you should ask the people in Redcliffe how long it took them to get it up. This industry was built on sheer hard work.(Time expired)

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2010-05-11,"—I rise to speak in support of the initiatives that the government has handed down as part of its tax package. It is a tax package that will strengthen the economy and a package that will make our tax system both simpler and fairer. I want to address some of the issues that were raised earlier in this debate, but I think to give this some context we have to remember that the two competing sides in this argument—the parties that come to this debate—have been engaged in this struggle before. There are the builders, those who are committed to securing and sharing the national wealth in the national interest, and there are those who are prepared to preserve sectional interests and to oppose changes that are in the national interest.
Let us have a look at the petroleum resource rent tax, which even those on the other side now seem to acknowledge is a fair tax that ensures Australians are able to capture a fair share of the mineral resources being exploited by companies. Let us go back to when that tax was introduced. No-one wants to talk about the fact that those on the other side, in the same way as they are now running around saying the whole world will fall in, opposed that tax. If I can quote a Liberal Party frontbencher at the time, Alexander Downer—someone, I know, a lot of people on that side of the House have a lot of respect for—he said:
The resource rent tax which will be introduced by this Government will only make matters considerably worse because it will impose a new burden upon those people who are prepared to put money up front and to go out and explore for oil. It will put a new burden on the risk takers in the oil industry, apparently because the Government, for reasons of its own, resents and despises these people.
Sounds familiar. The National Party leader at the time, Ian Sinclair, said:
With the proposed resource rent tax on 40 per cent, very few high risk exploration prospects will be capable of proceeding or are likely to proceed. Indeed, they are likely to be most unattractive.
That is what they said, back when the petroleum resource rent tax was being introduced. What have we seen since then? We no longer see the opposition from those on the other side. In fact, whilst in government they were prepared to take advantage of some of the benefits of having collected that resource rent tax over time. And we see that we have had projects such as the Pluto project, worth $12 billion, and the Gorgon project, the biggest single project in Australian history, worth $43 billion, proceed and progress under this set of tax arrangements. So, when they talk about a resource rent tax or the resource superprofits tax stifling investment, let’s have a look at the record of what actually occurred and was achieved under the petroleum resource rent tax.
One of the big fallacies that is brought forward by those on the other side is where they come in and say, ‘This big scary tax, this big supertax on everything.’ It is not a tax on everything. But ‘this big tax’, they say, has depleted the superannuation savings of poor pensioners, superannuants and retirees all around this country. It is interesting that they should say that, because those who actually know something about superannuation, the Industry Super Network, released a report yesterday dismissing the opposition’s claims. Their research indicates that for a member with a super balance of $50,000, which is the average super balance for members of an industry fund, last week’s volatility in mining shares on the ASX—which they all attribute to the suggestion that we are going to introduce a resource superprofits tax—would amount, for someone with an average balance, to a variation to the fund balance of $57. That is the impact: $57. Most observers would suggest that the impact we have seen on mining shares in the last week is not going to be an ongoing thing and is a temporary reaction to what has occurred.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2010-05-11,"—by leave—The Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act requires the committee to consider draft estimates for the Audit Office, with the chair ultimately making a statement to the House on budget day on whether, in our opinion, the Auditor-General has been given sufficient funding to carry out his duties. In support of this process the Auditor-General is empowered under his act to disclose to the committee his budget proposals, which we then consider and use to make representations to government as necessary. This process reflects both the committee’s status as the parliament’s audit committee and the Auditor-General’s status as an independent officer of the parliament.
The committee met with the Auditor-General in February to review the Audit Office’s budget proposals for the coming financial year. The Auditor-General advised that he would be seeking additional funding of $5.6 million, over five years, in this year’s budget. The additional funding was to be applied in three main areas. First, the Audit Office sought $5.3 million for audit work required following the establishment and projected expansion of the National Broadband Network Company Ltd. This additional audit work is mandatory under section 13 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, which requires the Audit Office to audit the financial statements of Commonwealth companies and their subsidiaries. The additional expense will be offset in full by audit fee revenue, although in this context it is important to note that such revenue is returned to the budget rather than being available to the Audit Office.
As I said in my corresponding statement last year, the committee believes that the Audit Office should be fully funded for any new obligations that government places upon it, particularly where new agencies are established. The committee is therefore pleased that the Audit Office will receive the additional funding it sought in this year’s budget in relation to the NBN Company Ltd. The committee also notes that the recent transfer of the office of Indigenous evaluation and audit from the Department of Finance to the Audit Office has been properly accompanied by ongoing funding of approximately $4 million per year.
The Auditor-General advised the committee in February that he would also be seeking an additional $1.5 million over five years in support of his reviews of compliance of proposed government advertising campaigns with guidelines for agencies issued in July 2008. This funding request was withdrawn late in the budget process when, following a review of the guidelines by Dr Allan Hawke, the Auditor-General’s role in providing review reports on proposed advertising campaigns was abolished, on 31 March.
Finally, the Audit Office sought $5.3 million for the period 2009-10 to 2013-14, partially offset by audit fees of approximately $1.2 million, to meet the workload associated with the full revision to the Australian auditing and assurance standards, which reflects changes to international auditing standards. As a result of these changes some 41 revised auditing standards become effective in 2010-11. The changes result in an increase of about a third in mandatory auditing procedures, with the extent of new requirements exceeding 20 per cent. The changes therefore increase financial statement audit efforts significantly and require updates to audit methodology and related training.
The Audit Office has not been successful in its bid for funding this year for this additional workload. While this is disappointing, the committee acknowledges that in last year’s budget the Audit Office, with the committee’s strong support, received an additional $20.1 million over four years. This enabled the Audit Office to restore its target number of performance audits to the traditional level of around 50 audits per year, following a reduction to 45 for the 2008-09 financial year. The Audit Office’s total revenue from government is estimated at $73 million in 2010-11. The Auditor-General has advised that the appropriation for the year ahead will allow him to meet his obligations, including maintaining his targets for production of performance audit reports and public sector better practice guides. The committee therefore endorses the budget proposed for the Audit Office for 2010-11.
However, the committee is concerned by the lack of new funding in support of the revision to the auditing and assurance standards. While the new standards should enhance public confidence in the quality and relevance of all its services, the committee is of the view that they will significantly increase the effort required to audit the financial statements of public sector entities. Based on its internal analysis and external assessments—most notably from the United Kingdom—the Audit Office estimates that the new requirements will result in an average increase of five per cent in financial statement audit effort, based on its auditee profile of 275 small entities and 34 material entities.
Given that the financial statement audits and the associated professional standards are mandatory obligations for the Audit Office, there is a risk that ongoing budget pressure in this important area of audit activity may in time force the Auditor-General to, again, reduce his program of performance audits and better practice guides. The committee continues to assert that any such downgrade would be a false economy and not in the interests of either the parliament or the people it serves. The committee notes that the Auditor-General made a similarly unsuccessful request in last year’s budget for additional funding to meet the costs of the revision to the auditing and assurance standards, and previously received only partial funding for the substantial increase in audit workload arising from the introduction, from 2008-09, of the general government sector financial statement. The committee therefore flags its support for any request by the Auditor-General in next year’s budget process for additional funding to meet the costs of the revised auditing standards.
In the longer term, the committee also notes that the Auditor-General has previously suggested that it would be desirable to have in place arrangements that allow the Audit Office’s funding to be adjusted in line with changes in the scale of the public sector. We agree that this matter requires further consideration to ensure that the Audit Office is properly funded into the future and able to discharge its responsibilities to the parliament.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2010-05-11,"—I rise to speak on the
Information Commissioner Bill 2009
and the
Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009. Freedom of information, the statutory right of access to government documents, is justified on the grounds that it encourages transparency and political accountability and discourages corruption and other forms of wrongdoing. At the federal level, it was the Fraser government that first introduced freedom of information into Australia in 1982 through the Freedom of Information Act of the same year. This formed part of a broader package of administrative law reforms promulgated during the 1970s and 1980s, and this made Australia the first country with a Westminster system of government to legislate for freedom of information. In subsequent years, following the Commonwealth’s taking the lead, similar legislation was passed in all Australian states and territories.
As noted in the
Bills Digest
for the FOI Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009, these FOI acts have certain major features in common. First, government is obliged to publish information about its activities in general and about whether it holds certain kinds of documents. Second, every person has a legal right to obtain access to information in documentary form, subject to the operation of specific exemptions and exclusions, which is in the possession of ministers or government agencies. Exemptions can apply to specified agencies—for example, our domestic or international intelligence agencies or the police forces of the state jurisdictions—or to categories of documents, such as documents that deal with international relations or international security. A third feature of FOI acts is the personal privacy dimension, which enables a person who has gained access to a document held by government that relates to his or her personal affairs to request that the document be amended in some respect, to appeal against a refusal to amend the document and—even if the appeal is unsuccessful—to request that an annotation be attached to accompany the record when it is shown to any other person. The last feature common to all the FOI regimes is a right of review in relation to most decisions made under the acts—that is, internal review within the agency and further review by a body external to the decision maker.
The Rudd government’s position on freedom of information, like so much of what we see from this government, mirrors its failings in other policy areas. Prior to the 2007 federal election the Rudd government was very heavy on rhetoric, but after it was elected FOI was added to its list of comprehensive policy failures and broken promises. When in opposition, Rudd Labor stated:
A Rudd Labor Government will restore trust and integrity in the use of Commonwealth Government information, promoting a pro-disclosure culture and protecting the public interest through genuine reform.
The Labor Party when in opposition described its approach to making information more accessible to the general public with the colourful phrase Operation Sunlight. However, although the government is very good at sloganeering, it is very bad at follow-through. The Labor Party’s election policy document was entitled
Government information: restoring trust and integrity in government information. This document foreshadowed significant changes to freedom of information legislation. It stated that a Labor government would abolish conclusive certificates and implement the recommendations of the
Open government: a review of the federal Freedom of Information Act 1982
report. It is interesting to note that the government promised a pro-disclosure policy and cultural change when it came to freedom of information requests, but its own figures, quietly released three days before Christmas last year, show that its rhetoric on FOI has failed to match that reality. Doesn’t the fact that the government released the report on its failure to adhere to its Operation Sunlight promises three days before Christmas say everything about how this government operates?
The
2008-09 Freedom of information annual report
shows that the Labor government have refused more FOI requests than did the previous coalition government. The government’s own figures show there is less freedom of information under the Rudd government than there was under the Howard government. The Rudd government’s heroic pro-disclosure rhetoric from opposition stands in stark contrast to the cold, hard statistical reality that they have implemented since they have been in government. The annual report is dated 31 October 2009, but the Rudd government waited until 22 December, a time when the political cycle is at a pretty low ebb, to quietly release it because it contained a litany of their failures in this area. The timing of the report’s release alone demonstrates the reality of the Rudd government’s attitude to disclosure. My colleague, the shadow Attorney-General, Senator George Brandis, was quoted in the
Australian
on 30 December 2009:
A reduction in the number of successful FOI applications of 10 per cent, and an increase in the number of outright refusals of almost 1 1/2 times, is certainly evidence of a change of culture within the government towards the release of information. Unfortunately, it demonstrates that the trend is in the opposite direction from that promised by Faulkner.
Far from bringing about the dawn of a new age of access to government information, the Rudd government has done the very opposite. As Senator Brandis also noted:
The exemptions in the FOI Act were invoked to block disclosure in 6.1 per cent of cases. By comparison, in the last full year of the Howard government, only 4.4 per cent of FOI applications were refused outright. The number of applications granted in part only was 22.9 per cent. The comparable figure in the last year of the Howard government was 15 per cent. In all, only 71 per cent of applications were granted in full; the comparable figure in the last year of the Howard government was 80.6 per cent.
As noted by the coalition senators in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration’s report, the cost of facilitating FOI requests has also increased substantially under the Rudd Labor government. From the last full financial year of the Howard government until the first full financial year of the Rudd government, the cost of FOI increased from just under $25 million to over $30 million—an increase of over 21 per cent. Given the increasing cost of facilitating FOI requests and the decline in the number of FOI access requests, in the two years between 2006-07 and 2008-09 there has been an extraordinary increase in the average cost per FOI request. In 2006-07 the average cost per FOI request was $642, whereas in 2008-09 the cost per request was $1,101—an increase of 71 per cent over two years. These facts contradict Labor’s purported commitment to ‘promoting a pro-disclosure culture and protecting the public interest’. The government’s commitment to a pro-disclosure culture was put to the test last year. The behaviour of public servants in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency in their response to an FOI request from Dr Richard Denniss from the Australia Institute was reported in the
Australian
on 30 January 2010. The article read:
Even though the department rang Denniss to confirm that he wanted advice to the minister, and the department’s lawyers said this was covered by the request, it was excluded on the instruction of departmental head … and his deputy …
Not easily deterred, Denniss fired in another request asking for documents prepared to help inform Wong—
that is, Senator Wong—
and her advisers of the details, merits, limitations and criticisms of the ETS. The response: he may be able to get what he wants if he hands over $256,586.98—
over a quarter of a million dollars—
although, catch-22, if he proceeds with his request, the department may decide it involves an unreasonable diversion of resources.
It is not clear what else the department of climate change actually have to do, but clearly they were not keen under this minister to facilitate Operation Sunlight, so proudly announced by Labor in opposition and so woefully adhered to in government. This example about a prominent public policy issue further illustrates that the Labor government is not honouring its election commitment to create a pro-disclosure culture and that Labor’s rhetoric on FOI does not match the reality of continued denial of access to information.
I move to some of the specifics. The Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009 contains key amendments: (1) introducing an information publication scheme which would require agencies to proactively disclose more information to the public (2) changing the time periods for access under the Archives Act, from 30 years to 20 years for all documents and from 50 years to 30 years for cabinet notebooks (3) abolishing FOI application fees, abolishing all charges for a person seeking access to their own information, making the first hour of decision-making time charge free for all FOI requests and allowing a five-hour charge free period for journalists and not-for-profit organisations (4) a single public interest test for disclosure (5) extending the FOI Act to cover documents held by service providers to the government and (6) introducing an objects clause to emphasise that the aim of the act is to give the Australian community access to information held by the government.
The bill that we are debating concurrently, the Information Commissioner Bill 2009, establishes the Office of the Information Commissioner, which was part of the reform of the FOI regime announced in March 2009. The functions of this office will be threefold: the FOI functions, which are about giving the Australian community access to information held by the government in accordance with the FOI Act; the privacy functions, which are about protecting the privacy of individuals in accordance with the Privacy Act and other acts; and the Information Commissioner functions, which are strategic functions concerning advice to government on information management.
As noted in the bill’s explanatory memorandum, the Information Commissioner, which is a new position, will be head of the office. The Information Commissioner will be able to perform all of the functions of that office. To ensure a workable governance arrangement, the Information Commissioner will be head of the office both strategically and administratively. Provision is made in the bill to ensure that no duplication arises in carrying out functions between the three commissioners and to ensure that no disagreement arises in the discharge of those functions.
The FOl Commissioner, which is also a new position, will mainly perform the FOI functions. For flexibility, the FOI Commissioner will also be able to perform the privacy functions. The Privacy Commissioner is an existing position established under the Privacy Act; however, the Privacy Commissioner will be appointed under this bill. The Privacy Commissioner will mainly perform the privacy functions. For flexibility, the Privacy Commissioner will also be able to perform the FOI functions. It is proposed in the bill that the existing Office of the Privacy Commissioner be amalgamated into the Office of the Information Commissioner.
The FOl functions of the Information Commissioner include: promoting an understanding of the FOI Act; assisting agencies to publish information in accordance with the publication scheme; providing guidelines, advice and training to agencies; and conducting investigations and reviews of decisions. In effect, it will perform an ombudsman’s role in relation to information matters.
I understand that discussions are underway between the opposition and the government regarding the onus of proof provision. Whilst the coalition supports these bills in principle, further amendments will be made in the Senate. I trust that the government and the opposition, with a bit of goodwill on both sides, will be able to find common ground on these two bills. As mentioned in the
Bills Digest
regarding the FOI Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009, there is an argument that in a number of areas the reforms do not go far enough. A common theme in submissions to the Senate inquiry was that, while the bill repeals a small number of exemptions, it retains an almost entirely untouched list of excluded agencies and documents held by certain agencies listed in schedule 2 of the FOI Act.
The two bills are not the end of the story. In relation to two key aspects of the FOI Act—namely, access to and amendment of one’s own personal information and the imposition of processing charges for FOI requests—the government has promised further reform. However, by the government’s own reckoning, access to government information is much less free today than it was prior to the change of government. The coalition have consistently stated support for any reforms to the freedom of information regime that would result in improved public access to information. So, whilst we commend this bill and support it in principle, it is on the basis that in the past two years freedom of information has gone substantially backwards under Kevin Rudd and his Labor government.",REPS,<title>INFORMATION COMMISSIONER BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2010-05-11,"—I am proud to support the two bills before the House: the
Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009
and the
Information Commissioner Bill 2009. These bills represent the most substantial reforms to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 since it was enacted by this parliament. It is somewhat regrettable, perhaps even laughable, to hear from an opposition spokesman claiming that the coalition has a commitment to open and responsible government and indeed, by the selection of a handful of statistics or a handful of anecdotes, seeking to ignore the major nature of the reforms that are contained in this legislation.
There has already been very substantial reform contained in legislation considered by this House, namely the Freedom of Information (Removal of Conclusive Certificates and Other Measures) Bill 2008, which was debated last year. That marked the first stage of amendments to the freedom of information regime. Really, the removal of conclusive certificates and what the conclusive certificates represented tells all the story that one needs to know about the true or actual commitment of the coalition to open government. Conclusive certificates, of course, were what lay at the heart of the former government’s resistance to the release of information, notably in a case where the former government went all the way to the High Court. It was a case brought by Michael McKinnon, a very senior News Ltd journalist, who was requesting documents that were concerned with bracket creep and material relating to the first home owners scheme—precisely the kind of material one might expect to see being requested under freedom of information legislation. The former government’s attitude to FOI was revealed by the way in which that request was refused and then fought at every single level all the way to the High Court of Australia.
This government’s first legislative act in relation to the freedom of information regime was to abolish those conclusive certificates provisions, and as was foreshadowed by the former Special Minister of State, Senator Faulkner, we now have before the House the substantial set of reforms contained in these two bills. They are a set of reforms that have been long awaited because they are based not merely on more recent reviews and reviews by the Attorney-General’s Department and not merely on what has been very longstanding Australian Labor Party policy. They are based on a review that was finalised by a joint report by the Administrative Review Council and the Australian Law Reform Commission in 1996. It contained a very large number of recommendations. It was itself, at that point, the most substantial review that had been conducted of the Commonwealth freedom of information legislation. As was commented on at the very start of that joint report of the ALRC and the Administrative Review Council, at that point—some 13 years since the act had come into operation—it was long enough for the shortcomings of the legislation to have been uncovered and for some very coherent work to be done on what changes were appropriate to make the freedom of information regime work better.
But that extensive report, the Open Government report of those two bodies, was ignored by the former government for the whole of its term of office. The very substantial reforms, which were carefully thought through and were the subject of very many submissions that were considered by those two bodies in their substantial report, were all ignored by the former government, and that is where we see the true commitment of the coalition parties to open government and to freedom of information—which is, of course, no commitment at all. We had to wait for the Rudd Labor government to come to office, bringing with it very detailed commitments for amendments to the freedom of information regime, for there to be an enactment and legislation presented in this House, first abolishing conclusive certificates and followed up by this set of comprehensive reforms to the whole regime, which will change the system. That is why the complaints voiced by the member for Stirling should be seen as the laughable complaints that they are. Rather than talk about the substantial reforms contained in this legislation, we had reference only to a handful of statistics—pretty much the same approach that was taken by the coalition senators participating in the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee which looked at this legislation. The coalition senators participating in the report—Senators Brandis, Ryan and Kroger—commenced their dissenting report with the risible claim:
The Coalition is committed to responsible and open government.
As I have said, the record of the former government speaks for itself. It had before it this extraordinarily detailed report by the two bodies—the ALRC and the Administrative Review Council—and chose to ignore all of those recommendations. There was no action to reform the freedom of information system and from that report—indicating that at that point some 13 years had passed since the act had been passed—we have had to wait another 14 or 15 years to get to this legislation before the House of Representatives in order to have substantial reform.
It is the case that freedom of information legislation deals only with one form of release of government information. Government information is released by this parliament collectively, it is released and made available to the public by members of this parliament individually, it is made available by ministers and it is made available by government departments. It should not be thought that the Freedom of Information Act is in any sense a code which fully describes the means by which government information is to be made available. What it does is to provide an additional means by which government information can be made available, and it does so because it is recognised, or at least recognised in democracies throughout the world, that the provision of information empowers citizens; that the provision of government information in every sense creates better government and in every sense makes it possible for citizens to participate more fully in the processes of government and for those engaged in the process of government, being members of this parliament, government ministers and officers of departments, to govern better.
I wish to comment briefly on the creation of the new offices, which is the purpose of the Information Commissioner Bill. The bill adds to the existing office of Privacy Commissioner the office of FOI Commissioner and the office of Information Commissioner, and it uses those newly created offices to set up a structure by which, for the first time in our freedom of information system, there will be a champion of FOI. There will also be a simpler means for review of freedom of information decisions, and there will also be, through the Information Commissioner, the possibility of review of all of the processes of FOI within the government, which will go a great distance towards what should be the true aim of a freedom of information regime, which is to create a culture in which governments and government departments and agencies are encouraged to release information. It should not be thought that freedom of information can ever be left completely to some code which lists in a prescriptive way the means and opportunities for obtaining information; rather, there should be a vibrant culture of release of information, where at all possible—a proactive culture of making information available—and it should not be left for citizens to make requests in order for information to be made available.
The
Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill
starts with what I would suggest is a very, very substantial reform, and that is to replace the objects of the Freedom of Information Act with a new provision. It is a very important provision because it makes clear that access to information is a right and makes clear that there are requirements on agencies to publish information. It makes clear that this parliament intends to promote representative democracy by increasing public participation in government processes by increasing scrutiny, discussion, comment and review of the government’s activities and, as well, by increasing recognition that information held by the government is to be managed for public purposes and is a national resource. It is important that that kind of object be stated right at the outset of legislation like this so as to put beyond doubt any suggestion that the Freedom of Information Act is intended to be in some sense restrictive or in any way intended to fully describe the opportunities that are provided for access to government information. Rather, it needs to be understood that an FOI regime, and in particular the freedom of information regime of this Commonwealth, is a tool—it is something that is there to assist in better government and assist citizens to participate in the government of the Commonwealth.
The specific other provisions I would comment on, apart from the objects clause, include the tidying up, if I can call it that, of the exemption provisions, which is important because anything that can assist in making this legislation easier to read and simpler to use is to be commended. There is a set of provisions which will now require the publication of a range of information, as well as provisions which specify how and when information is to be published by agencies of the Commonwealth and encourage the provision of such access.
There are further amendments in relation to the form of public interest test which is weighted towards disclosure. This is something that will, again, assist in ensuring that proper consideration is given to requests for information. The Victorian freedom of information legislation has for many years contained reference to public interest, which operates in that legislation as a form of override or reason why, despite an exemption having been made out, documents ought to be released because the public interest requires such access. The Commonwealth legislation will through these amendments now include clear public interest provisions which include a set of factors that will favour access, including promoting the objects of the act, to which I have already referred, informing debate about matters of public importance, promoting effective oversight of public expenditure or allowing a person to access his or her own personal information.
What is also important is that this public interest test makes clear that a range of matters are not to be taken into account in a public interest assessment. They include whether or not access to a document would result in embarrassment to the Commonwealth government or cause a loss of confidence in the government. I repeat: that is a factor not to be taken into account in a public interest assessment. Further, and this is a matter that has been sometimes raised by government agencies in resisting disclosure, it puts to rest the suggestion that access to the document resulting in any person misinterpreting or misunderstanding the document could ever be a relevant factor. That too will not be something that is taken into account in public interest considerations. There are two more factors which are not to be taken into account in the public interest evaluation. The first is that the author of the document is or was of high seniority in the agency to which the request for access is made. That is ruled out as something that might be taken into account in a public interest matter. Secondly, ruled out from consideration in the public interest evaluation is the proposition that access to the document could result in confusion or unnecessary debate.
This is a piece of legislation which puts trust in the citizens of Australia. It rests on the proposition that political debate in this country and the participation of citizens in the government of this country will be assisted by the provision of information—and the more the better. That is why we see this sort of provision, which says no-one in future will be allowed to go and suggest in the review processes, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or before the Information Commissioner or to the Federal Court of Australia, that simply because the release of the document might result in confusion or unnecessary debate that would be a reason in the public interest for it not to be released—and so it should be, because that judgment, as to whether or not the release of a document might result in confusion or unnecessary debate, is an extraordinarily subjective judgment. I, as someone who has participated in more freedom of information cases than I care to remember, can say that I am very pleased to see that argument, as a reason for not allowing the release of a document, put to rest.
It is, of course, the case that the public interest underlies many of the exemptions. We have a clear public interest in refusing to release national security documents. We have a clear public interest in refusing to release documents that are sourced from the intelligence community. The way in which the new public interest provisions work recognises that there are competing public interests and that there are public interests which favour nondisclosure as well as public interests which favour disclosure. This proposed act contains a rebalancing of the provisions which were there before in a clearer way and will lead—and this is what the coalition has failed to recognise—to a system that promotes disclosure and a system in which information will be more accessible.
I end by again referring to the claims that have been repeatedly made—the ones that were recently made in the Senate committee process by Senator Brandis and other coalition senators and were made throughout last year by Senator Brandis—about the coalition’s supposed commitment to open and responsible government. They are laughable claims. Their failure to implement the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Administrative Review Council’s recommendations from 1996 speak for themselves. That failure shows the true commitment.

",REPS,<title>INFORMATION COMMISSIONER BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2010-05-11,"—I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, for the call—a busy day in the parliament and we are looking forward to another session of the parliament later this evening. I recognise that the members of the Left Right Think-Tank, Australia’s first think tank for young Australians, are here in parliament today for the budget. They will, of course, be interested in the bill on freedom of information that we are discussing. That certainly interests young people as well as interesting the rest of the Australian population. To the member for Isaacs: I could not agree more with your contribution. I think we will probably hear more of the same from the member for Moreton in due course—a very fine Queenslander, I might add.
—Hear, hear!
—People do not understand that there can be good friendships with those on the other side of the parliament. I remain a little bit cynical, though, I am afraid, about this particular bill and I am going to go through it and outline why I remain cynical. I will challenge the member for Isaacs over his comments about Senator Brandis and reflect on what is currently the situation within the Australian government.
I think we all agree with the purpose of the
Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009. It is to amend the FOI Act 1982 to ‘usher in a new regime for access to government information’. How could you disagree with that? It is an absolutely laudable object. The second object of the bill is to ‘promote a pro-disclosure attitude’. I hope that the bureaucracy of the government departments out there hears this loud and strong and clear, because that is what we need. This bill is intended to deliver more effective and efficient access to government information and promote a culture of disclosure across government. But let us have a look at what is happening at the moment, and I will give you a case study: the Department of Defence. Never have I seen a more paranoid department. It does not matter what you ask of the department as the answer is, ‘No, we can’t tell you.’ Their attitude goes completely against the grain of the philosophy of this bill and it has got to change.
I will give the parliament a specific example. Defence is normally considered a bipartisan operation and all of us are very mindful of the work that the members of the ADF do for our country. We are all supportive of the Defence Force. I am particularly supportive because, within Australia, I have the largest defence concentration in my electorate in Townsville with the Army at Lavarack Barracks and the Air Force at RAAF Townsville. It is a very, very significant base and Australia’s most modern base. I take a keen interest in defence. I look after the people in the Defence Force.
When issues arise in Afghanistan and the media finds something and blows it up out of all proportion and you know that what they are saying is wrong, you want to stand up for the men and women of the ADF in your electorate and you want to give the media information that is correct. So what do you do? You ring the media ops section of Defence at Russell in Canberra. There are probably 100 employees in media ops. It is called Defence public affairs as well. You say, ‘This is what the papers are saying. I know this not to be true. Give me a couple of lines that I can use in the media to defend the Australian Defence Force in Townsville.’ Their answer is, ‘Look, I’m sorry, we can’t talk to you.’ They know that I am not going to misuse any information and that I need information for the right reasons. I explain that carefully and the answer is no, we cannot tell you. Then they say, ‘You have to ask the minister.’ I have been down that process a number of times. What happens when you ask the minister, effectively, is that you put a request in writing to the minister’s office for information. It will take days if not weeks to get a response. And by the time it comes through the issue has long gone.
In the last instance I said to Defence public affairs, ‘You’re there to look after the public, to provide information, that is your role. Here I am. I’m a member of parliament but I’m also a member of the public and I want to stand up for the Defence Force. Give me information and give me information that won’t embarrass anybody.’ But the answer keeps coming back—no. In this particular instance when I was defending the men and women from Townsville who had been to Afghanistan and were accused of drug related issues in Afghanistan and I knew it to be wrong I said to Defence, ‘In half an hour I’ve got to front the television cameras and I’ve got to give an explanation. Give me a couple of lines. I want to support the Defence Force.’ The answer was no. I said, ‘Are you saying that you’re going to just turn me loose and I could be wrong in what I say?’ They said, ‘Yep, we can’t do anything about it.’
It is that kind of paranoia that Defence has. People want to do good things for the Defence Force and need correct information that Defence has and could give them but does not. It is that kind of culture that departments have to take notice of. It cannot go on being a secret society, particularly when we are all trying to do the right thing. It is wrong that that should happen. How can you have a Defence public affairs unit of 100 people who will not give you information? That kind of culture has to be addressed. I call on the Minister for Defence to have a look at that in relation to the object and philosophy of the bills that we are talking about tonight.
In the information commissioner bill there are three information commissioner appointments. There is the Information Commissioner, the FOI Commissioner and the Privacy Commissioner. I note that the Information Commissioner has the ultimate decision power should there be a disagreement. That is fine. The bill also gives the Information Commissioner a discrete function of advising the government on information management policy.
The Information Commissioner is to be assisted by an information advisory committee. That committee will be chaired by the Information Commissioner and will comprise senior executives from key agencies and other persons outside the government who have suitable experience or qualifications. That is a good thing. The advisory committee and hence the Information Commissioner’s advice to government will not be truly independent if the appointments of the advisory committee are not picked with balance in mind. That is my view. That is not in the bill, but I think it is self-explanatory. I hope that, in making appointments, the government is mindful of the need for balance.
In the freedom of information bill the member for Isaacs talked about some of the tests that will be applied to more exemption categories than is currently the case. That is a good thing. He talked about the public interest test to be added to the economy, research and personal information exceptions. I think that on both sides of the parliament we are pleased that you will no longer be able to use arguments to prevent the release of information like, for example, disclosure of documents could cause a loss of confidence in the government or cause embarrassment to the government. Well, three cheers. That is a very good step forward.
I am pleased to see the bill also gives weighting to the FOI applicant. Should there be a disagreement between the three commissioners then the FOI applicant wins. That is interesting, though, as it contradicts the philosophy that the Information Commissioner has the ultimate say over the FOI and privacy commissioners.
I would like to turn to the history of FOI in Queensland, and the member for Moreton will be interested in this as well. This is where I get a bit cynical. Back in the Fitzgerald days, around 1989, Queensland suffered a lot of corruption in the police force, and there were people like Don ‘Shady’ Lane and Brian Austin who got themselves into a bit of strife. There was a fellow called Jack Herbert—I am the member for Herbert, but there is no relation—and there were some goings-on that were looked at. The inquiry handed its report to the government in Queensland in 1989. The report said:
A Government can deliberately obscure the processes of public administration and hide or disguise its motives. If not discovered there are no constraints on the exercise of political power. The rejection of constraints is likely to add to power of the Government and its leader, and perhaps lead to an increased tendency to misuse of power.
I say hooray to that—it is dead right. In this context, from what the report said, it is easy to see the fundamental importance of proper record keeping by public servants so that the activities and decisions of government can be scrutinised by the public. Importantly, Fitzgerald saw that effective FOI laws were one of the accountability mechanisms necessary for a robust democracy, and we are recognising that in this bill in the parliament tonight.
The recent history in Queensland is fascinating because in September 2007, within days of Anna Bligh becoming the Premier, cabinet approved the terms of reference for a broad-ranging review of FOI, and the independent panel that resulted from that delivered its report in Queensland in June 2008. In answer to the question—this is a general finding—of whether FOI in Queensland had brought about a ‘major philosophical and cultural shift in the institutions of government and the democratisation of information in the last 15 years’, the review said no. I think we all suspected that.
Since that review, Queensland has gone down the track of what we are doing here in the Australian parliament tonight. The Queensland government made a commitment to provide access to information held by the government unless, on balance, it is contrary to the public interest to provide that information. The review on Queensland’s Freedom of Information Act found that a new approach was needed from the government, putting forward 141 recommendations for reform. The Queensland government then proceeded to enact those changes.
But what is the result of that? This is where, I guess, we all get cynical. A media release from the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland dated 25 November 2009 is headed ‘Accountability a joke under Bligh’—and this is what I have feared. It says:
Premier Bligh is living in a fool’s paradise if she thinks her government is setting the national agenda for accountability.
The Leader of the Opposition said:
… Premier Bligh’s claim in state parliament this morning that Queensland’s Right to Information legislation made her government more accountable was laughable. Anyone who has attempted to extract information from this government using RTI processes is confronted with bureaucratic obfuscation …
“Under Bligh’s self-flaunted legislation, departments are required to respond 25 days but are either unable or unwilling to do so.”
“The most recent request from the opposition office seeking information regarding the Bligh Labor Government’s negotiations with A1GP was met with a reciprocal request for an extension until 11 March 2010, more than three months after the designated due date.”
These are the kinds of things that, as members of parliament, on both sides, we have to be very careful about. FOI has to mean FOI. After this bill goes through the parliament, if we see what is happening in Queensland continue to happen in the Australian departments, it will be a sad day for Australia. It will be a sad day for the aspirations that the member for Isaacs articulated so well in the parliament this evening. I accept that he is genuine in what he feels, and I think that all of us would want to see these kinds of aspirations delivered on by the Australian government and by the departments and bureaucracy in the Australian government so that Australia can be a better place and the people of Australia can be better informed.
Finally, I would just like to thank Alec Zeglis, who is with us tonight, for helping me prepare this contribution to the parliament. Alec is another fine young Australian who, one day, will be one of Australia’s leaders. Well done, Alec. Thank you.",REPS,<title>INFORMATION COMMISSIONER BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2010-05-11,"—I thank the member for Herbert for those kind words at the start of his speech and for his contribution. In a spirit of good democracy and open and accountable government, I rise to voice my strong support for the
Information Commissioner Bill 2009
and
Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009. Australian democracy, like all democracy, relies on government being transparent to our people and institutions like the media to hold us accountable. Without this vital transparency, even historical and substantial democracies can breed secrecy and corruption. Without daylight, good government festers. We are lucky to have a history of continuous democracy. Nearly every country around the world has had blights on their democratic processes. We can look at the fascism that has arisen in Europe, the coups d’etat of Africa and the revolutions of South America, and even the United States has had civil wars, McCarthyism and other blights on its democratic processes. In Chris Wallace-Crabbe’s poem
Terra Australis, he says of Australia:
We are the final children of the earth
Whom knowledge has not scarred—
not ‘scared’ but ‘scarred’. Looking back to my darker days under the Bjelke-Petersen government, as mentioned by the member for Herbert, this was the reality for Queenslanders. It was not just in the police service; it also infected the democratic process and the elected officials. Thankfully, a few good men and women on both sides of politics had the courage to stand against corruption. Since the Fitzgerald inquiry in 1989 Queensland has thrived under progressive, open and accountable governments, and, as the member for Herbert mentioned, more can be done.
In July last year, 20 years on from the Fitzgerald report, Tony Fitzgerald gave a lecture at the Inaugural Griffith University Tony Fitzgerald Lecture. He stressed that a lot more could be done. I am going to take you to some of the comments he made. Before I do, I particularly want to commend some of those people involved—not only AJ Brown at Griffith University but people from 20 years earlier, such as Mike Ahern, a National Party minister and later Premier. I commend Mike Ahern for his courage and commitment to good government. He let the Fitzgerald inquiry take place. Mike Ahern is well known as a fundamentally decent man. Consequently, the Queensland that I grew up in completely changed. We have wonderful police officers now that are able to shine—people like Commissioner Bob Atkinson, who leads the police service in Queensland. He is surely one of the most honourable men I have ever met, an inspiration to all young police officers and young Queenslanders.
In his lecture last year, at the Inaugural Tony Fitzgerald Lecture, Tony Fitzgerald said that every generation has a duty to historical truth. He warned us in that lecture that, tacitly at least, Queenslanders were encouraged to forget the repression and corruption which had occurred and the social upheaval that had been involved in eradicating those injustices. Younger Queenslanders know little of that era, the Bjelke-Petersen era, and are largely ignorant of the possibility that history might be repeated. It is a salutary warning. He said that ethics are always tested by incumbency. As a Queenslander in the Commonwealth parliament, I look to what has happened in my Queensland at the state government level and some of the tests that are put in front of elected officials.
The last point from the Fitzgerald lecture that I will make is the following quote:
Unfortunately, cynical, short-sighted political attitudes adopted for the benefit of particular politicians and their parties commonly have adverse consequences for the general community.
Those sentiments from Tony Fitzgerald, while particularly pointed, have a particular relevance for the Rudd government, peopled as it is by so many Queenslanders. That has informed the legislation that is before the House. Government cover-up and secrecy breed cynicism in the community, and obviously the last thing that we need is more cynicism about politics. We have to work hard to protect the integrity of our democracy. It is an often used quote, but the price of democracy is eternal vigilance.
That is why the Rudd government made an election commitment to restore trust and integrity to our political system, not only in the area of political donations and gifts but also by improving laws concerning freedom of information. We have already removed the power of ministers to issue conclusive certificates to refuse access to certain documents through FOI. Instead, all decisions to claim exemptions will be subject to a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
The bills before the House represent the biggest change to FOI since it was introduced way back in 1982, 29 years ago. That was back when Malcolm Fraser was the Prime Minister, back when Malcolm Fraser was a liberal with a capital ‘l’ rather than the liberal with a small ‘l’ that he seems to be now. To take you back—and I know that you are too young to remember this, Deputy Speaker Bird—Eye of the Tiger
was No. 1 for about six weeks and Channel 9’s
Today Show
had its very first airing back in 1982, and it is still going strong.
Chariots of Fire
had won the Oscar for best picture and Michael Jackson’s

had just been released. That contextualises the time in which FOI came about. We need to revisit the motives behind that legislation.
Through the bills before the chamber, we are further reforming the FOI Act to ensure that the right of access to documents is only limited where a stronger public interest lies in withholding access to those documents. Specifically, the public interest test states:
The agency or Minister must give the person access to the document if it is conditionally exempt at a particular time unless (in the circumstances) access to the document at that time would, on balance be contrary to the public interest.
This legislation also lists the factors which must not be taken into account in deciding the public interest test. These include whether: access to the document could embarrass the Commonwealth, the document could be misinterpreted or misunderstood, the author of the document is of high seniority within the agency and the document could result in confusion or unnecessary debate. Some of the factors which would favour disclosure under the act include where the document would: inform debate on a matter of public importance; promote effective oversight of public expenditure, which is always important; and allow a person to access his or her own personal information.
As well as providing greater freedom of access to requested documents, the legislation heralds a new era of proactive disclosure. There is a term that people probably will not be rushing to have tattooed on their shoulders—‘proactive disclosure’ is probably not as catchy as ‘detailed programmatic specificity’, but it is an important term. Australian government agencies will have new obligations to proactively publish information, including: details of statutory appointments, information an agency routinely gives access to in response to requests under part 3 of FOI, information that is routinely provided to the parliament and certain operational information about an agency’s functions or powers in making decisions affecting members of the public.
While the overall intent of these bills is to provide greater access to government information, it does include two necessary and completely understandable exclusions relating to intelligence information. Intelligence agencies are already wholly excluded from the FOI Act. However, under this legislation extracts or summaries from intelligence agency documents such as ministerial briefings will also be excluded. Nevertheless, the Department of Defence ministers and agencies will be excluded only for information relating to the collection, reporting or analysis of operational intelligence. There is a general appreciation throughout the community that there is some government information that, for the sake of Australia’s security and safety, is better off under lock and key.
Next, fees for lodging FOI applications will also be abolished. Applicants will not pay for any charges for accessing their own personal information. Journalists and not-for-profit groups will not pay for the first five hours of decision making and all other applications will be charged after the first hour of decision making. This will ensure that as many people as possible can access information at the lowest possible cost. This legislation also brings forward the open access period for most records under the Archives Act from 30 years to 20 years and for cabinet notebooks from 50 years to 30 years. I look forward to 2040.
The Information Commissioner Bill 2009 will establish the Office of the Information Commissioner. This new Commonwealth agency will be headed by a new statutory officer called the Time Lord—sorry; just fooling with
Doctor Who
fans! The officer will be called the Information Commissioner. The commissioner will be responsible for all the functions and powers under the FOI Act and the Privacy Act, bringing these together under the one office for the first time. The Privacy Commissioner and the new FOI Commissioner will support the Information Commissioner. They will be responsible for: issuing guidelines on the administration of the FOI Act, because anybody who has ever been tangled up in red tape knows that the devil is always in the detail; investigating government agency compliance with the FOI Act; reporting on compliance with and operation of the FOI Act; administrating the training of staff; and reviewing decisions by agencies and ministers who refuse access to documents. This will include a new two-step review process. The first review will be conducted by the Information Commissioner. If not resolved, a second review will be done by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
As I said, these bills implement the biggest reform to FOI since it was introduced nearly 30 years ago. We are doing this because we want to make it easier for people to access information and to promote greater openness and transparency in government. For governments, freedom of information is a bit like going to the dentist. It might be a little bit painful, but you know that you are better off for it in the long run. We know that our democracy will be better for these changes. Unfortunately, under the coalition some people’s experience in trying to gain access to documents through freedom of information was a little bit like pulling teeth. We in the Rudd government believe that our achievements and our shortcomings should be on the record for all to see so that people can make an informed decision about our administration. We also believe that open government is better government. The singer Paul Kelly said, ‘I was born in a luck country and every day I hear the warning bells.’ This legislation before the chamber will help us all to hear the bells long before they toll for democracy. I commend the bills to the House.
