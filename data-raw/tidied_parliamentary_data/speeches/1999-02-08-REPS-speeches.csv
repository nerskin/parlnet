"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1999-02-08,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 draws the attention of the Government to the condition of the national rail track;
(2)	 commends the Government for its commitment of $250 million to rail infrastructure but asks that it be expanded;
(3)	 calls for the declaration of national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth; and
(4)	 seeks removal of impediments to a seamless interstate rail system.
The most neglected mode of Australian transport is unquestionably rail. As we approach the 21st century we expect it to make a significant contribution to the efficiency of the Australian economy, but for the most part we restrict it to a 19th century capability. If you think I exaggerate, I refer you to the Melbourne to Adelaide rail link. About 270 kilometres of that distance—namely, the section between Melbourne and Ararat, or nearly one-third of the journey—is restricted to a speed limit of 80 kilometres an hour, whereas 115 kilometres an hour might be a more desirable target. Worse still, this same stretch has 12 further speed restrictions ranging from 12 kilometres per hour to 65 kilometres per hour. Little wonder then that the journey takes three hours longer by rail than by car and that the rail transit time between these two major Australian capitals is 13 hours—the same time that it took 60 years ago. Little wonder then that industry, business and tourism ask: is government serious about rail?
The one nation on earth that should be dedicated to a highly efficient shipping and land transport regime is Australia. We know what happened to ANL—it is almost too painful to contemplate. But now this 
 crunch time has come for the poor relative of land transport—rail. In fact, so urgent is it that, if a plan of action is not devised and implemented within the next 10 years, the interstate rail service in certain corridors could become irretrievable.
If we are serious about rail being able to compete with modern road transport, if we are serious about the efficient distribution of bulk commodities, if we are serious about our commitments to the environment, if we are serious about road safety and if we are serious  about the economic efficiency of Australia, the Australian rail system must be addressed. That is what I seek to do with this motion before the House.
The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform pulled no punches in its bipartisan report into the role of rail in the national transport system. It was a unanimous report. As chairman, I make no apologies that we said we did not want the report to have 40 tame recommendations, 20 of which called for further studies. We set out with the target of 10 or 12 hard-hitting recommendations. In the event we ended up with 16.
During that inquiry the committee received 175 submissions, held 14 days of public hearings and examined 147 witnesses from 84 organisations. The committee spent six days on inspections, which varied from track facilities in the Pilbara to the condition of the said Melbourne to Adelaide line near Ararat, and from Queensland's tilt rail project to Goninan's Spotswood maintenance centre.
Minister Sharp and subsequently Minister Vaile asked the committee in its terms of reference to examine the administration, operation and pricing of the national rail network, opportunities for private sector participation, means to access and utilise the rail network, effective investment in and ownership of the rail network, and characteristics of international best practice. The one denominator that is common to all those terms of reference is the track. If you do not get the track right it does not matter what rolling stock you buy, it does not matter what promotion of the railways you do, it does not matter whether government removes excise from fuel or not. All these 
 things pale into insignificance if the track, the thing that takes the trains, is not in top condition—efficiencies will not occur.
When trains in Europe are running regularly at 350 kilometres an hour and freight trains at 180 kilometres an hour, it is a joke that on our major trunk routes we have trains travelling between 10 and 65 kilometres an hour. We are an international joke when it comes to travel.
In the release of the report on 12 August, I said that to achieve national best outcomes the committee had recommended three key actions for the Commonwealth to undertake. The first was to declare a national track on the standard gauge rail track linking Brisbane to Perth via both Melbourne and Broken Hill. By `declare' we mean declare it for purposes of access. The second was to address the chronic infrastructure deficiencies in the national track and the third was to immediately invest in the national track.
The committee's proposal for a declaration of the track from Brisbane to Perth is a radical departure from the current situation and parallels the Commonwealth's road funding arrangements where it is responsible for the national highway, Highway 1. In effect, the standard gauge rail line from Brisbane to Perth would become the national rail highway, such as the Bruce Highway, the Princes Highway or whatever. Highway 1 is a vital artery for the nation's road system. Equally, a dedicated rail highway could achieve the same thing.
The committee went on to recommend that the Australian Rail Track Corporation's role as the one-stop shop for access be enhanced by giving it control and management of the national track, including those sections of the interstate network currently controlled by state authorities. We believe this is absolutely essential.
In launching the report, I highlighted the need for national consistency in standards and operations. The break in gauge is more than just the width of the track. Many witnesses gave examples highlighting how difficult it is to operate across jurisdictions; there are so many standards on just about everything. The list of inconsistencies impeding rail transport is long and almost seems beyond belief.
To achieve a national approach in rail for the national track, the committee recommended that the Commonwealth fund a one-off grant to standardise signalling, radio and telecommunications and safety operations; the adoption of national standards for the condition of the track; and a strategic approach to providing consistency in safety standards and practices. While we went on to talk about  other things such as training, operating procedures, transparency and access, the track was the essential and pivotal argument to our case.
I repeat that, unless as a matter of urgency we deal with the infrastructure and other issues raised in the committee's report and that we do that in the next decade, rail will deteriorate to a point where the situation will become irretrievable. The appalling condition of the infrastructure for rail was one of the biggest points to emerge from that inquiry. It is not 
 acceptable to have 70,000 concrete sleepers sidelined in a marshalling yard near Pura Pura and to have 20- and 30-metre stretches of the same train line adjoining that marshalling yard sitting in pools of mud.
If we want rail to continue to have a role in the national transport system, substantial sums of money need to be invested in infrastructure. We recommended the investment of $750 million to fix the worst deficiencies of the national track. That needs to be spent in the next three years. We then recommended the investment from 2001 of $2 billion over 10 years, but that is to include funding in partnership with the states and territories or the private sector.
Mr Speaker, that might sound like a lot of money, but when you consider that Queensland Rail will have spent nearly a billion dollars between Brisbane and Townsville in less than a decade on just one line it is not a big ask that, for a national system that links the five mainland capitals, we spend $2.75 billion over 12 or 13 years. What is important about it is that we have a bipartisan will to make it happen. The benefits are immeasurable. I again refer you to Queensland Rail, which has done some very innovative things over recent years. They have recently opened the tilt track line between Brisbane and Rockhampton. As recently as the 1980s, the train took 14 hours for that journey. The tilt train takes seven. (Time expired)
—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rail Infrastructure</title>,Private Members' Business,0,1,speech
"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I second the motion. I support the motion moved by the member for Hinkler. I commend him for bringing it before the House and also for chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform inquiry that produced the report Tracking Australia . One hundred years ago, rail and sea were the main transport modes for Australia. Rail, in many respects, was the pride of Australia, although narrow parochialism meant economic folly—separate gauges. Rail opened up Australia. Often railway terminals were the most substantial buildings in country towns. But from those days of glory little has been done to maintain rail and its lines have been allowed to deteriorate.
Contrast this with Europe, where rail is coming again into its own as a transport and freight service. As recently as last week, the French government approved a new high-speed rail link between Paris and Strasbourg. This will be only one of a number of important new rail links in Europe. We also have to get away from the idea in Australia of either investing in rail or road. In a country as vast as ours both are vital, yet it is true that over recent years a disproportionate amount of funding has gone to the road network.
The British government has recently published a white paper on the future of transport, dealing with roads, rail, air, shipping, cycling and even taxis. One wishes that a similar paper could be produced in this country so for once we could look at the whole transport chain and see how all the components fit together. Our quality of life depends on transport. We all travel, even if only locally, and we need an effective, national transport system. Transport policies 
 in this country have always been dominated by the short term.
Tracking Australia is a report that at least looks at rail in the medium to longer term. During the inquiry over 117 people and organisations gave evidence and the committee inspected the world's most efficient freight trains, hauling iron ore in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. However, on the other side of Australia where most people live, we saw National Rail and other interstate freight operators struggling with poorly maintained track in Victoria with numerous speed-weight restrictions, along with track having `steam age' alignment. The main impression of the  committee was just how bad the condition of some of the mainland national track was. For example, as the chairman has said, we found a section of track between Geelong and Ararat with worn-out, old wooden sleepers slowing trains down. Concrete sleepers have been sitting by the side of the track for over three years.
Another problem needing urgent attention is the upgrading of the safe-working arrangements between Casino and Brisbane. They were the subject of a crucial report by the ABC's 7.30 Report on 6 November 1998. The lightweight rail on the Melbourne to Albury standard gauge track, except for the Somerton-Tallarook section that was upgraded by the Keating government as part of its $430 million rail capital works in the 1992-95 program, has reached the end of its economic life since it was laid in the early 1960s.
It is now a potential safety hazard for trains moving at any reasonable speed and needs adjustment. There is a curve for every kilometre plus steep ruling grades from Sydney to Albury. We were advised that many studies have been done on the need to upgrade the worst of the `steam age' alignment, but nothing has been done. It is of concern that the recently completed Booz Allen Hamilton report, in listing nominated and evaluated rail projects for the national rail network, did not even allocate funds for the planning of the rail deviations that will be necessary to lift the average speed of Melbourne-Sydney intermodal trains from the current 70 kilometres to the agreed 80 per hour. Since this target was set in the historic 1997 rail summit of the Australian Transport Council as a five-year goal, we should either start work now or openly admit that we will fail to bring the rail track linking our two largest cities up to speed.
Between Sydney and Brisbane the track alignment is even worse. Some 396 kilometres or 41 per cent of this track fails to meet basic fast freight train standards of any curve having a radius of at least 800 metres. This is one reason why the average terminal to terminal speed on intermodal freight trains is little more than 50 kilometres per hour on this corridor. Another reason is the lack of a modern signalling system north of Casino. As found by the 1994 BTCE report for the National Transport Planning Task Force for this rail corridor:
Transit times, reliability and costs are so poor that the corridor may not survive as a commercial freight alternative unless improvements are implemented. 

Not only is the future of this corridor in doubt but also other interstate rail corridors may be lost if they are not upgraded to basic modern engineering standards.
The Sydney-Brisbane rail corridor was noted as far back as 1989 as being in jeopardy by an earlier Booz Allen Hamilton report for State Rail. Its present outlook, at current levels of upgrading, is poor. Indeed, the current upgrading of the Pacific Highway to a near four-lane standard by 2005 may prove to be in vain if all it achieves is taking more and more freight off rail and putting it onto B-doubles. This would likely be followed by the closure of the line.
The committee was advised that, on the basis of earlier BTCE estimates for the National Transport Planning Task Force, it would cost about $3 billion to upgrade the national rail system so that freight trains could operate efficiently and effectively against trucks using the upgraded national highway system. The committee's report makes it very clear that, if we are to retain railway tracks between our largest cities, they will need upgrading at a cost far exceeding the $250 million currently on offer over four years by the Howard government. We have recommended that this amount be increased to $1,000 million over the next three years, and that from 2001 a further $2 billion be invested. The amounts involved may seem large, but the stark choice is either upgrading our national railway network linking our state capitals or closing it down and increasing the nation's road freight task by some 15 per cent. Australia's road freight task, about 114 billion tonne kilometres in 1995, is already the highest per capita in the  world.
So the option of closing down the interstate rail network should be thrown out by this parliament and an increased allocation made for basic upgrading. This should include the  basic deferred maintenance, plus funding for rail research and forward planning, and the lifting of overhead clearances of Melbourne-Adelaide to allow for Perth-Adelaide double stacked container trains to be extended to Melbourne. The cost of such clearance lifting, plus some grade and curve easing on the eastern side of the Adelaide Hills, would be of the same order as the new Adelaide Hills-Crafers Highway with its new tunnels, which is due to be opened later in 1999 at a cost of $138 million. I would suggest that upgrading the Melbourne-Adelaide rail corridor should be given the same priority as this road works nearing completion.
We also need to identify a longer term Melbourne-Brisbane route capable of double stacked container movements. This length of haul is best suited to rail. Yet as noted by the  National Transport Planning Task Force in 1995:
. . . rail only carries 21 per cent of the long-distance freight. Rail traffic has to pass over more difficult terrain than road, through Sydney, and over a distance 24 per cent longer than road. Road traffic travels along the Newell Highway, covering the door-to-door distance in 22 hours, compared with rail, which requires 37 hours from terminal to terminal.
In 1998, the government conducted a study of the use of road trains on the Newell Highway, and in 1997 our committee, when examining our road system, was bombarded with calls to upgrade the Goulburn Valley 
 Highway. This could cost $500 million, and I have no doubt that planning is under way for this right now. An earlier report found that $1 billion would be warranted for the Seymour-Brisbane highways. What we need to do, and do quickly, is to seek the best advice possible and compare the national benefits of spending $1,000 million on facilitating road trains on the Newell and Goulburn Valley Highways, or to spend about the same amount in developing a basic inland standard gauge railway from Melbourne to Brisbane via Parkes that would be capable of carrying double stacked containers. For my part, I would prefer to see trains on tracks rather than road trains on our national highway system in the eastern states.
There are often suggestions made that the states, or the private sector, should invest in our interstate rail links. For the states, investing in interstate rail tracks is as reasonable as expecting the states to invest in the national highway system. The states' failure to invest in the interstate roads in the 1950s and 1960s was the reason that 25 years ago the Whitlam government formed the national highway system. To date, some $18 billion has been spent, in today's dollars, on the national highway system, whilst the federal outlay on rail capital works on interstate links is of the order of $1 billion. The committee in 1998, as per its roads report in 1997, like the National Transport Planning Task Force in 1994 and the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Party on Transport in 1991, urged a more balanced approach to federal outlays in road and rail investment. Until we do this and get a much better balance between rail track access fees for trains and road pricing for heavy trucks, it is pointless expecting the private sector to make significant rail investments.
In the lead-up to the centenary of Federation, it is relevant to note that our intercapital rail links played a vital part in the formation of the Commonwealth. The constitution gives the Commonwealth ample provision to not only operate railways but also build and improve railways. The present government saw fit to effectively disband Australian National, and still wishes to sell National Rail. The least the government can now do is recognise the need for urgent investment in the national rail network.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,1999-02-08,"—I am delighted to support the motion before the House in this new era of railways in Australia. I commend the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform report Tracking Australia , produced under the outstanding chairmanship of the member for Hinkler, and I commend all those members who participated in producing that report. It is a landmark report. Other members have referred to the changing attitudes towards railways in governments and also in the private sector.
As members would be aware, passenger railways and their operation have dominated the thinking and policies of governments and those people using railways around Australia. There is a change taking place in the way in which those railways operate; we have only to look at the Homebush Olympic Games 
 site where the new railway will service that venue with 50,000 people per hour and a train every two minutes. That will bring about a change of attitude towards urban rail in Sydney and around Australia.
The committee report and the motion really refer to freight. That is the problem that we face in Australia: moving freight by sea, road or rail. In the mid-1990s that was divided at about one-third each, with road dominating in terms of tonnes carried and value. Road always had an advantage because it was a fast, short-haul, door-to-door, flexible service, whereas rail was not beating the competition. Rail freight, fundamentally, was interstate. The intrastate was lacking because of state rivalries—and all members would be aware of that. The National Rail Corporation now carries 16 per cent of the national freight.
Railways have been in decline over many years because of inconsistent operating systems, different regulations state by state, difficulty in gaining access to the state track systems, unreliability of the operations, poor customer responsiveness and the 19th century alignments of the tracks. Roads enjoyed new highways that were straight and multilaned.
However, there is emerging support for rail, as this report indicates, especially for long-haul rail movement. Queensland Rail is a shining light of the ability to invest capital on new tracks, especially for mineral exports. Road accidents cost an estimated $6 billion a year; rail is comparatively safe and it is environmentally friendly. With the introduction of new technologies that other speakers have mentioned, as has happened in Europe, as well as deregulation and road congestion, there is a move back to railways.
The state transport ministers met in 1997, and the states and the Commonwealth unusually agreed to a course of action to set up interstate rail arrangements, where there would be investment access to one track from Brisbane to Perth. As other speakers have mentioned, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics have suggested that if we only spent $3.2 billion on a 20-year rail program we could bring the track up to scratch. I commend the previous Labor government for their One Nation program where $443 million was spent on upgrading interstate tracks and terminals. The Hilmer competition policy has ensured that there will be more genuine competition between road, rail and the private sector.
The real problem that rail faces is the old formations: the ballast drainage, old sleepers and gradients. This brings about speed restrictions which make rail uncompetitive with road. The Melbourne-Adelaide section, which other members have alluded to and which goes through part of the electorate of Corangamite, is very good evidence of the poor standard of laying of the track between Pura Pura and the South Australia border: replacing of standard gauge track on poor ballast with new concrete sleepers, which was unbelievable; using life expired rail; the appalling conditions of the standard gauge, which the committee inspected between Gheringhap and Ararat; and using old sleepers so much so that that becomes a major problem.
Finally, there is an example of good railway practice in the Pilbara region. It is world's best practice and it gives a lead to railways throughout Australia. Trains in that region are 2½ kilometres long and carry 28,000 tonnes in one run. They are world's best practice, so that proves that we can do it here in Australia if we are prepared to invest the money in the track and provide new rolling stock. Contrary to some of the expectations of the new projects, like the Alice Springs-Darwin railway, I would advocate to members of this House that we get our current railway system in order. Let us make the investment. Let us make the rolling stock better. Let us get the track in order. Then we can start looking at new investments such as Alice Springs-Darwin.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rail Infrastructure</title>,Private Members' Business,0,1,speech
"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—We have not been very clever in the development of transport systems in this country, particularly over the last 40 years. In  fact, you could say that our collective brain on transport systems has largely been disengaged. We have allowed one of our great resources—an extensive rail network spanning much of the continent—to deteriorate and become increasingly uncompetitive against road transport. It seems that the prevailing view in government for 40 years has been that rail is an outdated, 19th century form of transport, intrinsically uncompetitive against modern road transport and destined to die out.
I do not believe this is the case, nor do I think that the members for Throsby or Corangamite or Hinkler believe that either. I believe that rail does have a future in a balanced national transport plan and that the main problem for rail has been the failure of successive governments, both state and federal, to acknowledge that future and to fund it appropriately. It is a proper role for government to provide the transport infrastructure needed for the efficient operation of the national economy.
The problem is that almost all of the money has gone into road infrastructure. Rail infrastructure and indeed shipping have not been similarly supported by government. On this the facts speak for themselves. Government spending on roads is almost 10 times that spent on rail transport. If the hidden subsidies for road trauma and compensation are taken into account, it is probably 20 times.
The result of this differential funding is that, compared to rail, road transport has become a very competitive form of haulage. That is all very well and good—especially for trucking companies, oil companies and so on—but the role of government in creating a national transport infrastructure is much wider than that. That role involves providing balanced transport infrastructure according to a proper national plan—and that means appropriate funding for rail as well. Given the current state of our rail infrastructure, as outlined in the report Tracking Australia, if that does not happen soon, the road transport industry will be without competition from rail altogether—something which cannot be good for either consumers or the economy generally. 
The unbalanced focus on road transport is also responsible for additional costs which are not generally taken into account when comparing the efficiency of the different modes of transport. For example, the high and escalating cost in both human and dollar terms of the road toll, both in road trauma and compensation payments, is at least in part the result of the heavy increase in road transport.
What this country needs is a diverse transport infrastructure. It is a mistake to put all our eggs in one basket. Infrastructure for road, rail and shipping transport must be properly funded by government for the economy to operate with the efficiency needed to grow. I believe that if governments had, over the years, maintained a reasonable level of expenditure to allow for continual and appropriate upgrading of the rail infrastructure then rail would be a much more competitive transport alternative today.
Such expenditure would have enabled those aspects of the 	tracks which cause inefficiencies—timber sleepers, tight curves, steep gradients, and low and narrow tunnels and bridges—to be progressively eliminated. This would have enabled the industry to grow and to effectively utilise the new rail technologies. But because of decades of neglect, a massive injection of funding is needed to rebuild the infrastructure and win the confidence of potential investors.
As the members for Hinkler, Throsby and Corangamite have pointed out, the track between Adelaide and Melbourne is one of the most neglected sections of the national network and is in desperate need of repair. In fact, sometimes it takes longer to transport freight along this track than it did 100 years ago. The problem is not confined to just this track. According to the Tracking Australia report, failure to provide substantial infrastructure investment may mean that major sections of the national rail network will be irretrievably neglected within ten years.
However, the injection of funds needed to revive the rail industry will require a display of will and vision on the part of government, and the Howard government's offer so far of $250 million over four years is a miserly and wholly inadequate response. What is needed  at the very least can be found in the recommendation of the Tracking Australia report: $750 million over three years to remove the critical deficiencies on a declared national track, and $2 billion over ten years from 2001.
It is vital for the efficient running of our economy that we have a first-class transport system. But that means more than first-class roads. Rail has a future and a place in any planning for a national transport system. The current rail network is in dire need of substantive investment in both infrastructure and personnel. Road freight transport will undoubtedly continue to grow, and rail will not again in the foreseeable future reclaim the mantle of being the premier form of national freight transport. The national roads program is therefore very important. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rail Infrastructure</title>,Private Members' Business,0,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,1999-02-08,"—It is very pleasing to stand and support the excellent motion on rail infrastructure moved by the member for Hinkler, 
 and also to endorse the remarks made by the previous speakers, the members for Throsby, Corangamite and Port Adelaide. As someone who knows a bit about transport I am not all that forthcoming when I talk about the Australian rail system to engineering colleagues of mine. Unfortunately, we have the legacy—which should prove to be an example to us as a nation that aspires to great things—of lack of vision.
The dilemma we face is the lack of a comprehensive national rail system. Although we owe a lot to our founding fathers, they did not think very far ahead when they deliberately decided to have different gauges in each state. Of course each state is based on the colonial system at the time, radially into the state capitals, and that does not suit the needs of a modern nation now—the need to transport from west to east and from north to south. The absence of a nationally coordinated grid system is another deficiency. This has been the reason for a lack of infrastructure investment. It is a sad reflection that road transport is more efficient. This has occurred because the transport system has not been up to the modern needs of our nation.
I am a little embarrassed also, because the members for Hinkler and Port Adelaide have both made reference to some very poor standard gauge track in Victoria that happens to run right through my electorate, right through the spine of the Wimmera. It is the source of many complaints from my constituents, who like to use the various railways stations along there as passenger ports but make the decision, as many trucking operators do, that it is better to go by car.
I think the member's motion is a timely one for the parliament to make sure that the momentum that is being gathered continues. The member for Corangamite paid credit to the previous Keating government. I was very pleased to see those initiatives. I now at least have two standard gauge rail tracks running north to Yaapeet and Hopetoun in my electorate, which is very important in order to get grain down to both the Melbourne and Portland ports. Mallee being a very strong grain area, that is where the freight should stay—on the rail system and not on the road.
I have a reflection on the lack of vision by our founding fathers from the 1995 report referred to by the member for Port Adelaide. In it I found a quote regarding Earl Grey at the time:
With broad gauge equipment already ordered, the irritated Victorians asked London to veto the New South Wales' about-turn. But Earl Grey was in the process of giving the colonies more freedom to make their own mistakes. . . 
It is what looks in hindsight like a simple mistake which is having profound effects on our rail system. From my further reading I thought I might offer some light-hearted reference to the standard gauge. It is actually a standard which is four feet, 8.5 inches, which is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? Because that is the way they built them in England, and many of our engineers at that time were English expatriates.
Why did the English people build them like that? Because the first rail lines were built on the same principle as the tramway system, and that is the gauge 
 they used. Why did they use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building the wagons, which used that wheel spacing. Why did the wagons  use that spacing? Well, they tried to use the same spacing as the wagons, which corresponded to the same distance as the wheel ruts at the time.
Where did the long distance roads in Europe come from—and why were there ruts? They were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their legions. They were the roads used to expand the great Roman Empire. The roads were that width, because that was the width of the chariots. Thus we have an answer to our question. The standard gauge distance of four feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original specification for the width of an original Roman chariot.
It proves that we should stick to the original specification, not divert from it. So the next time we are tempted to wonder what horse's backside came up with this odd gauge we will be exactly right, because the Imperial Roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back end of two horses. It just proves that we should not divert from an original specification.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I understand that the issues raised by the member for Hinkler arise out of an inquiry conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Micro Economic Reform into the role of rail in the national transport network. My predecessor the Hon. Peter Morris was deputy chair of that committee and he has emphasised to me the importance of upgrading our rail infrastructure. It is of vital importance not only to Australia as a whole, but also to the Hunter and Central Coast regions within my electorate. My predecessor also mentioned to me that the member for Hinkler has a great interest in rail and is very committed to seeing that we get the national rail network, as was my predecessor.
The current national rail network is not meeting the needs of Australia. It is creating a problem for regional areas like the ones I represent. It is inhibiting the transfer of goods to and from the regions and impacting on the economic viability of the industries operating in the regions. Its inadequacies are forcing companies to transport their goods by road, which in turn is forcing government to invest more money in upgrading road infrastructure. It is essential that this government act now to upgrade the track between Sydney and Melbourne. This section of track needs straightening and all sections of the track must be upgraded to a dual tracking system.
Another major problem area is Sydney where there is a bottleneck that causes major problems for goods travelling from Newcastle to Melbourne. Trains are regularly delayed for up to six hours. Sydney is a major problem as far as a seamless rail system is concerned. These problems must be addressed as a priority. There needs to be a major investment into this infrastructure because the delays are currently a major disincentive to the use of rail.
While this government has committed $250 million to rail infrastructure Australia wide over four years, 
 this does little to solve the bottleneck at Sydney where in the vicinity of $600 million is required to be spent to ensure the smooth transit of freight. The commitment to rail infrastructure must be expanded. I can understand the member for Hinkler calling for the $250 million to be extended—$250 million is only a drop in the bucket. If our national rail infrastructure is to be upgraded, then the government must show some leadership. It must make a substantial financial commitment to the upgrade. If it does not show this leadership and does not make a more substantial commitment, our national road infrastructure will collapse.
The Tracking Australia report recommended that in addition to the $250 million committed to the national rail infrastructure there should be a further $750 million over three years. I can understand why the member for Hinkler is encouraging this money to be committed. It is essential that we have this investment. The $750 million would be spent on priorities developed between the state and Commonwealth government. There would be a further $2 billion over 10 years from the year 2001. It is very evident that an enormous financial commitment is needed and it is beholden on this government to ensure the future viability of our national rail infrastructure by making this substantial commitment to the upgrading  of the rail network. It is quite obvious that $250 million will do little to upgrade our national rail infrastructure. It is essential that the government address the need for a standard gauge, as has already been mentioned, from Brisbane to Perth. There is a chronic deficiency that needs to be addressed to stop the irretrievable deterioration of the system.
As the member for Hinkler would agree, the current investment is totally inadequate, even with the $250 million. The government needs to do much more in terms of effective investment in Australia's public rail infrastructure. It is essential that the government show leadership and assist in the development of an integrated, funded transport plan with a strategy to address the needs of the nation's rail. If this does not happen, it will collapse. The government must show leadership and address the imbalance that exists between road and rail funding.

"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1999-02-08,"—There is no doubt that rail infrastructure in this country is in a parlous state, but at least this government is addressing that problem. With proper planning and coordination, and the $250 million that has been allocated, a start has been made. In the motion before us today, the member for Hinkler, in his wisdom and commitment to a good outcome, encourages the cabinet in particular to look more closely at ways to further enhance the $250 million that has already been allocated. In the last parliament, the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Micro Economic Reform did a lot of work and spoke to a lot of people about the problems associated with rail transport in this country.
I think what the member for Hinkler has put forward today is worthy of support. In some ways—and I have said this to the member privately—I would like to amend the motion and add just about any form 
 of infrastructure because what is true for rail is true for almost every bit of infrastructure in this country. More money needs to be spent after proper planning and consideration.
The problem with rail is not the making of this government but is something that has happened over the last 120 years. All infrastructure in this country has basically been an area of responsibility for government since 1788. Rail has been the victim of competing interests between state and federal governments and the pro-road and pro-rail lobbies for far too long. As different transport ministers and different departmental heads have come and gone, and as the pro and anti rail forces come and go, we have seen the current mess develop.
What we have at stake, after almost 100 years of federation, is not much of a change from what we had 100 years ago. Those competing interests are still there and some of the inadequacies and inconsistencies of the rail system from 100 years ago are still here today. For instance, the Commonwealth government puts money into rail infrastructure into Sydney. The standard gauge, conveniently for the New South Wales government, is also the gauge in New South Wales. The first thing that happens when more rail is laid to the port of Botany or ports around Sydney is that the New South Wales government decides that the Sydney suburban rail lines should access that rail and freight is left sitting outside Sydney for six or 12 hours waiting for a slot to get in. So Sydney is an absolute basket case.
The national track between Brisbane and Newcastle is an absolute disgrace. Yet north of that, in Queensland, is the best laid track in Australia. And why? Because, deliberately, over the last eight years there has been a concerted effort to put real money into the infrastructure. For instance, between Brisbane and Rockhampton—through the electorate of the honourable member for Hinkler—the curves, inclines and gradients have all been relaid with the future in sight. And more recently, plans have been announced to continue that through to Cairns. This is the sort of thing that needs to be done across Australia.
You cannot help but wonder if, in fact, given the problem in Sydney, it might be better to put the Queensland gauge through as the standard gauge; it might prevent the Sydney city trains from using it as a way of right. The previous efforts from the Keating government—their One Nation rail moneys—in practice, were a farce. For instance, the committee found during its deliberations that some infrastructure that was bought was not properly laid—that concrete sleepers were left lying beside railway lines. The sleepers were bought with the One Nation moneys and in rural Victoria they were not installed.
In my own electorate the Port of Brisbane rail link, which commences from the National Rail freight terminal partly in my electorate and partly in the electorate of the member for Rankin—I see him here in the chamber—sat idle for a couple of years while there were arguments over signalling.

"Sidebottom, Peter, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I feel compelled to make members of this House aware of the dilemma facing many families around Australia who have children suffering from cystic fibrosis. I was staggered to learn cystic fibrosis has been removed from the eligibility list of recognised disabilities which qualify for the full child disability allowance. Cystic fibrosis is the most common chronic genetic illness in Australia, yet newly diagnosed cases have been excluded from receiving automatic assistance. From 2003, families will no longer automatically qualify for the $75.10 fortnightly allowance. The impact on these families will be enormous and, without doubt, will impinge on the quality of life of sufferers.
There is no cure for cystic fibrosis. It is a life-limiting condition. Children with this illness require daily medical treatment and supervision. They need constant care and attention, every day of their lives. These children spend hours each day with parents doing routine physiotherapy and exercise, to make the most of their short time with family and friends. As if the stress and emotional impact this places on families was not enough, the financial hardship many of these families face is a serious burden. It is imperative cystic fibrosis be reinstated to the child disability allowance list. We must show we care and we must support families who are experiencing real hardship. I will soon be calling on members of this House to reinstate the full child disability allowance for cystic fibrosis.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Cystic Fibrosis</title>,Statements by Members,1,1,speech
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-02-08,"—I move:
That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on Wednesday, 3 February 1999, of the Honourable James Francis Cope, Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1973 to 1975; Member of the House of Representatives for 
 the Division of Sydney, New South Wales, from 1969 to 1975, for the Division of Watson, New South Wales, from 1956 to 1969 and for the Division of Cook, New South Wales, from 1955 to 1956; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Mr Speaker, there are probably now only three members of this House who sat in the parliament with Jim Cope: me, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the member for Mitchell. I remember Jim Cope with a genuine personal regard. I thought he represented the very best of the traditions of his party and was a faithful reflection of the origins of the Australian Labor Party. I thought his life revealed the best of that party. He was a great advocate for the cause of working people. When he was elected Speaker he was referred to as the `battler' from Sydney who had lived in a small terrace house in a tiny street in Redfern for the previous 44 years. He always defended his Redfern origins, saying once, `I am proud to be one of them and would hazard a guess that people in more affluent areas would like to have such friends and neighbours in times of stress.'
Before entering politics, he was Federal Treasurer of the Australian Glassworkers Union from 1952 and an alderman of the Redfern Municipal Council before its amalgamation with the Sydney City Council. He did experience in his own life genuine deprivation, and this was his motivation for entering parliament. He spoke of his experiences before and during the Depression. He once said, `I remember how we looked for work—50 or 60 men lined up outside this place at Camperdown each day, like a line of cattle, waiting for a job.' When he was elected to parliament he spoke very powerfully and  emotionally in his maiden speech of his working background.
He had the distinction, which a number of people have enjoyed, of being the representative of three electorates in the federal parliament. He is, of course, best known for having been the Speaker of the parliament from 1973 to 1975. The circumstances of his ceasing to be Speaker are well known and I do not intend to canvass those in any way today. The stories have been written about them and views have been formed about them. I see no particular purpose to be gained by going over those details today.
But there is one aspect of that rather dramatic day which has not been recalled in some of the stories that have been written over the past few days, and it illustrates the marvellous sense of humour that I remember Jim Cope had. As all honourable members will know, when there is a vacancy in the Speakership you have to meet and elect a new Speaker. You do not do it by a division or a show of hands; you actually write the name out. We, then being the opposition, had absolutely no chance of having our nominee elected. In the time honoured tradition, however, we nevertheless nominated the late Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, who was then the federal Liberal member for the now abolished seat of Angus in South Australia. It was a fairly dramatic sort of day and everybody was a little bit tense. We were all gathered in that raucous. The Labor Party nominee and subsequent Speaker—and I think a very fine Speaker—Gordon Scholes was nominated by the then govern 
 ment. Geoff Giles was nominated by the opposition. With his absolutely unmistakable voice Jim Cope pierced the silence and called out very loudly and undeniably, `How do you spell Giles?'
Given the circumstances, it illustrated the great sense of humour that he had. Of course, as a loyal Labor man he voted for Scholes. It is to his very great credit that, although he would have felt a degree of personal hurt because of those circumstances, he never publicly bore any grudges against his party.
His politics were like the politics of many people of that generation on both sides. They were moulded by the searing experiences of the Great Depression. He came to parliament with the simple desire to improve the lot of everyday working Australians. His priorities were their priorities and he spoke passionately about them in his maiden speech and during his years in parliament.
On behalf of the government I want to record my respect for Jim Cope. I remember him as a very friendly, decent man for a relatively new member of the parliament to deal with. I certainly remember those dramatic days and months of 1975—and we will be saying something in a moment about another player in the events of 1975, the late Jim McClelland. On behalf of myself, the Liberal Party and the government, I record my respect for Jim Cope. I am sad at his passing, but he lived to the great age of 91. He and his wife, Myrtle, were together for 67 years, which in anybody's language is an astonishing partnership. It was a 67-year period that embraced not only the First War but the Second War and the years of the Great Depression and the postwar revival and reconstruction of Australia.
On behalf of the government, I extend to Myrtle, their family and all of their many friends our sorrow at Jim's passing and record our respects for his contribution to his party, the Australian parliament and the Australian people.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cope, Hon.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I would like to support the remarks made by the Prime Minister, on this very sad occasion, in recognition of the long service to this parliament in Australia by Jim Cope. The Prime Minister, as he says, is one of the few members of this parliament who can remember serving with Jim Cope as a member of parliament. I as a small boy can remember being introduced to him from time to time by my father, as he was one of my father's friends in successive parliaments for a very lengthy time.
It is a great country where it is possible for somebody who is a glassblower by trade to rise to the senior position of this chamber. Jim Cope did that. He did it in his own time. One of the things that you can note about Jim Cope is that he was never in a hurry for any particular thing that he wanted to achieve  with this life. Nor did he have unrealistic expectations about what that life would produce for him or necessarily even unrealistic expectations about what government would do for the people. In fact, it was quite late in life that he came to parliament, but he served here for a very long time. Given the quiet temper of the passage of years for Jim Cope, it is 
 quite surprising he did not make it to the next century, despite the fact that he was born in 1907.
He was a servant of this House for a long time. When he came into this parliament he was not unique, but he probably would have been almost unique in this chamber in that he believed the first thing that he ought to do was to sit down and study standing orders to make himself as knowledgeable on standing orders as he was in any aspect of political policy or  in any aspect of political endeavour in general. It was a view on his part that there was an absolute obligation on members of parliament to understand the standing orders, if not necessarily to assist the Speaker to at least be able to participate in any of the discussions that went on in parliament in an orderly—if disorderly from time to time—fashion.
He became as a member of parliament an expert on standing orders and also one who added to the lightness of the place. He was a great humorist. The Prime Minister had one example of that in the remarks that he made. There were another couple of examples that my father drew to my attention. Once when the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, was in full flight about the extent to which the Australian people loved him, he regaled the parliament with a story of a truck driver moving alongside him at the traffic lights, leaning out of the cabin and shouting to the Prime Minister, `Good on you, Bob. You're doing a terrific job.' In the midst of the quiet titters of recognition from at least the government side at that stage, Jim's distinctive voice could be heard coming out with, `And did they pinch him for drunken driving?'
On another occasion, and I do not think it would be appropriate to go through the full extent of this particular story, there was a debate in this chamber at one time about three locations for where we are now and one member of parliament had failed to obtain Mr Speaker's attention, despite repeated efforts to get on his scrapers to opine his views. On the way out of the chamber, the Speaker drew attention to the fact that he was exiting in a huff in a slightly disorderly manner, at which point he turned and said to the Speaker precisely where he ought to place his particular call. Instantly, Jim Cope jumped up and said, `I think we have a fourth site.' It is indeed fortunate that site was not chosen and this one was. That site, however, was a mobile site and was unlikely to be.
He was a man who had a great sense of humour but also had a great sense of honour. He had a great sense of the role of Speaker. The Prime Minister did not allude to the circumstances of his termination but I will. He was wrongly treated. There is no question in my mind that that was the case. He was wrongly treated.
—Your father said that too.
—My father was one of a number of Labor members who absented themselves from the vote when that occurred. From time to time it may be necessary to remove a Speaker; that was not the way for a Speaker to be removed. But he bore no bitterness for it. He had no rancour at all and was enormously supportive of the subsequent Labor Speaker, Gordon Scholes, who also joined my father in exiting 
 the chamber at that point. So he was a man without rancour, a man of very great decency and a man of great humour.
He was an example of a style of Australian who, I suppose, to some degree is disappearing certainly from public life and perhaps from Australian life—a person who was essentially self-educated but with an absolute determination to know as much as he could to do his fellow man and woman in Australia as much good as he conceivably could in this place.
He was not in any sense a careerist. He was a person who took the view that he was he here for a purpose and that he would perform that purpose and conduct his activities as effectively as he could. He was an ordinary bloke. One of the things he did on coming to  office was to continue a habit of Labor speakers prior to that of dispensing with the gown and wig and, given the lengthy period of time that there had been between Labor speakers, that appeared to be something of an innovation at the time.
I could be wrong about this but I think he was the first Speaker appointed by Labor in the postwar era—I think it was a continuing Speaker after World War II—so he would have been the first to actually obtain that office when he did, and it was a very long time between drinks as far as Labor Speakers were concerned. He brought great credit to that office. He brought great credit to this parliament. Our condolences go to his family, of whom he was a loving and proud head.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cope, Hon. James Francis, CMG</title>",Condolences,2,1,speech
"Fischer, Tim, MP",NP,1999-02-08,"—I would like to build on the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and particularly refer to that day in 1975. In support of what the Leader of the Opposition has said, it was good to see Clyde Cameron reiterate the apology he subsequently tendered to former Speaker Cope in respect of his conduct on that particular day. In fact, history records that there were four people who absented themselves from the Labor government on the subsequent division when the member for New England, then Leader of Opposition Business, moved for the suspension of Mr Cameron. I learned today, inter alia, that one of those was Mr Beazley Sr.
These were momentous times in the history of Australian politics. That was at the start of 1975, and it was an intense period of activity in the federal parliament. Two days before, the former federal Leader of the National Party, Doug Anthony, had been suspended and there was a further set of altercations. There was some brilliant thinking by Mr Sinclair at the time in moving that motion in support of the Speaker's position. Of course, the motion was defeated and the Speaker tendered his resignation. It was a class act and a courageous act. It was the best of the Westminster tradition a la the Australian parliament's interpretation thereof. In saluting the life and times and work of former Speaker Cope, I particularly salute his stepping out of the Speaker's chair in the circumstances, very difficult as they were, immediately following that particular incident and the non-carriage of that particular motion.
I single out in his maiden speech his strong link with wide groupings of workers, including the Glassworkers Union and also the pensioners. I will quote briefly. He said:
Recently the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) announced a surplus of more than £70,000,000 for the financial year 1954-55.
He went on to argue that that surplus should be used variously, and said:
It is a responsibility of this Government or, for that matter, of any government, to see that age and invalid pensioners are decently housed and fed in keeping with Australian standards of living. Those people are the pioneers of this country. They built it to what it is to-day. I remind honorable members that the vast majority of them had to raise their families without the assistance of child endowment payments, and in so doing they nullified their prospects of saving for their years of retirement.
Those are very interesting words uttered in 1955 by the member who subsequently became the member for Sydney. He gave great service to his beloved Labor Party but also to the state and to the nation, especially in his role for that critical period as Speaker of the House. On behalf of the National Party, I extend sympathy to members of the Cope family.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cope, Hon. James Francis, CMG</title>",Condolences,2,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I join with the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Prime Minister in expressing my condolences and joining in this motion on the passing of Jim Cope. I, like the Leader of the Opposition, knew Jim Cope not as a parliamentarian but as a regular visitor here as part of family visits. Jim Cope was one of those people who in many ways instilled into me the importance of the parliament and subsequently the role of the Speaker and, significantly, the importance of the standing orders. Whether it was a brilliant tactic by the member for New England, I think all of us who have studied the standing orders would have moved precisely that way—including Jim Cope, had he been in that position. But I join with the Leader of the Opposition in saying that there were many on our side of the parliament who thought that Jim Cope in those circumstances had been harshly dealt with.
Whilst reference has been made to the fact that he was a glassworker and a trade unionist, it is also true to say that before he came to parliament Jim Cope experienced several years of unemployment, and that experience shaped him as a staunch defender of lower income and unemployed people throughout his parliamentary career. In his first speech in the House he gave a glimpse of that. He said:
I have been through the mill. I know what it is to go without a meal . . . But I doubt very much whether the Prime Minister or the Treasurer would know what it is to go without a meal. It is only by seeing these people, it is only by ""going through the mill"" that one can speak with sincerity on these matters.
In his first speech he also advocated the need for government to care more for aged and invalid pensioners. In a statement of renewed significance in the current debate over the GST, he noted very forcefully that the high prices of food `do not affect the tables of the rich; but they place pensioners in the semi-starvation class'.
Reference has been made to the dry wit of Jim Cope in the anecdote that Kim Beazley told. I think it is also important to place on record that he was a very dedicated local member of parliament. He believed in the importance of representation and of constituency. Whilst he did rise to the significant position of Speaker of the House, he never forgot the roots from which he came. I think it is a testament to this democracy and this institution that someone of Jim Cope's background could rise to become Speaker of the parliament. He served the parliament and he served the people of his electorate with great distinction. I join in expressing my condolences to his wife of 67 years, Myrtle, to their daughter, Bonnie, and to their family and friends.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cope, Hon.

As the person currently honoured to occupy the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives, I would like to say a few words about my distinguished predecessor, the late James Francis Cope. As we have heard this afternoon, he was clearly a man committed to the principles of the party he served so well, to the parliament he loved and to the people he represented. Those of us who did not know Mr Cope personally have had portrayed for us in this condolence motion a man with a sense of humour and a sense of justice and a man whose disposition did this office honour.

 tax cheats'? If so, how does the Prime Minister explain the evidence of his modeller of  choice, Chris Murphy, that it will cause long-term net job losses in Queensland and Tasmania, it will result in people living in smaller, poorer quality housing and it will have a significant negative impact on surf lifesaving and the work of St John's Ambulance and the Royal Lifesaving Society of Australia?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Tax Package: Mandate</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question

Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: now that the parliament has resumed, our commitment to giving personal tax relief to the battlers of Australia, the family men and women of Australia, remains undiminished.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I rise to support the member for Charlton's private member's motion which attempts to get more reasonable sitting times into this place. The debate was adjourned 
 approximately 3¼ hours ago, during which time we have heard a variety of condolence motions and had question time, and is now being resumed to allow three five-minute additions to the debate. It epitomises the problems we have in this House in arrangements for debate—the lack of continuity, the allocation of specific amounts of time.
I could not help but notice during the condolence motions—and I am sure that members of both sides also noticed—that members took the opportunity to catch up on some much needed sleep, or should I say `reflection' or `contemplation'. Whatever it was, it certainly was a statement about the management of time and its usage in this House. 
I have some notes prepared about my experience between 1993 and 1996 as a member of this chamber when a different time arrangement existed. I remember that time arrangement being implemented, and I also remember the way in which it was greeted by members on both sides of the House. However, previous speakers from the other side particularly have referred to the time arrangements that were introduced in 1994 as being put there by then Prime Minister Paul Keating and supporting his views on and attitudes of the management of the House of Representatives.
I believe that the way this chamber should operate relates to the concept of how parliament operates. To purely see this chamber as an adversarial place where arguments are put, for and against, is not a concept that I think is enjoyed or shared by most people who come here. I would like to think the majority of elected representatives see this as a place where they can discuss problems, where they can work together constructively and, through places such as committee rooms, come to a result that enjoys the support of both sides.
If, on the other hand, we intend to restrict debate on major pieces of legislation—such as we saw before Christmas, before the adjournment for the summer break, when the guillotine was used and when members who wished to support their electors were denied the right to contribute to the debate—then this will be a pure adversarial chamber; it will not come to the conclusion or have the support of the community that we deserve, that we should have. I believe that the time management skills of our chamber, as the law-making organisation or proponent in our nation, could be far better.
I support the member for Charlton. I believe that an earlier adjournment of an evening will allow for social interchange and for members of both Houses to meet to exchange opinions and to talk about common problems. That is certainly not taking place in the chamber when we sit to 11 o'clock. It was certainly evident, as I said, that even on the first day of this week's sittings members from both sides promptly nodded off during what they probably regarded as debate not of particular interest to them. That is something that we could do without; it is something that I believe indicates we should much better manage our time in this House.

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,1999-02-08,"—I note that there are four speakers from the opposition on this motion, and three of them are first termers. In fact, they have been in parliament for a little over four months. The member for Paterson has served a term here before. On this side we have two speakers who have served four terms and one who has served three terms. I cannot guess how many terms the honourable member for Mitchell has served, but we are very experienced in parliamentary procedure and the procedures of this House.
I take at face value what the honourable member for Charlton has proposed in this motion. If I recall correctly, her predecessor in her seat, her father, was also a great advocate for shortening the actual sitting hours from 11 p.m. back to 8 p.m.
The reasons given by the honourable member for Charlton—family reasons, relationships—are quite valid. The effect of parliamentary life on both those things is very onerous and debilitating in many ways. But there is a simple fact: everybody is different. A procedure that may suit one person may not suit another person. That crosses party lines. Even on this side of the House it crosses over people from different states and regions. The honourable member for Mitchell and his colleagues from Sydney and people from Melbourne can get to Parliament House in Canberra from their homes in a couple of hours. It may not even take that long. If they live close to the airport they have only a 40- to 50-minute flight to get to Canberra. People from Western Australia who fly to this parliament on Sunday night leave on a plane at 1 a.m. and get to Canberra at 9 a.m. The impact of an 11 p.m. sitting night means a lot more to those people than somebody whose journey started in Sydney or Melbourne.
Having said that, people have different circumstances. Those examples I gave cross party lines and state boundaries. The further you live from Parliament House, the more  remote an area you come from, the more difficult it is to get to Canberra and work those long hours.
We should not think of only ourselves, the members. This motion also affects staff members—the people who run this institution: both houses, the committees and our own personal staff. We do not seem to measure the effect on the health of those people when we are looking at ourselves. The reasons the member for Charlton moved this motion are quite valid, but there are other circumstances on both sides of the House which are not valid.
There are occupational health and safety factors—and I can speak from personal experience on these—that we have to be very careful of. We have to allow members of parliament to maintain their health and lifestyle. It can be a very debilitating experience to suffer some of the traumas that disability and bad health can cause. All you have to do is take a good look around the House and remember Senator Panizza from Western Australia, Gordon Bilney from that side of the House, Ian Sinclair, who had heart bypass surgery, Ian Macdonald, David Connolly and me.
In summing up, this question is not about the executive forcing its will on the backbench or the 
 opposition; it is about coming to a sensible solution to suit most members, while at the same time not compromising the capacity of the parliament to be an effective debating chamber.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I am more than happy to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Charlton this afternoon. I agree wholeheartedly that there is a need to look at ways to bring the operation of parliament into line with the realities of our obligations as both elected representatives and normal human beings with family lives.
Quite correctly, for much of the time our priorities are given to our constituents, but that should not mean we have to ignore the obligations we also have to our families. I do not think it is being too selfish of us to include some consideration for our own health and general wellbeing when we look at the work arrangements in Parliament House. It would be a very good start to return to a finishing time each day in the chamber of 8 p.m., as previously adopted by this House.
Of course politicians would not be the only beneficiaries of changes to sitting hours. Our staff as well as the staff responsible for the running of Parliament House face the same difficulties as we do when the hours of sitting run into the late evenings.
One of my main objections to the current sitting hours is the apparent disregard shown for those members with families. I do not yet have the same level of family responsibilities as many other representatives here, such as the member for Charlton. I can nonetheless appreciate the extra pressure that must come with trying to accommodate those responsibilities alongside the job of being an MP, away from home for so much of the year.
I suppose that, in taking up this issue, I am looking ahead to a time when I will be wanting to include young children in my parliamentary lifestyle. The entitlements available for bringing a family to Canberra are quite reasonable but they are also pretty meaningless when you look at the hours that we are expected to actually be in Parliament House and the hours that our families are left to amuse themselves, even when they are in town with us. Surely a sitting day that made more use of the early part of the day and finished at a reasonable hour, such as 8.00 p.m., could allow for more family time in Canberra than is possible under the current sitting arrangements.
I understand perfectly well that nobody forced me to enter parliament, so I have to take some personal responsibility for arranging my life to suit the obligations that come with this job, such as the amount of time that has to be spent away from home. For me, though, that still leaves the legitimate question of how to maximise the effectiveness of MPs when they are in Canberra. We have to start by being realistic and accepting that we are human and we cannot be expected to work at peak performance when beset by fatigue and feelings of isolation from our families. It is certainly not that any of us are scared of hard work. Campaigns are very effective at smash ing any illusions of life as a politician being an easy wicket.
Like everyone here, I have entered this parliament to work hard for my electorate and to provide the best representation possible. My concern is that the hours that we sit here, as they currently stand, do not allow for that to happen. It is very hard to put in 100 per cent effort for your constituents when you are constantly fighting to stay alert or negotiating with your partner to wait around for just two more hours so you can see him to talk about important family issues when parliament rises for the night.
Of course, the question of finding sitting hours that are both adequate and sensible is an old one. The About Time inquiry in 1993 was a comprehensive examination of the issues associated with late night sitting hours and produced recommendations that attracted broad endorsement in a subsequent review of those changes. It was interesting for me to read the submissions members made to the previous inquiries into and reviews of this issue. Naturally, I have been wondering whether my struggle with the hours of sitting was just a case of a trap for young players, a bit of a rite of passage that came as a new member and that I was yet to come to terms with. But, as I saw the names of those people who challenged the effectiveness of late sitting hours back in 1993, I realised that they included some long-term and experienced members of Parliament.
It appears that there is no magic formula that turns you into a machine capable of superhuman performance just because you have entered parliament. And why do we really expect there to be? It has certainly not been discovered in any other profession. I spent some time working in the legal profession before entering parliament so I am no stranger to long working hours that often verged on the ridiculous. When a matter was going to trial, all stops were out to get every scrap of evidence prepared and witnesses coordinated. But I think it is very significant to note that, when it came down to the real business end of things—the trial, where every word is crucial and lives hang in the balance—the hours were kept to a sensible limit.
Obviously, that was done in recognition that the work being carried out was extremely important. The players involved—solicitors, barristers and judges—had to be functioning at their peak capacity in the best interests of the particular parties involved, as well as the overall perception of the justice system in the wider community. I think it is reasonable to draw the analogy with what goes on in this place. The issues at stake and the decisions to be made are every bit as important as the determinations made in our nation's courts. If our legal system and the workers in it deem their work as deserving of the highest standards of concentration and intellectual application, surely the parliamentary system should apply similar standards.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,1999-02-08,"—The mover of this motion has chosen only one element of the Blewett report and that is the hours of sitting. There were many recommendations in the Blewett report, so by adopting this proposal or a similar one the House would not in fact be dealing with the totality of what 
 the Procedure Committee submitted to the House in 1994. There were many other matters.
Members who are new to this place come into a much enlightened chamber compared with that operated by Paul Keating. Question time was limited. Members of his own party received only limited opportunity to ask questions. Members of the opposition were not encouraged to ask questions of the Prime Minister or other ministers because they mostly deigned not to come into this place. If the Prime Minister came near the place, it was often for one day a week only.
Are the Australian Labor Party members—because they seem to be in agreement on this—proposing that they want to return to that control of this House by the executive as  Keating ran it? Limited hours? Shorter hours? If you shorten the hours of the parliament and not sit additional days, you immediately put the control of the parliament into the hands of the executive. You need to think that through.
If you are proposing setting additional hours, you are proposing that many members spend more time away from their families, because their families have school commit ments and their children need a continuity of ability to attend school. Surely we are not thinking that members and their families are going to spend part of their time as a total family in Canberra and then part of their time in an electorate somewhere else, because—in reality and in practicality—if the children of members' families attend a primary school, they need continuity and that means that they are usually in the electorate. If the members of a family attend a high school, it is more important that there be continuity and they are more likely to be in the electorate.
Does that mean that somehow or other we arrange babysitters to look after our youngsters while our spouses or partners come to Canberra? That is not realistic either, so it is a matter of trying to find a balance between the competing features while doing the work that we must do, and that means sitting an appropriate number of days. The parliament is now sitting more days than it did under Paul Keating. That is because there is more work and more debate is needed. There is more need for us to apply ourselves to the matters of state and to the reasons why we were elected. On the other hand, we have the problems of our families being elsewhere.
We need to strike that balance—there is no doubt about it—but the proposal that Neal Blewett came up with, which people like Kathy Sullivan and Paul Filing from our side disagreed with, does not really meet the proposals that this House would like to see. The member for Fairfax, in his comments to me, said, `Extended hours at the end of the session are the biggest bane in a member's life. You sit for long hours, often through the night.' All political parties are guilty of that process. That is the gut crunching stuff that wears you down and makes it extremely difficult to perform well in the electorate or here.
But to raise occupational health and safety factors is just incredible when you consider that you are going to encourage people, including staff, to work at 
 their desk without a break from 9.30 in the morning to 8 o'clock or from 2 o'clock in the afternoon to eight. The honourable member shakes her head, but there is no provision for a break time. It is a matter of agreement between a member and his staff or between the member and the whip if you can get away for a meal. That is not a realistic approach either. What Keating and the Labor Party did with those changes in standing orders in 1994 was in fact to rule out meal breaks, and that was a great loss to the staff and to us. It was an opportunity to sit down. I have got here amongst a collection of speeches a speech made by the current Chief Government Whip, Michael Ronaldson, who said that the introduction of these changed sitting hours had produced a barrenness in the parliamentary dining room. Nobody was going there, following the change, to meet and talk about the day's work. At 8 o'clock people left this building and went out to Canberra or went home after working solidly. They went out and had a dinner they really did not need, a large dinner at 8 o'clock at night. It would be far better for them to have a light meal at 6.30 and then go back to work at 8 o'clock than have a large meal late in the evening. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I raise today the government's failure to commission a 
 comprehensive and independent health and mortality study of Australians who participated in the British atomic tests and associated clean-up operations.
With the connivance of the Menzies government, the British government conducted 12 major, and hundreds of minor, atomic tests at Maralinga, Emu, and the Monte Bellos Islands between 1952 and 1963. The full extent of these tests was not revealed to the Australian public until the election of the Hawke Labor government, and the scandalous nature of their conduct was not properly examined until the McClelland royal commission, which commenced in July 1984 and reported in November the following year.
On the day on which the parliament paused to remember the life of the late Jim McClelland, it is appropriate to recall the work of the royal commission that he chaired, and particularly its recommendations that:
.	 Britain should fund a major clean up at Maralinga and Emu,
.	 the traditional Aboriginal owners should be compensated for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their lands, and
.	 a national register should be compiled of people exposed to radiation from the tests.
In response to the royal commission, the former Labor government initiated a $104 million clean-up of the Maralinga site and a $13.5 million compensation package for the traditional Aboriginal owners encompassing new outstations, improved health services, roads, water supplies and employment programs. Britain has contributed £20 million towards these two measures.
Some 15,000 Australian military and, I stress, civilian personnel were involved in some way in the British tests, and the local Aboriginal population was also severely affected. It is the situation of these personnel and local Aboriginals that I wish to highlight today. It is notable that Australia has devoted less attention to monitoring the health of its nuclear personnel than the British and has been less generous in providing compensation than the United States or New Zealand, who both provide repatriation benefits to defence personnel who were involved in nuclear tests.
A mortality study of 22,000 British nuclear veterans was first examined by the National Radiological Protection Board and reported in the British Medical Journal. More recently there has been a further study for the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association by the Australian researcher Sue Rabbitt Roff of Dundee University in Scotland. By contrast, the only Australian study ever made of nuclear personnel was the Donovan report by the Commonwealth Department of Health, which was conducted some 16 years ago. It was severely criticised by the McClelland royal commission which stated:
. . . the conclusions of the survey—
that is, the Donovan survey—
should have been more balanced . . . accepting that it was not possible to say that there was no radiation-induced illness or mortality.
The royal commission further concluded:
. . . because of the paucity of relevant information on which it is based, the Donovan Report cannot be regarded as an adequate epidemiological study.
The official UK study, published in 1988, found little difference between the overall death or cancer rates of nuclear veterans compared with a control group of veterans who were not involved in the tests. When specific cancers were considered, however, the atomic test participants had higher death and incidence rates of leukaemia—other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia—and multiple myeloma. This finding was consistent with earlier scientific work linking these cancers to radiation exposure.
In December 1993 the results of a follow-up investigation of the 1988 UK study were published. In the follow-up period there was no apparent difference in the death rate for nuclear participants compared with the control group. Mortality from leukaemia in the follow-up period was actually less in the participant group than for the control group. The study team concluded that the 1988 results were most likely the result of chance but that `the possibility that participation in the tests may have caused a small risk of leukaemia cannot be ruled out'. Following this study, both the UK, and later Australia, decided to no longer accept compensation claims for multiple myeloma as being linked to participation in the nuclear tests.
An Australian researcher, Sue Rabbitt Roff, was subsequently commissioned to study the mortality and morbidity of members of the British Nuclear Tests Veterans Association. This study was funded by the late Dame Catherine Cookson under the auspices of the Centre for Medical Education at Dundee University. Ms Rabbitt Roff's study involved a sample of approximately 12 per cent of all British nuclear veterans. To date the main output of the Dundee study has been a retrospective analysis of deaths reported to the BNTVA between 1983 and 1997. Whilst there is some dispute about the methodology employed, this study appears to show that these BNTVA members had double the expected death rate compared with the control group of working men.
The New Scientist of 4 April last year also reported her claim that up to 40 per cent of British nuclear veterans suffer from a rare and debilitating skin and bone syndrome called SAPHO.
More recently, in a media release issued on 13 December 1998, Ms Rabbitt Roff drew attention to an apparent anomaly in the number of cases of multiple myeloma reported in the official UK studies. Her data revealed twice as many cases as had been reported by the National Radiological Protection Board. She found evidence of 45 cases of multiple myeloma amongst British nuclear veterans, 32 of whom had died, whereas the NRPB had reported only 22 cases up to December 1990, nine of whom had died. Two-thirds of the cases among members of the organisation appeared to have been diag nosed after the December 1990 cut-off date for the NRPB follow-up study.
The British Ministry of Defence announced on 10 January this year that the NRPB had been commissioned to investigate these findings regarding multiple myeloma. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence 
 was quoted as saying, `The investigation would be carried out to reassure people that the disease is not linked to the tests.' I think most people would express concern about such rigid riding instructions to the investigation. Within a few hours of the British announcement, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Mr Scott, promised that an Australian researcher would be appointed to:
. . . examine Dundee University researcher Sue Rabbitt Roff's methodology, the scientific standard of her report, its relevance to Australian servicemen exposed to the same blasts and whether there is need for further investigation.
That is a quote from the AAP report of 11 January. I am critical of the government's response on two main grounds. Firstly, whilst there may be some value in commissioning an expert review of the Dundee findings about British veterans, this still does not give us any factual data on the health and mortality of Australian personnel and their families. To do this, we need to commission a rigorous and objective study of our own personnel. This is something that I have been advocating for over a year—with the endorsement of the ALP National Conference and as promised in Labor's defence policy statement at the last federal election. The specifics of the ALP National Conference resolution of January 1998 were as follows:
1. the establishment of a nominal roll of ADF personnel—
and, I would add, civilians and local Aborigines—
who had a demonstrable role in the conduct of the British tests and associated clean-up operations and were exposed to radiation as a result;
2. the conduct of a rigorous health and mortality study of all veterans included on the nominal roll and of their children and grandchildren. Independent researchers—
and I stress `independent'—
and representatives of the ex-service community must be extensively involved in the design and the conduct of the study; and
3. the establishment of a suitable mechanism to assist veterans to access government records on the atomic testing program and on their personal military service and associated medical treatment.
It further said that:
. . . on the basis of the outcome of the health and mortality study, Labor will examine whether the current schemes of Comcare, military compensation, special administrative scheme and act of grace are satisfactory mechanisms to solve their problems.
Secondly, there is no reason to be confident that the coalition proposes to actually do anything about the issue. On numerous occasions over the past 14 months, we have heard sympathetic noises from the coalition on the issue, but absolutely nothing has been done.
We first had the Deputy Prime Minister reported in the Australian of 29 December 1997 as promising that the government would closely consider Ms Roff's report. A spokesman for the then defence minister made a similar commitment in the Courier-Mail of 30 December—that is, way back in 1997—in relation to Dundee findings regarding veterans' children. Further, on 5 March 1998—almost a year ago now—the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Scott, wrote to the 
 Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council stating:
. . . the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel . . . will be co-ordinating the Government's examination of the Dundee study once it is completed. I can assure you that the Government will give this matter careful consideration.

"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I have great sorrow tonight in standing here to speak on the condolence motion for Jim Cope, who was a person who represented an electorate called Watson for many years, as I have for a few years. Jim served as the member for Watson from 1955 until 1968 when that seat was abolished in that form and became the electorate of Sydney. He then served from 1968 to 1975 as the member for Sydney. The electorate of Watson that was served so ably by Jim Cope was a very different electorate from the electorate of Watson that I represent today. There is an interesting parallel in that Jim was the member for Watson and became the Speaker of the House, and I was the Speaker of the House when I became the member for Watson, having been the member for Grayndler prior to a redistribution. So there are some similarities.
Jim Cope was a very decent man whom I had known as a young man in the Labor Party. When I became the Speaker of this parliament his were the first congratulations I got. From time to time he would ring up with a bit of advice, but mainly he would ring after there had been a rather hectic day. You would have gone back to your office—as I am sure you will, Mr Speaker—and thought, `It can't get much worse than that,' and Copey would ring up and say, `I listened to question time today, and you didn't do too badly. At least they haven't done to you what they did to me.' He would have a laugh about that. Sometimes when you had had those bad days Jim would give you a ring, and it made you feel a bit better. I think Jim Cope learnt what a lot of people learn being Speaker of the House of Representatives, which is that it is really a pretty lonely position, as you have no doubt thought from time to time, Mr Speaker, and I certainly thought from time to time.
The electorate that Jim represented was a lot different from the electorate that I represent now. The seat of Watson in those days covered the suburbs of Alexandria, Banksmeadow, Daceyville, Kensington West, Mascot, Pagewood, Rosebery, St Peters, Tempe and Waterloo. And of course the centre of it, as far 
 as Jim Cope was concerned, was Redfern, because Jim Cope was a person from Redfern and of Redfern, and he really was one of those great Labor characters that that suburb has thrown up. He lived in the same street in Redfern throughout his parliamentary career, which is something that probably not too many of us here can say.
I said originally that there were some parallels between his career and mine. All of us think that issues here move on, but some issues never move on. Another parallel between Jim Cope and me was that in 1968, 31 years ago, he served on the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, and he was concerned for his constituents who were then being subjected to noise from Sydney airport. So the member for Watson in 1968 was pretty concerned about aircraft noise in the same way that the member for Watson in 1999 is concerned about aircraft noise. I have no doubt that whoever represents Watson in another 30 years will probably still be concerned about aircraft noise. So I have often found that there were interesting little parallels in my life and that of Jim Cope.
Another parallel is that Jim Cope was a tradesman. Jim was a glassworker, the honorary treasurer of the New South Wales branch of the Glassworkers Union and the federal treasurer of that union. He came into the parliament as a glassworker. I came into the parliament as a telephone technician. In those days there were a lot of tradesmen representing the Labor Party; nowadays there are not too many tradesmen—or there are not enough tradesmen, in my view—representing the Labor Party.
He had a long career in both the industrial and political movement before he got into  parliament. He was an alderman on Redfern council in 1947 and 1948. He joined the Labor Party in 1930. He was a secretary of his local branch and a president of the Cook Electorate Council. He served the people of Redfern, the people of Watson and subsequently Sydney very well.
Unfortunately, I think people will remember Jim Cope more for what happened on 27 February 1975 rather than for what he brought to the role of Speaker. Those who remember Jim well—like Gordon Scholes, who was his deputy at the time, Kim Beazley's father, who served with him, and Frank Stewart, who was my predecessor as the member for Grayndler and had told me from time to time about Jim—know that he was the sort of person who had a great number of friends in the parliamentary Labor Party, including the father of the current member for Barton. Part of his round of friendship was that he was very good at the game of billiards. From what is left of the memorabilia from the old billiard room in the Old Parliament House you will see that Jim Cope was a very prolific billiard player. Those who served with him at the time recall that he was also a very generous host as a Speaker and that people used to call by his office in the Old Parliament House of an evening for a drink and a reminisce.
He was well liked by his colleagues and that is the reason he was elected to the position of Speaker. He put a lot of effort into understanding the standing 
 orders. He had a very good sense of humour, which is necessary in your job, Mr Speaker, as it was for him. Unfortunately, the events of that one day—27 February 1975—overrode a lot of the other things that people will think about Jim Cope. But a measure of Cope was that, even on that day, Peter Nixon, who was one of the people who brought him down—the troika of Sinclair, Nixon and Anthony were orchestrating the upheaval in the House in 1975—said of him that Jim Cope was a man. Nowadays, in these gender neutral times, that is not the most terrific compliment to throw around but, for a person of Jim Cope's generation, to be called a man by your opponent was a great compliment. Cope was that sort of person. He was a very honourable person.
When he lost the vote for the suspension of Clyde Cameron, he took it on the chin. There were plenty of precedents that he could have grabbed hold of and still held the job. Archie Cameron, when he was the Speaker, I think probably lost more votes in the House against his decisions than he won. Cope could always have found something in Cameron's history that would have allowed him to say, `The Prime Minister might have decided that he didn't want to uphold the Speaker's ruling, but that is not going to break my heart.' But, because Cope was an honourable person, he resigned. For him, that was a terribly sad thing to have to do because he was part of the generation of Labor people who had spent all their life in opposition.
He came to parliament in 1955 and it was not until 1972 that his party got into government. So he had only a couple of years in the job of Speaker, which meant so much to him. He was not brought down so much by the opposition but by what was, to put it at its most generous, just pent-up passion on both sides of the parliament which blew up that day and caused something to happen which has not happened since and I doubt ever will again.
So in some ways what Jim Cope did was to be a great help to Speakers in the future because, after that event of hubris which overtook the government that day, I think all other governments have been always a little bit careful not to put a Speaker into such a position. So what happened to Jim probably saved me and some of my predecessors and maybe you, Mr Speaker, and may save some of your successors. I think that Cope was a person whom we could all look up to. He had very much a sense of humour.
In those days, there was a predominance of Catholics representing the Labor Party in this parliament from New South Wales. In 1955, there were not many Catholics who represented the Labor Party from some of the other states because many of them had been purged from the party. On 11 September 1975, Cope said in a explanation:
I claim to have been misreported in a booklet entitled `A Biographical Register of Commonwealth Parliament 1901-1972' by Joan Ryden. The booklet  states that I am an RC. I am not an RC. I am an unfinancial Anglican.
That was the sort of joke that Cope would have had with people. Tomorrow we will farewell him from Christ Church Saint Lawrence in Sydney, which is where most unfinancial Anglicans should properly be 
 farewelled from. What we have seen with the passing of Jim Cope is the passing of another link with the past of the Labor Party, another link with those people who went through a lot of the trauma that there was in the Labor Party in the mid-1950s. More particularly, what we have seen with the death of Jim Cope is the death of a very decent, honourable man who put his party's interests above his own interests. Not only will he be sorely missed by Myrtle and his daughter Bonnie, but he will be sorely missed by all of us.
Tomorrow, I think we should celebrate the life of Jim Cope, celebrate the life of a person who was a great member for Watson and subsequently Sydney, the life of a fellow who was a great trade unionist and the life of a man who did what his constituents wanted him to do and was a person who truly represented the ethos of Redfern and of the Labor Party.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cope, Hon. James Francis, CMG</title>",Condolences,15,1,speech
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—Over the past few days, many people have spoken and written about the Hon. James Francis Cope, who was my predecessor as the member for Sydney. They have called him a modest man. He and his wife Myrtle lived in their Redfern terrace for 44 years. Even after many years in parliament, Mr Cope continued to record his occupation as `glassblower'. He was a staunch unionist and an ALP member for about 70 years and also an alderman on the former Redfern Council. He was a particularly proud resident of Redfern, which is a suburb at the heart of my electorate of Sydney.
After author Don Whitington had declared that Redfern was `almost a dirty word in Sydney' and peopled by `thugs and thieves, pimps and prostitutes, gunmen and gangsters and decent hardworking artisans and unskilled labourers too poor to live anywhere else,' Mr Cope replied that he would not claim that every person in Redfern was the perfect citizen. He said:
In some ways they may seem rough and ready, but I am proud to be one of them and would hazard a guess that people in many of the more affluent areas would like to have such friends and neighbours in times of stress.
He told one newspaper, `We're no angels, but you've got to stick up for a place that has produced one Governor-General—Bill McKell—and three state Premiers,' and, indeed, a Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Upon election to the federal parliament, Mr Cope's first speech called upon the Menzies government to increase pensions by £1 per week rather than the 10s per week that was proposed. He said:
Instead of their having to depend on charitable organisations for left-off clothing and a bowl of soup, some money could be taken out of the defence vote and used to assist them, because my policy is not one of guns before butter . . . Let me emphasise that what I say about the pensioners I mean. I have been through the mill. I know what it is to go without a meal. In the 1930s I was unemployed. I had a wife and a young baby and I was on the dole. But I doubt very much whether the Prime Minister or the Treasurer would know what it is to go without a meal. 

He told a newspaper on his ascension to the speakership:
I was out of work for three years—I was on the dole and I got precisely 14 shillings and tuppence a week. Six shillings of that went on rent for a little room in Redfern where I lived with my wife, Myrtle, and baby daughter Bonnie. I remember how we looked for work—50 or 60 men lined up outside this place in Camperdown each day, like a line of cattle, waiting for a job. And the boss would come out and say `you, you and you'. You couldn't afford fruit and vegies—yet you could go out to Sydney Heads and see them dumping the fruit and vegetables they couldn't sell into the sea. I thought there was something terribly wrong with this sort of system, and that's when I got interested in politics.
Mr Cope was a proud Australian who believed that the Governor-General should be an Australian, not a member of the British aristocracy. His arguments resonate with the current arguments for a republic and an Australian head of state. He said:
The present policy of the Government of appointing a member of the British nobility as Governor-General gives to people of other countries the impression that we are still in the antiquated days of traditional colonialism. It also creates the thought that Australians are an inferior race—that none of them possess the capacity, intellect and dignity required for the office of Governor-General.
Having been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George under the imperial honours system, Jim Cope later wanted to convert his honour to an Officer of the Order of Australia. Unfortunately, that was not possible.
As the honourable member for Watson has said, Jim Cope warned many years ago of the problems of aircraft noise. In 1966 Mr Cope wrote to the Australian warning that the `proposed supersonic airliners of the near future' would place a further burden on residents living near the airport. So, over 30 years ago, Jim Cope said:
We have now reached the stage when we must consider which is the most important, the speed and comfort of air travellers, or the health and welfare of residents living near major airports.
I believe residents in the electorate of Sydney would still find a lot to agree with in those words.
I have a particular reason to be grateful to the late Jim Cope. It is a reason that I share with colleagues such as the member for Swan, the member for Isaacs and the member for McMillan, amongst others. Mr Cope was an advocate throughout his parliamentary career of non-alphabetical listing of candidates on ballot papers for the House of Representatives. The donkey vote, he believed, accounted for up to four per cent of the vote in any seat.
He gave many examples to prove this, with many complicated calculations about the vote of the Democratic Labor Party and the Communist Party, but one particular example he gave related to a candidate who stood in a Queensland election. The candidate stood in order to make sure that the ALP candidate was not at the head of the ballot paper and immediately withdrew from the election. Despite withdrawing and despite newspaper reports at the time that this man was no longer a candidate, he still received 150 votes. Despite this move away from alphabetical listing first being proposed in relation to the Senate ballot paper 
 in 1939, it was not until 1983 that this anomaly was finally rectified.
Mr Cope was a witty interjector and many people have spoken today about some of his more famous quips, including his suggestion for a fourth site for the new parliament and his comments to Sir Robert Menzies, the then Prime Minister, about the truck driver. But he is probably best known for his role as Speaker and the way that he left that position. As Mungo MacCallum describes it:
Coalition members saw their transition to Opposition as an aberration to be remedied as soon as possible and by any means possible. To achieve this they were prepared to push the parliamentary process to its limits and beyond.
On one day Mr Cope, as Speaker, was forced to suspend three former Liberal ministers, including former Prime Minister Gorton. Today, and during the last few days, the story of Mr Cope's resignation has frequently been retold, but I have it on good authority, indeed from one of the members of the Paddington branch of the ALP who was Prime Minister at the time, that the story really begins much earlier than the day of the resignation.
Former Prime Minister Whitlam's refusal to allow the Leader of the House to move Mr Clyde Cameron's suspension followed a similar scenario several years earlier when Prime Minister Menzies refused to support Speaker Archie Cameron in similar circumstances, according to Mr Whitlam. There was a chance that the situation might have been defused, except that Ian Sinclair, in what the Deputy Prime Minister today described as a `brilliant move' and a `class act', jumped to his feet to move Mr Cameron's suspension. Nevertheless, Mr Cameron was quoted in the Australian as saying that Mr Cope was `an honest and decent bloke' who had been absolutely right to name him. `Jim Forbes,' he said, `made me too angry to be sane, and when Cope asked me to apologise and withdraw, I was just temporarily insane with anger.'
Whatever the historical reasons for the events of that day, it seems that Mr Cope never bore a grudge, always putting party unity before any personal disappointments he may have felt about the events leading to his resignation. He made his peace with Clyde Cameron and former Prime Minister Whitlam, who helped with the arrangement for Mr Cope's state funeral.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—It is with honour, but with some considerable sadness, of course, that I rise in memory of my friend Jim Cope. Jim was a member of my electorate for some 20 years. Indeed, until the last three years, he was an active member of the Ramsgate branch of the Labor Party, which is my branch and my father's. For quite a while, that branch was honoured with a former Speaker of the House of Representatives and the former President of the Senate, so very few members got away with anything on the rules. Jim always added that same colour and that same sense of professional interjection for which he was famous at those meetings. Whereas all political meetings, I suppose, 
 on both sides of the fence, can be pretty dull affairs, ones attended by Jim were really a pleasure.
Until the last three years, Jim kept pretty good health and an active life. In the last three years, bad problems he had with his legs and his vision were such that it was impossible for him to be cared for at home, and hence he went into a nursing home, which was actually in the electorate of the member for Watson. I visited him on a number of occasions there. Indeed, the last occasion I visited him was last Monday evening—a week ago today. He was clearly in a bad way and in a lot of discomfort, but even then he was more concerned with asking me how my wife was and how my children were and was clearly interested in them. He was able to account for the friends who had visited him. He mentioned that Joe Riordan, Les McMahon and Les Johnson, all former members, had all frequently visited him. Indeed, my father took great pleasure in going to visit Jim to go through some of the old stories.
Right up until the end he was very fortunate indeed and, if we can have that blessing, we will all be grateful to keep our faculties to the end. Jim once told me that, after retiring from parliament, he had made a practice of reciting to himself the American states in alphabetical order just for the mental agility. Apparently he did that on a daily basis. So if that is a recipe for keeping alertness, it is perhaps not a bad one. I have to say that I would fail the test today. But that is an interesting insight into him.
He kept an interest in affairs outside the parliament. We have heard of his interest in snooker. He was a life member of City Tattersalls where he was, I understand, highly respected as a snooker player until his vision started to deteriorate. He was a very active and keen member of the St George Leagues Club. He was a participant in all kinds of activities. I only knew Jim as a man of a small frame, but he would frequently boast to me of his cricketing achievements. In particular, he mentioned some famous bowler—whose name escapes me—who he hit a century against. He was proud of that, and I understand he was a New South Wales schoolboy cricketer.
Fundamentally, he was a real gentleman. People have said repeatedly that he was a very decent man, and that was something that came across in his manner. For instance, he persisted in telling me last Monday night what an asset I had in my wife Michelle and my family, which is true, but he was taking an interest in circumstances where he quite clearly knew that he was in a bad way.
It is with sadness—and is very much heartfelt—that we convey our sympathy to his wife of 67 years, Myrtle; his only daughter, Bonnie; his grandchildren, Leanne and James; and his great grandson, about whom he spoke with great fondness, Cameron Price. So it is with great honour but sadness that we pass on our condolences, but praise the memory of Jim Cope.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Cope, Hon.

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I will keep my remarks relatively brief, given the number of comments that have already been made by members on both sides of the House earlier today and this evening.
I first heard Jim Cope when I was a young whippersnapper out there listening to the  parliamentary debates on ABC radio in the days when ABC broadcasts used to interrupt the mainstream ABC metropolitan radio networks and parliament had one or two more listeners. Jim Cope was, I suppose, the first Speaker I remember listening to in parliament. He had a very tough job during the days of the Whitlam government. It was, I suppose, part of the nature of a reforming government such as that headed by Gough Whitlam that there was a lot of controversy about decisions that were taken by the government. The then opposition used every mechanism at its disposal to take the debate up to the government of the day, and that made Jim Cope's job very difficult during the time that he had the honour of being Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives.
I first met Jim Cope a number of years later after he had retired from the Australian parliament. I got to know two Labor Party members who lived at The Entrance, Joyce Buckley and her husband, Ken, who passed away in recent years. Jim Cope was Joyce Buckley's brother-in-law. I first met Jim Cope when Ken and Joyce were kind enough to invite me around for afternoon tea one day. Mr Speaker, I can tell you, you have not seen an afternoon tea until you have seen an afternoon tea put on at the home of Joyce and Ken Buckley—scones and jam and cream and biscuits and cakes.
It was a real honour to meet Jim Cope. He was a real gentleman, very quietly spoken and a very generous person. As others have mentioned, he was very proud of his origins—very proud of having been a long-term resident of Redfern, and very proud of the cohesion and the tough community support that exists in a community such as Redfern.
Gordon Scholes once said to me that if you go to Old Parliament House and visit what used to be the snooker room—I think perhaps even in the new snooker room—there is a plaque that lists the Australian parliamentary snooker champions. There was a competition that used to be run each year, and Gordon Scholes said to me that the reason the competition stopped was that Jim Cope kept winning year after year after year, and there was no competition at all because he was such a good snooker player.
His electorate of Sydney also covered Lord Howe Island and included a few of my relatives. I know that he was very keen to raise issues that affected that small group of constituents, who lived quite a long distance away from Redfern. He was a member who represented his community with great distinction.
I know that he was very proud of his family. As my colleague the member for Barton has already mentioned, his wife of 67 years, Myrtle, is very proud of not only Jim's achievements but the contribution that her family has made over many years. I am sure that all members would like to place on record the great distinction with which Jim Cope performed his duties over many years. His daughter Bonnie, her two children, Leanne and James and his great-grandson, Cameron, are very proud of the great things that he did during the time that he had the honour of repre 
 senting his electorate in the Australian House of Representatives and the time that he represented the House of Representatives during his two years as Speaker of the Australian parliament.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—I am replying to the second reading speech on the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1998  on behalf of the opposition. The bill reintroduces a bill that was previously before the House before it was prorogued.
The position of the opposition is continuing concern with the bill. In particular, my review of the previous debate has firmly formed in my mind the view that the government has failed to sufficiently justify the course of action that it is taking. It is a course of action to, if you like, disarm to a degree one of our armoury of government—that is, the Australian Government Solicitor, which represents the legal interests of the Commonwealth. It is not an insignificant act that the government is taking, and one would think that before it takes that act it would justify the reasons for it.
My reading of the previous speeches has failed to identify any revelation as to where there will be a costs benefit to the Commonwealth or indeed where there will be enhancement or improvement in the quality of legal services provided by the Australian Government Solicitor. Indeed, to the contrary, the indications are that costs will go up and the already respected Australian Government Solicitor will be under considerable pressure. So these things have to be put before us before we are prepared to accept such a significant disarming of the resources available to government.
There was an endeavour to portray our opposition as some sort of a throwback to a previous philosophy on the part of Labor. It is not that at all. It is simply a case of the government failing to justify its actions.
The government will say that its reasons are that it is implementing the recommendations of the Logan committee. The government will also say that this action is necessary because we need to change the employing base of the Australian Government Solicitor; it needs a mechanism to attract top quality lawyers and to pay them commercial rates. This formation of a statutory corporation, as the bill intends to do with the Australian Government Solicitor, is a means of freeing up the AGS—the Australian Government Solicitor—from the regimes of public sector employment.
But if you look at those justifications and at the terms of reference of the Logan committee, you see that they were specifically requested to consider the privatisation of the AGS. Indeed, it is somewhat reassuring when you look at the recommendations because the Logan committee itself, with the terms of reference skewed heavily to privatisation, came back and recommended against privatisation because of `the strong and necessary public interest in maintaining a central legal service for government'.
We are firmly of that view. There is indeed a very solid public interest in maintaining a competent, accessible, professional and objective legal service for government. The Logan committee effectively put forward this option which the government has taken as an alternative to privatisation of the AGS, but it is a gross overstatement to say that the Logan committee actually recommended this particular course of action.
In terms of the other rationale of the government, that is, to free up its ability to negotiate higher salaries and better terms and conditions of employment to retain its existing employees, to prevent them being poached by private firms, the way the government has elected to go is this formation of the statutory corporation. But there were other mechanisms involved, whether it be a schedule to the Public Service provisions dealing with the AGS or other forms of negotiation. There were certainly alternatives to this action that they have taken.
Even the rationale that higher salaries is the be-all and end-all from the point of view of lawyers currently employed by the Australian Government Solicitor is a bit presumptuous. Many whom I know and whom I have dealt with have chosen to go to the AGS because of the wide variety of work that they are able to undertake in moving through the various elements of the office, whether it is advice work to government, litigation work or whatever it might be. That has been a great source of attraction. Indeed, the fact that they are giving a valuable public service is another motivating factor. So to say that these lawyers are motivated purely by money is presumptuous in the extreme.
Assuming that the rationale is correct, that you are going to be in a position to attract more experienced lawyers or to retain experienced lawyers, is that rationale a valid basis for taking the particular action 
 which the government has taken? Again, you have got a fallacy here. There is talk of paying salaries on commercial partner rates, whether it is $250,000, $200,000 or $300,000, to engage someone who has had experience as a partner of a substantial private firm. The fallacy in reasoning is that quite often those partners of those private firms are paid the salaries they are paid not necessarily from any great legal expertise but because of their ability to attract work, to attract clientele, as a result of their commercial contacts or as a result simply of their public relations skills or skills as hosts. While these people might be on substantial salary packages as a result of those qualities or indeed their marketing qualities, those qualities may be quite irrelevant to working with the Australian Government Solicitor. There is obviously a limited clientele that the Australian Government Solicitor can attract—essentially government agencies. So those qualities that are often sought from high income earning partners in private firms may not necessarily be the desirable qualities that enhance the service of the Australian Government Solicitor.
The extent to which the ability to pay these large salaries will enhance the quality of the  AGS is questionable, particularly in circumstances where already the solicitors at the AGS are quite free to obtain the advice of experienced council if they have a complex legal issue or if they need to engage council to represent them in court. So the extent to which there is justification in paying these big salaries is questionable.
What have we got? The ability to pay higher salaries, potentially enabling the AGS to attract more experienced lawyers, is one point of questionable benefit to the AGS. What is the downside, as against that one and only possible benefit, as I can see it? The downside is significant. As a result of the imposition of the competitive neutrality principle on the AGS, the government's litigation services have been opened up to commercial tendering. 
This competitive neutrality principle has brought about a situation where the government will impose on this new statutory corporation, the AGS, the same taxation regime as applies to private firms, and other costs that are part of the on-costs of those private firms. That is estimated, on my research, to be in the vicinity of $5 million. Also, the government has the ability to impose a dividend equivalent to a private sector profit that otherwise would go to the partners of the private legal firms. That too is in the vicinity of $5 million.
Those costs will be, if you like, artificially imposed on the AGS because those costs are deemed costs that the AGS will face. Those deemed costs become actual costs because they will come out of the AGS budget. In addition to that cost burden, there will be a $20 million to $29 million fee for this transition to the statutory corporation arrangement and the redundancy payments that will be necessary, together with some other restructuring costs. So there is a significant cost involved in the action that the government is taking. Who will be paying for these costs? It will be government departments and agencies that will be paying for these costs. But the government has not seen fit to 
 give any additional allowance or subsidy to the departments to enable them to meet these additional legal costs.
Faced with that scenario, the departments are going to have three options. With regard to the first two, either they could pay more for legal fees by decreasing other areas of activity or they could reduce the services that they obtain from the Australian Government Solicitor. But who benefits from our departments not being able to access appropriate advice when they so require it? Ultimately, any errors that they make are errors that affect Australian people, whether they be individuals or businesses. So if there is reduced ability to access legal services, that is going to have a detrimental effect on the operations of government in general.
The third option they will have will be to engage their own in-house lawyers. This is a scenario that is happening in many private companies now, whether they be BHP or other moderate size companies. They are actually engaging their own in-house lawyers rather than meeting the cost of private practice. Increasingly, the rules differentiating solicitors and barristers are becoming blurred and more flexible, so quite often these in-house lawyers will brief counsel directly, bypassing any firms of solicitors at all. It is quite possible that government departments, faced with the greater cost burden, may take that particular course of action.
Who benefits from that course instead of advice being given to the departments from a central pool—a highly qualified and experienced pool—in matters affecting the government, with an extensive library and extensive corporate knowledge? Who benefits from taking that resource away from departments? Who benefits from the fact that departments will be getting advice from in-house lawyers rather than objective advice from another government instrumentality and an independent source—the Australian Government Solicitor?
The government has not examined the possibility of government departments engaging in-house lawyers as a result of opening up this competition and taking away from the services provided by the Australian Government Solicitor. But that is one scenario that is quite possible and, I would go so far as to say, is quite likely to occur. It is quite  astounding indeed that the government has not thought of that potential.
What is going to happen as a result of these increased charges? In many ways the proof of the pie is in the eating, or in what has already happened. In a Senate estimates hearing today, the government admitted that in September last year the AGS increased its fees by five per cent, partly in anticipation of this corporatised structure and the imposition of the competitive neutrality principle. The government was unable to provide an undertaking that the fees would not further increase as this system was implemented. So it is quite false to suggest that this competition—and I will address the fallacy of competition shortly—is going to decrease fees. In fact the evidence is—and the facts speak for themselves—that fees charged by the AGS have already gone up in anticipation. Commonsense suggests that they will go up further 
 when these actual artificial burdens are imposed on the AGS.
What has happened to this supposed competition that is going to be generated by what the government has done? The first thing to note is that the baseline of the competitors has already been increased by five per cent and is likely to go higher. Who benefits from that? It is likely that the private firms will actually increase the amount that they are charging the government. So who suffers? The departments and the Australian people will suffer as a result of that competitive playing field being elevated.
Let us look at this concept of competition. The government says there will be competition for the services of the government, therefore prices will come down. The private firms are competing, yes, but they are competing in an environment where they are already getting a wide range of commercial work. Bear in mind that we are usually talking about firms that are capable of doing government work—quite substantial firms, indeed, with well over 100 solicitors. They are quite big businesses. They are already in a marketplace where they are being paid commercial rates by other enterprises. If the price of doing government work is too low, they will simply say, `We are not interested. We would prefer to keep ourselves available to do this more highly paid commercial work. It is simply not economical to do the government work.' They are competing for government work, yes, but in an area in which they already have a substantial revenue source to sustain their firms.
On the other hand, what will be the ability of the Australian Government Solicitor to compete? It cannot. Constitutional advice to the government suggests that the Australian Government Solicitor cannot compete for private work. The best it can compete for in the legislation is perhaps state government work or local government work. Let us look at that. There is so much state government litigation against the Commonwealth that they would be crazy to retain the Australian Government Solicitor; it simply will not happen.
Let us look at local government work. While I suppose it is an expertise that could be obtained, it has never been part of the expertise of the Australian Government Solicitor to obtain intricate knowledge of local planning laws or of environment court procedures. It is just not something that they get involved in. Moreover, obtaining local government work would involve going out to meet local councillors and lobbying quite hard to get these institutions. No-one is suggesting that that has ever been done by anyone on behalf of the Australian Government Solicitor, nor would it be appropriate for it to be done.
The reality is that the Australian Government Solicitor has only one source of work, and that is from Commonwealth government agencies, departments and instrumentalities. The Australian Government Solicitor is locked in; it cannot go and compete for other work. So this concept of the ability to compete on behalf of the Australian Government Solicitor is a complete and utter fallacy.
The whole premise behind this government's legislation is flawed. The only competition that the Australian Government Solicitor is in is perhaps the competition for staff. It is not in the competition for clientele. So it is wrong to portray this legislation as bringing some massive benefit as a result of competition. That will not occur in a commercial sense. Indeed, the government's expectation that the AGS will profit as a result of that competition is entirely unrealistic.
The burden that the government is placing on the AGS to make profits is unrealistic. Private firms make their profits for a whole range of reasons. Yes, skill comes into it, but so does a lot of lobbying—to get a commercial client, a local council or trade union—whether it is wining, dining or cocktail parties. All these commercial firms of note are experts at that and have been able to develop substantial practices because of engaging in that activity. That, as much as the quality of their legal work, determines their profitability. It is all part of their marketing, all part of their system of operation.
It would be most inappropriate if the Australian Government Solicitor started engaging in that sort of activity, if it started wining and dining and holding cocktail parties for department heads, with a view to wooing their work. On the other hand, there is nothing at all to stop private firms from engaging in the activity and inviting those from government departments who control the allocation of legal work to such events—be they lunches, cocktail parties or just rubbing shoulders with the general clientele the commercial firm has. That will inevitably occur, so the AGS is going to be at a significant disadvantage in competing for this commercial work. One would like to think that our public servants are beyond that sort of thing, but I dare say they will be given a direction to make this system work or appear to work, by throwing at least initial briefs out to the private sector.
There is a concern that the quality of legal services will be affected, and that is a significant concern as a result of this contracting out of litigation services. Again, we are not talking about advice work; no-one would cavil at the idea that the Australian public is entitled to the very best advice available. And if there is a particular expert in a commercial firm or at the bar, it is quite appropriate that the Australian Government Solicitor or a department have access to that advice.
But we are actually talking about the litigation work of the Commonwealth—the champions of the cause of the Commonwealth, if you like—being tendered out to private organisations. There is a concern, and the government has acknowledged that concern by providing in this bill for the capacity to give legal service directions, where the Attorney can give directions as to how he would like work to be conducted, either generally or in specific cases. But when you look at that model, there are very few teeth to enforce those directions. Indeed, one would think that most of the complaints about breaches of the model litigant principle that the Commonwealth has adopted will come from opposing litigants, but those 
 opposing litigants do not have standing to evoke any remedy against the legal services directions. That can be done only by a Commonwealth agency, but they will be the ones benefiting from the performance of the legal work, so there is a substantial question about whether the mechanism available through the legal service directions is appropriate. 
The other concern we have in the same context is that the office to supervise and coordinate Commonwealth legal services will be staffed by only three people. They will be responsible for supervising the adherence to these legal service directions in what is in the vicinity of 15,000 pieces of litigation a year. That is just too much to humanly ask anyone. At the same time, they are responsible for coordinating these legal services now that they are going to be contracted out to a wide variety of private firms. That itself is a position of great responsibility, because one of the real strengths of the Australian Government Solicitor, as I have indicated, has been the corporate knowledge that it has had.
It has had years of representing the Commonwealth. It knows every twist and turn that has occurred over the last 100 years. All are noted, all are indexed, and all are catalogued in their library. Indeed, we see from the publications that the Australian Government Solicitor currently distributes that it provides an excellent educative function for government department as to developments in the law. That is under threat. And the government at least appears to acknowledge that. So these three people have the responsibility of supervising or enforcing these directions as to  how cases should properly be conducted as well as trying to coordinate this provision of legal services and build some method into retention of that knowledge.
The government just has not delivered the goods on what is required to properly undertake that role. I have spoken of my concerns at the loss of that corporate knowledge, and the significance of that just cannot be underestimated. That is something that the Commonwealth owns on behalf of the Australian people to protect their interests, and I think this bill will make significant incursions into that.
The point that I would like to conclude on is that the establishing of the statutory corporation will result quite clearly in changed employment circumstances. While I have referred to the situation of perhaps a lawyer with greater experience being able to command more money, that will not be the case for the bulk of employees. So the government would be short-sighted in the extreme if it were to simply unilaterally vary the existing terms and conditions of employment of existing staff of the Australian Government Solicitor.
Many people have elected to obtain employment in the AGS because of the perception that they are going to be employed by a fair employer. If the government does not behave as a fair employer and properly protect its existing employees during this transitional arrangement, it will lose a lot of goodwill which currently exists in the Australian Government Solicitor and which is under threat as a result of actions such 
 as this. So the government really needs to assure existing employees that their terms and conditions of employment will not be diminished as a result of the course of action it is undertaking. Others who may not feel comfortable with the new structure need to be assured that there are appropriate redundancy and redeployment provisions in place, and we have not seen that.
In conclusion, the position of the Labor Party, as previously, will be to oppose the bill. We are doing so because the government has not sufficiently identified the benefit that will be obtained in terms of either the reduction of the cost of litigation services or the enhancement of quality of litigation services. Indeed, indications are, from the actuality of increased costs, that the government has not been prepared to supplement the budgets of departments and instrumentalities to cope with these additional costs. So they are going to suffer in their ability to access the same extent of legal advice that they have become accustomed to.
The other concern which I have outlined is our concern that the government has not properly resourced the Office of Legal Service Coordination, which is essential if services are not to diminish. And finally, the government, from our point of view and indeed from the point of view of the union representing the employees, has not properly addressed the transitional arrangements for the existing staff. Unless and until those concerns are addressed, the opposition will continue to oppose this bill, as it has done previously.",REPS,<title>JUDICIARY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-02-08,"—The Judiciary Amendment Bill 1998  is one of significance and of necessity in the interests of maintaining the unique role of the Australian Government Solicitor and in the interests of enhancing the delivery of legal services available to the Commonwealth by introducing competition with the private sector. This bill provides opportunities for the new statutory authority, the Australian Government Solicitor, separate from the Attorney-General's Department, to carry out its work as provider of legal services to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth bodies and agencies—an extensive client base, I note—in a manner which will ensure that it can provide first-class, high quality cost-effective legal services in this increasingly demanding, complex and competitive legal marketplace.
This bill has had a long gestation period. It is the result of an extensive process of consultation, analysis and review. It has its origins back in 1995 when the then government commenced the process of providing choice to government clients. It is a response to an exercise required under national competition policy for examination of government enterprises and the provision of government  services in the context of national competition principles.
Further, the bill is a response to a report commissioned by the Attorney-General in November 1996 to review the Commonwealth's needs for legal services and how best to meet those needs. This report—the Logan report—was delivered in March 1997. Its review was extensive and the well-qualified committee consulted widely within government agencies and 
 departments, with the Australian Government Solicitor, with the legal practice and its clients. It consulted with private sector lawyers. It conducted a survey of legal practice clients. It invited and received submissions from the public, from private law firms and from within government.
As a result of the extensive inquiry, analysis and examination, as well as consultation with all affected parties, the Logan report made 16 recommendations to improve the provision of legal services to the government, its department and agencies. The coalition government accepted the main themes of the Logan report and, in response to its recommendations, this bill was first introduced into the House in November 1997.
The passage of time has not diminished the importance of this bill, nor its potential impact in enabling this separate statutory authority—the AGS—to provide legal services on a competitive and cost-effective basis to the Commonwealth. I am yet not able to understand why we are continuing to debate this bill and I lament the fact that the opposition continues to oppose it. It is a bill that ensures the viability, continuity and competitiveness of the AGS, the government's own law firm.
The opposition should be embracing this proposed structure to make the AGS a more efficient organisation. There are many fine lawyers within the AGS, dedicated and hard working lawyers who deserve the opportunity to be able to compete effectively with the private sector—dare I say, on a level playing field—and who will benefit in terms of the intellectual challenges as well as the increased employment opportunities and conditions which the restructure offers.
The Logan review did consider a number of options for the proposed restructure and the one selected was defined as a `public sector provider, separated from the department with greater contestability and transparency'. The committee found that there is a strong and necessary public interest in maintaining a central legal service provider. However, a separate, central legal service provider should be established so as to ensure competitive neutrality, to enable it to compete effectively with the private sector, and to be transparent and accountable.
No, the bill does not amount to a privatisation of the AGS. The Logan report—an independent review—determined that there is an important and continuing role for the government's own solicitors in providing legal advice, and determined that privatisation would not be in the Commonwealth's best interests. Heed was taken of the recommendation.
The AGS is already given statutory recognition as a body corporate by the Judiciary Act 1903, but it does not have currently a separate structure from the Attorney-General's Department. This bill establishes the AGS as a statutory authority separate from the Attorney-General's Department to give it the necessary transparency in its organisation and structure. It will operate as a government business enterprise. Government ownership will be maintained. This is in the public interest. There are sound and cogent 
 reasons why the assets of the legal practice should not be sold. It would be difficult to convert the major assets of the legal practice into a saleable form and so these assets will be maintained. They include the intangibles such as the practice's management and people, its historical performance, the high regard held for it by its clients, its goodwill and its irreplaceable corporate memory.
It must be recognised that the AGS has expertise in providing core legal services which public interest considerations demand be carried out exclusively by government lawyers—matters relating to cabinet, constitutional advice, national security and public international issues. The AGS can provide a `whole of government' approach.
So all legal work deemed to be non-core can be carried out either by the AGS or by private sector law firms and lawyers. Litigation is one of the major components of the legal work that will be contestable other than in core areas.	The AGS will be well placed to compete upon the passage of this bill. The Commonwealth agencies will have the freedom of choice of using the AGS or private sector firms, enabling the government to access the best available representation. Maintaining the legal practice but opening it up to greater competition will result not only in increased efficiencies for the AGS but also in a more efficient legal service delivery from the public and private sectors.
Although the AGS will be a government business enterprise, it will not be a corporation like other government business enterprises because current state and territory laws, which place restrictions on lawyers incorporating their practices, mean that it would not be possible to make the AGS a legal practitioner corporation—that is, lawfully able to practice in all jurisdictions under state and territory laws. The government does not consider it appropriate to legislate to shield the AGS from the operation of these state and territory laws and allow it to operate as a limited liability company. Further, establishing the AGS as a company, with directors having separate obligations under the Corporations Law, could impair the ability of the Attorney to properly supervise the AGS. As a statutory authority, the AGS will have a transparent organisational structure and enable it to focus on the provision of legal services to government.
The bill also contains measures to ensure that the AGS will not enjoy net competitive advantages over private law firms by virtue of its government ownership. In particular, the bill establishes the mechanism to require the AGS to pay to the Commonwealth amounts equivalent to any Commonwealth, state or territory taxes which do not otherwise apply to the AGS. It will therefore not enjoy any competitive tax advantage over private law firms.
We acknowledge that the AGS has been operating successfully on an administratively separate basis from the Attorney-General's Department since July 1997, but this bill is still necessary. Other factors need to be addressed before it can be said that the AGS is operating on a fully competitively neutral basis. First, the AGS is not currently able to employ its staff on 
 a competitive basis with private sector law firms because of the inflexibility of the current remuneration regime under the Public Service Act. If the AGS is not given greater flexibility, it will be operating at a significant disadvantage.
The difficulty in attracting staff is one concern. The employment conditions on offer to AGS lawyers will not be comparable to those available in the private sector. The Logan committee recognised that the AGS would need this flexibility to reward its staff and to provide incentives equivalent to those in the private sector. It was a recommendation of this independent review that the AGS be conferred with significant employment flexibility. This does not mean that there will be a wages bonanza for the AGS staff. Their salaries and benefits need to be funded, along with the other business expenses, including the payment to the government of the dividend and the tax equivalent payment—out of AGS income—in the same way as other businesses. Market and business principles will apply.
The restructured AGS will be managed by a chief executive officer. Under the bill, staff will be employed on terms and conditions determined by the CEO. Like all other business enterprises, it is not proposed that AGS staff be employed under the Public Service Act, and I reiterate that this is crucial to its long-term viability, as the AGS faces strong and healthy competition from the private sector.
In another life I was the managing partner of the Perth office of a national law firm. Incidentally, I have a current practising certificate, but I am not practising law. I am well aware of the salaries, benefits and conditions offered to legal practitioners in the private sector. I am also well aware that many government lawyers are attracted to the private sector for a variety of reasons. But from my experience and my knowledge of the  legal profession, both the public and private sectors, it is apparent that in order for the AGS to be able to compete with the private sector it must be free to negotiate wages and conditions with its staff. It must be able to compete to retain, or to attract, the best and most able and competent legal practitioners to carry out the government's work, as the private sector does. After all, the government, its departments and agencies and, through them, the members of the public for whom the agencies operate deserve no less.
The AGS will seek to employ people with the qualities and abilities that suit the needs of the AGS. If they are not in the market for an urbane rainmaker, they will not pay the salary necessary to attract one to the public sector. Under this bill, client departments and agencies should achieve better value for their money. It will give Commonwealth agencies greater freedom of choice, will ensure accountability in relation to their legal services and will deliver significant savings to expenditure on legal services. There is no evidence to suggest that departments will be paying more for the same level of services.
This bill contains provisions to enable the Attorney the ability to issue legal services directions. This is another reason why the passage of this bill is neces 
 sary. Until this bill is in place, the Attorney is not able to issue legal service directions. The full untying of Commonwealth litigation will not occur until these directions are in place, because these legal services directions will provide the comprehensive framework for protecting the Commonwealth's legal and policy interests and will enable the Attorney to exercise his role as first law officer in Commonwealth litigation conducted by private law firms. So, whilst it is possible for Commonwealth litigation to be untied under guidelines issued by the Attorney-General, it is essential that we have the legislative framework in place before litigation is untied on any large scale.
The legal services directions are essential to ensure the Attorney-General is in a position to maintain proper standards, particularly in litigation. The Commonwealth, as a model litigant, is required to act with complete propriety, fairly and in accordance with the highest professional standards. The legal services directions will ensure that that responsibility will be maintained. The power to issue directions will ensure that the Attorney-General will be in a position to manage risks that could arise from the provision of services that are inconsistent and will be able to ensure the necessary level of coordination.
This bill heralds a new age for the AGS. It should provide a challenging, vibrant and competitive environment for its practitioners and will result in the more efficient and cost effective provision of legal services to the Commonwealth. Obtaining the best legal advice and representation in court—advice that will be expert, extensive, diverse, coordinated, consistent and accountable and, after all, that is why at the end of the day legal service providers are chosen, cocktail parties notwithstanding—will enable the government, its departments and its agencies to act in a way that is designed to comprehend and carry out the relevant duties and powers conferred by legislation.
The opposition should have taken a constructive approach in this debate and recognised the very positive reforms this bill would deliver. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>JUDICIARY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1999-02-08,"—Basically, the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1998  aims to introduce competition into the provision of government legal services. It will do this by corporatising the Australian Government Solicitor and making it compete with the private sector for government work. The AGS will be headed by a CEO and will pay a dividend to its shareholder—the government.
The arguments for and against the proposal were well documented in the contributions by the Attorney-General and his shadow minister, and they make interesting reading. The government's rationale for the changes are the same old pro-competition ones: increased efficiency, greater choice and reduced costs. However, the government does recognise the fundamental difference between the role of the AGS and private companies. As the Attorney-General said in his speech:
The AGS is not, and cannot be, the same as privately owned law firms. Its unique value to  government is based on its government ownership and its expertise in delivering 
 consistent and coordinated legal services to government clients.
For these reasons, the changes will reserve some core areas of work solely for the AGS, and these include cabinet, constitutional, national security and public international law matters. The bill also gives the Attorney-General the power to direct the corporatised AGS to undertake specific legal work in other areas. It is in that split-up of roles that I believe the government is heading down an incorrect path in this legislation.
The opposition's view was set out clearly by the member for Banks, and his speech is worth reading again to gauge the reasons why the opposition and I oppose this bill. He goes though his experience as a lawyer in the public system and basically concludes that privatisation here will not enhance service to the government or to the people of Australia but simply line the pockets of partners in the top law firms. His conclusions include that the removal of staff at the AGS from employment under the Public Service Act will lead to vastly increased salaries at the top end and reductions at the bottom. From his experience in the public legal sector in New South Wales, he does not think competition has ever introduced benefits to the legal system. He says that the notion of public service is essential to the public legal system—I believe that as well—and the people who work there often do so to serve rather than to earn, which may seem something foreign in the sort of climate that exists in this competition-mad environment. The member for Banks also says that he expects the costs to actually rise, not to fall, with these changes and he says that the proposals do not provide sufficient safeguards for the public interest. I believe they are very convincing arguments.
As the member for Barton appeared to point out, the market is far more likely to force prices up in the lucrative legal area. As it stands, the AGS now acts as something of a break. One has only to look at the insurance privatisation in the state arena and the green slips debacle for competition delivering the reverse of the government's claimed intention.
From the advice I have received on the private legal system and from what I have observed myself, opening government work up to competition will not necessarily reduce costs or provide better services to the government. If the motivation for providing legal services is simply revenue and not the notion of public service or public interest, then I cannot see how these changes will lead to better services. Also, it seems hypocritical to, on the one hand, open the system up to competition but, on the other hand, ensure that the AGS has a public interest responsibility not shared by its competitors. How can the AGS compete effectively on that basis? It looks like a permanent, semipregnancy. For these reasons I cannot accept this as sound policy.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1999-02-08,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise in the House tonight to report to members of a quite exciting project that occurred in Canberra over the January holidays. Over the four days of 16, 17, 18 and 19 January of this year, ACT Scouts held their fifth Cuboree at Camp Cottermouth here in Canberra.
The Cuboree caters for cub scouts—girls and boys—between the ages of eight and 11 and, as I said, this was their fifth. They conduct these fairly enormous projects once every three years. The first Cuboree had 350 participants, and it was an attempt to run an adventure camp for cub scouts. The success has been the reason for its growth. This year, the fifth occasion for the Cuboree to be held, 1,628 participants were involved—approximately 1,200 cub scouts plus their leaders, parents, venturers and so on. This year the participants came from Canberra as well as New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania.
The thing of note about these Cuborees is not only the age group to which they cater but also the incredible amount of trouble that the organisers go to to adopt particularly definite themes. Concentrating very heavily on an integration of activities is the major aim. In other words, the activities are not just for the working day, so to speak, of the Cuboree but in fact targeted 24 hours of the day with things like camps mysteriously being moved in the dark of night so that when the youngsters wake up in the morning they have a whole new set of parameters facing them.
The first theme was a celebration of the 70th anniversary of cub scouting. Subsequent themes included Operation Earth Rescue, where the participants played the roles of visitors from other planets, checking out what we on earth had done to our soil, our water and our environment generally. Another theme was Lost Civilisations, where they built villages representing the Incas and Ancient Egypt as well as some of the civilisations in our current world that are under threat. The fourth Cuboree, Shaping our Future, attempted to look 10 years into the future. Time capsules were compiled and buried, and they are going to be dug up again at the Cuboree in 2005 by the youngsters of that time.
This year's theme, Worlds Apart—Something in Common, was a theme to learn about tolerance, understanding, and recognising and celebrating the differences that we see in each other. This is a very successful attempt to bring together young people in the age group of eight to 11, who can have a marvellous experience of learning, sharing, understanding, learning tolerance, as well as some of the more hands on lessons of survival, and learning to live with others.
Talking about survival, the day I visited the Cuboree, it was 37 degrees, with every single participant housed in tents of one sort or another out at Camp Cottermouth, just out in the west here. Water 
 trucks were going around ensuring that people were surviving, so living skills were a very big part of the four-day experience for them.
Commissioner Pat Boling of the ACT Scouts, Peter Harris, who is the ACT Arts Commissioner with the ACT Scouts, and all of those who have worked so hard in getting this amazing initiative to the point that it has got to now, deserve every accolade that we can give them. This is a really good example of teaching our young people and getting them at an early age to become enthusiastic about a whole range of challenging yet enjoyable experiences. The Cuboree is now so big that some of the interstate participants bring parts of the programs with them. This time, they successfully transported very large wooden cows, which were built in Victoria and trucked up to be part of one of the exhibitions. It has come to the point now where the Cuboree crosses all state and territory bounds.
As I said, hot, dusty, water trucks, enthusiasm and a wonderful atmosphere of learning, sharing and experiencing. Pat Boling, Peter Harris and everyone concerned with ACT Scouts and the Cuboree deserve every accolade that we can give them and every encouragement to continue this sort of innovation in the scout movement for the young people in our communities to continue to enjoy.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Capital Territory Scouts: Fifth Cuboree</title>,Adjournment,17,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-02-08," asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 11 November 1998:
Will the Government act to curb the number of bank closures in regional and suburban centres; if so, how.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Banking: Branch</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,19,1,question
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1999-02-08,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
While the Government appreciates the potential impact of bank branch closures on the residents, and indeed the economies, of many smaller communities, it is important to recognise that the Government does not determine the policies or guidelines banks adopt in closing a bank branch—they are a commercial decision for bank management. This is the same approach the honourable member's party took when it was in Government.
In determining how the Government might appropriately respond to such closures, account must be taken of the fact that branches are only one possible channel for providing financial services. There is a range of different mechanisms for delivering financial services, including technology-based methods, mobile financial advisers and alternative agency-style structures through the more traditional `human interface'. Facilities such as GiroPost at post offices and franchise concepts promoted by some banks provide smaller communities with `face-to-face' banking. Likewise, facilities such as EFTPOS, ATMs, telephone and internet banking increasingly provide a suitable electronic alternative for many customers. The acceptance of these electronic banking channels has risen markedly in recent years, with well over half of all customer transactions now conducted outside the branch.
The Government is addressing the matter in other ways. Continued support has been given to the CreditCare initiative, a joint venture with the credit union movement, to help residents in rural and remote communities left without banking support regain convenient access to basic financial services.
During the election campaign, the Government announced the Rural Transaction Centres program aimed at providing services, including personal banking, to rural areas. The initiative will be sufficiently flexible to ensure that rural centres complement, but do not duplicate, existing services or discourage the introduction of alternate services in a town.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Banking: Branch</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,19,1,answer
