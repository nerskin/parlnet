"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-06-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today relating to immigration.
While the government seems to have the view that there is no issue here, all Australians are concerned about the administration of the immigration department and the minister’s performance. Today was another example of the minister not being on top of what is going on in her own department, unable to provide answers to the most basic questions about a Chinese citizen, Mr Chen, who sought political or territorial asylum in this country.
The minister was unable to offer us any information, despite four or five questions on these issues, other than to refer us to a week-old press release put out by her department. That is the extent of her grasp—that is the extent of her knowledge of these matters and the extent to which she has informed herself about Mr Chen’s plight. The best she can do is read a week-old press release from the department in which it seeks to defend itself against accusations he has made about his treatment.
It is not good enough. It was not good enough for Ms Rau, it was not good enough for Ms Alvarez-Solon and it is certainly not good enough for Mr Chen. This is a minister who has totally lost control of her portfolio and a department that seems to have no idea of what the right thing to do is. We have had no explanation today—no detail and no answers to the legitimate questions about why a person in fear of his life and the life of his family was not granted political asylum and was not assisted.
Instead, what we got was an explanation which beggared belief. The explanation was, ‘Mr Chen did come into the DIMIA office. He did come in to have a chat with us. We didn’t know why he was there, but we rang up the Chinese consulate and discussed who he was with them.’ Mr Chen has produced a letter which is headed, ‘Seeking political asylum in Australia.’ We know he gave that to DIMIA at some stage, but DIMIA and the minister would have us believe that they did not know why this chap popped in. He popped in, he introduced himself and what do they do? Give the Chinese consulate a call and have a chat about him! DIMIA did not know why he was there but they gave the Chinese consulate a call. This is a man who is seeking political asylum because he fears for his life. We hear from Mr Chen in fact that within minutes he received a call on his mobile, while still in the immigration department’s offices.
What is the explanation for this? None. What answers can the minister provide? None. The minister was asked whether or not DIMIA were in fact in breach of the Migration Act, which provides protection for people seeking political asylum—section 336F of the Migration Act prohibits disclosure of information identifying an applicant to the foreign government from whom protection is sought. It is pretty straightforward: if you are looking to get political asylum, the Migration Act says you have got certain protections. But what does DIMIA do? On the face of it, it rings up the Chinese consulate and says, ‘We’ve got this bloke here. Is he really one of yours?’
—That’s not what happened.
—That is what he says happened; that is what the minister said happened today: ‘We didn’t know why he was there but we just gave them a call and mentioned that this bloke was here.’ Mr Downer, when asked, said, ‘He didn’t really formally apply for political asylum; he didn’t fill in the form.’ There is no form. He produced a letter seeking political asylum and Mr Downer tried to say he didn’t fill in the proper form. What we now know is that there is no form.
What he did was to seek protection and asylum from persecution and this government ignored him and tried to fob him off. They rang the Chinese consulate. That is not good enough, and the minister’s explanation today was not good enough. Something is deeply wrong inside that department and something is deeply wrong with her administration of that department. Mr Chen’s case is just another example. I understand that in the other place today Mr Downer admitted to a conversation with the Chinese ambassador about Mr Chen’s case. This will come out; we will get to the bottom of this. This government is arrogantly refusing to answer questions about how they have dealt with this man, a man who was in fear of his life and the life of his family. It is not good enough. It is not good enough for the minister to come in and try to close the asking of questions by simply referring to a week-old press release from her department. She has to be more accountable to this parliament.
There was no accountability today. What we are seeing is arrogance creeping into this government. They are not prepared to provide details as to why this man was fobbed off or why this man had DIMIA ring the consulate and effectively alert them to the fact that he was seeking asylum. These are serious issues that go to someone’s liberty and life. They are serious issues that deserve answers. Whether Mr Chen’s story is 100 per cent right, I do not know. But what we know from the minister today is that she is unable to provide an alternative version. She did not come clean. She read a week-old press release. That is not good enough. (Time expired)

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-06-14,"—It is not coincidental that we are participating in this take note debate at the end of question time while at the same time we in this place and those in the other place are debating the merit of the government’s Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005. This take note debate today is a political debate, as have been all the other debates initiated in this place on this issue by senators opposite. This debate, like all the other debates, is about getting the minister. The opposition is obsessively pursuing a witch-hunt against a minister who fulfils her responsibilities in a diligent and effective manner.
This is a debate that seeks to divert attention away from Labor’s dismal policy and leadership failures in the vital area of taxation, and to particularly divert attention away from the government’s reduction of the taxes that are levied on all Australians. That is what this debate is all about, as was the similar debate a week or two ago. The main reason why we are having this debate today is to divert attention from the Labor Party’s shameless and ignorant attitude and position in relation to the government’s tax cuts. Australians are not fooled by debates such as this.
Today the opposition raised several issues relating to Minister Vanstone’s administration of her department, including, among others, claims by a current Immigration officer on Lateline on Monday, 13 June 2005 and the handling of an asylum claim of a Chinese national. We just heard the leader of the Labor Party in this place talk about the minister not providing answers to questions asked of her. I listened very carefully to what the minister had to say in here today and, in relation to the claims made by a current Immigration officer on Lateline last night, there were several salient points which can and should be made and which obviously the leader of the Labor Party in this place missed taking note of.
The minister said today that if any officer within the department had any specific issues of concern, or still has specific issues of concern that they would like to make known, she is always available to see them and listen to them. We know that. Members opposite, including the leader of the Labor Party in this place, certainly know that. Anonymous claims, as the minister said, are obviously open to interpretation. Claims should not be made anonymously, particularly when the minister’s door is open.
Having said this, Australia’s asylum processes are world class. Claims of bias against unauthorised arrivals just do not stand up to even the most superficial scrutiny. It should be noted—and I know that all reasonable Australians will note this—that of the 10,000 unauthorised boat arrivals seeking protection since 1999, almost 80 per cent have been granted protection in the first instance by the minister’s department. Given this record, it is hard to see how claims of bias stand up. I respectfully suggest to honourable senators opposite that it is a matter for praise not criticism that the department was able to cope with the sheer number of unauthorised boat arrivals between 1999 and 2001.
In relation to the handling of the asylum claim by the Chinese national, the minister has also made several very relevant points which again senators opposite seek to ignore. But it is worth again going on the record very clearly and very precisely with what happened. This person’s visa application is being processed on its merits in the normal manner, although I stress here that it has priority. The circumstances demand that it be handled as a priority. Mr Chen was provided with a briefing on his visa options before he lodged a protection visa application with the department on Friday, 3 June 2005. That is a matter of public record. He was contacted by DIMIA early in the following week and offered the opportunity for a protection visa interview to be held later that week. At his request—and I stress that this was at his request—this interview has been rescheduled for a date acceptable to him, as he and his representative wanted more time to prepare his case. That again is a matter of public record which honourable senators opposite seek to ignore.
Much has been made of the minister’s reference to the media release. But it is a matter of public record that the department issued a press release making it clear that contact with the PRC consulate was short and that it only confirmed that the person in question worked with the consulate. It did not disclose any information about that person’s whereabouts or intentions. Again, honourable senators opposite ignore that. His position and his status were in no way compromised. The fact that he was seeking protection was not known to the department at the time, so how could they pass on any information to that effect? (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-06-14,"—What we have heard today from Senator Vanstone only confirms for the opposition that the department and the minister responsible for it should discontinue the view that the Palmer inquiry is a fix-all. It is not. It is not going to produce the results. The minister continues to hide behind the fact that the Palmer inquiry will provide an answer to all of the woes that currently beset the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Yet all we have had from the case of Rau onwards is mistake after mistake. These mistakes even go to areas which hitherto we would not have considered. We look at the Chen matter and we find another episode of DIMIA bungling administered by the minister.
More information entered the public arena through ‘Jamie’ on Lateline last night, when it came to light that people are not going to come forward to the Palmer inquiry. People are concerned about the way that they may be treated as a consequence of putting their hand up and saying, ‘I’ve got information that may assist. I’ve got information that may expose how the department of immigration actually works’—not how it should work or could work. Instead, we have people—and I suspect that there are more than simply the person on Lateline last night—who are too concerned, too afraid to demonstrate who they are and what the actual issues are because of the retribution that may be visited upon them. That is a culture within the department administered by the minister. It is not a culture that has just grown up without both former Minister Ruddock and now Minister Vanstone having anything to do with it. They are not in a position to be able to divorce themselves from the truth. The truth is that the department of immigration has gone downhill under their control and under their watch and something needs to be done—not something such as the Palmer inquiry, where Mr Palmer, for all his good intentions, is going to leave after the Rau case, as we understand it. We then find that Mr Comrie is going to take up the cudgels in relation to some 200 other cases that might need to be investigated, including the case of Ms Solon.
We need the minister to come into the chamber, to cut through all of this and to indicate that a royal commission is the only way that these issues will be dealt with, and dealt with in a serious and profound manner once and for all. Otherwise what we will face is this issue continuing to bubble through and other people coming forward and saying, ‘I was a bit concerned about making this known during the Palmer inquiry and I have more to add.’ Today Gerard Henderson, former chief of staff to John Howard, had this to say:
It is one matter for department officers to be given such powers of assessment, detention and deportation—
and, as an aside, very serious powers. Mr Henderson continued:
It is quite another matter when it is accepted by the minister that the same officers have a cultural problem with the way in which they handle asylum and migration issues.
The deauthorised department cannot be reformed without radical and all embracing change. In the meantime, victims of its deficient culture should have their cases reviewed by someone not in the need of “cultural change”.
That means that a royal commission is the only way that we are going to be presented with what actually happened, how it happened, what happened and when it happened, and not the farce we have at present, whereby Mr Palmer will hand down his full and complete report to the secretary of the very department that he is inquiring into. We may never know all of the issues that are ventilated in the report. The minister has not given us a guarantee that the report will be made public. It is a convenient way and it is a sleight of hand means of saying: ‘This is what we will do. We will get the report and we will consider what we will release. We will consider the recommendations.’ It is a filter. That is what the minister has in fact said she will do.
What we do not know is when the Palmer inquiry will finalise its report and for how long it will sit on the minister’s desk. Will she then sit on it until next Friday and release it at the end of this session of parliament so that we do not have an opportunity of seeing it? That is the usual course that this government would take and someone on that side should put a stop to it. We already heard that Mr Georgiou is not going to put up with it. He has not reached an agreement with the Howard government. He thinks the department of immigration is still in need of a fix-it job and he is going to introduce his bill today as well.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2005-06-14,"—The government and Minister Vanstone have responded promptly and appropriately to the request of Mr Chen, the Chinese national, for safety and protection. Mr Chen’s protection visa application was lodged, I understand, on 3 June. I also understand that it is being treated as a priority. Mr Chen has been contacted concerning his application and he has deferred the interview so that he and his advisers can further prepare for it. The government will follow normal processes in determining his status. Above all, he will be given a full and fair hearing. Mr Chen’s supporters also want Australia to provide him with territorial asylum. Mr Chen is like any other person seeking asylum. It will only be granted if he is considered to be at great personal risk. His application for a temporary protection visa is considered to be the most appropriate way to respond and to move forward, and that process is in place at the moment.
Australia has an enviable record in the strength and the administration of its immigration program. Australia will receive about 110,000 new Australians under our general immigration intake in 2004-05 and around another 10,000 to 12,000 under our humanitarian intake. This will include a large number of refugees and others who might qualify under TPV guidelines. Over one million potential Australian citizens take out papers to seek immigration to Australia each year. I think it is more than that; it is approaching 1.2 million. We are probably the destination of choice for many tens of millions around the world who wish to make a better life for themselves away from their country of birth.
We acknowledge our established responsibilities in this area and have done so consistently since World War II. More than seven million new Australians have made their way to our shores since that time to begin a new life for themselves. Included in that number are over 600,000 people who came here with a status that was based on humanitarian grounds. Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration policy. Above all, that policy is about nation building and it is based on priorities that most Australians feel comfortable with and in fact most Australians feel proud of. It is very much part of the make-up of our country and the way we see ourselves and, as a government, we will work very hard to maintain it.
The minister has responded to Mr Chen’s self-created status in an appropriate way. His rights will be considered in a proper way, and I understand that he and his family are safe. I might finish by saying that continued criticism of DIMIA and the minister is entirely counterproductive and should be seen for what it is—political opportunism from the Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,4,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2005-06-14,"—I note that the second speaker in support of Senator Vanstone managed to go for just three minutes in defence. That is not a very good effort from you, Senator Macdonald. I want to say that, in a government that is characterised by shoddy ministers and shoddy ministerial performance, Senator Vanstone takes the cake—not the birthday cake, of course, but what she herself now describes as a ‘sorry cake’. And what a sorry saga it is. Let us have a look at the ministerial record of Senator Vanstone and her predecessor, Mr Ruddock.
We have the case of Cornelia Rau, an Australian resident detained. We have the case of Vivian Alvarez Solon, an Australian citizen deported. We have a situation where an Australian citizen of Chinese origin was wrongfully detained because he was not carrying his passport. We have the case of a mentally ill person who was improperly detained, despite the fact that DIMIA itself sought to have him psychiatrically assessed. We have a judicial decision saying that DIMIA was responsible for culpable neglect and breached duty of care in relation to the refusal of psychiatric treatment for two detainees at Baxter. Neither detainee had seen a psychiatrist for 12 and 21 months respectively. We have the Chinese defector, Chen Yonglin, whose desire to defect was blown to the Chinese embassy by the very DIMIA staff that he had turned to for help. We have 201 other possible bungles that are being investigated by Mr Palmer. We have seen Minister Vanstone forced to backtrack over the fiasco surrounding East Timorese refugees. We have seen the minister overruled by Mr Howard when she tried to send newborn baby Michael Andrew Tran to Christmas Island with his parents. And, of course, we have a situation where Liberal Party backbenchers are in open revolt over the policies that Minister Vanstone is pursuing and over her administration of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.
It is no wonder that they are in such open revolt, because we do have a government department that seems to be out of control. It is out of control because there is no ministerial responsibility or no ministerial hand being applied to deal with the problems. Minister Vanstone is either unwilling or unable to fix these problems. What is the minister’s response to these issues? It is blame shifting. The two people who are responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves in relation to immigration policy and the administration of the department of immigration are Mr Ruddock, the previous minister, and Senator Vanstone, the current minister. They are the two people who are responsible—Mr Ruddock and Senator Vanstone—and the only response from Senator Vanstone is blame shifting. She always blames the department. She never accepts responsibility herself, and Mr Ruddock never accepts responsibility for his appalling administration. And do you know who the sacrificial lamb is going to be, Mr Deputy President Hogg? I will tell you. The sacrificial lamb will be Mr Bill Farmer, the secretary of the department of immigration—and if you did not know it before the weekend, you certainly know it now, because he has already been rewarded with an Order of Australia. Yes, the writing is on the wall for Mr Farmer. He is a goner. He is getting the blame. The end is nigh for Mr Farmer. (Time expired)

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-06-14,"—I agree with and support the Labor Party in taking note of the broad issues of immigration today.
—Thank you very much for that.
—I accept Senator Faulkner’s thanks. However, I do have to put on the record that the Labor Party’s case in relation to exposing human rights abuses in China, particularly recently, has been a little less than sparkling. The Democrats have attempted in the past to draw attention to these issues. However, motions I have tried to move highlighting the issues involving Falun Gong practitioners and their persecution have not been supported by the Labor Party. Similarly, as I am sure honourable senators would recall, in the lead-up to the visits from both President Bush and President Hu, there were motions bringing the parliament’s attention to human rights abuses in both of those countries. Extraordinarily, the Labor Party supported the motion that exposed US problems but did not support the motion involving human rights abuses in China. So the Labor Party start from a pretty low base.
But, even saying that, in this case the Labor Party have gone on recording stating that a number of individual cases—cases where application has been made for asylum—are worth supporting, and they should be heard on that issue. I also asked a question on this in the parliament today. In particular, I was curious to know what moves the government had made in terms of looking into the issue of the Lan Fu kidnapping. Given that the case is a few years old, I would have thought that the Minister for Justice and Customs would have had a little more to report today, but he did not.
In relation to ASIO or any other government agency’s investigation into the substance or otherwise of the claims that have been made by Mr Chen, again, there has been a lack of information provided to the chamber by the minister. When Mr Chen’s case first came to light, I said that the first and foremost priority for our government must be to ensure the safety of Mr Chen and his family. Of course, the same must be said of other Chinese defectors who have sought asylum in this country. In this respect, the government’s actions deserve further questioning. Although the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs came out yesterday assuring the public that Mr Chen’s case would be given priority by the department, she has failed to explain to the chamber why Mr Hao’s case has received low priority. I think his application was made in February. What about the applications made by Professor Yuan Hong Bing and his assistant Zhao Jing? They also remain unresolved after a year. So it is not just Mr Chen’s case; there are many other cases that we feel the department and the government should come clean about. Given that numerous states, international bodies and human rights organisations around the world have condemned human rights abuses—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—You cannot argue that you want to be taken seriously and then talk and laugh through any discussion about human rights abuses in China. Human rights organisations have condemned human rights abuses in China. There is widespread evidence of ongoing human rights violations currently, so it seems extraordinary to me and to the Democrats that the government should take such a long time to establish that these individuals are likely or not likely to be persecuted if they return. We need information from the government on those particular cases.
The Chen case also raises a number of issues in relation to application for political asylum in Australia. Our law does provide for individuals to seek political asylum in Australia. I would assume that Mr Chen’s circumstances, are the precise circumstances in which political asylum could reasonably be granted. Mr Chen, it has been indicated, has been told that it is more appropriate that he apply for a protection visa. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said there have been only two successful claims for asylum under the political asylum category in Australia. Is that being used as an excuse: the fact that this particular category is invoked rarely and therefore it is unlikely that he would be successful or that it is inappropriate for him to claim under that particular asylum or visa category? Our law allows for it, and he should be allowed to apply successfully. (Time expired)

Suite M1.24
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister

I refer to the following Guidelines made under section 238-10 of the 
Higher Education Support Act 2003
.


Administration Guidelines

These Guidelinesrevise the Administration Guidelines by including new provisions concerning the reporting obligations of higher education providers and the requirements for provision of Commonwealth Assistance Notices to students.
According to the Explanatory Statement, these Guidelines purport to revoke and replace the previous Administration Guidelines that commenced on 30 June 2004. However, neither the making statement that accompanies these Guidelines, nor the Guidelines themselves, expressly revoke the previous Guidelines.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 22 January 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Guidelines. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Tchen
Thank you for your letter of 2 December 2004 concerning your request for clarification on a number of matters relating to the content of some of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 Guidelines. I appreciate the Committee’s input and apologise for the delay in replying.

Administration Guidelines

The Committee has asked for clarification about the status of the Administration Guidelines. These were first gazetted on 17 July 2004 and then amended with a full version gazetted on 10 August 2004. The Explanatory Statement revoked the previous version.

Amendment No. I was made to the Guidelines on 17 August 2004. Only the amendment was gazetted on that date and the Explanatory Statement clearly states that “These Guidelines amend the Administration Guidelines.”

Comments

To avoid further uncertainty in the content and status of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 Guidelines in the future, I have asked my Department to ensure that all Explanatory Statements that accompany the Guidelines and amendments to the Guidelines are as informative as possible.
Thank you for bringing these matters to my attention.

Dear Minister

Thank you for your letter of 7 March 2005 responding the Committee’s concerns with the following Guidelines made under section 238-10 of the 
Higher Education Support Act 2003
.


Administration Guidelines

The Committee notes your advice that these Guidelines were first gazetted on 17 July 2004 and then amended with a full version gazetted on 10 August 2004. The Committee is, however, concerned that the version gazetted on 17 July 2004 was taken to have been revoked by the Explanatory Statement accompanying the full version. An Explanatory Statement accompanying an instrument has no legislative character and as such the statement revoking the previous version on 17 July 2004 has no effect. The Committee therefore suggests that the status of the earlier Guidelines should be clarified with their revocation by another legislative instrument. In the meantime, the Committee has given a notice of motion to disallow the Guidelines gazetted on 10 August 2004.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 22 April 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Guidelines. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Mr Tchen
Thank you for your letter of 10 March 2005 concerning certain Higher Education Support Act 2003 Guidelines, which was in response to my letter of 7 March 2005. I appreciate the Committee’s continued feedback on this matter.

The Administration Guidelines

Thank you for your advice that an Explanatory Statement accompanying an instrument has no legislative character and consequently, the statement revoking the 17 July 2004 version of the Administration Guidelines has no effect. I note the Committee’s suggestion that the status of the earlier Guidelines should be clarified with their revocation by another legislative instrument.
In line with this suggestion, I will shortly make and table in Parliament a consolidated version of the Administration Guidelines incorporating all previous amendments and this will allow the publication of the Guidelines in their entirety. Furthermore, all previous versions and amendments to the guidelines will be revoked.
I trust that the Committee will agree to withdraw its notice of disallowance on the Guidelines gazetted on 10 August 2004.
Once again, thank you for your input on these matters.

Guidelines in relation to the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the 
Workplace Relations Act 1996

6 December 2004
The Hon Kevin Andrews MP
Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations
Suite MG.48
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister

I refer to the Guidelines in relation to the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. These Guidelines specify guidelines to be used by a delegate of the Secretary to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in exercising powers under Part VA of the Act, such as requiring a person to provide information or documents in relation to a building industry investigation. The Committee raises the following matters with regard to some of the provisions contained in these Guidelines.

These Guidelines commence on the date from which Schedule 4 to the 
Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act 2004
 commences. The Explanatory Statement does not give any indication of a likely or anticipated commencement date for that Schedule although the Summary to the Guidelines indicates that this date was expected to be in September 2004. Schedule 4 does not appear to have commenced at this time and the commencement of these Guidelines remains uncertain. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice on the expected commencement of the amendment Act.

Clause 15 of these Guidelines specifies limitations on the use of the power to issue a notice. Paragraph (a) states that a power must only be used for building industry investigations, but must not be used for matters that are minor or petty. This reflects subsection 88AA(3) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (as amended). There may be differences of opinion as to whether a matter is ‘minor or petty’. The Committee therefore seeks your advice as to the processes to be followed when a recipient of a notice believes that the matter is minor or petty.
Further, clause 15(b) of the Guidelines states that the power to issue a notice must be used in good faith and not for a collateral purpose. Subsection 88AA(1) of the Act requires the Secretary to have reasonable grounds for believing that a notice should be issued. The Committee suggests it may be preferable if the good faith/non-collateral purpose requirement was also specified in this subsection, rather than the Guidelines.
Finally, the Committee seeks your advice as to whether there are procedures for the return of documents that have been supplied in response to a notice.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 22 January 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Guidelines. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Tchen
Thank you for your letter of 6 December 2004 concerning the Guidelines in relation to the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction industry made under section 88AGA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.

You asked for advice as to when Schedule 4 of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act 2004 commences. The Act provides that Schedule 4 will commence on a single day to be fixed by Proclamation or six months after the Act receives the Royal Assent. As the Schedule has not been proclaimed it will commence on the 13 January 2005. However the Guidelines will not commence until after a disallowance period. The period for disallowance commenced on 16 November, the first day of the 41st parliament. The Building Industry Taskforce can not exercise the Schedule 4 powers until the Guidelines have passed the disallowance period.
You asked for advice as to the processes to be followed when a recipient of a notice to produce documents believes that the matter is minor or petty. The legislation and Guidelines include sufficient safeguards, including extensive preliminary procedures the delegate must satisfy before issuing a notice, which should prevent notices relating to minor or petty issues being issued. However, if a person believes that the power is being used for a minor or petty purpose they may refuse to comply, just as they can refuse to comply if some other element of the requirements has not been complied with. It would also be open for a person to seek a declaration from the Federal Court that the notice was invalid.
The Committee’s suggestion that it may be preferable if the good faith/non-collateral purpose requirement be specified in subsection 88AA(1), rather than the Guidelines is noted. However, given the safeguards contained in the Guidelines and legislation I consider that it is sufficient that such requirements are contained only in the Guidelines.
You asked for advice as to whether there are procedures for the return of documents that have been supplied in response to a notice. The process and procedures by which documents are returned would be a matter for the Building Industry Taskforce or the Secretary to determine. However it should be noted that the Secretary or delegate can only keep a document for as long as it is necessary for the purposes of the conduct of the investigation to which the document is relevant (subsection 88AD(1)). The person that is otherwise entitled to possession of the document is entitled to be supplied with a certified copy of the document (subsection 88AD(2)). The processes put in place will ensure that the Secretary or Building Industry Taskforce do not retain documents for any longer than they are legally entitled to.
I trust that this letter is of assistance to the Committee.

Dear Minister

Thank you for your letter of 5 January 2005 providing advice in relation to the Guidelines for the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. This advice addresses a number of the Committee’s concerns.
The Committee sought advice on the processes to be followed where the recipient of a notice to produce documents believed that the matter was minor or petty. In your letter you advise that such a recipient “may refuse to comply” or, alternatively, might seek a Federal Court declaration.
I seek your confirmation that these are the only two procedures available, and that the Guidelines do not contemplate a way of resolving such a matter without compelling the involvement of the Court. I also seek your advice on the consequences for a recipient who simply refuses to comply because he or she considers the matter to be minor.
The Committee would appreciate your further advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 3 March 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Guidelines. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Tchen
Thank you for your letter of 10 February 2005 seeking further advice on behalf of the Standing Committee regarding the Guidelines for the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.

You seek confirmation that the Guidelines do not contemplate a way of resolving such a matter without compelling the involvement of the Court.
The Guidelines, which are closely modelled on Guidelines issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in relation to the exercise of information gathering powers under section 155 of the Trade Practices Act 1974, have been carefully devised to ensure that there are adequate safeguards to prevent a notice being issued for a minor or improper purpose.
The Guidelines make it clear that seeking information or documents voluntarily is to be preferred and that resort to the compliance powers should only be contemplated in circumstances in which other avenues have been pursued. A notice is not to be issued without a ‘belief on reasonable grounds’ in relation to the matter. It is made clear in the Guidelines that the power cannot be exercised for minor or petty purposes.
The Guidelines also refer to directions to be issued by the Secretary to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations that will, amongst other matters, provide that the Secretary will have to approve each exercise of the powers.
The Guidelines and directions taken together will ensure a high level of scrutiny of the issuing of a notice to ensure that it is issued for proper purposes.
The combined effect of the Guidelines and the Secretary’s Directions will ensure that the powers are not used for minor or petty matters. As there are sufficient safeguards contained in the Guidelines and Secretary’s Directions it is not necessary to provide a process for a person to challenge the notice. Doing so would only provide a means for any person who receives a notice to seek to avoid or delay compliance with that notice.
The compliance powers are similar to those contained in section 155 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. It is noteworthy that neither the Trade Practices Act nor the Guidelines issued by the ACCC provide any process for a person to challenge a notice.
You also seek advice on the consequences for a recipient who simply refuses to comply because he or she considers the matter to be minor.
Section 88AA(7) provides that failure to comply with a notice is an offence. However, this will only be the case if the notice is valid. If a notice was issued for the purpose of an investigation that was minor or petty it would not be a valid notice.
As noted in my response to your previous letter, it would also be open to a person to seek a declaration from the Federal Court.
Thank you for bring the Committee’s concerns to my attention. I trust that this letter will address those concerns.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 2 March 2005 providing further advice in relation to the Guidelines for the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The letter raises two further issues in relation to which the Committee seeks clarification.
The Committee previously sought advice on the processes to be followed where the recipient of a notice to produce documents believes that the matter is minor or petty. In your letter you advise that the “combined effect of the Guidelines and the Secretary’s Directions will ensure that the powers are not used for minor or petty matters,” and that “as there are sufficient safeguards contained in the Guidelines and Secretary’s Directions it is not necessary to provide a process for a person to challenge the notice”. Given the significance of the Secretary’s Directions in regulating the exercise of power in this area, the Committee would appreciate an opportunity to examine those Directions.
Secondly, in your letter you note that section 88AA(7) of the Act provides that failure to comply with a notice is an offence. However, this is only the case if a notice is valid, and a notice issued for the purpose of a minor or petty investigation would not be a valid notice. Ultimately, it becomes a matter for challenge in the Federal Court. This approach seems to continue a trend of imposing an obligation on recipients of notices and other ‘offenders’ to challenge the validity of actions taken against them. As a matter of principle, applicants should bear the burden of having to demonstrate the validity of their claims. Defendants should not have to bear the burden of, in effect, disproving the validity of claims made against them.
The Committee would appreciate your further advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 26 April 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Guidelines. In the meantime, the Committee has given a notice of motion to disallow the Guidelines pending your response on these matters. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Tchen
Thank you for your letter of 10 March 2005 seeking further advice on behalf of the Standing Committee regarding the Guidelines for the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.
You have requested an opportunity to examine the Secretary’s Directions in relation to the exercise of these powers. My Department is currently developing these Directions but they are not expected to be finalised until the powers take effect. However, I consider that the Guidelines provide comprehensive insight into what the Directions will ultimately contain. At page 5 of the Guidelines, there is a comprehensive section dealing with what the Directions will contain.
Essentially the Guidelines will be the main source of the Directions. The relevant sections setting out what will be in the Directions is extracted below.

The Secretary’s directions require:

Taskforce investigations to be initiated using the general powers available to Taskforce investigators under the Act e.g. section 86.
The voluntary provision of information/documentation and the use of pre-existing information gathering powers are to be the preferred forms of obtaining information/documentation directed at ensuring compliance with and/or investigating suspected/alleged breaches of the Act or an agreement or award made under the Act.
Resort to the use of Pt VA compliance powers should only be contemplated by the delegate in circumstances in which other avenues available to the Taskforce to obtain information on a voluntary basis or by use of information gathering powers under section 83BH and 86 of the Act have been pursued or are not considered to be adequate to obtain information necessary for an investigation, because for example there is a risk that the information may be destroyed, not provided or provided only on terms unacceptable to the Secretary or the delegate.
Where the delegate proposes to exercise the power under subsection 88AA(1), by written notice, and require a person to give information, produce documents, or attend and answer questions on oath or affirmation, the delegate will advise the Secretary prior to issuing a notice and will provide the Secretary with details of  the types of the information/documentation/evidence being sought; a summary of the alleged incident, conduct/behavior or case being investigated and the reasons for his belief that the power should be exercised in this case. In accordance with subsection 88A1(2) the Secretary will provide, the Ombudsman with such information and access to documents as required.
The Secretary will consider the delegate’s advice and convey in writing to the delegate whether he agrees with the delegate’s decision to do so.
The delegate will not issue a notice without the Secretary’s agreement.
The Directions will simply be a brief document outlining the requirements as detailed above.
In addition to the Secretary’s Directions, I would draw your attention to the following sections from the Guidelines indicating the ‘Limits on the use of powers’ (p8) and the ‘Requirements of a valid notice’ (p9):

‘Limits on the use of powers’

15.   There are a number of limitations on the use of the power.
16.   The investigative power does not extend to evidence gathering once an investigation is concluded and proceedings commenced. The delegate may not be able to issue a notice after legal proceedings have commenced if doing so would interfere with a person’s rights to protection against self-incrimination and self-exposure to a penalty which apply in court proceedings and/or would interfere with the court’s inherent power to conduct its own proceedings.
17.   While it is not possible to provide guidance on all possible circumstances, the delegate will generally not issue a notice to a private individual or a corporate respondent involved in proceedings. Rather, the delegate will rather rely on court procedures, such as discovery, notices to produce and admit, interrogatories and subpoenas.
18.   The power to issue a notice for the purposes of a Taskforce investigation is not affected by another party instituting proceedings against the proposed addressee of the notice. A decision by the Taskforce to begin proceedings, as distinct from actually beginning proceedings, does not necessarily preclude it from issuing a section 88AA notice.
These limits are one of the many safeguards against the improper use of these powers. The protections that the limits on the use of the powers provide include that the power can not be used for a matter that is minor or petty, that the power to issue a notice must be used in good faith and that the notice should not be unreasonably burdensome. They place conditions on when the powers may be exercised and require that the potential burden on a recipient be considered.

‘Requirements of a valid notice’

19.   A notice requiring the addressee to provide information or documents must:
disclose on its face the nature of the building industry investigation in relation to which the Secretary or delegate believes on reasonable grounds that a person has information, documents or evidence relevant to a building industry investigation;
specify the information or documents in enough detail to provide the addressee with a point of reference by which to judge whether the notice validly requires information/documents/evidence to be provided; and
request information or documents relevant to the investigation.
20.   If a notice requires a person to attend an oral examination, the description of the nature of the building industry investigation determines the scope of the questions that can be asked at the examination.
21.   Given the investigative nature of the notice, there is no requirement that it will set out all the facts necessary to constitute a contravention or possible contravention. Nor is it necessary to set out the relevant evidence or information on which the delegate decided to issue the notice.
22.   The nature of the investigation will be described simply but in enough detail for the addressee to know what the subject matter (and possible contravention of the Act) is.
These criteria should ensure that a notice is only issued for a valid purpose. They require the nature of the investigation to be disclosed in the notice, for the notice to give enough detail of the information or documents required and that the notice must request information or documents relevant to the investigation. The detail that must be provided in a notice will make it clear the matter is not to be minor or petty.

Scope of information and documents that can be required

23.   Information/documents shall not be sought that would:
require the addressee to give an interpretation of a document, except where explanations of symbols, codes, etc. may be necessary; or
require the addressee to seek out information or documents which are not in its possession, custody or control or to formulate an opinion on a particular matter.
24.   A notice may be directed to a body corporate, but where information about awareness, knowledge or belief is required; the notice should be directed to particular persons, for example company officers, directors or employees.
This restriction on the scope of information should further ensure the appropriate exercise of these powers.
As I explained in my previous letter, these Directions taken in conjunction with the limitations contained in the Guidelines provide sufficient safeguards to ensure that the powers are not used for minor or petty matters.
The purpose of these powers is to facilitate compliance activity in the building and construction industry. There are limits imposed on the operation of these powers and the Taskforce will be required to satisfy extensive requirements before they issue a notice. It is the nature of an investigation of this kind that the powers should operate in this way and I consider that too many conditions would render these powers ineffective. I am confident that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure they are used appropriately.
In the process of drawing up the Guidelines, my Department has drawn upon its extensive legal experience in drafting legislation specifically for the construction industry. As a result, I believe that we have struck a balance between ensuring that the powers are used appropriately and ensuring that the powers are able to be effective. I consider that too many additional conditions would now render these powers ineffective. I am confident that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure they are used appropriately.
It should be noted that it would be for the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute any case involving failure to comply with a notice to produce documents or give evidence. The ‘Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth’ sets out criteria governing the decision to proceed. Key amongst these criteria are considerations of fairness and consistency. The criteria governing the decision to prosecute specifically state that “[t]he initial consideration in the exercise of this discretion is whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the institution or continuation of a prosecution.” Applying these Guidelines would mean that it would be extremely unlikely that a prosecution would be pursued in a case of a notice being issued for a minor or petty purpose.
I do not accept your concerns that the defendant is bearing an unreasonable burden in a situation where they consider that a notice is invalid as it relates to a minor or petty matter.
My Department has sought advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) about whether it would be for the prosecution or defence to establish that a notice had been issued for a minor or petty purpose. AGS have advised that if a prosecution has been commenced against a person for non-compliance with a notice and the person claims, at any point, that the notice has been issued for a minor or petty purpose then the prosecution would have to prove the notice was not issued for the purposes of an investigation that is minor or petty. The prosecution would have to prove this beyond a reasonable doubt. I have attached a copy of that advice for your information.
In conclusion, I would also note that the Guidelines are modelled on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Guidelines for their information-gathering powers. In addition section 88AI of the Act provides that there will be an annual review by the Ombudsman of the exercise of the section 88AA power. The Secretary must provide the Ombudsman with such information and access to documents as the Ombudsman requires. The Ombudsman must cause a copy of each report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament.
As set out in this letter and in my previous letters there are more than sufficient safeguards to ensure that the powers are used properly.
Thank you for bringing the Committee’s concerns to my attention. I trust that this letter will resolve all of the Committee’s concerns.
If you have further concerns I am happy to arrange for a member of my staff or a departmental officer to meet with you and/or members of the Committee in the interests of resolving the Committee’s concerns expediently.
Please contact Peter Cully on (02) 6121 7237 if you would like to discuss these matters further or to arrange a meeting.

Dear Mr Cully

Subsection 88 AA(3) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996—burden of proof issues

We refer to your request of 18 March 2005.

BACKGROUND

Section 88AA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (‘the WR Act’) provides the Secretary to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations with certain powers to obtain information in relation to a ‘building industry investigation’. Subsection 88AA(7) makes it an offence to fail to comply with a relevant notice issued by the Secretary.
Subsection 88AA(3) of the WR Act provides that the power to issue a notice ‘must not be used for the purposes of an investigation that is minor or petty’. You have requested advice as to the burden of proof in circumstances where it is claimed that a notice under s.88AA has been issued for a minor or petty purpose.

ADVICE

For the following reasons, we are of the opinion that the prosecution would bear the burden of proving that a notice was not issued for the purposes of an investigation that is minor or petty. The prosecution would have to prove that matter beyond a reasonable doubt.

Section 88A of the WR Act

Section 88AA of the WR Act relevantly provides as follows:
(1)   Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if the Secretary of the Department believes on reasonable grounds that a person (the relevant person):
Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if the Secretary of the Department believes on reasonable grounds that a person (the relevant person):
(a)   has information or documents relevant to a building industry investigation; or
(b)   is capable of giving evidence that is relevant to a building industry investigation;
the Secretary may, by written notice given within 3 years of the commencement of this Part to the relevant person, require the relevant person:
(c)   to give the information to the Secretary, or to an assistant, by the time, and in the manner and form, specified in the notice; or
(d)   to produce the documents to the Secretary, or to an assistant, by the time, and in the manner, specified in the notice; or
(e)   to attend before the Secretary, or an assistant, at the time and place specified in the notice, and answer questions relevant to the investigation.
The time specified under paragraph(1)(c), (d) or (e) must be at least 14 days after the notice is given.
The power given by subsection (1) must not be used for the purposes of an investigation that is minor or petty.
………………………………………
A person commits an offence if:
(a)   the person has been given a notice under subsection (1); and
(b)   the person fails:
(i)    to give the required Information by the time, and in the manner and form, specified in the notice; or
(ii)   to produce the required documents by the time, and in the manner, specified in the notice; or
(iii)  to attend to answer questions at the time and place specified in the notice; or
(iv)  to take an oath or make an affirmation, when required to do so under subsection (5); or
(v)   to answer questions relevant to the investigation while attending as required by the notice.
Section 7B of the WR Act provides that
Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code (except Part 2.5) applies to all offences against this Act.
Note 1: Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code sets out the general principles of criminal responsibility.
Note 2: For the purposes of this Act, corporate criminal responsibility is dealt with by section 349, rather than by Part 2.5 of the Criminal Code.

The Criminal Code

The Criminal Code is set out in the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995.
Part 2.6 of the Criminal Code deals with criminal responsibility. Section 13.1 relevantly provides:

Legal burden of proof-prosecution

The prosecution bears a legal burden of proving every element of an offense, relevant to the guilt of the person charged.
……………………………..
In this Code:
legal burden, in relation to a matter, means the burden of proving the existence of the matter.
Section 13.2 provides:

Standard of proof-prosecution

A legal burden of proof on the prosecution must be discharged beyond reasonable doubt.
Subsection (i) does not apply if the law creating the offence specifies a different standard of proof.
10.   The burden of proving each of the elements of the offence in subsection 88AA(7) would be borne by the prosecution. An essential element of the offence is that the conduct of the defendant is in response to the issue of a notice under subsection 88AA(1). In our view, this presupposes a requirement to prove that a notice has been validly issued, should that issue be raised.
11.   The issuing of a notice under s.88AA(1) is subject to s.88AA(3) which states that a notice may not be issued ‘for the purposes of an investigation that is minor or petty’. Therefore, if an objection to the notice was raised in the course of proceedings, it would be for the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the notice was validly issued.

When an evidential burden may be placed an the defence

12.   There are certain circumstances in which the Criminal Code places what is referred to as an ‘evidential burden’ on the defence. These circumstances can include when the defendant is relying upon some excuse or justification provided for by the law creating the offence. We do not consider those circumstances apply here but we mention them for completeness.
13.   For purposes of the present discussion, we refer to s.13.3 of the Criminal Code, which relevantly provides:

Evidential burden of proof-defence

                ………………………….
A defendant who wishes to rely on any exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification provided by the law creating an offence bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter. The exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification need not accompany the description of the offence.
                ……………………………..
In this Code:
evidential burden, in relation to a matter, means the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist
14.   All that is required to discharge an evidential burden is for the defendant to point to some evidence to support the contention that the exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification applies to his or her circumstances. The defendant does have the burden of proving his or her case in that regard. The burden of disproving the matter remains with the prosecution, and it must do so beyond a reasonable doubt; s.13.2 of the Criminal Code provides:
The prosecution also bears a legal burden of disproving any matter in relation to which the defendant has discharged an evidential burden of proof imposed on the defendant.
15.   In any event, we do not consider that the circumstances of an alleged offence against s.88AA(7), on which you have requested advice, give rise to any evidential burden for the defendant. As we have noted, the validity of the notice under s.88AA(1) (including that it was not issued for the purposes of an investigation that is minor or petty) would become an essential element of the offence for the prosecution to prove, if the matter was put in issue. (The defence would merely have to raise it as an issue rather than satisfy any evidential burden.) Moreover, s.88AA(3) of the WR Act exists as a qualification on the valid exercise of the power under s:88AA(1). That provision is not ‘an exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification provided by the law creating an offence’ (which is s.88A(7)). Hence, we are of the view that s13.3.(3) of the Criminal Code would not apply.
16.   Please let me know if we can be of any further assistance in this matter.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 29 March 2005 providing further advice concerning the Secretary’s Directions in relation to the exercise of Compliance Powers in the Building and Construction Industry made under section 88AGA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.
In your letter you note that, while the Guidelines are to be the main source of the Secretary’s Directions, these Directions are still being developed and are not expected to be finalised until the compliance powers take effect. The issue of the effect of these unfinished Directions, particularly in the context of the need for ‘reasonable’ exercise of the powers, remains a matter of concern to the Committee.
You conclude your letter by offering to arrange for a departmental officer to brief the Committee in the interests of resolving the issues expediently. The Committee would welcome the opportunity of a briefing. I will arrange for the Committee Secretary, Mr James Warmenhoven, to arrange a briefing with Mr Peter Cully—the nominated Departmental contact officer—within the next few weeks.
Yours sincerely
Tsebin Tchen
Chairman

New Housing for Defence Housing Authority at McDowall, Brisbane, Queensland

The McDowall project was referred to the Committee on 6 December 2004 at an estimated cost of $17.5 million.
The purpose of the work is to provide 50 houses to meet the operational requirements of Defence, mainly to service the nearby Enoggera Army Base. It is intended that the houses will be ready for occupation in November 2006.
The proposal presented to the Committee comprises
40 conventional and ten small housing lots;
two park areas with a total area of 6,170 square metres;
internal roads and footpaths;
access roads; and
stormwater, drainage, sewerage, communications and electrical services.
The Committee inspected the site of the proposed development and conducted a public hearing in Brisbane on 24 February 2005. Issues explored at the hearing included site selection, the nature of the development, traffic management, consultation and a range of environmental issues.
Subsequent to the hearing, the Committee received a letter from a McDowall resident outlining some concerns in relation to the proposed development. This correspondence was forwarded to the Defence Housing Authority and the Committee recommends that the Authority continue to engage in close consultation with owners of neighbouring properties and the wider McDowall community. Having examined all the evidence presented to it, the Committee recommends that the proposed housing development project proceed at the estimated cost of $17.5 million.

Provision of Facilities for Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre Additional Accommodation and Related Works, Maribyrnong, Victoria

The Committee’s third report of 2005 addresses a proposal from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to provide additional accommodation and carry out related works at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre at Maribyrnong in Victoria.
This work was referred to the Committee for consideration and report on 9 December 2004 at an estimated cost of $7 million.
The Department’s proposal is driven chiefly by the need to provide adequate separation for different categories of detainees. In its current form, the Centre allows only for the separation of adult males from females and families. The facility needs to be expanded and reconfigured in order to protect the welfare of residents and staff.
The Department intends that the proposed works should deliver:
the ability to separate different detainee groups;
an increase in capacity of some 50 places;
increased amenity for residents, particularly women and children;
improved resident recreation and access to outdoor facilities;
improved disabled facilities for residents and visitors;
increased privacy in the new areas;
better security;
improved OH&S conditions for staff; and
the provision of some self-catering facilities.
In order to achieve these outcomes, the Department proposes to construct additional accommodation in the form of demountable buildings and to reconfigure existing facilities to accommodate a further 50 detainees within the existing Centre boundaries. The Department intends that the proposed works will:
“…achieve additional accommodation that provides improved amenity and demonstrates a clear regard for the personal needs and dignity of the residents” and
“…provide detention infrastructure that is humane, non-punitive and sensitive to the needs of people held under administrative detention.”
The Committee visited the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre on 23 February 2005 and conducted public hearings in Melbourne on 23 February and in Canberra on 7 March.
During its investigations, the Committee considered a range of matters relating to the need, purpose, scope, cost and value-for-money of the proposed work.
The Committee was primarily concerned at the Department’s proposal to accommodate a further 50 detainees within the boundary of the existing site. The Committee acknowledges the considerable challenges faced by the Department in respect of providing additional places at the Maribyrnong facility and is appreciative of the efforts made to make the best possible use of the limited space available. However, the Committee does not believe that a population increase of the magnitude proposed would enhance amenity to residents or satisfy the Department’s intention to provide “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure”.
Following their inspection of the existing facilities, members were in no doubt as to the pressing need for refurbishment, particularly in respect of the existing ablutions and family accommodation area. Members were disappointed to note that the detailed project cost estimate did not include specific amounts for extensive refurbishment of the existing accommodation. The Committee was unanimous in its view that the proposal did not appear to be accomplishing the stated purpose of improving the overall amenity of the facility and providing “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure”—particularly considering the proposed 65 per cent increase in occupancy. The Committee therefore recommends that, in order to maintain a reasonable level of amenity, the current maximum occupancy of the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre be increased by no more than 20 places, with a total maximum occupancy in surge periods of not more than 100 detainees.
In respect of the project scope, the Committee noted the Department’s intention to utilise portable accommodation units at the site and recommends that these be of an acceptable standard to ensure a reasonable level of comfort and amenity for detainees.
The Committee was concerned to learn that there is no single national or international building code or standard for immigration detention facilities and believes that this deficiency should be addressed. The Committee does not believe that remand centres and backpacker hostels are entirely appropriate analogies for detention accommodation as the freedom of movement available to the occupants of such facilities are markedly different. In respect of building codes and standards, the Committee therefore recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs consult with appropriate government and professional bodies to establish a national benchmark for the construction and fit-out of Immigration Detention Centres and Immigration Reception and Processing Centres.
Similarly, the Committee noted that there is no agreed standard for the per capita provision of space and amenities at immigration detention facilities In respect of the ratio between living/recreation space, amenities and occupancy, the Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs consult with appropriate government and professional bodies with a view to establishing a national benchmark for room occupancy and related indoor and outdoor recreation areas, ablutions, kitchen and laundry facilities at Immigration Detention Centres and Immigration Reception and Processing Centres.
Members were also concerned to note that accommodation at the Centre is based on quadruple occupancy of double bunk rooms. Whilst the rooms in the proposed new accommodation zone will measure 15 square metres plus ensuite, some rooms in the existing section are only 11 square metres, with access to shared ablutions. Members concluded that, whilst quadruple occupancy of the larger ensuite rooms proposed for construction under the extension project would be acceptable, quadruple occupancy of the existing non-ensuite rooms did not represent an appropriate level of amenity. In order to fulfil the Department’s objective of providing “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure”, the Committee recommends that the Department reduce the number of detainees accommodated in the existing double-bunk rooms at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre to two persons per room. Moreover, the Committee recommends that, wherever possible, occupancy of new ensuite rooms should be kept below the maximum of four, especially in cases where the detention period is prolonged.
The Committee is of the view that the Department should act promptly to redress the shortcomings of the existing accommodation at Maribyrnong in order to meet the stated project objective of providing “humane and non-punitive” detention facilities. The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs expedite the proposed routine maintenance and upgrade of existing ablutions and accommodation facilities in order to reduce the disparity in quality of accommodation between the old and new wings of the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre.
During their visit to the Centre, members observed that the existing bedrooms do not have doors, but were pleased to note that the Department includes improved privacy for residents among the anticipated project outcomes. In order to fulfil the Department’s objective of providing “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure which provides a clear regard for the personal needs and dignity of residents”, the Committee recommends that the Department install bedroom doors or bed-curtaining in all rooms at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre to ensure an appropriate level of privacy for detainees.
In respect of the reconfiguration of the Centre, members questioned whether the design represented the best solution in terms of access to recreational space for families and children, as the selected option will not provide families with immediate and unescorted access to the largest outdoor recreation area. The Committee questions whether this solution adequately meets the Department’s intention to improve “…amenity for residents, particularly women and children…”. In view of this, the Committee recommends that the Department give consideration to using the proposed new Zone A of the extended Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre for the accommodation of families in order to allow children greater access to the centre’s largest outdoor recreation area.
Having reviewed the evidence presented to it, the Committee recommends that the works proceed subject to the acceptance of recommendations 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 of its report. Further, the Committee seeks a response from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in respect of the Department’s intention to adopt the recommendations made herewith.
In closing, I wish to thank my Committee colleagues for their cooperation throughout this inquiry, the Hansard and the staff of the secretariat.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

DEVELOPMENT OF ON-BASE HOUSING FOR DEFENCE AT PUCKAPUNYAL, VICTORIA,

The first of the proposed works is intended to provide 80 on-base houses to meet current and future Defence Force accommodation requirements at the Puckapunyal Military Area. The Defence Housing Authority intends that delivery of the new homes will occur progressively between February and November 2006. The estimated cost of the project is $19.6 million.
The proposed works will comprise:
construction of 80 houses; and
associated stormwater drainage, communications, sewerage reticulation, gas and electrical services.
The Committee visited the site of the proposed works and conducted a public hearing at Puckapunyal on 20 April 2005.
Having explored a variety of issues relating to the need for the new homes, the consultation conducted with stakeholders, the provision of services and amenities, and the environmental management of the project, the Committee was satisfied that the works would meet all stated project objectives and would represent an improved level of amenity for Defence families. The Committee therefore recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $19.6 million.

DEFENCE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ORGANISATION ORDNANCE BREAK-DOWN FACILITY, PORT WAKEFIELD, SOUTH AUSTRALIA

The Committee’s fifth report of 2005 addresses works required to enhance Defence research capability in respect of explosive ordnance and weaponry. This research is necessary to support the work of the Australian Defence Force and associated organisations in ensuring national security.
At present, research into weapons and ordnance is conducted at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation Facility at Edinburgh, South Australia, and the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Port Wakefield. Safety requirements at these sites currently limit investigation to small-size ordnance. The proposed work would address this deficiency by enabling research into a wider range of explosive ordnance and weapons.
Work elements to meet Defence’s objectives consist of:
a control room for the remote monitoring and operation of ordnance breakdown equipment in other areas of the facility;
a cutting building for the radiography and remotely controlled cutting of ordnance;
a disassembly building for the safe radiographic examination and breakdown of explosive ordnance;
two explosive ordnance storehouses;
a storage building to house general equipment;
engineering services, including power, water, sewerage, communications and sealed roads; and
security provisions, comprising fencing and a Type 1 security system.
In the course of its inquiry, the Committee was assured that the proposed works would take account of all necessary occupational and public safety requirements, and would also entail appropriate security measures. The Committee was also satisfied at the level of consultation conducted by the Department with the community and other stakeholders, including the execution of land acquisition procedures.
In respect of environmental impacts, members were pleased to learn that the works would result in improvements to the habitat of an endangered local bird species, and further, that the Proof and Experimental Establishment site had met four of the eight criteria for inclusion on the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance.
Having thoroughly examined the proposal, the Committee recommends that the construction of an ordnance breakdown facility for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation at Port Wakefield, South Australia, proceed at the estimated cost of $8.4 million.
Mr President, I would like to extend thanks to my Committee colleagues, the secretariat staff and all those who helped with these inquiries, and I commend the Reports to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,19,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-14,"—I rise to speak to the motion moved by Senator McGauran in relation to the four reports of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. I specifically want to speak to the report on the proposed Maribyrnong immigration detention centre. The motion moved by Senator McGauran was that the Senate take note of that report and the other reports before us.
I must emphasise that I am not a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, so I have not seen the report and was not able to participate in the specific inquiry. The Joint Standing Committee on Public Works does have a very narrow term of reference. It does not relate specifically to policy matters per se; it looks much more narrowly at public works—usually buildings, defence housing and other government facilities.
The issue at the heart of this report, the proposed new Maribyrnong immigration detention centre, is an issue that I believe needs further noting, not so much in terms of whether we are getting value for money—whether we are picking the right quality cement and those sorts of things—but in terms of whether it is actually necessary, desirable and appropriate to be building expanded immigration detention facilities. People would say that, if we are going to have better quality facilities, that is better for the people who are detained within them—and I do not dispute that. Any opportunity to have better facilities for people whilst they are in detention is, on the face of it, desirable. But the bigger question, of course, is whether we should be having so many of those people in detention facilities.
Senators would know that the Australian Democrats have long opposed mandatory detention in this country. Our record on that is totally consistent and very longstanding, over more than a decade. But the bigger issue here is not even mandatory detention. Many people misrepresent the position of the Democrats and others who oppose mandatory detention, saying that we support an open door policy and believe there should be no detention at all. That is not the case. Certainly, on behalf of the Democrats, I state that we do not support an open door policy and we certainly do not suggest that there are not circumstances where it may be appropriate to have people in detention for migration related matters. But the fact is that we have far too many people in migration detention and far too many of those people are in there for far too long. We have people in there, including children, who are in detention for months and years.
The simple matter is that, if we did not have that policy—an unjustified, immoral and unnecessary policy—we would not need this report at all. We would not need the additional accommodation or the related works because we would not need the detention centre. As I said before, there is a case for people being detained for migration purposes in select circumstances for specific reasons and for limited periods of time. If we had that policy, obviously we would need to have one or two facilities somewhere. But we would certainly not need to have the vast and continuing endless expenditure on building, expanding, refurbishing and adding new detention centres, time after time. If we look at the amount of expenditure in this area over recent years, we see it is simply scandalous.
The broader issue here that underpins what these reports are about is value for money for the taxpayer. There is no way that it is value for money for the taxpayer to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new facilities and on expanding and upgrading facilities to detain people when we do not need to be doing that in the first place. The Maribyrnong centre, which is in Melbourne, is small bickies compared to some of the others. It is estimated, depending on which document you read, that the one that is still proposed for Christmas Island, which will accommodate a total of around 800 people, will cost over $300 million. That is $300 million to build a detention facility on Christmas Island, when we have an empty detention facility, in mothballs, at Port Hedland, when we have the Baxter detention facility at less than half capacity, and when we have an empty facility—it has been empty for a few years—in Darwin, which we are now going to spend more money on to upgrade. We have a proposal for a facility in Brisbane still on the books, and we have the facility at Woomera. Enormous amounts of money have been spent upgrading and expanding that facility—mainly on security—and then within a year or two that money is mothballed.
Billions of dollars have been spent on a totally unnecessary policy that causes immense harm to people, distorts the rule of law, subverts due process and, on any objective criteria, does not contribute one bit to border protection under any sensible meaning of the term. It is a stupid waste of money purely because the government will not admit the blatantly obvious: that this policy is not necessary, that it causes immense harm and that there are alternatives that are not only more humane but more workable and much more in accordance with our legal and democratic traditions, and they would save us a fortune.
I for one believe that it is time to start saying no to more and more public money being spent on more and more detention facilities, with a few little bandaids around the side now and then to take the pressure off the Prime Minister whenever one case comes up that makes things look difficult. It is time to recognise that the whole policy does not work, and you cannot continue to adjust, amend and build on something when its foundations are completely and utterly in ruins. The foundations of the mandatory detention policy—its legal foundations, its ethical and moral foundations, and its policy foundations—are completely bankrupt. Continuing to build on and amend that policy, whether it is building new centres or changing the way that the policy works so that it can operate in a supposedly more flexible or more humane way, is ignoring the core problem, which is that the policy, the law itself, is corrupt.
Until we acknowledge that, we will continue to waste more money. It is bad enough to be wasting money but this is wasting money to generate human suffering for no good end, other than political ends for a government that refuse to admit that they have got it wrong—and both major parties have refused to admit that they have got it wrong. Time after time they have kept cracking down, one thing after another, and they have never taken a step back and said: ‘Maybe we’ve gone in the wrong direction. Maybe we need to choose another path.’ Surely there is enough evidence out there now that we need to choose another path. It certainly does not involve building more detention centres, additional accommodation and related works, even if it means good value for money, and we are getting top quality bricks and cement and nice clean floors. The simple fact is that the policy that is behind the construction of these detention centres is wrong. It is time for that policy to be changed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,19,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-06-14,"—I also rise to speak to the report of the Public Works Committee on the Maribyrnong detention centre. As a Victorian I want to make some brief remarks about this report. I have not yet had the benefit of seeing it, but being a regular visitor to Maribyrnong I do know something of the background to this. It is not a bad thing that we are improving that accommodation, although I agree with my colleague that quite a few of the people who are at Maribyrnong ought not be there.
I agree too that we should not be increasing accommodation in detention centres overall, including Maribyrnong. One of the reasons is that this will take over a substantial area of open space at the present time—space which had been denied to detainees for about two years because the government argued that security arrangements were not in place, despite several-metres-high steel walls and ribbon wire and what appeared to me to be a very secure environment. These detainees have only just had access to that outdoor space—a pretty miserable outdoor space too—but this development is proposing to use much of that space up. The problem is that, when people are there for lengths of time—many years in some cases; the people that I have talked with are still there or have been kept there for five years or more—whilst nothing is more important than getting them out, if they cannot move around in this very confined environment it is obviously not good for their mental health.
I point out as well that Maribyrnong council has been very opposed to this expansion. I think the government let the council know that this was happening, but that was about the extent of the consultation that took place. This does matter to the Maribyrnong City Council because adjacent to the Maribyrnong detention centre is a brand new housing development. Quite a substantial area of land has been set aside for redevelopment. You are going to have some quite expensive housing, I would say, which will back onto the detention centre. In fact, the mayor, when I last spoke with her, indicated that the plan was to put up another very large fence so that the people in this new housing development would not have to look onto the misery of the Maribyrnong detention centre and very obviously prison-like circumstances in which people live—that is, as I said, with razor wire and very high walls.
Having said all of that, I should also say that the conditions inside the Maribyrnong centre—and I am told this is better than most other detention centres—are pretty miserable. In the male quarters the dormitory spaces are occupied by four men in very narrow, short, steel double bunks, with a very narrow space in between those two sets of beds. There is very little by way of furniture—a simple metal cabinet—and there are bars on the window and a pretty miserable outlook. Together with that there are the so-called isolation rooms, which have nothing in them. All in all, this is not good place for anyone to be. I welcome any proposal to improve those conditions.
However, I reiterate what my colleague has just said: most of the people who are there should not be there in the first place. They are there because they are asylum seekers and they are going through a process. It makes no sense to be locking them up when most of them are waiting for some court process to take place. They are the last ones likely to abscond. It puzzles me. Even the minister today said, ‘We’re not going to let people off scot-free.’ These people are not going to wander off and disappear. It is in their interest to have visas and full permanent residency in this country. I cannot see them running off and disappearing, particularly those people with children. Children have to be put through school and looked after. It would be extremely difficult, I would suggest, for a couple or an individual with children to simply ‘get off scot-free’, as the minister suggested, as if they had committed a crime—and, of course, the majority of asylum seekers have not. As a Victorian senator I want to add my voice and express my concern at this proposal—a concern which, from what I can gather, has been echoed to some extent in some of the comments and content of this report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,19,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-14,"—I rise to take note of report of the Public Works Committee on the Maribyrnong detention centre. The Senate, in taking note of this document, is being asked effectively to approve the building of more immigration detention centres—this one at Maribyrnong. Last Thursday I was out the front of Villawood detention centre when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs turned the first three sods of the new detention centre to be built at Villawood. I thought then, as I think now, that, in the midst of all of the claims about the way in which we need to be ending this system of mandatory detention, the minister on Thursday opened and turned those first sods of a brand new detention centre that is not just any detention centre but a new detention centre that is designed specifically for locking up women and children.
The minister seeks on these sorts of occasions, as she did on Thursday and has subsequently, to claim that this is an opportunity for families to live in the community. As for these residential housing projects that the minister was opening at Villawood last Thursday, I have been to visit such a residential housing project in Port Augusta. It is quite incredible to see the way in which this government is able to transform a normal suburban street into a prison. What they do is build two large fences all of the way around it. Regularly around it they position cameras, which give 24-hour monitoring of people who are held within that particular facility. There are motion detectors so that, if anyone opens the window after 11 o’clock at night, an alarm goes off, given the expectation that they are going to escape over the two fences, through the motion detectors, past the 24-hour security cameras and out into the community.
If there are schoolchildren in that area—and there often are—then, on their way to school, they go through an X-ray. An X-ray wand is waved over them, as is done in our airports, and their bags are also searched. On the way home from school, yet again their bags are searched and they go through an X-ray by these guards. Regularly throughout the day in these places—and the minister likes to describe this as families living in the community—guards from the private security company contracted to run our immigration detention centres come into people’s homes every couple of hours to do a head count. When I went and visited one of those homes in a residential housing project in Port Augusta, the place was in disarray. One woman had been in there for an indeterminate period of time. She did not know how much longer she was going to be in there. She was being held in there away from her partner, who was elsewhere. Often the partner is in another immigration detention centre and mothers are held there with their children away from and without any ability to engage with the community, certainly without any ability to know what is going on and for how much longer they will be held there.
When I visited those women and children they told me about the circumstance where, once a week, they are being taken by the guards to the local shopping centre. They have a specific allowance—that is the only money they are allowed to spend—for buying food that they may cook for their family in the residential housing project. When they are there we have the circumstance where, if they seek to spend any more money than that allowance or to spend that money inappropriately, the private security guard argues with the mother at the checkout about what she can be buy and how much money she can spend buying food for her children. If that is not a paternalistic attitude about the way in which asylum seekers and mothers should be able to look after their own children, I do not know what it is. But the minister claims that this is about women and children being able to live in the community. You are not living in the community when, as occurs in these residential housing projects, if you run into somebody in the supermarket that you know and enter into a conversation, the guard not only removes you from that situation but also can deny you the right to go the shopping centre the next week to buy food for your children. That is not living in the community. It is not living in the community if you cannot talk to people in your local shopping centre. It is not living in the community if you cannot lean over the two fences and the security cameras to talk to your neighbours. It is not living in the community if you have your bag searched on the way to school when you are a six-year-old. It is not living in the community if you have a security guard arguing with you at the checkout about what you can and cannot buy to feed your children. And yet the minister puts up this ridiculous idea that this is about allowing women and children to live in the community.
Today we hear more announcements. The government, in their negotiations with Petro Georgiou and others, are saying perhaps we should allow fathers to live in this environment as well. That is not living in the community. Allowing fathers to be able to be treated in this degrading way and to be a part of an area that has turned from a suburban street into a prison is not living in the community. It is just another form of prison. The minister for immigration, in response to the concerns we have seen now for years—particularly about children in detention but, in general, about the operations of our immigration detention centres—responds to these concerns by opening a new detention centre for women and children last Thursday. And here in the Senate we are again being asked to consider more changes and the building of more expansive detention centres, this time in Victoria. That is not a minister who is taking seriously her responsibility to her portfolio and to her individual duty of care for the people that she holds in detention.
A minister who was responsible would not respond to this crisis by going out and turning three sods of soil, like the minister did on Thursday, for the building of another detention centre for children and women to be locked up in. That is not an appropriate way to be dealing with this immigration detention debacle that the current minister is presiding over. An appropriate way would be to set up a judicial inquiry—an open, public inquiry—where we can hear about the way in which this department and this minister are administering this system of mandatory detention. The Greens certainly say that we need to go further than that. The system of mandatory detention that exists in this country, which this government, minister and department preside over, is one which says, ‘We will lock people up and ask questions later.’ That is not appropriate. Think of all of the scandals that we have seen, whether it be Vivian Alvarez, Cornelia Rau or three-year-old Naomi Leong, who has spent all her life up until a couple of weeks ago when she appeared on the front page of the newspaper, living in a detention centre. I think it has been 10 children now living in detention centres who have been born there. All of those people do not deserve to have a minister who sends these issues off to a closed inquiry. They deserve for there to be an open, public and transparent inquiry. They do not deserve to have a system of mandatory detention supported by both the major parties which says, ‘We are going to lock these people up. Maybe if they appear on the front page of the newspaper we will ask some questions later.’ That is an utterly irresponsible way for the government to run public administration of these affairs.
The way in which, scandal after scandal, the department changes and manipulates the way it deals with these issues is outrageous. It is an outrageous way to run this administration. During the estimates committee process I asked a number of questions about particular detainees. One of those was an Iraqi man with a hand deformed because members of Saddam Hussein’s Baathist regime had hit it with a burning metal rod. They also tortured and killed his father. That man was sitting in Baxter detention centre at the time I asked the minister questions about whether he could be released on a bridging visa for the torture and trauma that he had faced. Two days later, I got a message to say the man had been released. I asked another question about a man in immigration detention who, out of desperation—he had been in there for five years and was the longest serving detainee in Villawood detention centre—had drunk a bottle of bleach the night before the estimates hearings. That is the action of a desperate man in a desperate situation—a man who happens to have been one of the carers for the three-year-old in Villawood, Naomi Leong, who I mentioned before. I asked questions about that particular man of Immigration and a week later, I think it was, he was released from detention.
I hope that the asking of those questions and the release of those detainees were not connected. I hope sincerely that this government, minister and department are not making decisions on the basis of issues being raised in the Senate, the estimates process, the media or wherever it may be, and to decide only then to release people from detention. If that is so, it is an appalling way to run public administration of the department of immigration, or any other department for that matter. So I hope those issues, the asking of questions about detainees and the subsequent release of those particular individuals, are entirely unrelated. We should not be supporting the building of any new detention centres. We should be supporting the dismantling of this system of mandatory detention which says, ‘Lock people up first and ask questions later.’

New Housing for Defence Housing Authority at McDowall, Brisbane, Queensland

The McDowall project was referred to the Committee on 6 December 2004 at an estimated cost of $17.5 million.
The purpose of the work is to provide 50 houses to meet the operational requirements of Defence, mainly to service the nearby Enoggera Army Base. It is intended that the houses will be ready for occupation in November 2006.
The proposal presented to the Committee comprises
40 conventional and ten small housing lots;
two park areas with a total area of 6,170 square metres;
internal roads and footpaths;
access roads; and
stormwater, drainage, sewerage, communications and electrical services.
The Committee inspected the site of the proposed development and conducted a public hearing in Brisbane on 24 February 2005. Issues explored at the hearing included site selection, the nature of the development, traffic management, consultation and a range of environmental issues.
Subsequent to the hearing, the Committee received a letter from a McDowall resident outlining some concerns in relation to the proposed development. This correspondence was forwarded to the Defence Housing Authority and the Committee recommends that the Authority continue to engage in close consultation with owners of neighbouring properties and the wider McDowall community. Having examined all the evidence presented to it, the Committee recommends that the proposed housing development project proceed at the estimated cost of $17.5 million.

Provision of Facilities for Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre Additional Accommodation and Related Works, Maribyrnong, Victoria

The Committee’s third report of 2005 addresses a proposal from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to provide additional accommodation and carry out related works at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre at Maribyrnong in Victoria.
This work was referred to the Committee for consideration and report on 9 December 2004 at an estimated cost of $7 million.
The Department’s proposal is driven chiefly by the need to provide adequate separation for different categories of detainees. In its current form, the Centre allows only for the separation of adult males from females and families. The facility needs to be expanded and reconfigured in order to protect the welfare of residents and staff.
The Department intends that the proposed works should deliver:
the ability to separate different detainee groups;
an increase in capacity of some 50 places;
increased amenity for residents, particularly women and children;
improved resident recreation and access to outdoor facilities;
improved disabled facilities for residents and visitors;
increased privacy in the new areas;
better security;
improved OH&S conditions for staff; and
the provision of some self-catering facilities.
In order to achieve these outcomes, the Department proposes to construct additional accommodation in the form of demountable buildings and to reconfigure existing facilities to accommodate a further 50 detainees within the existing Centre boundaries. The Department intends that the proposed works will:
“…achieve additional accommodation that provides improved amenity and demonstrates a clear regard for the personal needs and dignity of the residents” and
“…provide detention infrastructure that is humane, non-punitive and sensitive to the needs of people held under administrative detention.”
The Committee visited the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre on 23 February 2005 and conducted public hearings in Melbourne on 23 February and in Canberra on 7 March.
During its investigations, the Committee considered a range of matters relating to the need, purpose, scope, cost and value-for-money of the proposed work.
The Committee was primarily concerned at the Department’s proposal to accommodate a further 50 detainees within the boundary of the existing site. The Committee acknowledges the considerable challenges faced by the Department in respect of providing additional places at the Maribyrnong facility and is appreciative of the efforts made to make the best possible use of the limited space available. However, the Committee does not believe that a population increase of the magnitude proposed would enhance amenity to residents or satisfy the Department’s intention to provide “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure”.
Following their inspection of the existing facilities, members were in no doubt as to the pressing need for refurbishment, particularly in respect of the existing ablutions and family accommodation area. Members were disappointed to note that the detailed project cost estimate did not include specific amounts for extensive refurbishment of the existing accommodation. The Committee was unanimous in its view that the proposal did not appear to be accomplishing the stated purpose of improving the overall amenity of the facility and providing “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure”—particularly considering the proposed 65 per cent increase in occupancy. The Committee therefore recommends that, in order to maintain a reasonable level of amenity, the current maximum occupancy of the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre be increased by no more than 20 places, with a total maximum occupancy in surge periods of not more than 100 detainees.
In respect of the project scope, the Committee noted the Department’s intention to utilise portable accommodation units at the site and recommends that these be of an acceptable standard to ensure a reasonable level of comfort and amenity for detainees.
The Committee was concerned to learn that there is no single national or international building code or standard for immigration detention facilities and believes that this deficiency should be addressed. The Committee does not believe that remand centres and backpacker hostels are entirely appropriate analogies for detention accommodation as the freedom of movement available to the occupants of such facilities are markedly different. In respect of building codes and standards, the Committee therefore recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs consult with appropriate government and professional bodies to establish a national benchmark for the construction and fit-out of Immigration Detention Centres and Immigration Reception and Processing Centres.
Similarly, the Committee noted that there is no agreed standard for the per capita provision of space and amenities at immigration detention facilities In respect of the ratio between living/recreation space, amenities and occupancy, the Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs consult with appropriate government and professional bodies with a view to establishing a national benchmark for room occupancy and related indoor and outdoor recreation areas, ablutions, kitchen and laundry facilities at Immigration Detention Centres and Immigration Reception and Processing Centres.
Members were also concerned to note that accommodation at the Centre is based on quadruple occupancy of double bunk rooms. Whilst the rooms in the proposed new accommodation zone will measure 15 square metres plus ensuite, some rooms in the existing section are only 11 square metres, with access to shared ablutions. Members concluded that, whilst quadruple occupancy of the larger ensuite rooms proposed for construction under the extension project would be acceptable, quadruple occupancy of the existing non-ensuite rooms did not represent an appropriate level of amenity. In order to fulfil the Department’s objective of providing “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure”, the Committee recommends that the Department reduce the number of detainees accommodated in the existing double-bunk rooms at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre to two persons per room. Moreover, the Committee recommends that, wherever possible, occupancy of new ensuite rooms should be kept below the maximum of four, especially in cases where the detention period is prolonged.
The Committee is of the view that the Department should act promptly to redress the shortcomings of the existing accommodation at Maribyrnong in order to meet the stated project objective of providing “humane and non-punitive” detention facilities. The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs expedite the proposed routine maintenance and upgrade of existing ablutions and accommodation facilities in order to reduce the disparity in quality of accommodation between the old and new wings of the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre.
During their visit to the Centre, members observed that the existing bedrooms do not have doors, but were pleased to note that the Department includes improved privacy for residents among the anticipated project outcomes. In order to fulfil the Department’s objective of providing “humane and non-punitive detention infrastructure which provides a clear regard for the personal needs and dignity of residents”, the Committee recommends that the Department install bedroom doors or bed-curtaining in all rooms at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre to ensure an appropriate level of privacy for detainees.
In respect of the reconfiguration of the Centre, members questioned whether the design represented the best solution in terms of access to recreational space for families and children, as the selected option will not provide families with immediate and unescorted access to the largest outdoor recreation area. The Committee questions whether this solution adequately meets the Department’s intention to improve “…amenity for residents, particularly women and children…”. In view of this, the Committee recommends that the Department give consideration to using the proposed new Zone A of the extended Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre for the accommodation of families in order to allow children greater access to the centre’s largest outdoor recreation area.
Having reviewed the evidence presented to it, the Committee recommends that the works proceed subject to the acceptance of recommendations 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 of its report. Further, the Committee seeks a response from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in respect of the Department’s intention to adopt the recommendations made herewith.
In closing, I wish to thank my Committee colleagues for their cooperation throughout this inquiry, the Hansard and the staff of the secretariat.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

DEVELOPMENT OF ON-BASE HOUSING FOR DEFENCE AT PUCKAPUNYAL, VICTORIA,

The first of the proposed works is intended to provide 80 on-base houses to meet current and future Defence Force accommodation requirements at the Puckapunyal Military Area. The Defence Housing Authority intends that delivery of the new homes will occur progressively between February and November 2006. The estimated cost of the project is $19.6 million.
The proposed works will comprise:
construction of 80 houses; and
associated stormwater drainage, communications, sewerage reticulation, gas and electrical services.
The Committee visited the site of the proposed works and conducted a public hearing at Puckapunyal on 20 April 2005.
Having explored a variety of issues relating to the need for the new homes, the consultation conducted with stakeholders, the provision of services and amenities, and the environmental management of the project, the Committee was satisfied that the works would meet all stated project objectives and would represent an improved level of amenity for Defence families. The Committee therefore recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $19.6 million.

DEFENCE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ORGANISATION ORDNANCE BREAK-DOWN FACILITY, PORT WAKEFIELD, SOUTH AUSTRALIA

The Committee’s fifth report of 2005 addresses works required to enhance Defence research capability in respect of explosive ordnance and weaponry. This research is necessary to support the work of the Australian Defence Force and associated organisations in ensuring national security.
At present, research into weapons and ordnance is conducted at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation Facility at Edinburgh, South Australia, and the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Port Wakefield. Safety requirements at these sites currently limit investigation to small-size ordnance. The proposed work would address this deficiency by enabling research into a wider range of explosive ordnance and weapons.
Work elements to meet Defence’s objectives consist of:
a control room for the remote monitoring and operation of ordnance breakdown equipment in other areas of the facility;
a cutting building for the radiography and remotely controlled cutting of ordnance;
a disassembly building for the safe radiographic examination and breakdown of explosive ordnance;
two explosive ordnance storehouses;
a storage building to house general equipment;
engineering services, including power, water, sewerage, communications and sealed roads; and
security provisions, comprising fencing and a Type 1 security system.
In the course of its inquiry, the Committee was assured that the proposed works would take account of all necessary occupational and public safety requirements, and would also entail appropriate security measures. The Committee was also satisfied at the level of consultation conducted by the Department with the community and other stakeholders, including the execution of land acquisition procedures.
In respect of environmental impacts, members were pleased to learn that the works would result in improvements to the habitat of an endangered local bird species, and further, that the Proof and Experimental Establishment site had met four of the eight criteria for inclusion on the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance.
Having thoroughly examined the proposal, the Committee recommends that the construction of an ordnance breakdown facility for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation at Port Wakefield, South Australia, proceed at the estimated cost of $8.4 million.
Mr President, I would like to extend thanks to my Committee colleagues, the secretariat staff and all those who helped with these inquiries, and I commend the Reports to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports</title>,COMMITTEES,19,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-14,"—I rise to speak to the motion moved by Senator McGauran in relation to the four reports of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. I specifically want to speak to the report on the proposed Maribyrnong immigration detention centre. The motion moved by Senator McGauran was that the Senate take note of that report and the other reports before us.
I must emphasise that I am not a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, so I have not seen the report and was not able to participate in the specific inquiry. The Joint Standing Committee on Public Works does have a very narrow term of reference. It does not relate specifically to policy matters per se; it looks much more narrowly at public works—usually buildings, defence housing and other government facilities.
The issue at the heart of this report, the proposed new Maribyrnong immigration detention centre, is an issue that I believe needs further noting, not so much in terms of whether we are getting value for money—whether we are picking the right quality cement and those sorts of things—but in terms of whether it is actually necessary, desirable and appropriate to be building expanded immigration detention facilities. People would say that, if we are going to have better quality facilities, that is better for the people who are detained within them—and I do not dispute that. Any opportunity to have better facilities for people whilst they are in detention is, on the face of it, desirable. But the bigger question, of course, is whether we should be having so many of those people in detention facilities.
Senators would know that the Australian Democrats have long opposed mandatory detention in this country. Our record on that is totally consistent and very longstanding, over more than a decade. But the bigger issue here is not even mandatory detention. Many people misrepresent the position of the Democrats and others who oppose mandatory detention, saying that we support an open door policy and believe there should be no detention at all. That is not the case. Certainly, on behalf of the Democrats, I state that we do not support an open door policy and we certainly do not suggest that there are not circumstances where it may be appropriate to have people in detention for migration related matters. But the fact is that we have far too many people in migration detention and far too many of those people are in there for far too long. We have people in there, including children, who are in detention for months and years.
The simple matter is that, if we did not have that policy—an unjustified, immoral and unnecessary policy—we would not need this report at all. We would not need the additional accommodation or the related works because we would not need the detention centre. As I said before, there is a case for people being detained for migration purposes in select circumstances for specific reasons and for limited periods of time. If we had that policy, obviously we would need to have one or two facilities somewhere. But we would certainly not need to have the vast and continuing endless expenditure on building, expanding, refurbishing and adding new detention centres, time after time. If we look at the amount of expenditure in this area over recent years, we see it is simply scandalous.
The broader issue here that underpins what these reports are about is value for money for the taxpayer. There is no way that it is value for money for the taxpayer to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new facilities and on expanding and upgrading facilities to detain people when we do not need to be doing that in the first place. The Maribyrnong centre, which is in Melbourne, is small bickies compared to some of the others. It is estimated, depending on which document you read, that the one that is still proposed for Christmas Island, which will accommodate a total of around 800 people, will cost over $300 million. That is $300 million to build a detention facility on Christmas Island, when we have an empty detention facility, in mothballs, at Port Hedland, when we have the Baxter detention facility at less than half capacity, and when we have an empty facility—it has been empty for a few years—in Darwin, which we are now going to spend more money on to upgrade. We have a proposal for a facility in Brisbane still on the books, and we have the facility at Woomera. Enormous amounts of money have been spent upgrading and expanding that facility—mainly on security—and then within a year or two that money is mothballed.
Billions of dollars have been spent on a totally unnecessary policy that causes immense harm to people, distorts the rule of law, subverts due process and, on any objective criteria, does not contribute one bit to border protection under any sensible meaning of the term. It is a stupid waste of money purely because the government will not admit the blatantly obvious: that this policy is not necessary, that it causes immense harm and that there are alternatives that are not only more humane but more workable and much more in accordance with our legal and democratic traditions, and they would save us a fortune.
I for one believe that it is time to start saying no to more and more public money being spent on more and more detention facilities, with a few little bandaids around the side now and then to take the pressure off the Prime Minister whenever one case comes up that makes things look difficult. It is time to recognise that the whole policy does not work, and you cannot continue to adjust, amend and build on something when its foundations are completely and utterly in ruins. The foundations of the mandatory detention policy—its legal foundations, its ethical and moral foundations, and its policy foundations—are completely bankrupt. Continuing to build on and amend that policy, whether it is building new centres or changing the way that the policy works so that it can operate in a supposedly more flexible or more humane way, is ignoring the core problem, which is that the policy, the law itself, is corrupt.
Until we acknowledge that, we will continue to waste more money. It is bad enough to be wasting money but this is wasting money to generate human suffering for no good end, other than political ends for a government that refuse to admit that they have got it wrong—and both major parties have refused to admit that they have got it wrong. Time after time they have kept cracking down, one thing after another, and they have never taken a step back and said: ‘Maybe we’ve gone in the wrong direction. Maybe we need to choose another path.’ Surely there is enough evidence out there now that we need to choose another path. It certainly does not involve building more detention centres, additional accommodation and related works, even if it means good value for money, and we are getting top quality bricks and cement and nice clean floors. The simple fact is that the policy that is behind the construction of these detention centres is wrong. It is time for that policy to be changed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports</title>,COMMITTEES,19,2
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-06-14,"—I also rise to speak to the report of the Public Works Committee on the Maribyrnong detention centre. As a Victorian I want to make some brief remarks about this report. I have not yet had the benefit of seeing it, but being a regular visitor to Maribyrnong I do know something of the background to this. It is not a bad thing that we are improving that accommodation, although I agree with my colleague that quite a few of the people who are at Maribyrnong ought not be there.
I agree too that we should not be increasing accommodation in detention centres overall, including Maribyrnong. One of the reasons is that this will take over a substantial area of open space at the present time—space which had been denied to detainees for about two years because the government argued that security arrangements were not in place, despite several-metres-high steel walls and ribbon wire and what appeared to me to be a very secure environment. These detainees have only just had access to that outdoor space—a pretty miserable outdoor space too—but this development is proposing to use much of that space up. The problem is that, when people are there for lengths of time—many years in some cases; the people that I have talked with are still there or have been kept there for five years or more—whilst nothing is more important than getting them out, if they cannot move around in this very confined environment it is obviously not good for their mental health.
I point out as well that Maribyrnong council has been very opposed to this expansion. I think the government let the council know that this was happening, but that was about the extent of the consultation that took place. This does matter to the Maribyrnong City Council because adjacent to the Maribyrnong detention centre is a brand new housing development. Quite a substantial area of land has been set aside for redevelopment. You are going to have some quite expensive housing, I would say, which will back onto the detention centre. In fact, the mayor, when I last spoke with her, indicated that the plan was to put up another very large fence so that the people in this new housing development would not have to look onto the misery of the Maribyrnong detention centre and very obviously prison-like circumstances in which people live—that is, as I said, with razor wire and very high walls.
Having said all of that, I should also say that the conditions inside the Maribyrnong centre—and I am told this is better than most other detention centres—are pretty miserable. In the male quarters the dormitory spaces are occupied by four men in very narrow, short, steel double bunks, with a very narrow space in between those two sets of beds. There is very little by way of furniture—a simple metal cabinet—and there are bars on the window and a pretty miserable outlook. Together with that there are the so-called isolation rooms, which have nothing in them. All in all, this is not good place for anyone to be. I welcome any proposal to improve those conditions.
However, I reiterate what my colleague has just said: most of the people who are there should not be there in the first place. They are there because they are asylum seekers and they are going through a process. It makes no sense to be locking them up when most of them are waiting for some court process to take place. They are the last ones likely to abscond. It puzzles me. Even the minister today said, ‘We’re not going to let people off scot-free.’ These people are not going to wander off and disappear. It is in their interest to have visas and full permanent residency in this country. I cannot see them running off and disappearing, particularly those people with children. Children have to be put through school and looked after. It would be extremely difficult, I would suggest, for a couple or an individual with children to simply ‘get off scot-free’, as the minister suggested, as if they had committed a crime—and, of course, the majority of asylum seekers have not. As a Victorian senator I want to add my voice and express my concern at this proposal—a concern which, from what I can gather, has been echoed to some extent in some of the comments and content of this report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports</title>,COMMITTEES,19,2
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-14,"—I rise to take note of report of the Public Works Committee on the Maribyrnong detention centre. The Senate, in taking note of this document, is being asked effectively to approve the building of more immigration detention centres—this one at Maribyrnong. Last Thursday I was out the front of Villawood detention centre when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs turned the first three sods of the new detention centre to be built at Villawood. I thought then, as I think now, that, in the midst of all of the claims about the way in which we need to be ending this system of mandatory detention, the minister on Thursday opened and turned those first sods of a brand new detention centre that is not just any detention centre but a new detention centre that is designed specifically for locking up women and children.
The minister seeks on these sorts of occasions, as she did on Thursday and has subsequently, to claim that this is an opportunity for families to live in the community. As for these residential housing projects that the minister was opening at Villawood last Thursday, I have been to visit such a residential housing project in Port Augusta. It is quite incredible to see the way in which this government is able to transform a normal suburban street into a prison. What they do is build two large fences all of the way around it. Regularly around it they position cameras, which give 24-hour monitoring of people who are held within that particular facility. There are motion detectors so that, if anyone opens the window after 11 o’clock at night, an alarm goes off, given the expectation that they are going to escape over the two fences, through the motion detectors, past the 24-hour security cameras and out into the community.
If there are schoolchildren in that area—and there often are—then, on their way to school, they go through an X-ray. An X-ray wand is waved over them, as is done in our airports, and their bags are also searched. On the way home from school, yet again their bags are searched and they go through an X-ray by these guards. Regularly throughout the day in these places—and the minister likes to describe this as families living in the community—guards from the private security company contracted to run our immigration detention centres come into people’s homes every couple of hours to do a head count. When I went and visited one of those homes in a residential housing project in Port Augusta, the place was in disarray. One woman had been in there for an indeterminate period of time. She did not know how much longer she was going to be in there. She was being held in there away from her partner, who was elsewhere. Often the partner is in another immigration detention centre and mothers are held there with their children away from and without any ability to engage with the community, certainly without any ability to know what is going on and for how much longer they will be held there.
When I visited those women and children they told me about the circumstance where, once a week, they are being taken by the guards to the local shopping centre. They have a specific allowance—that is the only money they are allowed to spend—for buying food that they may cook for their family in the residential housing project. When they are there we have the circumstance where, if they seek to spend any more money than that allowance or to spend that money inappropriately, the private security guard argues with the mother at the checkout about what she can be buy and how much money she can spend buying food for her children. If that is not a paternalistic attitude about the way in which asylum seekers and mothers should be able to look after their own children, I do not know what it is. But the minister claims that this is about women and children being able to live in the community. You are not living in the community when, as occurs in these residential housing projects, if you run into somebody in the supermarket that you know and enter into a conversation, the guard not only removes you from that situation but also can deny you the right to go the shopping centre the next week to buy food for your children. That is not living in the community. It is not living in the community if you cannot talk to people in your local shopping centre. It is not living in the community if you cannot lean over the two fences and the security cameras to talk to your neighbours. It is not living in the community if you have your bag searched on the way to school when you are a six-year-old. It is not living in the community if you have a security guard arguing with you at the checkout about what you can and cannot buy to feed your children. And yet the minister puts up this ridiculous idea that this is about allowing women and children to live in the community.
Today we hear more announcements. The government, in their negotiations with Petro Georgiou and others, are saying perhaps we should allow fathers to live in this environment as well. That is not living in the community. Allowing fathers to be able to be treated in this degrading way and to be a part of an area that has turned from a suburban street into a prison is not living in the community. It is just another form of prison. The minister for immigration, in response to the concerns we have seen now for years—particularly about children in detention but, in general, about the operations of our immigration detention centres—responds to these concerns by opening a new detention centre for women and children last Thursday. And here in the Senate we are again being asked to consider more changes and the building of more expansive detention centres, this time in Victoria. That is not a minister who is taking seriously her responsibility to her portfolio and to her individual duty of care for the people that she holds in detention.
A minister who was responsible would not respond to this crisis by going out and turning three sods of soil, like the minister did on Thursday, for the building of another detention centre for children and women to be locked up in. That is not an appropriate way to be dealing with this immigration detention debacle that the current minister is presiding over. An appropriate way would be to set up a judicial inquiry—an open, public inquiry—where we can hear about the way in which this department and this minister are administering this system of mandatory detention. The Greens certainly say that we need to go further than that. The system of mandatory detention that exists in this country, which this government, minister and department preside over, is one which says, ‘We will lock people up and ask questions later.’ That is not appropriate. Think of all of the scandals that we have seen, whether it be Vivian Alvarez, Cornelia Rau or three-year-old Naomi Leong, who has spent all her life up until a couple of weeks ago when she appeared on the front page of the newspaper, living in a detention centre. I think it has been 10 children now living in detention centres who have been born there. All of those people do not deserve to have a minister who sends these issues off to a closed inquiry. They deserve for there to be an open, public and transparent inquiry. They do not deserve to have a system of mandatory detention supported by both the major parties which says, ‘We are going to lock these people up. Maybe if they appear on the front page of the newspaper we will ask some questions later.’ That is an utterly irresponsible way for the government to run public administration of these affairs.
The way in which, scandal after scandal, the department changes and manipulates the way it deals with these issues is outrageous. It is an outrageous way to run this administration. During the estimates committee process I asked a number of questions about particular detainees. One of those was an Iraqi man with a hand deformed because members of Saddam Hussein’s Baathist regime had hit it with a burning metal rod. They also tortured and killed his father. That man was sitting in Baxter detention centre at the time I asked the minister questions about whether he could be released on a bridging visa for the torture and trauma that he had faced. Two days later, I got a message to say the man had been released. I asked another question about a man in immigration detention who, out of desperation—he had been in there for five years and was the longest serving detainee in Villawood detention centre—had drunk a bottle of bleach the night before the estimates hearings. That is the action of a desperate man in a desperate situation—a man who happens to have been one of the carers for the three-year-old in Villawood, Naomi Leong, who I mentioned before. I asked questions about that particular man of Immigration and a week later, I think it was, he was released from detention.
I hope that the asking of those questions and the release of those detainees were not connected. I hope sincerely that this government, minister and department are not making decisions on the basis of issues being raised in the Senate, the estimates process, the media or wherever it may be, and to decide only then to release people from detention. If that is so, it is an appalling way to run public administration of the department of immigration, or any other department for that matter. So I hope those issues, the asking of questions about detainees and the subsequent release of those particular individuals, are entirely unrelated. We should not be supporting the building of any new detention centres. We should be supporting the dismantling of this system of mandatory detention which says, ‘Lock people up first and ask questions later.’
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports</title>,COMMITTEES,19,2
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-06-14,"—Just before question time I was speaking about the issue of poverty, which NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, estimates affects almost two million Australians. I was speaking about a report that was released last month by the St Vincent de Paul Society into income equality, which speaks about the growing gap between the rich and the poor in Australia and the fact that the income of the bottom 10 per cent of income earners has risen by just $26 per week whereas the income for the top 10 per cent of income earners has risen by $762 a week. The report notes that inequality of income is an open door to inequality in access to health services, housing services, public education, transport, communications, child care, aged care services and other sorts of social amenities, such as going to the cinema or going to a sporting event.
This inequality could easily be addressed by investing in social services and by investing in better income support and secure employment with fair pay. Professor Peter Saunders of the University of New South Wales Social Policy Research Centre has estimated that it would cost as little as two per cent of gross national income to eradicate poverty in Australia. He concludes that it is not a matter of affordability, it is a matter of choice. The coalition government has chosen yet again in this budget to make life easier for the wealthy and more difficult for the poor. The government’s welfare to work policy without a doubt will push more people into poverty. So much for the family friendly government. We see the budget and the huge tax cuts for the well off as being, as the Greens have indicated before, antifamily.
The National Council of Single Mothers and their Children has advised me of a number of examples of sole parents in different circumstances who will be disadvantaged under the government’s welfare to work policy. They tell me of the case of a single mother who has a nine-year-old child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and who gets no assistance from the child’s father. She is needed to volunteer at her local school because this public school is short of resources. There is no after school care available, although she does have her child on a waiting list. She currently does 10 hours of paid work. The question to the government is: will this be deemed enough, or will she be forced to seek more paid work and therefore have to reduce the care that she offers to her child and the voluntary work that she does at her child’s local school? What impact will occur on such schools if single parents cannot continue to do the voluntary work that many of them are now carrying out?
Another question that the National Council for Single Mothers and their Children have asked is, most importantly: what will happen when children are sick? They ask: how will the government legislate to protect mothers from being forced to attend to employment requirements rather than care for their sick child? What Job Network provider or employer is going to be willing to accommodate the needs of their sick child? For example, if you have something like chickenpox running through a family over many weeks, what is going to happen to the mother’s income over that period? Mothers will be in an untenable situation of having to decide whether to leave their children unattended or risk their income support. What happens when child welfare agencies are called and a mother is considered neglectful because she made the choice to leave her sick children unattended so that she did not risk her income support?
Single parents will also be disadvantaged by the government’s Welfare to Work measure because of the low rate of income support that they will receive compared to the rate that they currently get and the higher effective marginal tax rates that they will pay. In this bill the government has chosen to reduce the top marginal tax rate for the wealthy whilst failing to reduce sufficiently the effective marginal tax rate for the lowest income earners. The effective marginal tax rate is 40 per cent for some welfare beneficiaries, but it will be 60 per cent for single parents, low-income parents and people with a disability, who are forced to look for paid work under the government’s new policy. This favouring of the wealthy over the most needy comes at the same time that the government are privatising many of our essential services. They are making decisions such as lifting the cost of tertiary education for students and introducing more government funded private technical colleges. Both the government and the opposition voted to increase the cost to patients of essential medicines in the lead-up to this budget, and in this budget we see this government also lifting the threshold for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme safety net, meaning people will have to spend more before they get any support.
The government continues yet again in this budget to give priority to the private health insurance rebate, which means that next financial year $2.88 billion of public money out of our health budget will be spent to provide benefits—that is, private health insurance—mostly for the well off, rather than investing that money in our essential public health services, which desperately need it. The government, for example, chose in this federal budget to commit just $170 million to Indigenous health care when we all know from listening to organisations like the AMA that this is a fraction of what is needed to redress the extreme disadvantage that Indigenous Australians suffer and to address the great disparity whereby Indigenous Australians die 20 years younger than non-Indigenous Australians. The government has also decided to lift the Medicare safety net threshold and is now promising to look at allowing private health insurance funds to move into the area of covering non-hospital health services, a proposal that it had previously rejected in 2003.
The government is also reducing investment in public housing whilst encouraging private investment in the high-priced residential property market through its taxation policy. It is introducing an inflationary and regressive tax rebate for child-care fees when it should have and could have put this money into the more progressive child-care benefit or provided more of the child-care places that are desperately needed by mothers.
All through this budget the government are introducing changes to tax cuts, with Welfare to Work amongst these changes. They are also in this term of government seeking to attack the wages and conditions of ordinary working Australians and their families, requiring the lowest paid workers in the community to bear responsibility for any unemployment that may occur through the new minimum wage fixing procedure. I spoke earlier about this government perceiving the current minimum wage rate as too high already, even though it is half what the Treasurer acknowledges Australian families are struggling to survive on. The government are seeking to promote insecure work through individual contracts and giving employers the right to sack employees at whim.
The Labor Party was right to condemn the budget tax cuts as unfair, but we believe it is on the wrong track with its call for redistribution. Doubling the tax cut for low- and middle-income earners from $6 to $12 a week is still wasteful when it is compared to the many other useful purposes to which the funds could be put, such as investing in public services—health, education, the environment and the like, things I spoke about earlier.
Labor leader Kim Beazley, answering a question from Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program on 15 May, said that Labor had recognised a political imperative to reduce the tax paid by those who aspire to more—the so-called aspirational voters. This political imperative that Mr Beazley was speaking about is eating away at our sense of fairness and decency. It is distorting our sense of proportion as to who is really most in need. Around 4.5 million Australians live in households that struggle on $400 a week. Full-time adult ordinary time earnings are $993.10 a week, or $51,641 a year, and we know that plenty of people cannot find enough paid work to make up a full working week. I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name and Senator Brown’s on behalf of the Australian Greens:
Omit all words after “That”, substitute:
       “(a)    the Senate is of the opinion that it should not consider the bill further and that the revenue otherwise forgone from the tax cuts contained in the bill should be instead invested in Australia’s future in the areas of health, education and the environment; and
         (b)    this resolution be communicated by message to the House of Representatives”.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,24,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-06-14,"—I rise to speak too on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005 before us today. I want to start by noting that this is the second tax package which has delivered substantial tax cuts to people on high incomes. What the Democrats most want to point out in this whole debate is that there are people on very low incomes who will receive almost nothing out of this package. The average earner will save around $1.54 per week if they are on $10,000. If they are lucky enough to be on $120,000 then the amount that is saved is $60.62 a week. So we say that this is unfair. This package is unfair. Not so long ago we dealt with a previous tax package which delivered tax savings to people on more than $52,000 a year—$21.7 billion over four years to give high-income earners the greatest benefits of this package.
The Democrats support a taxation system that is broadly based. We support the principle of indexing taxes in general with income tax brackets and regularly adjusting what is known as bracket creep. We believe that income tax brackets should be linked to meaningful social indicators and we think that the tax-free threshold should be raised to at least the poverty line. At the present time we tax people who earn a mere $6,000 a year. Even if we were just to index that $6,000—which was established, as I understand it, in 2001—the threshold would at least be $1,000 higher at the current time. The fact that this package effectively indexes rates at the higher levels but leaves the threshold in place we think is highly problematic.
In our view the first budget priority should have been the underspend in areas such as health and education, the environment and infrastructure. It is essential, though, that we see some tax relief for low-income earners, because these are the people who pay very high effective marginal tax rates—and that is why the Democrats will be moving some amendments on that. We want to see their disposable income increase and their living standards improve as a result and to see this package used as a way in which we can encourage the transition from welfare to work through these incentives. At the present time there are in fact disincentives in place for people to get into the work force.
We would also support the bracket creep adjustments for higher income earners but we say that they need to be funded through cracking down on unnecessary tax concessions and loopholes. The fact that the government used the tax cuts as an election-winning device perverts the real policy need for structural income tax reform and is in effect just some sort of periodic relief.
On the tax-free threshold in this package, we will move amendments to increase it to $10,000. We think that $12,500 makes sense because that is the Henderson poverty line—or the minimum subsistence line, as it is known—and then we should be looking longer term at increasing that threshold to $20,000. By doing that everyone gets a tax cut, but it is much fairer on those people at low-income levels. We say the tax cut priorities the government has in this bill are all wrong. There is the need for tax relief for low-income earners and so, as I said, we will be moving to lift that tax-free threshold to $10,000, delivering $680 a year to benefit all taxpayers.
We think there is an argument for rationalisation of the tax system. At the present time we are predicting a $9 billion annual surplus. So we are not opposed to tax cuts per se, but our approach is to start with low-income earners before going beyond that. High-income earners will receive a tax cut of $4,502 a year whilst the average income earner will receive $312 a year. When you add to that $4,502 the $1,500 that high-income earners will receive from the scrapping of the superannuation surcharge, that is a very substantial tax cut indeed.
We have announced today that we will support the ALP’s amendments to this bill. I hope they will seriously consider ours, but we have indicated that we will support theirs. They are a fall-back mechanism only and we do not think they go far enough. They are not as fair as our proposed package but, nonetheless, we will be supporting the ALP on those amendments and we certainly hope the ALP stick to them. One of the problems in recent times is that the ALP have very much had a patch-up approach to tax cuts, and it is not altogether clear what the ALP stand for. I want to reiterate today that our highest priority is people on low incomes. People on low incomes are our first priority, and we have a plan, as I said earlier, to raise the threshold to $10,000, then $12,500 and then $20,000. That is what is known as a long-reaching plan but, at the present time, we do not know what Labor propose. Nonetheless, we will, as I have said, support their amendments.
It is worth bearing in mind that there are 1.8 million Australians who earn less than $10,000 a year. I think that is an alarming statistic. Most of them, it is true, do not currently pay tax. If our policy were supported around 400,000 more taxpayers would no longer be paying income tax. If our amendments to raise the threshold do not get supported in this chamber—and I think it is fair to say the ALP has suggested it will not support them—we will move to split the tax bills. We will attempt to support the cuts for those people earning up to $21,600—that is, the cut from 17c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar—and we will oppose those income tax cuts for people on higher incomes. The other point I want to make today is about the tax schedules.
—What about the regulations? Are you going to support—
—If Senator Boswell is interested in this issue he might listen, and then I will—
 (Senator Bolkus)—Order! Senator Boswell!
I announced this morning that the Democrats, along with most others I have heard speak on this subject, will not be supporting a disallowance should it be moved. It is a very hypothetical question. Nobody so far, as far I know, has said that they will disallow the schedules. We do not think it makes a lot of sense at the end of the day. After 1 July the government will be able to introduce whatever schedule it likes, and effectively others in this chamber will not have much say over that. It is an administrative vehicle—it is the schedule which lets employers know what they should take out of wages in tax. We see no purpose in artificially stopping that schedule for a matter of a few weeks.
Mr Costello asked us late last week to give an undertaking. I said I would take that to my colleagues. I have now done that, and I have advised the Treasurer that this is our position. The schedules are simply mathematical calculations of an administrative nature. That does not mean that we are voting for the government’s tax package—we are certainly not; we are going to protest right to the end—but we do not see the point in unnecessarily delaying the situation and costing business, with the confusion that might arise should those schedules have to be relied upon for the first couple of months. As I said, the government can in any case introduce schedules at any time it chooses, so it seems to us to be a pointless exercise.
However, we will stand very much on principle on the question of the bills and we will vote against them if the amendments are not won. We certainly hope that the Labor Party stand firm on their amendments and do not give in when they are bounced back from the House of Representatives. This was a great opportunity for tax reform in this country. I think the government has messed up. These are the wrong tax cuts for us to consider, and it is a great pity that an opportunity to take people out of poverty has not been taken up in this legislation.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,24,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2005-06-14,"—This is not the first time that I have risen in this place to speak on tax legislation. I was heavily and directly involved in the major tax package which included the GST back in the late 1990s. At that stage, we had months of committee hearings and long debates. This emphasised very much for me that, when we are changing the tax system, it is not something that we should do lightly, without proper consideration or quickly as a response to a particular lobby or pressure group. And it is not something we should do simply to implement what is supposedly a publicly popular measure of cutting taxes.
Tax should be about national and public interests as well as individual interests. We should be talking about tax reform and, in particular, about how changes to the system impact on various sections of the economy as well as on individuals. One of my major achievements in this place was ensuring that those major changes—what became known as the ANTS package—actually went through this place but that they only went through after considerable negotiations and considerable changes so that we did have a package that was environmentally and socially responsible.
Why did I support the tax changes back in 1999 when saying no was obviously much easier and a much less risky course to take? There were a number of national priorities that could no longer be ignored. Indeed, the Democrats had already seen this and had been undertaking a series of tax negotiations and tax discussions across all divisions in all states and both territories for some time. That led to a party ballot in which the Australian Democrats voted to impose a tax on services. The ALP also knew that a GST was essential and that personal income tax cuts would need to go with it, but they chose what they thought at the time was a politically expedient road and opposed the tax package entirely.
I will now move on to some of the reasons why change was necessary. Governments could no longer continue to build up debt and/or sell off assets. Borrowing and selling to fund our daily needs simply was not able to continue. The states and territories had to get access to the money they needed to provide public services and infrastructure. That has now been done, and we can see the extra money from the GST flowing to schools and hospitals. There are extra roads, police et cetera. In my home state, there is a raft of positive changes in the way services are being funded.
Another reason I supported the 1999 package was that we had to remove the hidden taxes that were embedded in our manufactured goods and so reduce the cost of Australian goods to make Australia more competitive. That has been achieved. But, as we made the raft of changes back then, we had to ensure that tax reform was socially responsible and equitable. Basically, we had to protect those on low incomes. That was done, with some $5 billion of fairness injected into the 1999 GST reform package, and that is what is now being partly undone. By ‘undone’, I mean that we are now losing a lot of the fairness that was negotiated into Australia’s tax system at that time.
In those tax negotiations, we had to boost pensions and benefits more than the government planned, because they were working on averages and that was simply not equitable. We needed to take food out of the package, because that has the biggest impact on those on low incomes, and we had to make a number of other changes, including boosting support through SAPs for people who are homeless and boosting opportunities for children living on low incomes—in particular, a childhood nutrition program. All of those changes were to help those on the bottom rung. In 1999 dollars, we negotiated roughly an extra $7 a fortnight for disability pensioners, and about $11 for a couple. It was more for people who were on single-parent benefits. Basically, it had to be an equitable social response to tax changes.
Under this package, together with changes to our social security system, many on low incomes are going to lose not just once but twice. Firstly, they lose because of the piddling tax cuts they get that are barely going to keep up with inflation. Secondly, many people will also lose through the lowering of their incomes with the move from pensions to enhanced Newstart. In particular, I mention here single parents and those newly diagnosed with a disability. Many Australians who apply for help in the future—when, I must stress here, the Senate will be in government hands and therefore compliant—will be actually worse off. In 1999, those of us who worked constructively with this government on tax reform also succeeded in reducing the tax cuts that were then planned for the wealthy. We rolled those back. That is certainly being undone with this package before us now.
I am not arguing—indeed, I do not think anyone in this place is arguing—that we do not need tax cuts. We do need them. Inflation has taken care of that; it is a certainty. But a tax system should be fair, and any changes that we make to that system should be assessed as to whether they are fair or not. In this case we see that those who desperately need tax cuts get few, if any.
What we actually need now is tax reform, not just tax cuts. It is not logical, as some have argued—including some in this place—to say that we have to give people more incentives at the top by giving them more tax cuts and giving them more money in their pockets and that the way to give incentive to those Australians who are already struggling is to reduce what they have in their pockets, to cut their incomes. I have great difficulty when I try to follow the arguments about how this can possibly be reasonable and fair. These tax bills are a great disappointment as I leave this place. Certainly the changes to social security legislation are. I ask opposition senators who seem so delighted at the prospect of these tax cuts: why should Australians who are living below the poverty line pay any income tax at all?
I would ask that government senators speaking in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005 not mention my name in their speeches. Yes, I did support you in the past on tax reform but I do not support what you are doing now. This package is simply unfair. It is un-Australian. It is not a fair go for all, as our most recent senator just noted. It may well be supported very vocally by some in the media, but that does not make it right and it does not mean we have to go along with it. I will oppose these changes wherever I can. Yes, the tax cuts are going through, but they will not have my vote and they will not have my name on them.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2005-06-14,"—I am disappointed that Senator Lees will not support taxation cuts for many, many Australians. I cannot understand it. I can understand someone putting up an alternative point of view. The Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005 implements the tax cuts announced in the May budget for all Australian workers. Some get more than others, but all Australian workers get a benefit. The bill ensures that the top tax rate applies only to three per cent of the working population. That is something that everyone has been pushing for, including Bill Shorten, who is supposed to be the new saviour of the Labor Party. He has said quite openly:
... the maximum marginal income tax rate cuts in at a relatively low-income level, which harms work incentives and skill acquisition. Effective marginal tax rates also remain high for low-income earners, deterring participation by secondary earners and older workers.
He has even suggested that the government needs to perform radical surgery—in fact, it could even need to apply the death penalty—on the tax regime. The government has listened to one of the leading lights and the hope of the Labor side, Bill Shorten, and has actually done what this new leading figure of the ALP wishes—and has got kicked in the head by the ALP in this place. I do not want to condemn all members of the ALP, because there are many in the ALP who think it is absolutely ridiculous to deny Australians tax cuts. Peter Beattie says:
We welcome the tax cuts. They are the right thing to do. I make no apology for saying that ...
That is what he told state parliament. He is a successful leader. Clare Martin, the Northern Territory Chief Minister, said she made it clear to the Northern Territory federal representatives that they should support the budget on behalf of Territorians. She said:
But that is the Federal Budget, and I wouldn’t be opposing tax cuts.
She said:
... every Australian will be looking forward to them, every territorian.
Geoff Gallop said:
If we look at the tax cuts, which I think are excellent—and we have been advocating that for some time. They’re essentially built off the back of the WA economy. The hard work of the West Australian people, the strength of our economy, has given Peter Costello the surplus he needs to deliver these tax cuts.
So he wants them. Everyone wants them—everyone except Wayne Swan, Senator Conroy and a few others in here. I made an inappropriate comment when I first heard about what was happening with the Labor Party refusing to back these tax cuts. I could not understand it. I have been in politics for something like 30 years and it just seemed to me to be the most stupid, idiotic thing that I have ever seen done by an opposition. All the things that I believed were wrong and all the things that I thought would happen to the ALP have happened.
Mr Beazley, stuck there like a rabbit caught in a spotlight, does not know which way to move. One of the things I learnt when I first got into parliament was: if you cannot say something, never go on television, because you look ineffective and weak. I do not think anyone looked weaker and more ineffective than the Leader of the Opposition on the 7.30 Report last Wednesday or Thursday night. He has been handed something that he just cannot handle. I do not blame him for not being able to handle it, because no-one could handle the poisoned chalice that the Labor Party’s economic spokesmen have given him. It was a disaster.
I thought the ALP and Senator Conroy would come storming into the Senate today to defend their position. In fact, I mentioned it in the joint party room. I said: ‘Beware of the attack. They’ll have to defend this.’ I was expecting a barrage on tax cuts at question time. I do not think there was one question bowled up to any of the economic ministers about tax cuts. I said to the party room—and I hope I am not disclosing any confidences: ‘There will be a line-up of ALP speakers a mile long, coming in here to defend what many of them think to be the indefensible.’ What have we seen on the speakers list? I think there are three speakers: Senator Conroy will be one, Senator Evans will be another and there is one other floating around. Senator Evans has to be up for it, to defend the position. Senator Conroy is an economic spokesman. He, too, will have to defend the position. But they could only muster three people—three kamikaze pilots. That is all they could muster: a squadron of three.
I am surprised. After 30 years of political life, I cannot understand how anyone could deny the people of Australia a tax cut. What the ALP has forgotten, or has never understood, is that there are many Australians that traditionally vote for the ALP who are on $60,000 and above. There are many of them. Many of them are in Capricornia, a seat that the ALP has held and holds now. They are scattered right throughout Australia. In the mining industry, $93,000 is a starting rate. Many people fly in, work two weeks in a row—12 hours a day, seven days a week—and then come home and have a week at home. They really work hard for their money. They are traditional ALP supporters, or they were. How can you deny those people a tax cut? Those people start on a salary of $93,000 and their salaries go up with the skills that they develop. The people that drive those big draglines are probably on $120,000 or $130,000 a year. Those skills are needed, they are appreciated and they are paid for. What are you denying those people? For a person on say, $90,000, you are taking $40 a week away from them. That is $40 a week that they work damn hard for. They fly in, work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, day in, day out for two weeks, sometimes three weeks, and then go home for a week. You are taking $40 a week away from those people, from the people who support the economy of Australia, the mining industry of Australia—the coalminers, the people that drive the draglines, the other miners. It is very hard, it is very nasty. It is hard yakka, and it carries a certain element of danger with it.
I am also concerned about the abattoir workers. You would not find, if you went around all of Australia, an industry that supports the ALP more than meatworkers do. And what have you done to them? A lot of those people do earn incomes between $25,000 and $55,000, but the skilled workers, the boners, the foremen, the top workers—the people that can work on the chain and keep the chain running—are on $65,000 to $75,000 a year with all the benefits. What are you going to cost them? It is around $25 a week. Twenty-five dollars a week is a lot of money to people that are living away from the cities, living away from the benefits that many people get in the cities, and where things are more expensive. What are you doing? Don’t you understand that it is not only the minimum wage worker that backs the ALP? There are many workers in the abattoir industry.
I could nominate quite a number of people out there—for example, truck drivers—that live out in the bush, that are rural and regional dwellers, that earn reasonable money. They work hard for the money. They roll up their sleeves and they really get into it. An interstate truck driver might be on $75,000 to $95,000 a year. He will lose $96 per month. Do you really expect that these people are going to vote for you? I cannot believe how anyone could get themselves in such an unbelievable mess—and neither can most people in the ALP. There are many unsourced quotes from people in the ALP. I will find them in a minute. I cannot understand how the ALP thinks it can ignore and walk away from not only the workers who are going to earn $6 extra a week—$6 dollars is not a lot of money, but it is worth having—but also, when you start getting to $20 and $30 a week, the skilled abattoir workers and miners. What about the waterside workers that load beef or sugar in Mackay? Those sorts of people are on around $80,000 a year with their overtime. They are going to be $170 worse off. I do not know how you can come into this place and defend it.
In October last year an election took place and the government ran hard on its economic performance. It not only won an additional four or five seats but also won, for the first time since 1974, control of the Senate. Is there any more striking example of the people supporting this government because they believe in its economic performance? Is there any more striking example of ignorance than trying to take these tax cuts away? I have never seen it before and I do not think I will ever see it again. There is a certain point where a party becomes unelectable. I think you have just about reached the point where a party becomes unelectable. The decisions you have made on these tax cuts are so reprehensible that no-one can understand them.
The people who are battling want their $6 a week. The people who are out there with their sleeves rolled up driving huge dragline machines, scooping up the wealth for Australia, putting it in trucks, taking it down to the ports, loading it on the ports and working 12 hours a day seven days a week have been neglected by the ALP. You say that you are trying to create a difference. You have certainly done that. You have created the greatest difference—between a government that has economic credentials and an opposition that, economically, cannot add up at all.
There are many, many workers in rural and regional Australia who are traditionally ALP supporters. They are the people who have held the faith. They have stuck by you. They have not come over to The Nationals or the Liberal Party as yet. They have held the line. You have walked away from those in the bush. You have never given them good representation. You do not even put up a reasonable candidate. You put up the name of some union hack from Brisbane and then go out and try to say you are running in Maranoa, Kennedy or somewhere else. You walked away from them politically and now you have walked away from them economically.
I thought that Capricornia was a seat that we could not win. We can win it on big swings. I would now say that you have opened that seat up for The Nationals. It is one seat where I now do not believe you will get a vote from the mining industry or the abattoirs. There will be the true believers who will hang on—those whom you could walk over, kick in the head and flog and who would still vote for you. You have virtually done that. You have left every rural and regional worker—and there are many, many of them who spend many hours of their lives with their sleeves rolled up to get into that higher bracket of income tax, paying it all out in tax and, as Bill Shorten has said, finding no incentive to work—and you have walked away from them. There is only one result from that: if you walk away from your constituency, they will walk away from you at the next election.
Debate (on motion by Senator Faulkner) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-06-14,"—Today in this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005 Labor draws a clear dividing line between the opposition and an increasingly arrogant coalition government. We do so on behalf of millions of hardworking Australians on low to middle incomes who are crying out for some tax relief after years of being squeezed by the highest taxing government that this country has ever known. In 2005-06 tax revenue is forecast to hit $235 billion. Tax paid per taxpayer has increased by $12,200 since the Howard government came to power. There can be no doubt that tax reform is required.
Unfortunately, that is not what the tax changes contained in this legislation deliver. The measures contained in this bill fail every test of decent tax reform. They are monstrously unfair, enriching the wealthy few at the expense of millions of hardworking Australians. They represent a wasted opportunity to reform the tax system in a way that promotes economic growth by encouraging work force participation. They also threaten to overheat the economy at a time when the Reserve Bank has already issued warnings that a strong consumer demand and capacity constraints may force it to raise interest rates.
For these reasons, Labor has consistently stated since budget night that it does not support the Howard government’s inequitable and economically irresponsible tax plan. But Labor has not just opposed the government’s flawed legislation; it has also developed an alternative proposal. It is a plan that more fairly distributes tax relief. It is a plan that will encourage people to move from welfare to work and provide increased incentive to work right across the income spectrum, not just at the top. It is a plan that minimises the danger that tax cuts will fuel inflationary pressures at this stage of the economic cycle and force the Reserve Bank to further increase interest rates.
Before talking about Labor’s alternative, I would like to take some time to detail some of the flaws in the government’s proposal. I will start with the rank unfairness of the tax cuts announced by the Treasurer in last month’s budget. Like many Australians, Labor was dismayed on budget night to see that the government could spend $22 billion on tax cuts but find a tax cut of only $6 per week for seven million Australian workers on incomes between $30,000 and $60,000.
We have come to expect arrogance from this government, and this Treasurer in particular, but a new low was established on budget night. The Treasurer decided to court the votes of the coalition backbench in the forthcoming leadership battle by giving them a tax cut of $65 a week while giving the typical hardworking nurse or teacher a measly $6. Surging revenues allowed the government to serve up a tax cut feast on budget night, but the vast majority of Australian workers were only offered the scraps from the table.
The top 10 per cent of taxpayers will pocket around 45 per cent of the tax cuts. Only around three per cent of taxpayers will receive the maximum tax cut. That is right: three per cent of taxpayers will receive the top tax cut. And this is from a Liberal Party that promised in 1996 to govern for all of us. The Australian people have learned from bitter experience over the years that the coalition’s definition of ‘all of us’ is a very narrow one. In the case of these tax cuts it includes lawyers, stockbrokers and the coalition backbench, but it excludes workers on average incomes.
There are only five federal electorates in this country where the average worker will receive more than $6 per week. These are the blue-ribbon seats of Warringah, North Sydney, Higgins, Bradfield and Wentworth. Shame on you, Senator McGauran; shame on you! The government would like to have the public believe that low- and middle-income earners have been looked after in previous budgets, but this claim just does not stand up. Since the GST was introduced five years ago, people on average incomes have received tax cuts of just $10 per week. In contrast, if this legislation is passed, taxpayers on $125,000 will have received tax cuts amounting to $119 per week. That is right: people on average incomes will have received $10 from this government, but if you earned $125,000-plus you will have received $119 per week.
In successive budgets the Howard government has attacked the progressivity of the tax system. Who could forget last year’s budget where the 80 per cent of workers earning under $52,000 received no tax cut at all? Since budget night, Labor have consistently argued that the distribution of tax cuts was not fair and that we would not support the Treasurer’s proposal. Two days after the budget, Kim Beazley unveiled Labor’s plan for fairer tax cuts. For around the same cost as the government’s tax plan and its changes to the superannuation surcharge, Labor produced a proposal that would double the tax cut delivered to workers on incomes between $30,000 and $60,000. That is right: double the tax cut. Under Labor’s plan, from 1 January 2006 the threshold where the 30 per cent marginal rate cuts in would be raised by $4,800, from $21,600 to $26,400. This change would deliver workers on average incomes a tax cut of $12 per week. In July 2006, Labor would increase the threshold where the 42 per cent marginal rate cuts in by $4,000, from $63,000 to $67,000.
Labor is also concerned that the tax system should be internationally competitive. Under the existing tax legislation, the threshold for the top marginal tax rate will be $80,000 in 2005-06. This threshold kicks in at around 1.5 times average earnings. Labor believes that this is just too low. Many skilled workers are now subject to this high rate of tax. Eighty thousand dollars is not a lot of money in cities like Sydney and Melbourne where housing costs have skyrocketed. Under Labor’s plan, from July 2006 the threshold for the top marginal rate would be lifted by $20,000 to $100,000. This would deliver a worker earning $100,000 a $40 per week tax cut. Labor’s plan differs from that of the government in that workers earning over $100,000 would receive around a third less in tax cuts than the government has proposed.
Of course Labor’s plan has not been popular with the Treasurer and his sycophantic supporters—not that there are many, as Senator Minchin worked so assiduously to ensure—who have been salivating at the prospect of a massive tax cut delivered at the expense of low- and middle-income workers. Some sections of the media in particular have displayed incredible double standards. Two years ago, the pathetic $4 sandwich-and-milkshake tax cuts were widely and justifiably condemned. This time around, with average taxpayers receiving just a $6 tax cut, the same commentators have dubbed the Treasurer a working-class hero and a genius. What could possibly explain this inability to maintain a consistent analysis of tax policy? Despite the inability of some sections of the media to see past the fistful of dollars, Labor is confident that its proposals for fairer tax cuts are well supported by the community.
Senators need only look to today’s Daily Telegraph to see an indication of this support. A loaded question was posed: should Labor delay the government’s tax cuts? It could not be more pejorative. It was not, ‘Do you want Labor’s $12 tax cut or the government’s $6 tax cut?’ That would be a fairer question. A loaded question—should Labor delay the government’s tax cuts?—attracted the support of 52 per cent of those surveyed. That is right. The vast majority of working Australians—the seven million Australians who know they are getting only $6—are not fooled. They are not sucked in by the headlines that the newspapers are running. They are not sucked in by the Treasurer’s posturing, while he preens himself to try to get votes from the coalition, to try to see if he needs to move out of the phone box of support. They are not fooled; they understand the difference between $6 and $12. They understand the difference between a party committed to fairness and a party committed to looking after its own. Imagine if the question had been fairly and accurately phrased to something like ‘Do you support Labor’s plan to double the weekly tax cut to seven million Australian workers?’ Can you imagine the response? We dare the Daily Telegraph to ask that question.
Unlike some in the media, the Treasurer is aware of the flaws in his tax plan. He has not wanted to debate the merits of his tax proposal against Labor’s alternative proposal. Peter Costello, the Treasurer, has sought to distract attention from his unfair tax changes by talking incessantly about the tax schedules and when they will come into effect. Senator Minchin has been doing exactly the same: ‘Let’s avoid the substance of the debate. Let’s not talk about the seven million Australians who could get $12 from Labor as opposed to $6 from the government.’ Labor has simply said, ‘Let’s put first things first.’ If our amendments are passed by the Senate and this government is shamed into giving Australian workers the tax cuts they deserve, those tax schedules would be incorrect. Demanding that Labor vote for them, when the tax schedules are subordinate legislation, is putting the cart before the horse. The long established practice of this parliament is that we debate primary legislation—that is, bills—before considering any instruments purporting to give effect to those bills.
It has been a scam by the Treasurer, it has been a scam by Senator Minchin and it has been a scam by the Prime Minister: ‘Do anything, say anything, just don’t let anyone notice that we are offering only half the tax cuts that the Labor Party are offering to seven million Australians.’ This controversy about the schedules has just been a sideshow orchestrated by the Treasurer to deflect attention from his unjust tax proposals.
We have also been told by the government that Labor’s position is based on the politics of envy. Our opponents seek to deny the legitimacy and relevance of principles such as equity and fairness in the tax debate. Let me assure the Senate and those listening today: this is a proposition that Labor simply cannot and will not accept. High-income earners are not the only group of Australians working hard and deserving some tax relief. The Treasurer misjudged the Australian Labor Party if he thought that we would support this proposal. Labor members were not put in this place to wave through proposals such as the one we have before us today. We have put forward a fairer alternative, and we will be challenging coalition senators to vote in the interests of the seven million constituents rather than in their own self-interest.
In addition to being monstrously unfair, the government’s tax package is also economically irresponsible. It comes at the expense of measures to strengthen the Australian economy. For people paying off a mortgage, it enhances the risk that the Reserve Bank will be forced to raise interest rates to deal with inflationary pressures caused by strong consumer demand and capacity constraints. Australia needs tax reform, not just tax cuts. The government forfeited the chance to institute real tax reform; instead, it took the opportunity to reward its political base of high-income earners.
The Treasury has repeatedly advised of the need to increase work force participation if economic growth is to be sustained as the population ages. The government’s tax cuts ignore the economic imperative to address the demographic challenge facing Australia. In contrast, Labor’s plan is not only fairer but also more economically efficient. A key feature of Labor’s plan is the introduction of a new low-income Welfare to Work bonus. For people earning up to $20,000 per year, the low-income and Welfare to Work tax offset would deliver an effective tax-free threshold of $10,000. This would reduce the crippling effective marginal tax rates for those on low incomes. Currently, single allowance recipients can face effective marginal tax rates of up to 75c in the dollar. That is right: 75c in the dollar.
Single income families with dependants can face effective marginal tax rates of over 100 per cent. The new tax offset proposed by Labor would phase out at a taper rate of five per cent. Under Labor’s proposal, in 2006-07 workers earning up to $31,000 would benefit from the tax offset. This tax offset tackles the problem of high effective marginal tax rates faced by welfare recipients returning to work. These measures will strengthen the Australian economy by enhancing labour force participation.
As my colleague the shadow Treasurer has noted, the economic literature on labour supply elasticity indicates that low-income workers are more likely to be responsive to incentives than high-income earners. That is right, Senator McGauran—that is the economic literature. If you choose to look beyond your own vested self-interest, the economic literature is clear: low-income workers are more likely to be responsive to incentives than high-income earners. But do not let the facts get in the way of a good bit of political bull. In other words, if you want to increase labour force participation, you get far more bang for your buck by focusing tax reform on reducing effective marginal tax rates for low-income earners. This is the approach that Labor has taken.
Labor is also concerned that tax cuts should not add to inflationary pressures and force the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates. Low- and middle-income mortgagees are well aware that any increase in interest rates would quickly swallow up any tax relief. During the last election campaign the coalition made much of its promise to keep interest rates low. At the same time in the run-up to last year’s election the government engaged in a reckless $66 billion spending spree to buy its way back into power. Labor warned then that mortgagees would pay the price for the government’s irresponsible fiscal policy. In March the seeds sown by the government in 2004 bore their bitter fruit when the Reserve Bank lifted interest rates by 0.25 per cent. There is macho man, Finance Minister Minchin, who allowed this runaway spending. What did you think when you passed up to the Prime Minister for his campaign speech, ‘Here, pick one from these six or seven options,’ and he took the lot? You laugh, but you should be ashamed of yourself. The hard man of the Liberal Party right wing! (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-06-14,"—I also join this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005, which in reality comprises, as the debate is showing today, the tax cuts announced on budget night. We all know, Senator Minchin, better than anyone sitting in cabinet, that tax is often a pious debate at the best of times. We heard the Democrats outdoing the Labor Party in their bidding. It is often a bidding war, and we know, whatever tax cuts we put up, even the public would want more than is delivered. It is often a pious debate, but nothing could have been more pious than Senator Conroy’s speech here today. It absolutely takes the cake. He has outdone the two other speakers from the non-government side. Senator Conroy has delivered something more pious and more fake than the other two, who did a very good job. He hid behind some Telegraph poll, if we are meant to believe the figures of that. I will be checking the Telegraph later on. He mentioned a Telegraph poll. He called the government’s tax cuts a scam.
The second speaker, Senator Sherry, enters the chamber. The Labor Party only had three speakers. You are never short of getting speakers in the Senate. It is the place of debate. It has been the most filibustering, obstructionist Senate for the nine years of this government. We are never short of getting Labor Party speakers to come in here day and night. The backbench would queue up. In fact, it was very hard to get a government speaker on before one o’clock at night sometimes. But today what do we have? Three speakers joined the debate. I was shocked. In fact, The Nationals contributed two speakers to the Labor Party’s three. What a joke. I had to rush this speech through. I turned up this morning knowing I had a tax speech, probably about 10 o’clock tonight by normal experience—
—Get on with it—talk about tax.
—What I am trying to point out, Senator Sherry, as you say, ‘Get on with the debate’—I will—is that you have lost support from your own backbench. None of them will come forward and argue the indefensible. They know this is ridiculous and the sooner it is over the better; the less said the better. That is the new approach to this tax debate. Senator Sherry tried. The only thing Senator Conroy did was not come in here with his usual over the top style of debating, because even he has been quelled on this. It is absolutely absurd. Senator Conroy claims that we have misjudged the Labor Party and the tactic that they would take in blocking this tax cut. He is right. We utterly misjudged the Labor Party, that the Labor Party would be so stupid, so idiotic, so dangerous.
As Senator Boswell said, you have almost reached the stage where you have become unelectable. I remember that when we were in opposition there was a ridiculous stage we had reached—never so bad as this, of course; we knew never to deny the Australian people a tax cut of any sort—in 1993, which Senator Boswell will remember, where we would not take any amendment cuts on the Native Title Bill. That is when you know you have been in opposition too long. My point is that you reach a stage where you really do become unelectable. You become so obstructionist, so caught up in your own internal politics, so idiotic and political that you cannot see the wood for the trees. That is the stage that you have reached today in denying the tax cuts to the Australian people. Senator Conroy is absolutely correct: we utterly misjudged you. We never thought you would do this.
Senator Conroy finished his 20-minute contribution by raising the fact that the government promised during the election period to spend $66 billion on commitments and promises, which we are fully committed to and are fulfilling—in the last budget all those promises were met. He finished by saying that that was a threat to low interest rates and that the Reserve Bank has sent out that warning, as if to say we should not even be introducing any tax cuts. I know those cuts were a big surprise to the Labor Party on budget night. It caught them flat-footed. It caught the shadow minister, Mr Swan, flat-footed and caught Mr Smith and obviously Mr Beazley totally flat-footed. So they went into what they instinctively know, and that is to object, to go into their negative mode. They were caught flat-footed, so much so that they decided to reject these tax cuts.
So Senator Conroy—just to finish that point on Senator Conroy and move on from his idiotic speech—was suggesting that tax cuts actually feed into higher interest rates, and the Reserve Bank have sent out that warning. So what he is really saying is that their offer is not really an offer at all. If the Labor Party ever got into government, no-one would believe that they would deliver. Even so, the suggestion that the tax cuts would feed into higher interest rates is ridiculous.
The truth of the matter is that these tax cuts announced on budget night were unexpected but indeed most welcome. Unlike the Labor Party, who were caught flat-footed on the night, we actually had a structure, a philosophy and a policy behind it all. As the Treasurer said in his speech, setting out the philosophy behind these tax cuts:
After we balance our budget, reduce Labor’s debt, and fund our services we should reduce taxes as far as is prudent.
So it is quite obvious that the philosophy behind these tax cuts is like a dividend to the Australian people. Good economic management right from our first budget, our first tough budget in 1996, allows us to pay these dividends. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the Treasurer’s 10th budget was his best. He increased spending in all portfolios. He reduced debt, which will be zero by 2007. What government can increase spending, reduce debt, cut taxes and maintain the reform momentum all at the same time? This was the Treasurer’s finest budget ever, his finest hour, and we are proud to say that he was able to include these tax cuts.
On each occasion the government got to the point where we were able to offer these tax cuts as they came along because we took the first tough steps in 1996 and have in every budget since. But the Labor Party, from 1996, have objected to every reform this government have tried to introduce. To date you have rejected our industrial relations reform, but has anyone heard of any strikes down at the waterfront lately? Has anyone noticed the country going out in sympathy with regard to secondary boycotts or anything like that? No. That reform has brought peace and harmony to the economy, but the Labor Party were against our initial industrial relations reform.
In the area of welfare we have introduced mutual obligation and we have targeted welfare fraud. The Labor Party were against that, yet that was all part of producing a surplus budget and being responsible economically. It is the same with regard to the Medicare safety net, and so it goes on in the area of education. You are even against reforms to support rural and regional areas such as Regional Partnerships. I am sure—you can remind me, Senator Boswell—that just about everything in the rural and regional area that we put up has been obstructed by the Labor Party in this house, either by filibustering or by voting it down.
You have paid a high price for that, just as you will pay a high price for your rejection and obstruction of these personal income tax cuts. The price you paid at the last election was the highest yet. Political pundits probably though that they would never see the day in modern politics when a government would again hold the majority in the Senate. How wrong they were. When the opposition get so weak and put up such a dangerous leader, do you really think you are going to put that over the Australian people? That is where we will be after 1 July. That is the answer the Australian people gave you at the last election: they told you to get your economic management in order. You are not listening. You have not listened. If this is your response then we are likely to increase our majority in the Senate after the next election. That is the price you paid at the last election; you are heading down the same track again. But far be it from me to give you gratuitous advice. I am quite enjoying the level of absurdity that the opposition have reached. Senator Buckland sits over there as Opposition Whip—
—The wise old owl.
—a wise old owl who is probably glad he is getting out on 1 July so he can go home to his farm and make a bit of money on his cattle and contemplate the good sense that the cattle have—more than there is in the caucus room. The Labor Party have learnt nothing at all in nine years. You have paid a high price. If the Labor Party cannot get sense out of the shadow Treasurer, Mr Swan, why don’t you listen to those that have had experience in government and know the degree of difficulty in running an economy and, when the rewards are there, how you should take them? Why don’t you listen to Paul Lennon, the Premier of Tasmania? Let me quote what he said about the tax cuts.
—A good man.
—Yes, Senator Boswell, he certainly was when it came to forestry issues. I just noticed Senator Brown over there; I must thank him for his strong stance in the area of forestry at the last election. It certainly sucked in Mr Latham and the Labor Party. I must thank him for the lack of reality that he has contributed to the Labor Party. Senator Brown ignores me, but he knows only too well that it was his advice to the last leader of the Labor Party—we await his book coming out in October; that should be another fine read!—and his lack of reality and the Greens’ lack of reality that led to the absurdity that we had in Tasmania with regard to forestry policy. Paul Lennon, the Premier of Tasmania then and now, rejected the Labor Party policy on old-growth forests, as he rejects your policy on tax cuts. He is standing up to you, in other words. This is what he had to say:
… at the end of the day the Tasmanian community wants the tax cuts delivered. And … had I been in the Federal Labor Caucus I would have been advising them not to block the tax cuts.
He also said:
… nor would I have said, if I had the opportunity in the Federal Labor caucus, that it was a smart political tactic to block the tax cuts. It is never a smart political tactic to do that.
As you know, the Western Australian Premier has also given you similar advice, as has none other than Bill Shorten, the up and comer—
—The hope of the side!
—the hope of the side, the man being groomed to take over the Labor Party reins—the new or the next Bob Hawke, which is how Senator Ray and Senator Conroy are attempting to groom him. At least, that is what I think they are doing; unless he too is going to ride right over the top of them. But he had some wise words to say. He put it quite simply, saying that his own union and all tradesmen will benefit from these tax cuts. It is an absolute fallacy what the Labor Party is selling, that these tax cuts are not directed to the working man and woman of Australia. They are directed to the heart of the working man and woman. If you listen to Bill Shorten, he said in the Australian on 3 May:
Some steelworkers I know at a OneSteel fabrication plant are doing something about Australia’s rotten tax system. Having calculated how much they can earn before paying the top income tax rate ... in the dollar, they simply refuse to work any overtime that pushes them above the limit.

…         …         …
The top marginal income tax rate thresholds should be raised to create a fair, productive and competitive tax system.
That is what the tax announcement has done. That is Bill Shorten talking to you from within your own party, a man who is from the union and has all the credentials to be able to influence you, but what do you choose? You choose to listen to Mr Swan. I have a strong suspicion it may well be the last time that the Labor Party listen to Mr Swan—I would say that would be the last time. It is just a matter of time before Mr Swan is graciously, I suspect, moved on.
The truth of the matter is that this government has a record of tax reform. We have undertaken major tax reform. There have been income tax cuts in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. We have cut company tax, we have halved capital gains tax and we had the courage to fundamentally restructure the tax system and go to the people in the 1998 election with the GST, which included income tax cuts. We had the courage like no other government to face the Australian people with regard to the GST, which cut wholesale sales tax and taxes from exporters and so on. The Australian people had confidence in us, and we brought that system in in 2000. So we are a continuing reform government—unlike the Labor Party, who, when they were in government, simply increased taxes. They increased company tax—first you decreased it and then you could not take that, so you increased it. In just about every budget you increased wholesale sales taxes. You jacked up the excise tax on petrol in just about every single budget until you got sick of the political reaction to that and then you simply indexed it.
But personal income tax reform goes down in political folklore and political legend with regard to the l-a-w law tax cuts. You promised, before an election, major personal income tax cuts. You legislated for it—it was law to deliver those tax cuts. Then you had the nerve on the other side of the 1993 election to come in here and overturn the law on personal income tax cuts—a promise on which people had voted for you. Of course, you introduced the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax and so it goes on. So your whole culture is shown up here today—your tax culture. It is a simple cliche but it sums you up: a big-spending, big-taxing party—that is what you were in government and that is what you will be. This is just a facade, just a front you are putting up to posture, knowing you will never have to deliver.
As the last speaker I can see that my colleagues want to get to the vote on this. Let us test the mettle. Let us see if those backbenchers who have been hiding all day from this whole debate front up and vote. You watch them: when this debate is over and the bill is through the Senate, they will all be back on the speakers list, pontificating. But when it comes to important issues like dollars in the pockets of the Australian people, where are they? They skedaddle. Their first loyalty is to the Labor Party, the Labor caucus. It is not to their electorate, not to the Australian people and not to building an incentive into the economy; it is to their own personal caucus. You have paid a high price in the past and you will continue to pay a high price for the decision you are going to make today.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2005-06-14,"—I wrap up this second reading debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005 by thanking all those who have spoken on the bill, particularly my colleagues Senator Boswell and Senator McGauran. I want to make a couple of points. I guess the Labor Party in their private moments would now accept that they made a terrible mistake on budget night to decide to vote against the government tax cuts. It is one thing to rhetorically claim that the tax cuts are unfair or whatever it is that the Labor Party believe—that is fair enough; that is democracy—but clearly it was an enormous error of political judgment, for which the Labor Party have paid a very high price, to rush to a decision on budget night and say that they would do what they are about to do and seek effectively to block our tax cuts.
The ancillary point is that I would have thought the Labor Party in particular would have some great reservations about doing that. We are a government that have just been re-elected with a swing in our favour. I would have thought that that does give us in a democracy, as the duly elected government, the right to bring down a budget, propose our tax cuts and not have the power of the Senate used to try to stop those tax cuts being brought into effect. That is, in effect, to announce to the public that you are going to block a central part of the budget of the newly re-elected government. I would have thought the Labor Party of all parties would have thought that was inappropriate. Nevertheless, we will go through this debate. We will see if the Senate does effectively block these proposals.
I would like to conclude these remarks by thanking the Democrats, the Greens and the Independent senators on behalf of the government for at least acknowledging the democratic right of the duly elected government to give effect to its proposals for tax cuts by announcing that they will not support any disallowance of the proposed tax schedule to give effect to those tax cuts. I think it has left the Labor Party in a terrible position. I gather Mr Beazley has still not said whether or not he will move disallowance of those tax schedules in this chamber. So I thank, on behalf of all Australian taxpayers, the minor parties and the Independents for recognising the reality of the prerogative of a duly elected government to give effect to its vision for tax reform in this country.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-06-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is a report from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission of an inquiry into complaints by immigration detainees concerning their detention at the Curtin Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. This report is another example—one amongst the now countless number of examples—of what the minister herself and the department head of DIMIA have now acknowledged is a major problem with the culture of the immigration department.
This report shows that that problem goes back a long way, because it deals with complaints made by a range of detainees—all of them asylum seekers—back in 2000-01. It has taken that long for this report to even be tabled in the parliament. That is example No. 1 of why the current so-called checks and balances are inadequate. The department often says, ‘If people have problems, they can complain to the Human Rights Commissioner and the Ombudsman.’ These people complained about their treatment back in 2001, and here is the report four years later.
The finding of the Human Rights Commissioner was quite unequivocal. The finding was that the rights of most of the people who complained under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights had been breached. Another example of how far out of whack everything in this area has gone is the fact that reports like this, in which the Human Rights Commissioner can find that the immigration department and the then detention centre providers, ACM, have breached people’s human rights, are tabled here with no comment and with barely a yawn. If I had not stood up to speak to it, it would have passed without any notice at all.
Our government breaches the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as determined under our own law through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, but nobody cares. It is par for the course for the government and the department to ignore these findings, as they have in the past. This is not the first time such a finding has occurred. The specific aspect of these complaints was that a range of people—26 complainants—were put in separation detention in Curtin detention centre for significant periods of time. According to DIMIA’s own figures, the greatest of those periods was 264 days. Separation detention is when people are put in a separate area when they first arrive in detention and can have no contact with anyone outside that area. They can have no contact with the outside world and no contact with anybody else even within the facility. They can have no contact with a lawyer or the Ombudsman unless specifically requested. Again, that is a clear example of the problem with the culture. They put people away from everything else. They do not even let them know their rights, and it is only if detainees know the magic words to specifically request a lawyer or specifically know to request to talk to the Ombudsman, for example, that they then can speak to them—and only about that specific issue.
The commissioner, in looking at the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, looked at the relevant law and what is called the body of principles that has been developed around that international law for the protection of all persons under any form of detention. One example of the sort of sophistry and distortion of culture that DIMIA had developed even four or five years ago is the fact that they said those laws did not apply because it is not penal or correctional detention; it is immigration detention. The department’s answer was, ‘We don’t even need to comply with those basic minimum principles because it’s not correctional detention; it is administrative detention, so we can operate on worse principles than the basic principles for correctional detention.’ That is bad enough, but the fact is that they were wrong anyway. It is quite clearly stated that the body of principles is meant to apply to all people under any form of detention. This report gives page after page of blatant breaches and blatant contempt for any due process and for the basic humanity of people. This was four or five years ago. The same is happening today. If anything, it is possibly worse because they have been allowed to get away with it for all that length of time and, not surprisingly, they have therefore become more and more blase about that sort of treatment of human beings. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</title>,DOCUMENTS,29,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2005-06-14,"—One of the nice things about the privilege of serving in Australia’s parliament for such a long time is seeing things that I have been involved in mature and come to fruition. Tonight I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to the environment and to the health of our environment. The way we live with our environment, use it, abuse it and protect it is the single most important factor in Australia’s national security and long-term prosperity. Our dependence on more and more intensive use of resources, more and more land clearing, more and more ploughing of marginal sandy soils and more and more greenhouse gas emissions cannot continue. Already we are realising there is a problem with water use in the Murray-Darling Basin, but this is just one of the problems that must be addressed as a matter of urgency. This is not scaremongering; it is a simple assessment drawn from history and from looking at the steadily worsening environmental indicators and the steadily increasing clean-up costs.
I have committed a lot of time to environment issues during my period as a senator because I believe they are so fundamentally important. While I have certainly added my voice to protect various species and various places, I have also pinpointed the processes that are causing such detrimental change. I believe you need four things to happen if you are to consider your time in this chamber worth while. Firstly, you need to be able to point to—to shine light on—specific issues for your constituents, issues that you care about. Secondly, you need to make responsible policy and legislative change. Thirdly, you need to make changes to funding, both to add investment or dollars to your area of concern and to take money, subsidies or incentives away from destructive practices or in some cases put in penalties if all else fails. Fourthly, you need to bring others with you, through compromise, through gradually moving the majority in the direction that makes a difference and that makes Australia a better place. Let me take these in turn, particularly as they relate to the environment.
Shining a light is easy. There are many opportunities built into the Senate structure for standing up and talking about the things that really matter to you and speaking on behalf of your constituents. I imagine that will be more difficult in the new Senate. But shining a light or highlighting an issue is only the first step. Extracts from speeches may make great fill in senators’ newsletters, but words do not in the end save a single tree. In fact, I would describe them on their own as just no-brainers.
Some take an ecocentric view of the world. They think only of the environment. When they think of the environment they say: ‘All species are victims; all humans are destroyers.’ Anyone who wants to protect species is innocent; anyone who they see as threatening them is a destroyer. It is a very simple world to live in. There are a number of individuals and some environment lobby groups who operate to this formula. These ecocentrics never compromise. The other side is always wrong and, more than that, the other side is always evil. For the ecocentrics, the sky is always falling down. Catastrophe is just around the corner. Disaster is looming. They always want environmental nirvana, and they want utopia and nirvana now. They have the odd titular political head, who is worshipped as long as this person does not compromise.
Their warnings about the environment are often fairly accurate but their methods of achieving change are highly questionable. You see, making the rest of us out to be planet destroyers and never compromising leads to really achieving nothing. In fact, you get 100 per cent of nothing. It is indulgent behaviour, and it is behaviour that is failing us because little is achieved on the ground other than getting other people’s backs up. So things actually continue to get worse. Sure, they may be able to point at the odd piece of wilderness they have saved. As a matter of fact, I can point out a few that I have contributed to protecting—most recently, the Brooklyn station in Queensland. But, as I said, the route of words alone is a no-brainer route.
I will consider the second and third ways to make one’s time in the Senate worth while together. Making policy and legislative change and getting funding shifted from destructive practices to positive practices is difficult. It often wins you very few friends, particularly in the short term; it is hard work; and it is long hours spent poring through the detail. It is many meetings and long arguments. It is proving your point with research. It is consulting up-to-date experts and it is the use of persuasion. It is being accommodating when other arguments are put to you that you consider fair and reasonable. It involves relentless pressure from others, particularly from those lobby groups and often from the media. It involves carefully checking arguments before either accepting or dismissing them. It involves having a purpose and a commitment to achieving real change and wearing the flak.
In the late 1990s I decided to negotiate seriously with the current government on the complete rewrite of most of Australia’s federal environment laws. With a number of environment groups against it and with pressure on me to say no under any circumstances, this was difficult. However, I could not ignore the fact that it was processes in the existing laws that were leading to Franklin dams, the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, the killing of species and the destruction of habitat, and development being done without any consideration for the environmental impact. As well, state and federal governments were running rampant with ever-decreasing environmental protection laws.
No, I did not get everything I wanted in the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, but neither did the government. I got most of what I wanted. The legislation passed in 1999. The result is the world’s first comprehensive biodiversity legislation that carries jail terms as well as monetary penalties—legislation that protected world heritage and wetlands properly, that protected endangered species very thoroughly, that drew the states into line and that meant the federal environment minister, not the resources minister, made environment decisions. It is a piece of legislation with extensive third-party powers for legal action to protect the environment. That was a first in Australia.
Strangely, the ACF, the Wilderness Society, Greenpeace and Senator Brown rejected the legislation without reading the outcomes of all the negotiations, without reading the clauses or understanding how they would work. They started screaming injustice straightaway. Their press comments on nearly 600 meticulous amendments representing sweeping and fundamental changes to the draft came very quickly after they were published. They persuaded a gullible ALP, who were desperate to look different from this government on something—anything—to go with them and to vote against the bill. In doing so, they locked themselves into an uncompromising position of saying no to good policy reform. They were led all the way by Senator Brown from the Greens, the champion no-compromiser.
Many good people, sadly, fell victim to ideology and did not see the realistic and good public policy outcomes that were achieved. Fortunately, groups like the Queensland Conservation Council, the Humane Society International, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and WWF were focused on fixing the law, and we worked diligently together to do just that and make the new legislation. But it came at a price. Considerable invective was thrown at us, privately and publicly, by the likes of Senator Brown, the ACF, Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society. They tried some quite nasty things behind the scenes, including pressure to get one of the supportive conservationists sacked. Publicly, they berated us in interviews and in press releases and set in place a grudge they wore on their sleeves for a number of years.
It is now six years, almost to the day, since those negotiations and I want to quickly bring the Senate up to date by addressing the fourth way I listed to make our time in the Senate worth while, and that is to bring others with you—moving the majority in a direction that does make a difference in the longer term. We now have an extensive web site for the EPBC Act, which shows every step of the way as an environment decision travels through the processes. That helps both conservationists and individuals in the local community. I have been informed that this is a model of public transparency and decision making that is world recognised. We have extensive environmental administration and governance coming from a stronger federal environment department. We have nearly all state and territory governments amending their legislation to bring it up to the federal standard. We have developers who work with the federal environment department from the beginning of their projects to make sure they put in enough protection to make a permit possible. Indeed, there is even one running seminars on how to do it.
There are many stories of proponents now talking environment from the word go rather than ignoring it all the way through. We have had considerable positive feedback from utilities, corporations and, yes, conservationists and local communities on the functioning of the act. There have been injunctions to protect species, force the environment minister to take more action and, in a full Federal Court decision, even put downstream and cumulative effects into the environment minister’s area of consideration.
I have one more thing to note. Six years on, Greenpeace have investigated using the act in a legal case. The ACF underwrote the Nathan Dam case, which was the most favourable win for conservationists in a decade. The Wilderness Society has used the act, and now even Senator Bob Brown is heading into the court brandishing it, with his usual moral outrage fuelling his feet. May you use the act often and wisely and well, Senator Brown. And may you one day have the courage to admit that you were wrong—you should not have opposed it absolutely; you should have worked with us to help improve it.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Environment</title>,ADJOURNMENT,30,1
