"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2004-08-12,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move:
1.	That the Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice (No. 1) 2004 made under subsection 115(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, be disallowed.
2.	That the Military Superannuation and Benefits Amendment Trust Deed 2004 (No. 1) made under subsection 5(1) of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, be disallowed.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansarda short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice (No. 1) 2004
The Notice revokes and remakes the pay TV anti-siphoning list to apply until 31 December 2005, and provides a revised anti-siphoning list to apply from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking further advice on the following matters. 
First, the list in Schedule 1 (which applies until 31 December 2005) does not refer to the 2004 Olympic Games. The Committee notes that future Olympic Games do appear in the second list in Schedule 2. Secondly, the Explanatory Statement indicates that the list in Schedule 2 (which applies from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010) removes Australian Football League State of Origin matches from the anti-siphoning list. In fact, these matches are included in the list. The item which appears to have been removed from the list of Rugby League Football events is “Any other match involving the senior Australian representative team selected by the Australian Rugby League, whether played in Australia or overseas”.
Military Superannuation and Benefits Amend-ment Trust Deed 2004 (No. 1)
This amendment to the Trust Deed provides for the introduction of family law superannuation splitting provisions for the scheme members and their former spouses. New rule 88 applies where a person who has an associate benefit dies. Where that person is survived by more than one spouse and/or child, rule 88 provides for the payment of the benefit to those spouses and/or children. The rule does not indicate whether such payments are to be in equal shares, or whether this is a matter for the discretion of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Board of Trustees. A similar point arises in connection with rule 39, which is amended by this instrument. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on this matter.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,0,1

That the Senate take note of the report.
I want to make a few remarks on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report into AusSAR's role in the search for the Margaret J. This is yet another unanimous report of this committee, and I think the fact that so many reports of this committee have been unanimous indicates how well this committee has worked over the life of this parliament. I want to thank the staff for the good work they have put in on what has been a very difficult and, at times, emotional matter. 
The Margaret J was a Tasmanian fishing vessel that went missing in bad weather in April 2001. It had three men aboard—Mr Ronald Hill, Mr Robert Kirkpatrick and Mr Kimm Giles. Tragically, all three lost their lives. The national search and rescue agency, AusSAR, was made aware of the missing boat soon after its failure to return to port and later became involved in the search operation. AusSAR's role quickly became a matter of public controversy. For many Tasmanians, the incident rekindled memories of AusSAR's role in the 1995 search for the Red Baron, a fishing vessel. 
I moved for the establishment of the committee inquiry to examine AusSAR's performance in June 2001. I did so in the face of vociferous criticism from the minister responsible for AusSAR, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson. Mr Anderson did not understand why a committee of the Senate might examine the performance of the national search and rescue agency in the failed search for three missing Tasmanian fishermen. Thankfully, the committee did not share the minister's desire to shield AusSAR from the sort of scrutiny Australians expect their parliament to provide.
I know that the participants in an online forum following a Four Corners program about the search for the Margaret J welcomed the committee's work. I know the people of Tasmania thought it fit and proper that the parliament should examine the performance of AusSAR in the failed search. The committee never sought to duplicate the work of the state coroner who conducted the inquest into the deaths of the three men aboard the Margaret J. We acceded to a request from Tasmanian authorities to delay public hearings until the conclusion of the coronial inquiry. The report has been delayed to minimise the creation of difficulties for any legal proceedings arising from the failed search. This report contains a sober review of the evidence presented to the inquest into the deaths of the crew, the coroner's subsequent findings, and the submissions and oral evidence received during the course of the committee's inquiry. The committee have made some considered findings about the timing of AusSAR's assumption of responsibility for search coordination.
The committee notes that the first effective request for transfer of responsibility was made by Tasmania Police on 15 April 2001—more than two weeks before AusSAR ultimately accepted responsibility for search coordination. And despite telling Tasmania Police in mid-April that it was not feasible to search for the missing men, a much delayed and restricted search on 30 April did happen to find the boat's life raft and it also led to the recovery of the bodies of two crew members. On this matter, the committee found: 
The success of the restricted search activity on 30 April 2001 leaves the committee unwilling to accept that earlier similarly targeted search activity would not have yielded a similar result.
The committee noted the coroner's findings on the estimated time of death of the three men—that is, the coroner found the men had died before the missing boat was reported to Tasmania Police on 13 April 2001. The committee also notes expert evidence to the coronial inquiry, recounted in the coroner's report, estimating Mr Hill's time of death as being between 9 April and 16 April and Mr Giles's death as being between 16 April and 27 April 2001. A local marine expert, Mr Jim Hooper, gave evidence to the committee and was adamant the men would have lived beyond 11 April 2001 based on his technical and local knowledge.
One of the terms of reference of the inquiry was the effectiveness of communication between AusSAR and Tasmania Police. The report finds that AusSAR thwarted the transfer of responsibility from state search and rescue and notes deficiencies in information recording procedures and mishandling of important information. The transcripts of relevant calls to AusSAR were received into evidence by the committee. I want to refer to extracts from those transcripts to highlight my concern about aspects of AusSAR's handling of this matter and to support the committee's view that the agency can do better. The extracts relate to AusSAR's involvement near the beginning and the end of the search for the Margaret J. I will not name the people involved because I do not want to highlight individual lapses. Instead, I want to question whether the language is indicative of wider problems in AusSAR's operations, at least at the time the Margaret J went missing. On 15 April 2001, four days after the Margaret J left port and two days after the boat was reported missing, an officer from AusSAR returned a call from Tasmania Police and started the conversation this way:
I'm just looking at this bit of a problem you're creating here.
The coroner was critical of this exchange, and found that the AusSAR officer's manner caused the Tasmanian police officer to back down on a planned request to transfer responsibility for search coordination. On 30 April 2001, Tasmania Police finally determined to seek a formal transfer of search responsibility. The police officer managing the search called AusSAR to make sure he got the request right. He said:
I'm just giving you a call because I'm not exactly sure of the protocol myself. My boss seems to think that we put a phone call through and forward it to you if it's too big for us.
AusSAR replied:
Right. OK. I think for something this size and the political pressure on board we might have to go to the Manager of the Operations Centre here.
Later, after establishing the right fax number, the police officer asked:
How would you prefer me to word/broach the final paragraph ... I mean my OIC seems to think that we've got some protocol where we just actually direct you to do it—
he is talking about the search—
Do I just sort of say it's beyond our resources and can you please?
AusSAR replied:
Yes. Yeah. It is beyond the Tasmanian authorities resources. 
The Tasmania Police said `yep'. AusSAR replied:
And I'm not sure myself actually because I've never taken anything over from Tassie Police.
The AusSAR officer found the relevant sections of the National Search and Rescue Manual after what the transcript records as `music playing on hold for almost two minutes'. After agreeing an assertive final paragraph was appropriate, the AusSAR officer said:
But I don't know how far we'll run with it. I don't think we'll run with it at all to be honest.
Later, two AusSAR officers considering the Tasmanian request agreed it would be prudent to review information previously considered. Officer 1 said:
I suppose what I'm trying to get us to do is to take a look at the problem, not necessarily mount a search but look at the problem and then review what was said by [another officer] before. I've got no reason to believe what he said was wrong in any way. Review it and say well we've done all that. We've gone through all of that. We've relooked at the search area. We are even more impressed that it is unrealistic and unreasonable and we don't believe there's any prospect of success or whatever we want to say. OK?
Officer 1 went on to say:
Review all of the information that the police may be able to provide us, which might be absolutely zip. And then taking all of that into account we can then say we've looked at all of this and we are convinced that there is no actual reasons to continue with the search, to reinitiate the search. We have to have some basis for saying no.
Officer 2 agreed, and suggested he should ask the Tasmanian officer with the necessary details to go back to his office and collect the information. Officer 1 said that would not be necessary, advising: 
If that takes him two weeks that's his problem.
It may have been a very big problem—not for an off-duty Tasmanian police officer, but for three Tasmanian fishermen missing at sea. I do not want AusSAR officers worrying about the things they were clearly worried about in these circumstances. I do not want them worrying about whether a state jurisdiction is causing them a problem by asking for help. I do not want them worrying about political pressure from above. I do not want them worrying about how to accept responsibility for search coordination because they are inexperienced or have not received adequate training. And I do not want them to worry about reasons for not recommencing a search that may, one day, save someone's life.
When Mr Anderson attacked this committee's inquiry in August and September 2002, I reminded him that he was the minister responsible for AusSAR during the failed search for the Margaret J and that he was responsible for improving AusSAR's performance. I urged him to cease using the deaths of three Tasmanian fishermen to attack the Labor Party and asked him to work with me and the committee to ensure that identified deficiencies in our search and rescue system were rectified. I renew that call today. Instead of instructing his staff to draft an incendiary media statement, I urge him to sit down and actually read this committee's unanimous report. Once he has done that, the minister ought to get to work implementing its recommendations.

—I will.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,19,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-12,"—We need to be assured, before we agree to this motion, that there will not be a truncation of the time for discussing committee reports at that hour. What a remarkable thing for the parliament: we are going to sit here until midnight again. This morning the Prime Minister revealed why that is so. I thought it was because there was some delay. Last night we got up to the opposition amendment in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on the free trade agreement legislation but the amendment was not here. It could not be dealt with. Senator Conroy said he did not want to put it forward. It turned out that the negotiations with the government had not been completed. All the very complex but very important amendments that came from the Democrats, One Nation and the Greens—despite their limited staff—had been delivered, debated and intelligently put to the committee, with the government or the opposition being unable to give any response to these amendments which would save Australia's national interest. But when we came to the single amendment about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Labor could not move it because it was not ready and they had not completed talks with the Prime Minister. 
We thought Mr Latham and Mr Howard together had not completed their talks but this morning the Prime Minister made it clear that the real reason there had not been progress here was that he had rung President Bush and President Bush had not given agreement to this amendment. So we are going to sit until midnight tonight and the whole thing has been delayed because we are waiting for President Bush to make up his mind. We will not get the response from President Bush so the Prime Minister said today that the Americans could say that the amendment we were going to deal with is inconsistent and that they may not accept the free trade agreement—and it would be Labor's fault. Doesn't that give the game away?
By the way, the Prime Minister said—and isn't this a thought-provoking statement from our Prime Minister?—that no Prime Minister in his right mind would agree to any agreement which weakened the PBS, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Hear, hear to that! It makes you think, doesn't it? This free trade agreement will weaken our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Prime Minister is saying, `We can't guarantee the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme because the Americans won't allow an amendment that Labor has proposed.' It is a very tiny amendment. The Americans will not give it approval. They have to think about it after our parliament has considered the matter. If the US administration does not like the amendment—that means, if the drug corporations do not like the amendment—the free trade agreement is off.
The Prime Minister might think that that would be a spectacular potential win with the Australian electorate but he wants to be very careful. Australians have a great relationship with Americans but their relationship with the American administration is a different matter, and if there is one thing Australians will not like it is having the shots for this country called from the White House. This is an independent nation. This is Australia. This is not the 51st state of the United States, and we expect our Prime Minister to be telling, not asking, the United States that if there is an amendment in this parliament which goes a small way towards protecting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—and Prime Minister Howard says that at worst it does not hurt—then this parliament will rule. In Australia it is not, `The US rules okay' but `Australia rules okay.' 
The Greens object to our being delayed all the way down the line while the Prime Minister makes his phone calls to George W. Bush to see if it is all right if we have an amendment to a law in this country to defend the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Whatever the conversation between Prime Minister Howard and George W. Bush was, the deputy sheriff was left hanging on the end of the phone with no clear answer. We will have to wait and see. Mr Bush in his inestimable, predictable way has handed the matter across to the drug companies, of course, and their lawyers are going through it over there in California at the moment, determining whether it is in their interests or not. If it is not in their interests the free trade agreement will be held off until some other session of parliament, until we get it right here in Australia—until we fall into line.
How could the Prime Minister of this country have a press conference this morning and say that he does not know whether the free trade agreement is on or off because George W. Bush will not tell him whether he can accept this tiny amendment to ensure the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? George W. Bush is not the elected head of state of this country. You would expect that the elected Prime Minister would have the gumption to say that he has told the US that this amendment, if it goes through this parliament, stands—that is it, full stop. Not only is parliament being delayed at the pleasure of George W. Bush but we are also getting a very clear indication here of why this free trade agreement is not in this nation's interest. It does not matter whether it is the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, quarantine, jobs in manufacturing, the environment, cultural content or intellectual property, but in future when we determine these matters in this parliament, Mr Howard or Mr Latham, first of all—because Mr Latham is going to vote for this as well if he is Prime Minister—is going to ring George W. Bush and say, `Is this okay?'  
Come off it! It is time the big parties here—the Labor Party as well as the government—got some spine. George W. Bush said in this parliament last October that `fair dinkum' meant `man of steel'. It shows you how much he knew about Australia. Where is the man of steel now? This quivering Prime Minister has to ring up the White House to see if we can put an amendment through the Senate to defend the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Really! Has it come to that?
We are dealing here with an arrangement of sittings of the Senate to deal with this free trade agreement, which is being held up by the inability so far of the US drug corporations to determine whether or not they will accept this very weak amendment from the Labor Party. I object. We should not be sitting here tonight. This should have been dealt with on our terms, on Australia's terms, in this Australian parliament. The Prime Minister said today that it does not matter what we do in the Senate—or what they do in the House of Representatives, for that matter. This matter is not going to be resolved by the debate; it is left to some drug company lawyers in America. We will await in the coming weeks their determination as to whether the free trade agreement is on or off. What is the point of us having a debate in here? What is the point of us making a determination when both of the big parties are handing sovereignty not just to the White House but also to drug company lawyers in the United States? The Prime Minister tells us that we can get our amendment through—it is not going to affect things much—but that the free trade agreement might be off if he gets a message from George W. Bush in the next couple of weeks saying: `We have decided that we will not have that amendment. It is not going to help the profit line of one of the big companies.' What a way to treat this parliament. 
We object. And the least we can do is to oppose this motion as a symbol of the fact that we object to the sitting hours here being rearranged at the pleasure of people over in United States working out whether or not legislation in here is good enough for them. And we object to the whole idea the Prime Minister introduced into Australian democracy this morning that it does not matter what parliament does on matters like pharmaceutical benefits—and add to that quarantine, intellectual property, cultural identity, the environment and jobs—because the final determination is going to be made over there in Washington. Not with us it won't be! We will be voting against this motion and we will be voting against this free trade agreement.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,19,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—The Democrats will also vote against this motion. We think it is an outrage that the minister has come in here this morning and talked about having negotiated the number of bills that will be dealt with before the Senate adjourns. Negotiated? I have yet to have a conversation with the minister about why it is that marriage, for instance, is on the list. What is the urgency on marriage? At our last sitting we had a bank-up of bills and there was some negotiation—it is called a leaders and whips meeting. That is where we get together and the government explains to us why certain bills are necessary and urgent for debate and must be passed within a given period. There has been no leaders and whips meeting still. The minister came across a moment ago and said: `We are not now listing bills at all. However, we are going to deal with marriage and electoral legislation.' Neither of those bills, as far as we can see, has any urgency. I ask the minister here and now, since we did not have a leaders and whips meeting and since we are wasting the time of the Senate in this debate about what we should be dealing with before we finish today or tomorrow or whenever it is, to explain why it is that the marriage bill and the electoral bill are urgent. Otherwise, it is very difficult for us to know exactly what we are going to stay here for, how long we are going to stay, why the Senate is being held up in this way and why the other bills dropped off. They were there yesterday and early this morning. Why have they suddenly disappeared? We do not have any answers to any of those questions.  
We will get into the debate on the FTA shortly. I agree with Senator Brown that we are here talking about this now because over a period of a week, from when the amendments first came out, agreement could not be reached between the two major parties. Obviously the lawyers in the United States—or George W. himself—might have held up the process. That needs to be explained to us, but we are being left in the dark. The minister says there has been negotiation. Let me explain that there has been no negotiation with the Democrats. We do not know why we are doing these bills and we do not know why we are going to be here until late tonight. It is quite provocative on the part of the government. If they want the free trade agreement legislation to be dealt with then this is not really a good way of handling business, because it requires the cooperation of the Senate.
We had the absurd situation last night where the debate stopped because we did not have this agreement and yet there are a lot of complaints on the part of the government about how this is taking too long. It has been more than 20 hours—I do not know what it adds up to now—but it has all been a waste of time, effectively, because we are not ready to deal with the only two amendments which apparently will make the difference between the legislation passing and not passing. I would very much like to think the government would consider our amendments seriously, but obviously they will not. That does not mean that we will stop talking about the amendments and stop advocating for them. I have a lot of questions to ask about these new amendments, so the minister can look forward to a proper exploration of the issues that arise out of them—but we will get onto that. In the meantime, we deserve an explanation as to why it is that there are now three bills to be dealt with where previously there were 11.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,19,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-08-12,"—We will not be opposing this motion, but let me say that the motion that has been moved by Senator Ian Campbell provided a substantive list of bills that the opposition does not agree with and moved that we should sit until their completion. I think, Senator Allison, that you were right when you said yesterday that it is not an end of session. The problem might be that an end of session turns up about every 20 days, unfortunately. But this is not one of those points in time when we would finish each job. We would not consider a list such as that, seek to complete it and then pack up our bags and go off for a recess. This is not the time of the year for that to occur. So the opposition will not be agreeing to the list that is specified in the Notice Paper that originally was in the motion put by Senator Campbell. 
What we want to see today is the FTA debate continuing. I think everybody wants that—and the longer I talk the less time is available for that debate to proceed in committee. Our position is that we are prepared to continue with the US free trade agreement—I understand that the amendments are ready—and we are ready to proceed with that debate today. We will monitor the progress of that debate today before we consider any other proposals as to what bills may or may not be required to be dealt with, given the time available. It is not a case of our thinking that there should be an open-ended period of time available. We are unsure of how long the free trade agreement debate will continue. No-one wants to not ensure that everyone has a full and frank debate on the relevant amendments. I am sure everyone wants to be able to do that and, as I have said, the longer I talk the further out we get from allowing that to occur.
In respect of the matter of bills that we might deal with, much depends on how long it takes to do the free trade agreement. I am not sure. Senator Brown might be able to tell the Senate how long the process might take. But we can come back and revisit that this afternoon. There are other matters on the Notice Paper today that we need to deal with—I think there are a couple of committee reports this afternoon. After that point, maybe we can have another assessment of the program to see where we are at with the free trade agreement amendments in committee. If necessary, Senator Campbell can come back and consult with the minor parties and the opposition about how he sees progress going. That is the way the opposition sees the matter at the moment.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,19,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—by leave—I thank Senator Ludwig for explaining where the negotiations are at. Again I say that negotiations in this place about what we deal with and the hours of business should be undertaken with everyone in this place, including Senator Harradine, Senator Harris, the Democrats and the Greens. We would all like to know what is going on instead of being told: `It's been negotiated; this is it. We've taken the bills off the motion but, informally, it's agreed that we're going to do the free trade agreement, marriage and electoral.' Now Senator Ludwig says that we will assess the situation as the debate goes on—but at what time? Are we going to have a leaders and whips meeting so we can work it out or is it just going to be negotiated between the two major parties with us being told the outcome of the negotiation? I can understand that you have the numbers and you can do this, but it is not the way we do business in this place—at least, it has not been since I have been here, since 1996. The smooth operation of this chamber depends on cooperation and communication with all of us, and it is best done in a more formal arrangement than discussions going on across the chamber.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,19,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2004-08-12,"—I would like to respond to some of the issues that have been raised. We had this sort of furphy of saying, `Let's have a leaders and whips meeting.' The leaders and whips meeting is something that we initiated so that we could—particularly in the closing weeks, usually the closing fortnight of a session, which we are not in at the moment—negotiate the sorts of bills to be finished before what is normally a five- or six-week adjournment. We are not in that situation. We are in a two-week on, two-week off session, and of course there is speculation about when the election will be so there is a heightened atmosphere that we are at the end of the session. 
Where are we today? I will explain so that people can understand this. We put out a legislative program, as we always do, at the beginning of the session. Some time, usually a week or two, before the session we put out what is called the public list. That lists, for the whole world to see—I think we publish it on the Internet—all of the bills that the government seek to enact or have debated and considered by the Senate during that session of sittings. We then put out a program for the sitting fortnight. That program listed, back on Monday, 3 August, as item No. 1 the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and an associated bill. Then it listed the surveillance devices legislation; the crimes legislation amendment bill; the telecommunications interception bill; the customs tariff amendment bill; an industrial relations bill; the tax laws amendment bill relating to reform of the WET, as it is known out there in wine producer land; the Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004; an anti-terrorism bill; and a trade practices legislation bill. That was the program for last week.
Last week the Senate, for probably the first time in many years—it may be the first time ever and was certainly the first time in my memory—passed no legislation at all, not one bill. It passed nothing at lunchtime on Thursday and nothing for the rest of the week from that publicly available program for last week. That meant that the Senate sat here and debated. We had an important debate. We had, and are still having, one of the most important debates in Australian history, about the free trade agreement. It is a fantastic debate about Australia's future. Do we engage with the world? Do we engage with the strongest economy in the world? Can we do it on our own terms? Can Australians negotiate an agreement with the greatest economy and one of the greatest democracies in world history and pull off an agreement that is good for Australia? It is good for the world, in fact, because when you get two strong democracies and strong economies working together it is good for a whole range of other reasons. It is, in fact, terrific for the environment. So it is a very important debate, but we thought that we could spend a few days on this debate on the US free trade agreement and then get to all of these other bills like customs bills and tax reform bills.
This week we came in having not passed any legislation last week from the list that is put out to the world—even the Democrats can look it up on the Internet and read it. This week we put out the next list, on Monday, 9 August—a week later. We listed the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and one related bill. We listed the Marriage Amendment Bill, the telecommunications interception bill, the surveillance devices bill, the trade practices bill, the schools assistance bill, the states grants bill, the family and community services bill, the Indigenous education bill, occupational health and safety measures, crimes legislation amendments and higher education legislation. We listed the tax laws amendments to the WET, which industry has been screaming for for years and we want to do this week. But, no, a couple of people at the other end of the chamber have decided that it is in their political interest to have an endless debate about the free trade agreement—not a long debate but an extraordinarily long debate.
What did we do in this place yesterday? We said: `Let's have a long debate about the free trade agreement. Let's sit and talk about it all night.' So yesterday we spent two hours debating because Senator Brown wanted to oppose the proposition that we had a longer debate about the FTA bills. We spent two hours of yesterday because Senator Brown wanted to have the night off. He did not want to debate the free trade agreement bill; he wanted to go out to dinner. What an absolute farce! One day he says he wants to have a debate about the free trade agreement but when we say, `Let's have it,' he says: `Not on a Wednesday night; they're sacrosanct. I want to go out to dinner. I want to sip some chardonnay and have a latte afterwards.' What a joke! We say, `Let's have a debate,' and he says, `No, I want to go out to dinner.' 
Why are we in the situation we are in at the moment? Because the program the government put out and published to the world said that we wanted to deal with all this. We can deal with the free trade agreement. We can have a long and important debate about it, we can discuss amendments and we can come to a vote—because ultimately that is what democracies are about. Let us have a vote and deal with all these other measures. What do I do, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate? I am faced, at the end of a fortnight of sittings—and it is costing taxpayers millions of dollars to run this place—with the fact that we have not done a single bill in two weeks.
That is what Senator Brown wants. He does not want the free trade bill. The Democrats do not want the bill. Let us be honest about this. They have made it clear that they do not like this bill and they do not want it and so they will talk about it till Christmas if they can. We want the bill and Labor, to their credit, want the bill. Labor have been constructive. We have sought to negotiate an amendment, and it has been a constructive process. But the Greens and the Democrats have decided to be destructive. They do not want a democratic outcome here; they want to filibuster this out. They do not want a long debate; they want to filibuster. They do not want to vote or debate; they just want to talk endlessly about everything else. But we want to deal with the bill and with a whole range of other bills.
At the end of a fortnight's sitting here am I with, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, the job of trying to get the government's program before the Senate and have some votes on it. So I thought yesterday, `Perhaps we will sit the Senate, pick bills off the list that we published three weeks ago and put to the Senate a list of bills that we might seek to do this week.' It became clear to me that not even that forlorn hope is likely to occur, so we are saying to the Senate: `Let's sit today. Let's try to do what we can do.' I have been very honest and open by going to the other end of the chamber and saying to all of the Independent senators, the minor party senators, the Greens and the Democrats that this is our intention. We have effectively given up on all of the other bills we listed three weeks ago. We have given up on any hope of getting the public list up, because two or three senators have wanted to talk endlessly and repetitively about the free trade agreement. That is their right, but please do not criticise me for having some secret agenda, not having leaders and whips meetings and not having negotiations.
I went down to the end of the chamber to say: `Perhaps we could do the electoral bill at lunchtime. There is only one bill that is uncontested, so perhaps we could use the spare hour we have at lunchtime to discuss the electoral reform bill.' That is the negotiation I was seeking to have, and I am getting criticised for it. All I am trying to do is allow the Senate to debate some bills—and important bills they are, for schools assistance packages, grants to the states for primary and secondary education assistance, family and community services and veterans' affairs legislation, Indigenous education— 
—Put them on instead of marriage.
—That was an inane interjection from the Democrat Whip. They are on the list. They have been on the list for two weeks.
—Let's get on with it.
—Yes, let's get on with it. I am not taking them off the list. The Democrats and the Greens, through their actions, have made it impossible to deal with them. They are on the list, they are on the Notice Paper and we are ready to deal with them; so let us get on with the legislation and stop this absolutely mindless time wasting that the Democrats and the Greens seem to take inordinate pleasure in.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Ian Campbell's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,19,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I would like to take this opportunity to speak to the Labor Party's amendments to this agreement, particularly those that relate to the cheaper medicines proposals.
—Senator Carr, you cannot speak to those amendments unless you move them first. They have not been moved.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-12,"—I will explain to Senator Carr that last night we all had to go home because Labor could not move the amendments because the government had not agreed, because George W. Bush had not agreed. This morning the Prime Minister said that we will not get agreement from George W. Bush until after the Senate is finished and that that will be the final arbitration on the matter. So we are now left to hear the Labor amendments put, presumably with the government going to a debate on those. I just want to clarify that—far from the Greens, the Democrats and One Nation delaying the chamber—the opposition and government could not bring forward the amendments last night. We have now got them and we should debate them. 
I will also say this about the amendments while we are waiting for the opposition to get ready to move them. I can foreshadow that the Greens will be moving an amendment to the Labor amendments to toughen them up a bit. We believe they are inherently weak—I do not know what Mr Howard and Mr Bush are worried about. I want to point out that, while they move on evergreening, the test is too weak and we will be moving an amendment to them to strengthen it. We believe even the penalties are very modest when compared to the potential billions of dollars that drug companies get from the processes we are discussing.
But the really important thing is to look at what is not in the Labor Party amendments. There is not an amendment here to deal with a process which could lead, through arbitration under the free trade agreement, to a challenging of the decisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme board when it makes a determination to either not allow a drug to be listed or not give it the price that a drug company wants. Let us make no mistake about this: the US pharmaceutical industry wants to undermine the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The scheme, which came in way back in the prime ministership of Ben Chifley, is now recognised as the best in the world. It delivers cheaper medicines, and I have seen figures that they are from a half to a quarter of the price that people have to pay in the United States. It makes expensive drugs universally available to everyone in Australia, including the poor who are sick. Its costs have been increasing, of course, but taxpayers have been prepared to fund it, even given what it costs, because people getting sick because they could not afford the drugs would end up costing us a lot more money through the medical system.
What an extraordinary system it is in the United States, with 30 million people not having access to hospitals. Just last week we saw on the FourCorners program the story of an elderly lady in one of the New England states who goes to Canada once or twice a year to buy her suite of drugs because that saves her thousands of dollars, because the Canadians have at least got some moderation of drug prices compared to the rip-off of the pharmaceutical corporations in America—and it is a rip-off. They are making extraordinary profits out of the illness of people. Nobody cavils at the wonder of pharmaceutical science in this age and its ability to cut across illnesses which were once irremediable, but the talk by the Republican senator on the Four Corners program—indicating that Australian prices are too low and should be raised and that Australians, as users of drugs, should have to pay more for what he claimed was the research into and development of drugs—sent a chill down my spine, as I am sure it did with many other viewers.
The pharmaceutical companies in the United States are out to get our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is not about the cost of development; it is about lining their pockets. That is what we are dealing with here today. The Greens, the Democrats and One Nation have already moved amendments in committee which would vouchsafe our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. What those amendments have said in brief is that nothing under this free trade agreement will affect our right, through the system we have, to determine prices and listings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in Australia. And guess what? Labor went across and voted with the government against those amendments. Labor had the opportunity to make absolutely sure and watertight that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would not be undermined by the free trade agreement and then several times last night went across and voted with the Howard government. 
—Get the egg-beater out!
—Senator Conroy, coming in late, can make his claims about egg-beaters, but the froth is with Labor when it comes to a real test here: over they go and vote with the government—and they did it repeatedly. The press gallery has gone into overdrive about this jousting between Mr Latham and Mr Howard over this amendment. I am sure there will be another stack of it today about who caved in—did John Howard undermine or are the Labor Party undermining the free trade agreement? The fact is that this amendment is pathetic. It does not address—
—Are you going to vote for it?
—The answer to that is, yes, because anything—
—Now you sound like John Howard.
—Why?
—It is unnecessary, it is hopeless, but you are going to vote for it.
—Yes, because, Senator Conroy—through you, Madam Temporary Chairman—the Labor Party sold out on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme last night. So the best we can get at this stage are the weak and pathetic—as you described them—amendments from the Labor Party. But even with the weak and pathetic amendments, we had the Prime Minister ringing George W. Bush, as he explained to the nation this morning, and he has not been able to get an answer out of him. Mr Bush has not made up his mind as to whether or not he will accept this amendment. Why won't he? Because the lawyers of the pharmaceutical companies, the big corporations, have not decided whether they will accept this amendment in the Australian parliament. If they do not, the free trade agreement is off.
What an appalling affront to Australian democracy this is. What has happened serially in this debate is that the Labor Party have been supporting the Howard government in removing the ability of this parliament to determine these matters in the interests of the country. Now an amendment is going to be put forward. It has not been moved yet, and they could not move it last night: they were not ready because Prime Minister Howard had not made a determination because President Bush had not made a determination—and he still has not. It just makes you angry that the Labor Party have caved in on so much in this free trade agreement.
Basically, what is frustrating about this debate is that, with a few honourable exceptions in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and a few other outlets, the debate going out to the public is not explaining how we are losing our democracy here. We are losing our right to determine what is or is not good for this country to a new system set up, outside the reach of our courts and our parliament, called a joint committee, with a dozen other subcommittees, with people appointed not by this parliament but by Prime Minister Howard and George W. Bush, who then appoint others. You bet the pharmaceutical companies will have a say on that. You bet the big corporations will have a say on that. And when you get to that arbitration commission, guess what? Can the average Australian take part in the arbitration? No, they can send a letter—that is it; full stop—and if the commission does not want to read their letter, it does not. When it makes a decision about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, intellectual property, cultural amenity or the environment in this country, where is the appeals mechanism? There is not any. We are disempowered. 
Worse still, last night the Labor Party voted against a Democrat sunset clause which would mean this parliament would have to review this in three years time to see how it is going—further disempowering the parliament. Prime Minister Howard got on the airwaves this morning to say that Labor have sought technical amendments to reduce the possibility of the free trade agreement succeeding—and that is what we are about to hear moved now. The Americans could say, `It is inconsistent and will not be acceptable.' Well, isn't that the pits?
The amendment we will be dealing with here will not end here: the Americans will say whether or not it is acceptable. George W. Bush, when he gets the call from the pharmaceutical companies' lawyers, is going to ring John Howard, Prime Minister of this country, and say, `The FTA is off,' if they do not like the amendment we are about to deal with, or, `It's on,' if they can accept it. That is horrendous. Defending the national interest? This Prime Minister is pulling the rug from under it. What is worse, the Leader of the Opposition is tugging with him. It has been left to the crossbench to defend the national interest here—right across the spectrum. Let us hear the Labor amendment.
The Greens will move to amend the amendment to make it less pathetic, Senator Conroy. That is all we can do. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate said a while ago, this is one of the great issues we will deal with in this parliament, but in my book the government and the opposition are pulling the rug from under the right of this parliament, in an elected democracy, to determine what is good for this country on a whole range of matters into the future. We will have this debate many years from now, as the Canadian, Mexican and American interests are doing over NAFTA, on issues which are not determined.
This agreement is determinedly vague. We must leave it to the faceless ayatollah of trade yet to be appointed by the Howard government to determine what gets through and what does not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, on jobs, on manufacturing, on quarantine—on the whole lot of it. It will not be determined by this parliament. The ayatollah of trade will not be answerable to this parliament in a process which is not determined by this parliament and which is out of reach of the Australian people and out of reach of the average American as well. That is what is wrong with this process. Fiddling at the edge by the Labor Party brings the whole thing into doubt, says Prime Minster Howard. It is time Prime Minister Howard got a backbone. It is time Prime Minister Howard respected democracy in this country. It is time Prime Minister Howard recognised that this parliament should run the affairs of this country—not his executive, not his phone line to George W. Bush and certainly not the pharmaceutical corporations in California.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1

When the government announced on 8 February this year that it had concluded negotiations with the United States on the text of a free trade agreement, it made many claims about the potential benefits of the deal for Australia. The minister put out a press release claiming the virtues of the deal. The Australian public were expected to take on trust that this was a great outcome for our country. The minister initially put out a two-page release but the United States released a great deal more information, claiming their victories in negotiations. It was immediately obvious that the two stories did not stack up. Who was telling the truth? What was the Australian public expected to believe?
Release of the text was another month away, and yet the government expected the public, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian parliament to fall in line and support the deal. It was not good enough. The US government was claiming victory on the PBS and audiovisual services, while the Australian government was claiming that these areas were fully protected. The Australian public, this parliament and the Labor Party were expected to support a deal that ultimately ran to more than 1,000 pages, sight unseen. The cabinet ticked off on it, sight unseen. Labor was not prepared to do that.
The FTA has broad-ranging implications for so many areas of Australian public policy. Australia's economic, trade, foreign, health, media, industry, agriculture and quarantine policies are all affected by aspects of the FTA. It extends even further to our intellectual property laws and copyright, customs and telecommunications, investment, financial services, government procurement, and electronic commerce. These are substantial issues requiring careful consideration. They should not have been forced onto the parliament or the Australian public without the opportunity for them to be considered and assessed on their merits. It was up to Labor to establish a mechanism to give the public an opportunity to have its say on the FTA. In the interests of transparency and proper parliamentary processes, Labor established the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America. The committee received over 500 submissions and held public hearings on 13 occasions in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. 
It was through the committee process that the parliament was able to bore down into all of the detail contained in the FTA. Those in business who strongly supported the deal gave evidence on the benefits they believed would arise. Those who had concerns about aspects of the deal gave evidence supporting their arguments. The government's negotiating team sat through many hours of the committee's hearings, providing us all with a greater understanding of how the deal was developed and how it would impact on current public policy. May I take this time to thank the negotiating team for their great cooperation and assistance throughout the FTA inquiry and their willingness to explain in great detail the implications of the deal. Expertly led by Mr Stephen Deady, the Australian officials have worked under enormous pressure over the past 12 months to conclude a deal to fit in with the Prime Minister's timetable, a timetable that was rushed purely for political reasons but a timetable that Australia's officials met through great professionalism and dedication to the task at hand.
Of the many issues raised during the Senate inquiry there were two notable ones of great interest to many Australians. These were in relation to the capacity of future Australian governments to regulate for local content on current and future media mechanisms. In this regard the US claimed:
In the area of broadcasting and audiovisual services, the FTA contains important and unprecedented provisions to improve market access for U.S. films and television programs over a variety of media including cable, satellite, and the Internet.
But Minister Vaile claimed:
Our right to ensure local content in Australian broadcasting and audiovisual services, including in new media formats, is retained.
To address these concerns, Labor said it would only support the FTA if our local content laws were legislated to ensure that any change to these laws could only be agreed to by the parliament. Once again, Labor set the agenda—it set the policy to protect the great Australian way of life—and the government followed. Labor set the policy to protect Australian local content and the government responded by drafting the amendment and filling out the paperwork to enable the Senate to pass the amendment last night. Labor set the policy to protect local culture and to ensure Australian voices continue to be heard and Australian faces continue to be seen on Australian TV. These were Labor demands, and the government followed.
Another key issue raised in the inquiry was the potential impact of the deal on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—a great Australian health scheme established in 1948 by the Chifley government. Chifley amended our Constitution to ensure this program could provide affordable medicines for the health and wellbeing of the Australian community. Labor has always said that it would not support the FTA if it in any way undermined the PBS—that if the FTA in any way undermined community access to cheap, affordable drugs it would be a deal breaker. What did the US say with regard to the outcome on the PBS? The US claimed: 
... Australia will make a number of improvements in its Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) procedures—including establishment of an independent process to review determinations of product listings—that will enhance transparency and accountability in the operation of the PBS.
But Mr Vaile claimed:
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), in particular the price and listing arrangements that ensure Australians' access to quality, affordable medicines, remains intact.
Once again, that was not good enough for the Labor Party. The Australian community was not confident in the government's assurances, medical and academic experts on the PBS were not satisfied with the government's assurances and Labor was not in any way convinced by the government's assurances. We have to be absolutely certain the FTA will not in any way undermine or delay community access to cheap medicines. Labor will not allow cheap drugs to be delayed by dodgy patent claims. Companies trying to pull that stunt face severe financial penalties if a court determines that their claims were initiated without a reasonable basis for believing that their claims would be successful. Labor has moved these amendments on that basis to protect the PBS.
Amendment (1), on claims in good faith, amends the legislation to reduce the burden of proof on the generic company in certifying what is covered by a registered patent. The current legislation is too strict. The bill needs to be qualified to reduce the risk to the generic company making the certification. As amended, the generic company will now be giving a certificate on the basis of good faith and on reasonable grounds. The insertion of the words `valid claim of' is necessary because not all claims in the patent might validly apply to the proposed drug of the generic company.
Amendment (2) requires that if the patent-holding company wants to commence litigation against a generic drug company then it too must fill out a certificate at that same basic standard. This certificate requires the patent-holding company to contest the case in good faith, have a reasonable chance of success and proceed without unreasonable delay. If the certificate filled out by the patent-holding company is false or misleading or an undertaking given under the certificate is broken, the patent-holding company can be penalised by up to $10 million and the court can order compensation to be paid to the Commonwealth, states and territories for losses sustained as a result of the injunction, including any additional costs incurred by the PBS and public hospitals.
The current law requires that a court cannot grant an interlocutory injunction unless the applicant provides an undertaking as to damages. Amendment (3) enhances the entitlement to damages for the generic company and for the Commonwealth, states and territories. If the patent-holding company wants to take injunction proceedings after being notified by the generic company that it is bringing a generic drug onto the market, it will be liable for damages: if the case is discontinued by the patent-holding company, if the case is dismissed and the court determines the patent-holding company did not have reasonable grounds to believe it would succeed in the overall action or to believe that each of its claims was valid, or if the basis of the injunction was vexatious, not reasonably made or unreasonably pursued. The court can award damages to the generic company, including on the basis of the patent-holding company's gross profits on its drug during the period of the injunction. 
Let us be clear: if a court finds that a drug company has got a bodgie patent and has been deliberately keeping generic drugs off the market, the court can order that all profits made by that company on that drug be taken from them. This is a seriously punitive penalty. That is what is necessary to make sure that this practice, prevalent in the US, does not come to Australia. It is not something that the Labor Party wants and it is not something the Australian community wants. This amendment puts in place a serious disincentive for companies to engage in this bodgie practice.
Our final amendment, amendment (4), makes it clear that the legislation will not apply retrospectively. It is encouraging that the Prime Minister indicated earlier this morning that his government supports the amendments. The Prime Minister claims these amendments are unnecessary. He claims that the penalties that could be imposed will deter innovation and impact unfairly on Australian companies. Labor has strong, sound, expert legal advice that these amendments are rock solid. Once again the Prime Minister has created a straw man to obfuscate his failure to protect the PBS. He caved in; we will not.
These amendments are consistent with all of Australia's commitments with regard to the WTO and the free trade agreement. The only person who has changed his position on this issue is the Prime Minister. It was a fascinating press conference this morning. It reminded me of that iconic Australian film The Castle. The fly-by-night solicitor, Dennis Denuto—if you remember that—is stuck in the court in a legal quagmire and he says to the presiding judge: `It's the Constitution; it's Mabo; it's the vibe.' That is what we saw this morning from the Prime Minister. It was not anything to do with the words, the legal advice. He was worried because of the vibe. That is the argument that he put up.
Today John Howard has had a Dennis Denuto moment. Unable to say what was wrong with Labor's amendments, the Prime Minister bumbled and blustered and grasped at straws. He said that the US may object to the text of the enabling legislation. He also said that Labor's amendments were unnecessary. If they are unnecessary, how can they be objectionable? If they are objectionable then Labor is here to tell you that they are necessary. If these statements are true, you have to wonder why the Prime Minister has agreed to these amendments. The truth is that Labor's amendments will protect the PBS. Australians should see the Prime Minister's statements this morning for what they are: creating a straw man and knocking it over, just to cover for the fact that he did not do his job. He did not get a tough enough agreement that protected the PBS. Labor has delivered. Labor has stuck to its position from day one: if the FTA undermined the PBS it was a deal breaker. Today we made sure that we protected the PBS.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—Labor has always been deeply divided over this free trade agreement. In actual fact, it is deeply divided over the issue of bilateral agreements per se. I can remember, when Labor was last in government, there were suggestions that it might be possible to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States or it might be possible to, in some way, be part of what were then the NAFTA negotiations to put an Australian perspective and get opportunities for larger markets. The mere concept was condemned by Labor. I can remember Mr Keating in particular, as the Labor Prime Minister, condemning it and arguing for multilateral trade instead. Then, of course, we had trade minister Senator Cook, who maintained that position in subsequent years. 
When Labor went into opposition, through the Senate committees and within this chamber its constant line was that bilateral agreements are evil and that the only way to seek broader trade opportunity is through the multilateral round. This government always had a different philosophical approach. It said that we have a responsibility to facilitate the growing of the Australian economy. Apart from getting the domestic fundamentals right—which was another area that Labor got so fundamentally wrong when it was in government; it made it impossible for Australia to export competitively because of domestic interest rates and inflation rates—this government also should take whatever opportunities present to broaden the market opportunity. It was legitimate to do that through bilateral and multilateral negotiations and it was not a matter of either/or.
Then, of course, as time went by Labor saw the Howard government successfully negotiate a bilateral agreement with significant benefits for Australia with Singapore and another with Thailand. It saw Australia exploring with other countries—China and a number of Middle Eastern countries—the potential for bilateral agreements and, to Labor's astonishment, it then saw ASEAN approach the Australian government to talk about the prospects of a trade agreement between ASEAN and Australia. Labor, in effect, got left totally behind and where it now stands philosophically on these issues is very difficult to read. Having lost the philosophical debate, Labor has sought to gain whatever short-term political benefit it could out of the detail of the bilateral agreements that have been negotiated by the Howard government.
This agreement, which has been negotiated with the United States of America, is, of course, the big one, because the US is by far the largest economy in the world and offers by far the largest market opportunity for a whole range of Australian products and services. Therefore, it becomes the primary focus of the Labor Party. It is also a primary focus under Mr Latham, I would suggest, because of the anti-American stance he has taken on other matters, particularly in relation to national security. If you bag the President of the United States on national security matters, it will be very difficult to endorse him on bilateral trade matters.
But anyway, for its own domestic political purposes, it always had a prejudice against a bilateral agreement with the United States no matter what benefit that agreement might provide for Australia—no matter that it might provide a benefit of an extra 30,000 Australian jobs. I guess that is not surprising, because Labor is the party that lifted unemployment in this country to one million. By contrast, the Howard government has reduced unemployment to the lowest levels in the last 20 or 30 years.
—This is humiliating.
—I am not surprised that Senator Carr is disturbed about our successes in reducing unemployment. We on this side of the chamber are proud of the fact that we have reduced unemployment by so much that we have been able to create another 1.3 million jobs, and we want to create more. We want all Australians to benefit. We want them to have the opportunity of employment. We want the Australian economy to grow. We will keep concentrating on the fundamentals that allow Australian exporters to be competitive and we will keep working on ways in which we can grow the Australian market opportunity. We do not mind whether it is with the United States or whether it is with some other party. We do not mind whether it is done multilaterally. Where we can get in and negotiate a benefit for Australia in terms of market access then we will do so. We have done so on this occasion in this agreement. That is why this agreement is so important for Australia and that is why it is so important for the Howard government. We are not going to easily forgo this unprecedented opportunity for market expansion. The opportunities offered to Australia—simply to get into the United States government procurement sector at both the federal and state level, for example—are enormous. We are not going to easily give away that opportunity. 
Turning to the current debate, Labor have been prejudiced against a negotiation with the United States from the very first day and against this agreement in principle. What happened then? As time went by, more Australians started to realise that this agreement could, in fact, bring real benefits for our country. Yes, there is probably a certain amount of trust in Mr Howard on that. Why is there trust? Because his management of the Australian economy has been so successful. It is very difficult, even for Labor, to argue to the contrary when you look at the great economic successes of this country in the last 8½ years. Senator Carr might fold his arms, but that is the reality. If you read the international journals and look at what has been said by the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD and other authorities—and I invite Labor senators to go back and look at the OECD reports on Australia of recent years—you see that they all applaud the economic management of the Howard government and they all applaud the incredible economic successes of the last 8½ years. 
Is it surprising that the Australian people have faith in Mr Howard and his leadership in taking them towards further economic benefits? No, it is not surprising at all, but it is embarrassing for the Labor Party. As the Australian people came to realise that this agreement with the United States could offer such tremendous opportunities for Australia, Labor domestically started again to be squeezed. The position became that perhaps they should not oppose the agreement in principle; perhaps they should search for a detail upon which they could distinguish their position—look for a fine detail or two on which they could go out and say, `Okay, we are no longer opposed to the agreement, but we are opposed to certain details.'
As I have said in the last three days in this place, the government were never prepared to negotiate an agreement with the US on any terms. There were always a number of no-go areas. We wanted the expanded trade opportunities, but there are aspects of our society and of our system that we are not prepared to sacrifice. Of course the US went into the negotiations on the same basis. There has to be give and take to get the extended trade benefits, but there were no-go areas. Those no-go areas for us included areas in the cultural sector and in the PBS. We are strong supporters of the PBS system. We have put an enormous amount of extra government money into the PBS system to ensure that it continues to work within contemporary Australia, particularly as new medicines and more expensive medicines become available. It is a critically important safeguard for the Australian community. We respect that and we support that. So this negotiation included a no-go area in relation to the PBS.
The Labor Party, however, whilst having to acknowledge that politically they had no choice but to support the agreement, decided that they would develop an argument that, in some way, the PBS was not adequately protected by this agreement. So we had Mr Latham and Senator Conroy coming out last week and focusing on the American system of patent registration and using the American experience to say that, in some way, there could be spurious patent claims within Australia that would threaten generics. Our position is that the Australian government supports the generic industry. Generic medicines play a significant part in keeping the prices of the whole system down in this country. We recognise that. 
We also recognise, although the Labor Party are not prepared to acknowledge it, that the major pharmaceutical companies that invest enormous amounts in new medicines also have an important part to play. They have a right to reasonable protection. But a line has to be drawn that does not provide a disincentive for the generics. You have to get the best of both sides. The PBS system has given the best of both sides. Labor came in and, using the American patent experience rather than the Australian patent experience, argued that in some way there could be spurious—or, to use Mr Latham's language, bodgie—claims which would mean that generics would be threatened.
In the negotiation of this agreement, one of the principal concerns we had was to ensure that the generic industry and growth within the generic industry—because there has been significant growth in recent years and significant growth in the number of generic products that are on the PBS—did not suffer any disincentive as a result of this agreement. It was something about which we negotiated hard and which Mr Vaile negotiated successfully. Yet Mr Latham, rather than using the example of the Australian patent system, picked up deficiencies in the American patent system and said to the Australian people, `There is a flaw in what the government has negotiated.' Of course, what we have learnt in the last week is that he has had to come to realise that the Australian patent system actually works well; it protects against abuses. He has had to realise that spurious claims will not work, and that the application of the patent system in Australia is not a threat to generic medicines. So, having recognised that—and it took a week for him and Senator Conroy to recognise it—they were forced to move to another area of argument. The area they chose was injunctions, and they have brought forward amendments to put heavy penalties upon injunctions.
The position is, as I said, that generics are protected within the agreement; it was an important part of our negotiation. We argue that these amendments are unnecessary. We argue that they are also risky because it may be put—and there has been some suggestion of this—that they are inconsistent with the agreement. But the Labor Party does not care if that risk is taken because half the Labor Party wants the FTA to fail. We will agree to the amendments because of all the benefits—
—Finally, he announces it! After 14½ minutes he finally coughs.
—No, because of all the benefits that flow from the FTA. And if we do not agree to the amendments, we lose the opportunity for another 30,000 Australian jobs. But why, for a political stunt—which is what the Labor Party is up to in this exercise—would they even contemplate the chance of another 30,000 Australian jobs at risk? It is very difficult to comprehend. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—On behalf of the Australian Democrats I want to outline our response to this issue. It is quite extraordinary that Senator Conroy could come in here and make such a pathetic argument for why the Labor Party have gone down the path they have. They have lost sight of the big picture on the free trade agreement, when in many respects it presented Australia with a unique opportunity to carve out those things that are relevant to the national interest, particularly social policy as it relates to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme but also, just as importantly, on questions of cultural and environmental policy.  
I heard the minister giving the government response to the opposition's amendments this morning and I agree with him in one sense. What he was saying was they are not needed in the first instance, because the free trade agreement is not really being altered to any great extent. So what we have got here is bodgie and dodgy getting together to give us a sweet FTA. The reality that Senator Conroy ought to understand is that all he has done is give us a sugar pill; it is a placebo. It does not give us any real answers for protecting the PBS in this country. If the Labor Party in opposition are serious about this then they should vote against the free trade agreement. They should have been seeking that the PBS be removed from the free trade agreement right from the very start.
From looking at the particular amendments that have been put forward, I think that Senator Conroy well understands that all he is seeking to do is affirm what already exists in Australian law. In particular, the first two amendments simply codify what is already dealt with and what is standard practice, as I understand it, in the Federal Court. I note that at the media launch Mr Latham and Senator Conroy said they were going to release some legal advice. I still have not seen the legal advice being tabled in public. I do not know whether it has been circulated in this chamber. The reality though is that it is quite easy to get any lawyer to give the client an opinion letter that suits the reasonable prospect of success—in other words, you can get what you want. But proving bad faith will require strong evidence, and well-advised clients will not leave any trail of bad faith. I would predict that no major pharmaceutical company will ever pay under this amendment, most of all because it does not achieve what Senator Conroy on behalf of the opposition says it will. It simply is not going to, and it is fanciful to suggest that the cost of medicines in this country will not increase.
The reality is that, in focusing on one or two things, they have lost sight of the bigger picture on the implications of the free trade agreement in respect of allowing US multinational pharmaceutical companies to be able to have a say in social policy in this country. The free trade agreement, through the various clauses that allow consultation processes to be triggered, allows the US government and more particularly US corporations to have a greater say in Australian policy. This is at the heart of the issue. These are the things the Labor Party ought to have been standing up for. 
Senator Conroy trumpets the success of the opposition amendments that have been put forward. I think it is important to remind ourselves that Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is world's best practice. It is one that is the envy of many other countries who would like to replicate it. US pharmaceutical companies of course have attacked it consistently—especially their Australian subsidiaries—because it delivers some of the lowest patented drug prices in the developed world. This has been affirmed by the Productivity Commission, who say that the cost of our drugs is three to four times lower than drug prices in the United States. We do this through a system of pharmo-economic analysis and reference pricing that determines the benefits of new drugs and their national bargaining power. So it is not surprising that the pharmaceutical industry, both here and in the United States, has been calling for changes to the free trade agreement that would strengthen their capacity as part of their industry to increase drug prices themselves.
These are the things that need to be kept in mind. Why, under the free trade agreement, have we accepted another process of review for what is on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme list? If we have a system that already works—and the government know that—why should we allow the Americans to have a second choice? Isn't that just a clause that would allow US corporations to put their foot in the door and force a deal on the question of higher priced drugs entering the Australian marketplace? Wouldn't it force drug prices up both for the PBS system and, inevitably, for Australian consumers? 
Senator Conroy also spoke about the $10 million fines that the opposition are proposing. That is pretty laughable. Those fines are loose change when you consider the size of US pharmaceutical companies and the amount of money that is being spent in the United States. Those pharmaceutical companies represent the most profitable and influential industry in the United States—and they have been that way for the past 10 years. In 2003 and 2004 it was reported that the industry spent $US150 million to influence public policy. That is the trend for US pharmaceutical corporations. That is what they already do. Why do the opposition fancifully think that these corporations are all of a sudden going to change their ways and not try to influence health policy in this country?
There are 675 pharmaceutical lobbyists in Washington alone. They spend their time going in and out of congress trying to influence policy. In 1999-2000, during the US election cycle, the pharmaceutical industry spent $20 million on campaign contributions, of which $15 million was provided to the Republican Party. In October 2003 it was reported that President Bush told Prime Minister Howard that raising Australian prices for US pharmaceuticals was important to ensure that consumers in all countries—not just the United States—paid for the high research and development costs. This is telling about what the opposition have come to accept. There is an illusion that they are going to keep the cost of medicines down; the reality, of course, is otherwise. 
It is also galling that during this debate we heard, one after the other, Labor Party senators come into the chamber to talk about how bad this deal is, yet today they arrive to sanction the enabling legislation for the free trade agreement. I remind the chamber again that the House of Representatives did not ever get to debate the free trade agreement or even the enabling legislation. The legislation was just passed through to the Senate. What did we get? We got the enabling legislation but we did not get to debate the free trade agreement because the guys over there in blue carpet land—the executive of government—decided what the free trade agreement would be. They signed off on it and sent us the enabling legislation—and we were expected to rubber stamp it.
—You can vote against it.
—Don't worry, we will be voting against it. Thank you for that interjection because it highlights the contradictions here. Senator Boswell ought to be defending the rights of the sugar industry instead of just paying them compensation. Labor senator after Labor senator came in here and talked about how bad this deal was. Senator O'Brien said:
... this government acted unilaterally and pursued a free trade deal which was more to do with politics than with free trade and with what we describe as an unrealistic negotiating time frame imposed on us by the US electoral cycle ...
Senator Conroy said: 
Expert evidence from the departmental officials who negotiated this deal—some of them are in the chamber today—was quite clear: there was absolutely no imperative for this to be signed or rushed. It was quite clear. We could wait until 31 December to vote this bill into legislation and make a decision to support it.  
That is laughable because yesterday we changed the hours and routine of business in order to facilitate an expeditious way of dealing with the enabling legislation. We got to the eleventh hour last night and the opposition were not even able to put forward their amendments that were on the running sheet. Why? Because they had not reached any agreement with the government—or, presumably, they were waiting for the sun to come up in Washington so that President Bush could say that it was okay. It is quite laughable to think about that because the Labor Party are talking about being able to wait until 31 December, and this agreement does not come into being until 1 January, so you have to wonder why it is being rushed and why the opposition would support that. Senator Kirk said: 
But the facts of the matter are that this government has failed to negotiate the best deal possible for Australia and in a couple of areas there are serious flaws. The government no doubt could have achieved a better deal for Australia if it had pushed harder at the negotiating table, especially on behalf of our farmers. 
I am sure that Senator Boswell would agree with that. Senator Kirk continued: 
The government sold out many important Australian industries that were counting on the Prime Minister and his government to look after their interests. This free trade agreement has been incompetently negotiated. 
That is pretty much at the heart of the matter. The Labor Party know that of the 42 grounds for qualification on the free trade agreement, they have chosen to make two amendments. They have neglected the other 40 and said, `When we're in government we'll look at those things.' As I said to Senator Conroy yesterday, `If you can look into that crystal ball, tell me what mechanism you are going to use in six months, eight months or a year's time when you are in office, to trigger a process to renegotiate the free trade agreement.' That is all rhetoric because the decisions—and the drawing of a line in the sand—have to be taken now. The opposition will not be able to renegotiate the free trade agreement. If they do renegotiate it they will just be dealing with some of the window dressing on the edges while the substance will remain the same.
People ought to be reminded that the free trade agreement effectively removes the parliament from being able to deal with social and public policy in this country particularly as it deals with health, the environment and culture. That is the reality and in effect it is done to the exclusion of the Australian people. In the case of the PBS we would have thought that the Australian public would have been permitted a greater say in what happened to the PBS. Instead, we have been given assurances from the government and have had to rely upon them. As for the opposition—if you can call them that—it would have been an opportunity for them to represent the interests of Australian people. That is what it comes down to.
We will not be supporting the amendments that are put forward by the Labor Party because the free trade agreement is fundamentally flawed. It is not a free trade agreement and I do not believe that anyone can say that it is a fair trade agreement. I note the flagging of amendments that are going to be put forward by the Greens. We certainly will not be supporting those either, because the reality is that no matter how much you tinker around the edges to try to even marginally move it ahead, those things in and of themselves, without looking at the bigger picture of the free trade agreement, will simply not fix the problem that the government have put before us and which the opposition are prepared to accept. Quite frankly, it is a shameful day when the opposition have been prepared to do this. I would hope that they are able to give some explanation on the issues that I have raised and how they see themselves distinguished from the government. All I see at the moment are smoke and mirrors in terms of what they are saying about the cost of medicines in this country not increasing. The cost of medicines will increase. Everyone knows that. Everyone out there has got that gut feeling; you can go with it yourself. Nothing is going to change as a result of these amendments. 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Before I call Senator Boswell, I advise Senator Ridgeway that the memorandum of advice that he alluded to at the beginning of his contribution was tabled in the Senate on the evening of 9 August, last Monday, and can be found in the Journals of the Senate, No. 58, on page 3,850.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I have been seeking the call for some time. It is quite apparent that you find it difficult to look to this side of the chamber. I suggest that it would be more appropriate if you were able to look to this side of the chamber. If the opposition has been discriminated against in this matter, can you give us an explanation?
—There is no discrimination, Senator Carr, and I am not disposed to accept that criticism. The rules of debate in the Senate are that the call goes from one side of the chamber to the other.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2004-08-12,"—I have listened to this debate. In fact I have spent many hours listening to it and many hours in a Senate committee where we went through all these issues like the PBS very thoroughly. I want to say that no-one appreciates the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme more than I do as a way of giving relatively cheap medicines and equalising the ability for the less well-heeled to have the same medicines as the well-heeled. There is a bipartisan view of that across both sides of the chamber. No-one with any political brains, with any sense, would interfere with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is the Holy Grail of Australian politics. 
That is why I went to extraordinary lengths with Mr Deady to have him explain that there was going to be absolutely no chance that there could ever be any influence exerted from America, from any drug company in America or from anywhere else on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. If anyone wants to go back and examine Hansard they will find his explanations to committee. So I have no fear of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme being influenced by any people other than ourselves. There is a committee set up that makes the decisions, and that particular committee will be unable to be influenced by any other process. That is why I am confident that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is quarantined. It cannot be interfered with and will not be interfered with; and anyone that does interfere with it, woe betide them. Any political party that makes a decision allowing that to happen will not be welcomed by the Australian public. That is why I have no fears about this. I listened to the evidence and I am quite capable of understanding the explanations that were given to the committee—the committee that you were on, Senator Ridgeway—and so I am confident in that area.
This has been a fascinating debate for those who are students of politics. It is where the Left meets the Right. I have always said that politics is a circle, and if you go around the Left will meet the Right. You have got an amalgam of the League of Rights and every other lunatic fringe group, and Senator Harris, agreeing wholeheartedly with the Left of the parliament. It is quite extraordinary. You have got the two extremes—the ultimate extreme to the Right, which is totally unacceptable to Australians, and the ultimate Left—coming together in unanimous agreement. It makes a very interesting study.  
We have the opportunity to access an open market of 300 million people. When I was a salesman and I had my own manufacturer's agency business, the difference between what I sold in Queensland and what was sold in New South Wales was always extraordinary, because New South Wales had a much bigger population. But now we are getting access to a market of 300 million people, and that must increase jobs. The prospect of another 30,000 jobs should excite everyone in this parliament. We should be saying to people that 30,000 jobs are coming onto the market assisted by this free trade agreement.
But what do we have? We have all the obstructions by the Labor Party. They knew they would vote for this, but they were looking for a fig leaf to cover themselves with so they came up with a couple of spurious amendments. We will accept the amendments in the interests of providing another 30,000 jobs and access to 300 million people.
A friend of mine, a woodcarver by trade, is into astronomy. He made himself a little dome so that he could study the stars. He put it in an American magazine and he has been inundated with orders from people in America who are interested in astronomy. He produced a good product, a better product than anywhere else in the world, and he has developed his own business providing America with astronomy domes. That is just one tiny little, minute, aspect of the free trade agreement that I know of that I can personally point to. This friend of mine was a woodcarver—it is a bit like being an arrowsmith: there is not a large demand for arrows or woodcarving—but he had the ability to work with his hands and he developed a market that has taken off in America. As a matter of fact, he was promoted somewhat in the Australian Weekend Magazine about eight or nine months ago. He cannot meet the demand; he cannot get enough workers where he is, in a small country town. That is just a tiny little aspect of it—one person developing a market in America that employs three or four people on the north coast of Queensland. We will now get access to that market of 300 million people, and I am sure there are going to be many more small businesses developed when they can ascertain what is required in America.
Our dollar is always going to be under the American dollar. On my side of politics—the National Party—we always like to see a particularly low dollar because it assists the farmers. Even if it is not terribly low, it is always going to be lower than the American dollar, and that gives us special entry into the American market. We in the National Party have been criticised for not standing up for farmers on this free trade agreement, but it would be an absolute betrayal of every farmer in Australia if we did not enthusiastically endorse this free trade agreement. Yes, the sugar industry did miss out. But let me say this about the sugar industry: they issued a press release and said, `We are not dogs in the manger; if the sugar isn't in it, we're not going to veto it, because it is better for all the other agricultural industries.'
—`Just pay us half a billion': it is openly public bribing!
—Why do you hate the sugar industry on that side of politics? Why are you always against the farmers? We assisted the sugar industry. I was one of the people who actually went in there and asked the Prime Minister. I encouraged him to go out and meet the sugar industry, which he did, and he was very well accepted there. So do not come in here, Senator Carr, and say that the National Party have walked away. We stuck with the sugar industry. 
The fishing industry, for one, think they have won the lottery. They get a 35 per cent removal of tariffs. The free trade agreement is worth $4,500 to every dairy farmer in Australia because it gives access for cheese and milk powders and many by-products that have not been able to access the market. The cattle industry immediately lose a 4.4c a kilogram tariff, and in two years time they pick up another $15 million. Bear in mind that they have only once been able to meet the quota and they will not be able to meet the American quota this year. In 10 and 15 years time that goes up to around $260 million. Why would I come in here and rubbish the free trade agreement? It is the greatest thing since sliced bread for the farming community, and I would brutally betray them if I walked away from it.
There is a big scream that we will lose the single desk, but we have not lost the single desk and we are not going to lose the single desk because our negotiators negotiated that the single desk stays. It stays on sugar, it stays on wheat, it stays on rice and it stays on barley. We have had a win-win on this.
—So what's your view on drugs? That's what this amendment is about.
—You ask me my view on drugs. My view is: this amendment is not necessary. It is a fig leaf for the Labor Party. That is all it is. It is not necessary.
—Senator Carr just doesn't like the fact that he was rolled by Senator Conroy.
—What this debate is all about is the Left being absolutely rolled. They were not only rolled on marriage; they got rolled on the free trade agreement. They stand in here and say they are standing up for their constituents. They have been comprehensively rolled every time. I do not know how you can go back and face your Lefties in Melbourne, Senator Carr, because you must say: `We are pretty useless but just give us another go; we'll try, we'll do something. We don't kick too many goals for you but we keep the Right honest; we don't let 'em go too far. We have been comprehensively rolled on all social issues and all economic issues.'
—Not known as the doormats for nothing!
—`Yes, we're the doormats for the Right. They walk all over the top of us, but we won't let the Right go too far on this one. We'll pull 'em back into line next time.' This is a great day for Australia. It is a great day for rural Australia and a great day for small business. I am very glad that we have been able to negotiate this opening to the biggest market in the world. I am excited about it. I think it is going to produce huge amounts of revenue for small business. I gave you the illustration of my friend up in Queensland who has one tiny slice of a very minute market, employing three or four people when he can get them—because it is pretty hard to get anyone; we have full employment in Australia for most people who want to work. This is where the Left meets the Right. The Left of the Labor Party meets the extreme Right of Australian politics—the League of Rights, the LaRoucheans and the whole lot who band together under One Nation—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—No, the National Party do not go down there. They are all happily singing from the one hymn sheet—the League of Rights, the Democrats, the Greens and the Left all together, all one big happy family. Hooray for the Liberal and National parties for producing this tremendous economic advantage! I congratulate the Prime Minister and my colleague Mr Vaile for producing such a great result for rural Australia and for Australia generally. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak to the amendments—and I do actually want to speak to the amendments. What we have heard today is a rerun of second reading debate speeches. We have heard from the doormat party of this government, the National Party, a proposition about the great benefits of these arrangements. What the National Party fails to point out is that our biggest trade deficit is with the United States. Nothing in this agreement is going to change that proposition. I want to talk about what is actually before us: the four amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act which have been proposed by the Labor Party. They are important, tough amendments which, I note, the government is now obliged to support. We heard 14½ minutes from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and it took 14½ minutes to say, `We support these amendments.'
This is after the humiliating press conference by the Prime Minister this morning when he revealed that he had to ring up the United States in a grovelling manner and ask for permission to support these amendments. The United States is not certain, so the Prime Minister is not certain. He quivers. The doddering position he takes is based on a dithering attitude because he has not got his instructions right. He has not got permission, so he is worried—`What will I do? I do not know whether or not the United States will accept my word on this.' How pathetic! How miserable! The Prime Minister of Australia has to ring up and get permission to support Senate amendments to this arrangement. This demonstrates the value of these amendments and points out their necessity. If the government has to get permission to support the amendments, it is quite clear why they are necessary. These are tough amendments. These four amendments are necessary to ensure the protection of the PBS. You cannot rely on the government to do that. It has to get permission—to find out whether or not it is allowed to support the PBS. How incredible that the national government of Australia should humiliate itself in that way.
With these amendments we propose a requirement that companies holding a patent make sure that they issue a certificate when they seek to use the courts to block a generic drug from coming onto the market. This will ensure that companies certify that their intended action is in good faith and that they believe the action has a reasonable chance of success. Here we are proposing a clear signal to the companies that evergreening or vexatious patent applications will not be tolerated in Australia. Yet the Prime Minister has to get permission; he has to ask whether or not he is allowed to support these amendments. We are saying that a certificate has to be issued and that, if the certificate is later found to be misleading or the undertakings are broken, the company will be liable to a civil penalty of up to $10 million.
Further action will be taken to give the courts the power to order that compensation be paid to the Commonwealth and the states and territories if such undertakings are not presented in good faith. This compensation will take into account losses sustained as a result of any injunction obtained by the patent company. That gives the lie to the claim that these are weak amendments. They are actually very tough amendments. They are legitimate amendments and they are necessary. This second amendment means that if a generic medicine is held up from being listed on the PBS the subsequent cost to the taxpayer can be recouped. The third amendment is a minor one which is necessary to reduce the burden of proof on generic companies issuing a certificate regarding the patent status of a drug. This will mean that the burden of proof for certificates will move from absolute to reasonable grounds. 
These amendments are necessary. I repeat: the fact that the Prime Minister has to ring up and get permission highlights why it is necessary to ensure that these measures are taken to protect the PBS. The amendments make sure that safeguards are imposed on these matters in the Therapeutic Goods Act to give a level of comfort to all Australians. The subtle changes to the PBS through the free trade agreement are matters of great concern. We all know that there are reasons why drug companies and the US negotiators wanted to modify the regime in the free trade agreement. Patent holders want notice of when generic manufacturers are going to manufacture a drug. It stands to reason that they probably want the notice so that they can take steps to avert the manufacture of generic alternatives. Of course they want to avoid losing profits. You would expect that to be how things work. It is therefore necessary to ensure that protections are built into the legislation to prevent the practice of evergreening.
We all understand that evergreening is effectively a mechanism of litigious activity employed to delay the introduction of generic drugs. Evergreening will increase the cost of the PBS. It is accepted practice in the United States and it cannot become accepted practice in this country. These amendments are important because they will protect the taxpayer. They will ensure that our PBS and our health system remain affordable and sustainable. Let us think about just two examples of drugs coming off patent in the next four years—statins, which treat cholesterol problems; and serotonins, which are antidepressive medications. I am advised that the estimated savings for those two drugs alone are $900 million. It strikes me that in those circumstances it is absolutely critical that these measures be undertaken.
These amendments are important for the generic medicines industry in Australia. Our generic medicines industry comprises six large manufacturing companies. Together they employ 1,500 Australians. These companies undertake significant research and development, they enjoy sustainable growth in Australia and they are increasingly able to develop export markets. The government's own action agenda on pharmaceuticals states that generic medicines have saved Australian taxpayers $850 million since 1995 by reducing the benchmark price of medicines. We want to see the generic industry grow. We want to ensure that their work is not hampered by costly court actions, that they employ Australians, that they manufacture drugs in this country and that they provide drugs at a cheaper rate, which of course forces down the prices and protects the PBS.
I also want to take this opportunity to highlight why the pharmaceuticals industry in this country is particularly important, from the research elements right through to the production elements. The industry has a strong scientific, statistical and clinical research base. The industry spends $450 million a year on research and development and has a turnover of $12 billion per annum. It is our second largest exporter after the automotive industry. It employs 30,000 people across the value chain—and that of course includes the generic manufacturers. I believe that we have to stimulate partnerships across the value chain to build on this very substantial industrial base. Labor's amendments will in no way impede the development of the whole industry. They are about safeguards.
—You're a bit worried.
—They are about ensuring that our patent laws are not in fact weakened.
—There's a little bit of nervousness coming through now. 
—They are, of course, consistent with the agreement that has been negotiated with the United States.
—You think you might have gone too far.
—Senator Hill seems quite animated about these matters. I ask him: where has his colleague the minister for industry been on these matters? The Australia-US free trade agreement has enormous implications for Australian industry, yet not one piece of formal advice was prepared by the industry department. There was no analysis or understanding of what the implications of this agreement are for manufacturing in this country. There was no work done on those questions. We have had a few little home truths from Senator Boswell about pencil-sharpeners and various other things. We are talking about a very serious question in terms of our trade relations with the United States, and the industry department do not think it is worthy of their consideration or any detailed analysis. What we have got are back-of-the-envelope calculations undertaken by the government's favourite modellers, which of course produced ridiculous, laughable estimates of what consequences there are.
Intellectual property is squarely within the portfolio responsibility of the minister for industry. What has he said on these matters? Nothing. The policy that assists to strengthen and grow the generic medicines industry is essential for the creation of jobs and the development of wealth in this country. What has the minister said about these things? Nothing. He is missing in action. This is a government that signs up to a deal sight unseen. We have no analysis being undertaken by the industry department and no real interest in the consequences—that is the only measure you can draw from the public statements that have been made.
It is essential that all Australians do have access to medicines. It is equally important that we have a viable pharmaceutical industry in this country. It is extremely important that generic alternatives provide both cheaper drugs and employment opportunities for Australians. I urge the government to understand how important these things are and not continue with this quivering, dotty approach we have seen from the Prime Minister, who is so uncertain and so lacking in leadership when it comes to these matters that he has to ring up and get permission. I think the government ought to understand how critical these questions are and full-heartedly support these matters. So far they have failed to do that, because they are really quite worried that the permission from their great powerful friends, the United States, will not come forward. It is a tragedy and it is pathetic that the government find it necessary to behave in this way.
There is an opportunity here to actually support the generic medicines industry in Australia. Labor support the pharmaceuticals industry, from research right through to production, and we want to see it grow and prosper. We want to make sure production in this country is protected. That is why I urge the Senate to support this. Despite the awkwardness and the nervousness of the Prime Minister and the government, reflected here by Senator Hill today, I think it is important that we appreciate that this is an opportunity to strengthen the PBS and to defend Australian interests, not the American drug companies' interests.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—We have had two Labor speakers try to justify what they are doing. The Labor Party in this public debate claim these amendments seek to protect our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is undermined by this US-Australia free trade agreement in a raft of different ways. The Labor amendment deals with one component of one of the areas in which the PBS is undermined by the free trade agreement. It is not a fix-all; it is not an opportunity to take it off the table. Right from the outset the Greens—and the Labor Party, too, in the Senate inquiry I was part of—called for the PBS to be exempt from the negotiations, to be completely removed from the negotiations. That has not happened, and the Labor Party no longer support removing the PBS from the free trade agreement. 
The PBS is going to be undermined, and not only by this issue of evergreening, which is occurring in Australia and proliferating in the United States. Evergreening happens when brand name manufacturers of pharmaceuticals take out exorbitant and spurious patents to stop generic manufacturers from being able to get their products onto the market. That is one of the ways the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be undermined through this free trade agreement.
There are two other main areas in which this free trade agreement will undermine our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The agree-ment will bring in a review mechanism under which US pharmaceutical companies can appeal decisions that our Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has made about the cost-effectiveness and medical  effectiveness of a drug before it chooses to list it on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The United States have made it quite clear, both through the members of congress and the pharmaceuticals industry, that they consider this to be an appeals mechanism. It is a mechanism that this government looked at in 2000. Senator Grant Tambling looked at this issue and recommended that the government not introduce a review mechanism as is proposed in this trade agreement. The government took that advice from its own senator at the time and rejected the proposal. What has changed for the government now that, all of a sudden when the request is coming from George W. Bush and the US pharmaceutical companies, they are prepared to accept a review mechanism they rejected on their own advice four years ago?
The other area in which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is impacted on and undermined by this free trade agreement is the setting up of a medicines working group that explicitly has, in its terms of reference, providing opportunities for US pharmaceutical companies to get more revenue for their innovation, research and development. That is what the United States have been trying to do through their negotiating. They have made that quite clear from the outset. The Australian government has known about that. The Australian government was aware of documents printed in the Australian in December last year marked `Australian confidential information: to be treated as US confidential information' in which the pharmaceuticals industry and the US negotiators made it quite clear that they sought to use intellectual property issues as a backdoor route for dealing with and undermining the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That has been clear from the outset and has been put on the record by the Americans. The Australian government and the Australian negotiators have known of that and ignored it. They have allowed the United States to continue putting in all of these extra parliamentary committees and processes in which pharmaceutical industries can have their concerns heard over and above our own determination about what is in our public health interests and what is in the interests of Australians in being able to get affordable and effective medicines. The Australian government has ignored those and has signed on to a deal that we will see undermining our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 
The Labor Party have said: `Oh, no, that is an issue. We are supposed to be a party that stands up for public health and for our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, regardless of the fact that we just increased the price of essential medicines in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme the last time we were here in the Senate debating this particular issue. But, because we have got to try to maintain that perception within the community, let's come up with some fiddly little amendment that makes minor changes which we can portray as being a great win for the Labor Party in standing up for public health.' That is not good enough. That is not fooling anyone. That does not convince us.
If the Labor Party were genuine about wanting to protect public health, they would have continued with the commitment they made last year to exempt the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from the US-Australia free trade agreement negotiations—full stop, from the start, take it off the negotiating table and don't put it in the trade negotiations. Over the last few days there have been several opportunities for the Labor Party to continue with that position through amendments that have been put up by the Greens, the Democrats and One Nation about these issues to say: `Let's take it off the table. Let's make sure it is not undermined.' But that is not the approach that the Labor Party have taken. That is not the path that they have gone down. They have said: `We want to have this trade agreement. We do not want a government to wedge us on this issue, so we will sign up and let's see if we can run a public relations campaign which tries to convince a few people that we really care about these issues.' Well, that is not convincing the people who know about these issues.
Let us have a look at some of the comments that experts in this area have made about the effectiveness of the amendments that the Labor Party are proposing. Professor Peter Drahos is one of them. He is an intellectual property law expert at the Australian National University. He said on Tuesday:
... these rules are not attacking the actual ability of the company to get a patent in the Patent Office, but simply placing restrictions on what they can do once they have them.
So they are not actually stopping the process of evergreening from occurring, a process we are already seeing occur in Australia, but simply putting in place penalties that may deter some companies from being involved in this. But they are not about stopping the process of evergreening that is occurring in Australia and is proliferating in the United States. Over the last few days the government's and the opposition's lawyers have been arguing about the effectiveness of the amendments that are being put forward. What we will see from the amendments that are being proposed is that more lawyers will have the same debates that the government's and opposition's lawyers have been having over the last few days. More lawyers will be having debates about what is good faith and how good faith is defined. This is a real opportunity for the large-scale manufacturers—the brand name manufacturers of pharmaceuticals—to get their way. On Monday, in an interview with the ABC, Peter Drahos said:
... lawyers will argue over the meaning of words like good faith and what is the reasonable prospect of success ... complexity ... is the friend of the large pharmaceutical company.
Complexity is not the friend of the generic manufacturers trying to get their products into the marketplace. Peter Drahos was asked on TheLawReport on Tuesday:
In your view, if these amendments are passed, will they prevent evergreening?
He answered `no'. He described the situation in these terms: 
[In] eliminating ever-greening patents you need a system of weed control. All Labor have is like a hoe. You know, you are being asked to tackle a field of weeds with a hoe. You ... need a system of weed control to do the job.
Kevin Outterson, who is Associate Professor of Law at West Virginia University in the United States, was shown prominently on last week's FourCorners program talking about these issues. His comments in the media this week about the Labor amendments were:
... it's too easy for a law firm to give an opinion to a pharmaceutical company—`Yes, there is some reasonable prospect that your patent to be upheld'. That could be a one in ten chance, or a one in five chance. It won't take much for a law firm to be able to give that ... opinion.
He was asked by a reporter on an ABC program:
You have a reasonably good understanding of the way so-called big pharma works. How do you think it would be reacting to these amendments here in Australia?
He replied:
I think they would find this to be something they could live with. I think they probably would fear something that was more stringent.
We have a similar law in the United States—
and he described the provision in the Therapeutic Goods Act, and then added:
and we have a similar provision—
which is called the Hatch-Waxman Act—
in the United States, and for a decade our Congress has been trying to change that law, in order to stay one step ahead of big pharma and to allow generics in more aggressively, to stop this evergreening practice.
He continues:
Every time our Congress puts in a complex law, big pharma has found a way to get around it. So I suspect that with this law we'll see the similar thing that the pharmaceutical companies may complain, they may throw up some smoke screen, but at the end of the day, I'd be very surprised if any company ever has to pay one dollar under this amendment.
That is the view from an associate professor of law at West Virginia University who specialises in these areas of evergreening patents and who lives in the country that has seen the greatest proliferation of evergreening patents from pharmaceutical companies in the United States. I will read from an article in Saturday's Age by Thomas Faunce, who is a senior lecturer in the medical school and a lecturer in the law faculty at ANU in Canberra. He says:
In 2002, an extensive inquiry by the US Federal Trade Commission found that as many as 75 per cent of new drug applications by generic drug manufacturers were the subject of legal actions under patent laws by the original brand-name patent owner. These were driving up US drug costs by keeping the cheaper generic versions off the market.
In Canada, similarly extensive investigation by the Competition Bureau revealed similar problems with drug patent evergreening.
He continues:
The evergreening article in the Australia-US FTA ... is far worse than the US or Canadian versions. For the first time it links the operations of our Therapeutic Drug Administration ... with supervising patent law.
It requires that the TGA drug marketing approval be “prevented” indefinitely (not for the 30-month and 24-month periods as in the US and Canada) whenever any type of patent (including a speculative evergreening patent) is merely “claimed”.
He describes Labor's proposed legislative penalty for evergreening as the `lowest common denominator solution'. He also says:
The generic drug industry in the US and Canada has the financial resources and independence to fight evergreening patent claims. The profit margins of generic companies in Australia are extremely fragile. Most are subsidiaries of the multinational pharmaceutical companies. As a result, it will be much harder for them to resist the threats posed by evergreening. 
These are the so-called safeguards that the Labor Party believes it will be putting in place. This is not going to protect our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is not going to protect us from the process of evergreening. We are already seeing evergreening in this country—and not just one instance. Several instances have occurred. There are court cases that continue about the issue of evergreening. There are law companies based in Sydney that I know of that are doing extremely well out of the process of evergreening as big brand-name manufacturers try to stop generic drugs from getting onto the program.
The United States have a coup in getting this free trade agreement, not just by getting the government to come on board but also by getting the opposition to come on board in Australia. They have set an international precedent that they have not been able to negotiate in international trade negotiations through the WTO. They have set a precedent which allows them to then negotiate free trade agreements with, for example, African countries, where these evergreening patents will be able to stop generic drugs for the prevention and cure of HIV, which is a growing epidemic in Asia and in Africa, from being able to come on board. They will prevent these generic drugs being available for people in those communities where they are most needed.
This is the international precedent that is being set by the opposition and by the government today. Australia is signing up on the back of John Howard's and Mark Latham's ride to say: `We will undermine a system of allowing generic drugs to come on board early. We are going to draw up a system which ensures generic manufacturers are disadvantaged. By doing so, we will make it easier for the US pharmaceutical companies to be able to bring in a similar system in each of the individual free trade agreements that they negotiate with poorer and weaker countries.' They have not been able to negotiate that in the international trade agreements, but now a precedent has been set for them. They can set up this, ensuring that women who are in African countries or in South-East Asia, suffering as a result of HIV, will not have access to timely and affordable generic drugs at a time when they need them. That is the precedent that has been set. It is not just about undermining our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme here in this country; it is setting an international precedent to ensure that people across this world who need fast access to these cheaper and therefore more affordable medicines will not be able to get them. Thank you for nothing. The Greens will not be standing for this at all.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—I do not often agree with Senator Boswell, but I do agree that these amendments are a fig leaf and spurious. They have also been described as `bizarre' by people who have had a look at them. Senator Carr says they are tough. They are all about writing out a certificate that says: `We've been good. We've done all this in good faith. We've got reasonable prospects of success in this case that we are mounting and we'll conduct it without unreasonable delay.' It is my understanding that if you get a lawyer to write a letter that says: `Yes, pharmaceutical company X is taking this action in good faith, of course. I think they have a reasonable prospect of success. Of course we'll progress this as quickly as possible,' that's it. That is about as much as you need in order to get rid of this spectre of a $10 million fine for doing the wrong thing on evergreening. That is how ludicrous this amendment is. This will not work because there are 50 or so provisions in the free trade agreement which enable evergreening to take place one way or the other. I am going to highlight a few of those today. Some of them have not been mentioned so far in this debate. 
This is why Labor's amendment will have absolutely no effect. For one thing, the principles of the agreement specifically recognise the rights of innovative drug manufacturers but nowhere in the agreement are there any references to the principle of negotiating the lowest prices for consumers. There is nothing in the free trade agreement about the public interest. There is no requirement for negotiations or for disputes to take into account that the most important and fundamental principle of our PBS is that it enables the government to deliver low prices.
The review process has already been mentioned. It is going to be largely about challenges to the non-listing of slightly modified drugs at the end of the patent period, the so-called `me too' drugs. Article 17(10)(4) takes the radical step of linking and indefinitely preventing market approval by the TGA if any type of patent has been claimed over the relevant drug. In the United States and Canada patent owners endeavour to protect their big-selling pharmaceuticals with speculative claims.
Another provision which has hardly got a mention—we certainly have not seen an amendment from Labor to overcome this one—allows the advertising of pharmaceuticals on the Internet. Drug advertising is banned in this country, and it is banned for very good reason. Drug manufacturers advertise their latest, most expensive brand—the `me too' drug—and people go running to their doctors, saying, `Doctor, we've got to have this one. The ad says this is going to solve the problems that I've got and my current conditions.' It is critically important not to have advertising in this agreement, but there is no sign of an amendment by Labor to get it out. Of course, advertising on the Internet is just the first step. Next it is going to be, `We need to advertise in the press,' or, `We need to advertise on the radio or on television.' We will see full-scale advertising in this country, advertising that has seen the price of drugs in the United States and elsewhere rise enormously.
In this agreement there is a clause which prevents our generic drugs industry from providing cheap drugs to neighbouring countries that might have a health crisis. HIV would obviously be one of those crises, but there are plenty of other examples. There are specific measures within this agreement which would stop us coming to the assistance of neighbouring countries. There is no amendment from the Labor Party to deal with that. Article 17(9)(8) locks in preferential patent term extensions. Nothing has been put forward so far by Labor that stops that. Article 17(10)(4) takes the step of linking and indefinitely preventing market approval by the TGA if any type of patent has been claimed over the relevant drug. Why is locking in the five-year data exclusivity period for pharmaceutical test data of benefit to this country? Why are any of those measures within the trade agreement of benefit to Australia? The answer is they are not.
Requiring the PBAC to publish the reasons for non-listing decisions opens the way for successful challenges through review or in the courts. Once you get the PBAC to spell out precisely what its reasons are for refusing to list a drug it puts pressure on the PBAC in preparing its decisions for non-listing, because it knows that every single word in the reasons for not listing will be open to challenges in the courts. We do not have that level of transparency in the drug industry. There is no requirement that clinical trials, for instance, be made public, often for the spurious reason: `This is all about confidentiality.' Where is Labor's amendment that would deal with that? It is missing. We also have the medicines working group, which has already been discussed here. 
The ALP amendments are simply window-dressing. They do not go to the nub of the issue. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies are already evergreening. I know that senators will have seen evidence of this. I know that it was brought before the committee. There are many cases currently in our courts. Clayton Utz has circulated a speech which was given that talks about patent law and how the pharmaceutical companies are using our courts right now.
Good faith is arguable. It is not a clear-cut matter. You can say you have done this `in good faith', and it is up to someone who is challenging you to prove that you have not. Unless you are a pharmaceutical company that has left a trail of memoranda all over the place saying you are doing this because you simply want to extend the patent or evergreen—and who would be stupid enough to do that?—then you are going to be able to say, `We did it in good faith,' hand on heart. It is a ridiculous notion to rest your case that you have improved or protected the PBS. This is a sham. You are pulling the wool over people's eyes. It is awful to watch the Labor Party do this—to give up on 50 provisions within this agreement, all of which damage the PBS. Its amendment goes to one very small, highly ineffective and unlikely to succeed way of dealing with this problem, and it is useless.
There is the question of whether the principles in this agreement will mean that the pharmaceutical companies can challenge anything which goes on in this country to do with putting up market barriers or any barriers at all to stop generics coming on the market. Those principles are critically important, because they will be the basis on which the legal arguments are conducted. It would have been a lot simpler for the ALP to have rejected the PBS measures in the FTA—all of them, to get rid of the lot. Let us maintain the status quo. That is bad enough. As I said, the pharmaceutical manufacturers already have so many cases in the courts. We should be protecting the PBS on the basis of what is already happening, let alone worrying about all of the provisions in this agreement which are going to damage it more.
At the end of the day it means higher costs for the PBS for all Australians, and I want to know what will happen at that point. We have had advice that we could see an increase in prices of three to four times the current level. That means that the PBS will collapse, because the government of the day, whether it is Labor or Liberal, will say: `We can't afford the PBS anymore. Let's go to a system like the United States has and let people pay for their own medicines.' That is where we are heading. That is what all the best advice that we have been given tells us.
It was very disappointing that in Senator Carr's speech he talked very quietly and very briefly about this certificate. Most of his speech was haranguing the Prime Minister for going back to President Bush. I agree that that is pretty ludicrous and pretty farcical, but what we want to know is: how can this work? It is my understanding that it has not worked anywhere else. Canada has an Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison and they look at evergreening cases. It is my understanding that they have 30 active right now. Canada rejects 50 per cent of all the drug patents every year. I think they have similar laws to the ones that are being proposed by the ALP, but my advice is that they are never used. They are never used because the drug companies put injunctions on anyone who seeks to use them. The generics do not take action, because half of the time they are owned by the big pharmaceutical companies anyway and the rest of the time they supply the big pharmaceutical companies with goods. They are not a separate industry. They are entirely part of the whole sector. It is ludicrous. 
—That is why the Commonwealth and state governments can take action!
—Getting onto the subject of state governments, Senator Conroy, I have actually seen a suggestion that the state governments probably have not realised that this agreement is going to boost the cost of pharmaceuticals to hospitals and that there will in fact be a direct cost. I think the estimate is $134 million by 2008. That is what the states are likely to have to shell out in extra costs because of the increases in pharmaceuticals that are dispensed in hospitals—because the states negotiate in a similar way to the government. That $134 million is an estimate of a research group at the Australian National University. They say:
New research presented in this paper demonstrates that these changes—
meaning the free trade agreements—
will raise drug expenditures in State public hospitals required to purchase products outside the PBS system. While many State Premiers have given support to the free trade deal on the basis of the limited agricultural gains in the agreement, these new findings threaten such support, as the deal may undermine the public hospital system in Australia. The authors, who are part of a research group analyzing the impact of international trade agreements on health systems at the Australian National University, estimate the impact of the FTA to state budgets to be in the order of $134 million per year.
So the state premiers, I think, are wrong in coming out and saying that this is a good deal for them. They obviously have not read that advice, which suggests that in fact it is going to cost them a great deal of money. I think there are a lot of questions that need to be asked on this whole matter and I propose to do that. I also suggest to the ALP that they seriously consider supporting our amendment removing schedule 7 altogether from this bill and tell the government that the free trade agreement should never have had the PBS in it. The government promised us, after all, that it would not. The minister even said today that there is no impact on the PBS. Well, what is with all of these provisions? What do they do? What effect will they have on our PBS? I think we need to know that. I have spelled out a few, but there are many more in this agreement. They are not there for fun; they are there because the United States wants more money out of Australia. Innovative pharmaceutical companies' rights are being acknowledged and will be very important at the end of the day in decisions about whether or not we will pay more.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I rise to place on the record that One Nation will support Labor's amendments to the FTA. But we would like to spell out very clearly that the reason we are supporting the amendments is that they in some way ameliorate the undesirable sections of the free trade agreement, particularly in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme should not be part of the free trade agreement. In commencing my contribution I would like to quote from a document from the Executive Office of the President of the United States of America. It is headed `US-Australia Free Trade Agreement—Questions and Answers About Pharmaceuticals'. These are questions and answers that were given, I understand, in Congress in the United States. I will be quoting verbatim from the document, because the document raises so many issues that have been raised as concerns by Australians. This document actually gives the United States interpretation of what gains or what commitments the United States has made with regard to pharmaceuticals in the free trade agreement. All of these comments are questions and answers from the American perspective. The first question is: 
What guidance has Congress given about pharmaceutical trade issues?
The answer is:
For decades, Congress set trade negotiating objectives that called for increased foreign market access for U.S. innovative medicines through tariff cuts and strong protections for U.S. intellectual property. In the Trade Act of 2002, Congress provided additional guidance with negotiating objectives that call for increased transparency in the pharmaceutical regulatory process, consultative mechanisms, and addressing non-tariff market access issues such as reference pricing.
They go on to say:
How has the U.S. been dealing with international pharmaceuticals issues in trade agreements?
This is quite a profound statement:
In earlier trade agreements, the USTR worked to achieve congressional negotiated objectives with provisions that eliminated or reduced duties on U.S. pharmaceutical products, and with strong IPR provisions protecting patents for pharmaceuticals and other innovative U.S. products.
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I rise to speak on the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill 2002. I do so with the understanding that the government will be moving amendments in the committee stage which have been agreed should be passed and that is why we are able to deal with it today as non-controversial legislation. Speaking first in the second reading debate, let me say Labor have always said that there was an opportunity with this bill to achieve some valuable reform in respect of health and safety for Commonwealth public servants. We have acknowledged that the bill contains some useful provisions. The approach, of course, goes right back to the year 2000, when a very similar bill was proposed by the government. We made it clear then that we supported the bulk of the bill but were opposed to those blatantly anti-union parts of the legislation which sought to restrict the role of unions in occupational health and safety.
Until today, the government has forsaken the opportunity to re-present this bill in a form which would be acceptable to all parties. I am pleased that today this divisive, unhelpful approach has been set aside by the government to allow the positive aspects of the bill to progress through the Senate with our support. It is a shame that it has taken so long to get to this point. Indeed, the government's lack of commitment to the positive aspects of the legislation is shown by the fact that it has sat dormant for almost two years since its introduction in June 2002.
Recently a Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee inquiry considered this bill. We certainly found serious deficiencies, mainly in schedule 1, which sought to limit the role of trade unions in workplace health and safety. The anti-union provisions in the bill were not surprising in the light of this government's secret plans to cut unions out of public sector bargaining altogether. Those plans were revealed in a leaked cabinet submission in December 2002 under the previous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The then minister was developing a proposal to require that all new Public Service positions and all promotions be subject to the acceptance of AWAs. This would have thrown the long-established merit principle right out the window. It would have meant that you do not get a promotion if you are the right person for the job; you get a promotion if you agree to accept an AWA. Part of the same proposal was that the government was going to ban all union collective agreements—it would only agree to non-union agreements. So much for choice! Employees could not choose under such a proposal to be represented by their union if that proposal became policy. 
The provisions in this bill that would have restricted the involvement of unions in health and safety issues are just another part of that same strategy. As we have made clear in our comments in the legislation committee's report, we do not support those provisions. I also want to draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that, in the government's own report, the government senators on the committee recommended that the Senate pass the bill. But in the last four paragraphs of their comments before they made that recommendation they actually drew attention to the lack of substance, the lack of any real argument or factual basis for the government's proposals with regard to removing or severely truncating the role of unions being involved in the development and maintenance of health and safety policies and processes within the Public Service. For instance, they said:
The Committee considers that, while enabling employees to have a more direct say in addressing OH&S matters in their own workplace may be a desirable outcome in its own right, this simply addresses part of the process by which measures might be developed to achieve OH&S outcomes. It does not of itself ensure that better OH&S outcomes will result.
To paraphrase, the government's proposals were very much directed at removing unions as a collective body from having much say in the development of decent occupational health and safety processes and promoting the role of individual employees. As the government senators noted, there was no real backup for that proposition. They went on to say:
When pressed on the issue, departmental witnesses were unable to demonstrate how the bill in general or the provisions on workplace arrangements in particular would lead to OH&S improvements. Instead, the department's evidence suggests that it is assumed that OH&S improvements will flow from changes to the way HSRs are to be elected.
Further, they state:
3.31  The Committee also notes that the department did not take the opportunity in supplementary evidence after the hearing to demonstrate how the bill will achieve improvements in OH&S matters. 
	...	...	...
3.32  The Committee is disappointed that the department was not able to do more than simply assert that the proposed measures would lead to improvements, rather than show, by way of elucidation or relevant examples, how the bill would achieve this end.
They were the observations, very strong observations, of government senators on this committee. They recognised that there was not only a lack of real substance and valid argument behind the proposals from the government in the legislation at that time but also they ignored the evidence that unions had played a very constructive role both in terms of organisation and in terms of education in the development of decent health and safety policy. I am pleased that the government has now recognised the wisdom of those remarks, and of our position, and is going to amend the legislation to remove those rather draconian provisions.
We have made it very clear that we support those parts of the bill that strengthen the enforcement aspects of occupational health and safety for Commonwealth employees. These are the provisions that will ultimately be passed today in this non-controversial legislation debate. We agree with the government that there is merit in increasing the levels of penalties in the act and in introducing civil pecuniary penalties for Commonwealth employers in addition to refining existing criminal penalties. This dual criminal and civil system of enforcement is also consistent with state occupational health and safety systems. We accept that introducing a civil stream of enforcement can expedite prosecutions. 
Under the current criminal-only system, very few prosecutions are brought at all. The Senate inquiry into the previous bill back in 2000 found that, of 50,000 reported accidents and 1,770 investigations, only nine prosecutions had been brought. This is exacerbated by the immunity of the Commonwealth and most Commonwealth authorities from prosecution. It therefore appears that criminal penalties alone, as under the current act, have little deterrent effect. An important aspect of this new dual system is that the bill will add a new provision, which was not in earlier legislation in 2000, to make it possible to secure a pecuniary penalty order against the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority. We are pleased to support the bill as it will be amended, by agreement, in the committee stage. We therefore support the second reading of the bill.",SENATE,<title>OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT) AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-12,"—The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill 2002 is similar to the one introduced in 2000, which was the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2000. That bill was also sent to a committee. However, the 2000 bill lapsed with the prorogation of parliament for the 2001 general election. The bill before us, in its totality, aims to amend the Occupation Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act to remove the automatic right of unions to provide OH&S representatives, in line with state OH&S regimes, and to establish a new penalty and enforcement arrangement. As stated in my two minority reports on these two bills, there are a number of useful advances in the proposed legislation.
The bill is, in many respects, in line with state and territory OH&S laws. It is obviously desirable to harmonise legislation in OH&S wherever possible. The Senate knows that the Democrats support and have vigorously lobbied for a unitary industrial relations system. A harmonised system is the next best thing. Having six different sets of OH&S laws—or nine, as it is in this situation—is, frankly, crazy for a country of this size. However, we have concerns with the bill with respect to the provisions relating to OH&S representation. As stated in my minority report:
A key area of concern to us is the place of unions in the maintenance and advancement of workplace health and safety. Unions supplement the regulatory and inspectorial roles of State H&S departments in an irreplaceable way. Unions as a whole sometimes get criticised as a result of the actions of some unionists in misusing the provisions of the various State health and safety Acts. Such unionists raise non-existent H&S issues to achieve other industrial objectives, and misuse entry and search provisions under the pretext of H&S1. Such behaviour needs to be addressed. However the way to deal with those abuses is not to clamp down on legitimate useful or effective union H&S activity.
Evidence was strongly expressed on this issue, and the Democrats will need to assess whether the intentions of the Bills goes too far in this respect. In my view union officials with expertise in H&S should continue to be involved as appropriate in workplace health and safety. 
I am also acutely aware of concerns raised by the unions with respect to the proposed changes to the election process of OH&S representatives. I believe that an independent process would be a better alternative to the one proposed by the bill and should address concerns of both employers and unions. We have raised those concerns with the government and have suggested some alternative provisions. As I understand it, the government have undertaken to consider our suggestions.
For the sake of facilitating the passage of the remaining provisions in the bill, this is now a non-controversial bill because the government have agreed to set aside the contentious provisions and have circulated the amendments and the supplementary explanatory memorandum to achieve that aim. This leaves us with the provisions to establish a new penalty and enforcement regime. We consider the new penalty and enforcement regime an improvement on the current system. As outlined in the supplementary explanatory memorandum circulated, the bill provides for: civil penalties, as far as possible reserving criminal penalties for more serious breaches; new offences where an employer breaches its duty of care and exposes an employee to a substantial risk of death or serious harm; and a wider range of remedies and substantial increases in penalties. New remedies of enforceable undertakings, injunctions and remedial orders are included. These will enable Comcare, the regulatory body under the act, to work with employers and others to remove risks to the health and safety of employees before an injury occurs.
The bill also extends the liability for the imposition of civil pecuniary penalties to Commonwealth employers. The CPSU did suggest that the lifting of the shield of the Crown to allow the prosecution of individuals employed by the Commonwealth for breaches of the act should be extended to agencies and ministers. The problem with this suggestion is that the Commonwealth would essentially be suing itself. In discussions with the CPSU they expressed a view that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission does not have the power to instigate proceedings for breaches under the act. The CPSU argued that good public policy demands that the SRCC, as the regulator, must have the power to instigate proceedings without having to rely on the agreement or good grace of its administrator, and that, because the SRCC is at arm's length from the government and independent of the bureaucracy, it is therefore in the best position to be the decision maker on the institution of proceedings.
We raised this issue with the government and they explained that the SRCC, as it currently operates, is a tripartite body which meets four times a year. It does not have any staff, it is supported in its functions by Comcare, and it is not a separate legal personality that is able to be sued or to sue. It appears then that giving that power to the commission, as it is presently structured, would not be appropriate. However, the government did note that, in its report entitled National workers' compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks, March 2004, the Productivity Commission recommended that the current regulatory framework for the oversight of the Australian government's workers compensation schemes and OH&S regimes be strengthened by progressively developing the SRCC to be controlled by a board of independent directors appointed for a fixed term on the basis of their expertise and skills, to have a full-time director appointed as chairperson and to be provided with its own staff and funding.
In its response, the government supported further examination of this recommendation and said that there is merit in examining in more detail the commission's recommendation that the SRCC become a small stand-alone regulator. Based on the government's response to the Productivity Commission, there appears to be scope for the government to pursue in the future the CPSU's views on this matter. For a good outcome in this area, it would of course be best for those two bodies to agree on the direction that should be undertaken. The CPSU have indicated to us that they are prepared to await the government's examination and to pursue the matter when we revisit, in the next parliament, the bill's provisions now being set aside by the government. On behalf of the Democrats, I look forward to discussing the issue further. 
On one final point, I note that the unions, in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, raised their belief that the offence of industrial manslaughter should be introduced at the Commonwealth level for cases of death caused by the negligence or misbehaviour of individuals. I also note that my ACT colleague MLC Rosalyn Dundas supported the industrial manslaughter bill in the ACT earlier this year. The ACT legislation, not surprisingly, has been met with concern from business, to the point where the federal government is looking to pass legislation to overturn the ACT legislation. I and the Democrats will be watching closely how the legislation operates in the ACT; what impact, if any, it has on employers who currently cut corners with respect to occupational health and safety; and whether there will be a positive impact, with fewer deaths and injuries through workplace accidents.
As noted by the CPSU, the penalty and enforcement provisions in this bill are an improvement on the current system. We acknowledge that there is possibly room for further improvement and law change, and I look forward to the outcome of the government's further examination of the Productivity Commission's report National workers' compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks. Until then, the Democrats are pleased to see progression in this matter and improvement to the current system. We support the bill with government amendments as being non-controversial.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-08-12,"—The effect of the government amendments will be to remove the provisions in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill 2002 concerning changes to a Commonwealth employer's duty of care and to the privileged role of involved unions in a Commonwealth workplace. The bill, as introduced, would have recognised the primacy of direct employer and employee relationships by enabling employers and employees to develop suitable health and safety arrangements which take account of the circumstances of their enterprise. However, the provisions in the bill that would introduce a new enforcement and compliance regime, including civil pecuniary penalties, injunctions, remedial orders and enforceable undertakings as well a general increase in criminal penalties will be retained.
While it is disappointing that the provisions to remove the privileged role of unions in Commonwealth occupational health and safety will not proceed, the government believe it is very important to send a strong message that we, as a government, are concerned and are leading the way in strengthening OHS compliance, particularly in Commonwealth workplaces. It is also imperative to align OHS penalties and breaches with those that currently exist in the states and territories. In moving these amendments, the government are demonstrating their commitment to improving health and safety in their own workplaces as well as their willingness to negotiate and compromise with other parties in the Senate to this end. I thank the Australian Democrats on behalf of the government for their constructive approach to the negotiations on the amendments and to the other parties for agreeing to deal with the bill as non-controversial. 
The government remain committed to further improvements in occupational health and safety in Commonwealth workplaces and to providing a greater opportunity for all employees to be actively involved in OHS matters at the workplace. It is imperative that Commonwealth employers be required to consult with all employees, not just unions, about the development and implementation of occupational health and safety arrangements. Safety in the workplace is important, and employees should have the opportunity to be involved in a manner best suited to their individual circumstances. Currently, where a union is involved, only employees nominated by the union can be candidates for election as a health and safety representative. This limits individual worker's rights. Employees should have access to the type of representation that they want in consultation with their employers on OHS matters. Best practice in occupational health and safety should enable those in the workplace to work together to make informed decisions about workplace safety, including about who they want as their occupational health and safety representative.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I seek leave to incorporate a speech by Senator Faulkner in relation to this matter.
Leave granted.
Senator Faulkner's speech read as follows—
The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2004 is not a controversial Bill. It contains measures designed to sort out a number of unintended consequences following the passage of recent electoral legislation.
Before the recent amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, a prisoner serving a sentence of five years or longer could not enrol, stay enrolled or vote in Federal elections.
In the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and other measures) Bill 2004 the Government proposed to stop all prisoners from voting, irrespective of their sentence. Labor opposed that measure because it was not only unjust, it was also unworkable.
During debate of the Enrolment Integrity Bill in the Senate on Friday, 25 June 2004, Labor's long-standing amendments relating to prisoner voting were carried.
And when I say Labor's amendment was “long-standing”, I am of course referring to the fact it has been on the table for more than five years.
As some Senators may remember, the Opposition moved the amendment in 1999 when a similar proposal was put forward by the Government. The amendment was circulated and no issues were raised about it.
I'm not 100% sure, but I think Labor's amendment was also discussed in the media.
Labor's long-standing amendments provided that a prisoner whose sentence commenced on, or before, the return of the writs for an election and whose sentence continued until after the issue of the writs for any succeeding election would not be entitled to be enrolled. In essence, we were trying to tie the restriction on prisoner voting to a logical rather than an arbitrary period of time.
The amendments were supported by the Government and were passed unanimously by the House of Representatives in late June 2004.
However, according to the AEC—somewhat belatedly—this approach may not achieve the intended outcome.
This was a surprise to me and to the Opposition, as the amendments had been around for more than five years and no-one had raised any concerns about them. Nevertheless, the AEC has now flagged a problem and we are duty bound to address the problem they have raised.
The Commonwealth Electoral Act, as amended in late June 2004, only allows for the removal of prisoners from the roll by objection action.
As a prisoner would only be ineligible for enrolment on the issue of the writs, objection action could not commence until that time. We are advised objection action takes at least 20 days, which would be after the close of the Roll—possibly having the unintended effect of all prisoners remaining enrolled to vote.
Given this was not Parliament's intention, we now have the Prisoner Voting Bill before the Senate.
The Prisoner Voting Bill requires the States and Territories to provide the AEC information on prisoners who are serving a sentence of imprisonment of three years or more. The AEC will then undertake objection action to remove these prisoners from the Roll. 
Of course, we would also like to see the AEC following up people once they are released to get them back on the Roll as part of their reintegration into society.
In the Prisoner Voting Bill the Government has, in effect, adopted Labor's approach and proposes a model for excluding prisoners from enrolling and voting based on Labor's three year time frame.
Labor supports this measure and also supports the other tidying-up amendments relating to the closure of the Roll and the review of new voter identification procedures.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PRISONER VOTING AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-12,"—We are debating the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2004 on what is possibly the last sitting week before an election. I say `possibly' because it is not a certainty but, because of that possibility, I reiterate the same sentiments I made in my second reading contribution to the electoral bill in late June. Those remarks were about process. It is my opinion that the next government, of whatever complexion, has to change its approach to the way electoral bills are introduced into and dealt with by the Senate chamber. It is bad form to rush important bills that affect an election process when the deadline of an election is over the horizon, and we have not had the opportunity to debate and to consider many of the very important views of senators from all the various political parties and the Independents around the chamber.
It would seem that, throughout the period of the three-year electoral cycle, electoral bills not only are few and far between but always come at the end of the electoral cycle. That is a perennial problem. It means that significant matters which the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters raise or that individual senators wish to raise do not have or seldom have the opportunity to be aired and debated. Electoral bills are not only matters of passion but matters which go to the heart of our concern to have a well-functioning democracy, not least because every single senator and member of the House of Representatives has a self-interest attached to those bills.
Turning to this bill, we have to debate this issue of prisoner voting all over again due to the unworkability of Labor's amendments, which stated that a person is not entitled to enrol and vote if the person:
(b)	is serving a sentence of imprisonment which:
(i)	commenced on or before the return of the writs for an election for the House of Representatives or Senate; and
(ii)	continues at the issuing of writs for any succeeding election for the House of Representatives or Senate; ...
That amendment was passed in June by the coalition and the Labor Party, with the Democrats opposing. That amendment is now law but has been found to be unworkable. It effectively required the Australian Electoral Commission to strike off the roll prisoners serving a sentence of three years or more. It is interesting that Labor's amendment had the unintended consequence of almost delivering the Democrat policy of allowing all prisoners the vote. Because the section applies only to those who continue to serve a sentence at the issuing of the writs for any succeeding election, and that can only be determined when those writs are issued, it follows that all prisoners are presently entitled to enrolment.
This is the case even if a prisoner is serving a sentence exceeding five years, or even life, because it is conceivable that such a prisoner could be released on parole or even pardoned prior to the issue of the writs for the second election. Under the act, there is a 20-day objection period before someone can be removed from the roll. The writs condition means the AEC will be unable to carry out the new law. If Labor's amendment went unchanged, it appears that, for the reasons outlined in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, prisoners who had enrolled could not be removed from the roll and so would remain on the roll. 
This does not automatically re-enfranchise prisoners, because under the act such persons would still not necessarily be entitled to vote. Entitlement to be placed on the roll does not connote an absolute entitlement to vote where there is a qualifying condition. Hence, unfortunately it is not correct to say that prisoners have been re-enfranchised under Labor's amendment. Rather, that amendment creates the anomaly that, whilst all prisoners are able to enrol prior to an election and their names cannot be removed from the roll prior to the election, they are nevertheless not entitled to vote—that is, if the AEC know they are prisoners. It does seem, if Labor's amendment goes uncorrected, that more prisoners are likely to be able to vote than were formerly.
Prisoners who are entitled to vote will not necessarily, and do not usually, vote in the electorate in which the prison is situated. Section 96A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides that a person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment is entitled to remain enrolled for the subdivision, if any, for which the person was enrolled when he or she began serving the sentence. The AEC confirm that most prisoners cast postal votes for their pre-prison home electorate and that very few prisoners, if any, are enrolled in the electorate in which their correctional facility is located. I got all excited and thought, `Ooh, this change will really influence the election.' I looked up where all the prisons were based and saw how many marginal seats might be affected, but it does not work out that way.
It is arguable that provisions purporting to disenfranchise prisoners are invalid by reason of an implied right to vote in the Australian Constitution. In fact, similar provisions have been held to infringe constitutional provisions in Canada and in Europe. The voting entitlement of prisoners has always been controversial, and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters have a somewhat chequered history of dealing with this thorny issue. What that committee have never properly addressed is why this double penalty should come through the Commonwealth Electoral Act. If a government were ever to consider that there should be a penalty of not voting then that should be part of the Criminal Code. It is our view that it is a judge who should decide whether or not you deserve to have your right to vote taken away. If a judge is going to decide that the nature of a crime is such that you deserve to have your right to vote taken away then that should be part of the Criminal Code. It has no place in the Electoral Act because essentially it is a double penalty imposed without regard to the crime itself.
It is important to understand that, although prisoners are deprived of their liberty while in detention, they are not deprived of their citizenry of this nation other than by the measures that are in the Electoral Act. As part of their citizenship, convicted persons in detention should be entitled to vote, although I must point out that the Democrats do agree that someone who has committed treason should lose the right to vote. I think that is a logical continuation of a principle because treason is a denial of citizenship.
There is no logical connection between the commission of an offence and the right to vote. For example, a journalist who is imprisoned for refusing on principle to provide a court with the name of a source might be denied the vote if he were imprisoned. To complicate this further, there is no uniformity amongst the states or between the states and the Commonwealth as to what constitutes an offence punishable by imprisonment. In Western Australia, for example, there is a scheme whereby fine defaulters lose their licence rather than go to prison, yet this has not been introduced uniformly in Australia. Why should an Australian citizen in Western Australia who defaults on a fine but is not jailed retain the right to vote, whilst an Australian citizen in another jurisdiction who is jailed for the same offence loses the right to vote? This would be inequitable and unacceptable, and that is what government policy seeks to do. 
—But you're only talking about parking fines!
—No, you're not, Senator McGauran. You need to study the subject a bit. Australia is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 25, in combination with article 2, provides that every citizen shall have the right to vote at elections under universal suffrage without a distinction of any kind on the basis of race, sex or other status. The existing law discriminates against convicted persons in detention on the basis of their legal status, and it is discriminatory between types of prisoners. This clearly runs contrary to the letter and the spirit of the covenant. A society should tread carefully in this area. All citizens of Australia are entitled to vote. It is the most fundamental tenet of our society and should not be undermined or restricted.
To summarise: where do the Democrats stand on this matter? We believe that people should not be entitled to vote if they are too young, if they commit treason, if they are not citizens or if they are mentally incapable of exercising a vote. We believe that if the right to vote is to be taken away as a result of a crime that a person has committed then that should be done by determination of a judge. This is a matter for the Criminal Code and not for the Electoral Act. That is our position and remains the reason we are disturbed about this form of legislation and this type of approach.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PRISONER VOTING AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-08-12,"—I would like to thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2004 is a demonstration of the government's commitment to ensuring the integrity of the electoral system. When it passed the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2004, it was the parliament's intention that people who commit offences against society sufficient to warrant a full-time prison term for an electoral cycle or longer should not have any entitlement to vote and elect the leaders of this society.
Debate (on motion by Senator Troeth) adjourned.
Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-08-12,"—by leave—This statement is made on behalf of Senator Nick Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Allison, as agreed by the Senate on 11 August 2004, and it relates to a request for a document containing Commonwealth sites, including offshore islands and territories, listed as potential sites for the storage of nuclear waste.
On behalf of Senator Minchin I wish to inform the Senate of the reasons why it is not possible to table a return to order. Last month the Prime Minister announced that the government had decided to abandon the establishment of a national low-level radioactive waste repository at site 40a, which is near Woomera in South Australia. This announce-ment was made in light of the recent Federal Court decision and the effective failure of the states and territories to cooperate with the Australian government in finding a national solution for the safe and secure disposal of low-level radioactive waste. Instead, the gov-ern-ment will build a Commonwealth radioactive waste facility on Commonwealth land for the management of both low-level and inter-mediate-level radioactive waste generated by Australian government departments and agencies.
At this stage the government does not have a short list of possible locations for the Commonwealth's low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste management facility. Assessment of possible sites on Commonwealth land, both onshore and offshore, is required before the government makes any further decision about sites that may be considered potentially suitable for such a facility. Given the government's pre-existing commitment not to locate the national intermediate waste store in South Australia, the new radioactive waste management facility will not be located in South Australia.
In April 2003, following assessment of Commonwealth land around Australia for suitability for the national store for intermediate-level waste, the National Store Advisory Committee, a group of experts advising the government on site selection, provided the Minister for Science with advice on sites for further consideration. This consideration of sites was in the context of the national store for intermediate-level waste alone, and was prior to the Prime Minister's announcement last month to co-locate the Commonwealth's low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste facilities. It is now likely that the National Store Advisory Committee's advice on the national store for intermediate-level waste will be used in the new site selection process which is currently under way. I therefore consider the committee's advice to be in the nature of opinion, advice or recommendations for the purposes of the government's deliberative processes and that tabling the advice would not be in the public interest at this stage.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—I present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee entitled Rural water resource usage, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I am pleased to present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee entitled Rural water resource usage,together with the Hansard record of proceedings. In considering the issues surrounding use of water in rural areas, the committee sought to bring together and assess a diverse range of interested parties and information on rural water and management, and to take into account the recent intergovernmental agreement on a national water initiative. On behalf of the committee I thank those people who shared their valuable expertise with the committee during its deliberations on this issue. Complex issues relating to water access entitlements and water trading were examined by the committee and the report reflects the committee's findings on these matters.
As everyone would know, over the last two decades there has been a growing awareness of environmental problems such as salinity and river health. A need for a national approach to solutions saw the development of the 1984 water reform framework and, subsequently, the Murray-Darling Basin agreement, the Living Murray initiative and the national water initiative. The committee has recognised in this report that the intergovernmental agreement on the national water initiative is a reaffirmation of the political commitment to water reform. We hope to see this political commitment continue and to translate into real long-term gains on sustainable use of water in rural areas. 
The committee considered at length the need to give users more secure rights to water, and the complex problems associated with the separation of water rights from land. The committee holds that the intergovernmental agreement has resolved some of the contentious issues in water management—for example, the definition of entitlements as a perpetual share of the consumptive pool, and the issue of who should rightly bear the costs of water allocation and reallocation. We welcome the establishment of a national water commission to provide advice to COAG on water issues. I am left with no doubt that increasing competition for scarce water resources within catchment areas will mean that the national water commission will have a broad and challenging job in achieving sustainable management of water resources.
The committee's report draws attention to the importance of coordinating regional water sharing plans over the broadest area of a catchment and the need to retain a close watch on the operation and behaviour of a water market in order to satisfy the need for national consistent regulation of trade. The committee recommends that the Council of Australian Governments must move forward in developing a policy on rules to control the water market. The committee also asks that loopholes which may result in profiteering or speculation by non-users, including foreign interests to the detriment of local water users or the environment, be closely scrutinised and appropriately policed. 
Through the course of the hearings it became evident that water in rural areas, especially in light of more intensive and widespread agricultural development, is a more and more precious resource. Governing and regulation of the use of the resource, however, appear to have fallen behind development requiring large-scale irrigation, as is evident in examples such as the practice of bunding in Queensland's portion of the Murray-Darling Basin.
The committee has recommended that, as a matter of urgency, a cap for water extractions in the Queensland part of the Murray-Darling Basin should be implemented. An appropriate cap would alleviate the severe pressures that are currently placed on this stressed system. I personally welcome today's announcement from Queensland's natural resources minister, Mr Stephen Robertson, who has said that his government intends to implement a water resources plan for the Condamine-Balonne catchment area in the state's south-west. Whether a 10 per cent reduction will mean sustainable use of water in the region and throughout the river system remains to be seen, but I welcome the speedy implementation of this important step in Queensland.
With regard to the national water commission, the committee also suggests that coordinating research to best inform implementation of the intergovernmental agreement should be a responsibility of the national water commission. The committee sees an important need for the national water commission to consult with interested parties within the scientific community on this issue. The committee recognises that, despite the beginnings we have seen, substantial progress is still to be made on this issue through COAG's National Water Initiative by the national water commission within regional catchment management bodies and certainly by the community at large. The committee considered that the most effective way of speeding up such a process must be through the establishment of clear milestones, both temporal and with regard to the physical needs of the environment.
Progress of difficult and controversial issues surrounding use and allocation of water in rural areas will depend on continuing political motivation. It is vital we solve problems surrounding trading over water across state lines, the harmonisation of water pricing and the designation of rules for trading which reflect hydrological realities and ecological needs. Both surface and ground water issues must be taken into account in future planning for rural water resources, as is illustrated in concerns that were aired in the hearings over the effects of Commonwealth licensed oil drilling on the La Trobe aquifer.
It is also important to consider the effect of water-intercepting land uses on catchments and river systems and, more importantly, that all decision making is based on a solid scientific knowledge base. Only with solid information can appropriate decisions be made on the amount of water available to rural communities in order to ensure downstream users and the environment are not compromised or disadvantaged. Finally, it is important to ensure that water is used efficiently at every opportunity. In considering this issue, the committee heard a number of examples of irrigation sectors that have improved their efficiency of water use in recent decades. However, we did note that there is still much potential for improvement. In our investigations into the effects of farm dams on water in a catchment area we were made aware of substantial discrepancies between the policies of the New South Wales and Victorian governments particularly, and we would encourage those governments to ensure a harmonised position is reached in the new future. 
I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the people involved in this exercise. The review the committee has undertaken in the course of this parliament I think has highlighted the need for further and substantial work on rural water use. Progress towards sustainable management of water resources is of vital importance for the health of rural communities, for Australia's primary industries as a whole and certainly for the Australian environment as well. I thank Ms Maureen Weeks, the secretary of the committee, and the staff of the secretariat. It has not been an easy process getting to this point but I think the results have paid off after the many hearings that were held across the country and certainly in the production of the report. It is one that I hope the government will take up. There are some key recommendations that ought to be adopted. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I will very briefly encapsulate the points I was making earlier in relation to Labor amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 4371. I reiterate that One Nation will support those amendments, but I clearly place on the record that the reason for supporting them is that they do, to a small extent, go towards resolving some of the glaring problems that are quite evident, particularly in annex 2-C, in relation to pharmaceuticals. Earlier today I was making some comparisons from a document from the Executive Office of the President of the United States headed `U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement—Questions and Answers About Pharmaceuticals' dealing with what guidance congress received about pharmaceutical trade issues. Contained within those questions and answers, there is one paramount issue in relation to how the US have been dealing with international pharmaceutical issues in previous trade agreements. The document says: 
Over the past few decades, market access and pricing issues also have been part of the U.S. trade dialogue with Canada, Japan, Korea and China.
It then goes on to say:
What are the key provisions regarding pharmaceuticals in the U.S.-Australia FTA?
This is where the paramount difference is very clear. The document says:
Based on new guidance from Congress in the Trade Act of 2002, the Australia FTA was the first FTA to include specific provisions dealing with non-tariff market access issues related to pharmaceuticals.
But the profound statement is the closing sentence in this paragraph, which says:
These provisions are based in large part on the Australian government's own studies.
So here we have a document directly from the Office of the United States Trade Representative clearly setting out that this US-Australia free trade agreement is the first agreement that carries a section in it relating to pharmaceutical benefits and that, at large, these provisions are based on the Australian government's own studies. The document says:
These provisions are based in large part on the Australian government's own studies.
The next question posed is:
Does the U.S.-Australia FTA block imports of patented pharmaceuticals?
The answer says:
The FTA imposes no new barriers to imports but reflects current U.S. law, which gives any patent holder the right to control sales (including by contract) of its product in the United States. This right, a core principle of U.S. Patent law for more than 100 years, applies to all U.S. patents, not just pharmaceuticals.
In the American document they are saying very clearly that their patent laws have been in place for more than 100 years and not just for pharmaceuticals. There is a further question:
Does the U.S.-Australia FTA prevent Congress from passing drug re-importation legislation?
The answer is:
No. The FTA reflects current law in the United States. Nothing in this FTA or any other trade agreement prevents Congress from changing U.S. law in the future. Even if a dispute settlement panel found the U.S. acted inconsistently with the FTA, it could not require Congress to amend the law. Importantly, provisions in the FTA protecting patent holders' rights only apply to products under patent. This provision would have no impact on importation of non-patented (generic) prescription drugs.
I wish to make this point absolutely clear: there is a vast difference between the US parliamentary process and the one that we have in Australia.
Yesterday I asked Senator Hill if he would be able to give a guarantee that no Australians' rights prior to the implementation of the changes to these 10 bills would suffer any impediment as a result of those changes. Senator Hill could not give that assurance. Yet we have here a document from the Office of the United States Trade Representative clearly saying that the free trade agreement in America does not bind their congress. They go even further to say that even if a dispute settlement panel found that the US had acted inconsistently with the free trade agreement it could not require congress to amend the law. That is absolutely astounding. These are the differences between what applies in America and what applies here in Australia. Interestingly, the next question is:
Will the U.S.-Australia FTA raise the price of medicines in Australia?
The answer is intriguing: 
The Government of Australia retains the right and authority to set the prices of medicine under the PBS. The provisions of the pharmaceutical annex to the Agreement will help improve market access for pharmaceuticals in Australia by improving the transparency and accountability of Australia's PBS system.
There is something missing. We have a question that says:
Will the U.S.-Australia FTA raise the price of medicines in Australia?
That is the question. Was it answered? No, of course it was not. There is nothing in that response from America that says that in their interpretation of the free trade agreement there will not be an increase in pharmaceuticals. The next question is:
Are any existing or future U.S. health care programs subject to the pharmaceutical provisions of the U.S.-Australia FTA?
The answer is:
USTR has worked closely with all relevant U.S. agencies to ensure the FTA does not require any changes to U.S. health care programs.
It is as clear as that. We are not going to affect any of their health programs. The answer goes on:
Procurement of pharmaceutical products by the Veterans Administration (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) is excluded from the Pharmaceutical Annex of the agreement ...
In America, two of their major government departments are not even subject to the agreement. A very relevant question for Senator Hill is: has the Australian government excluded any of our pharmaceutical purchases from the agreement? They go on to say:
Procurement of pharmaceutical products by state Medicaid agencies is excluded because coverage and reimbursement decisions are made by state officials, not by federal health authorities.
Here is another question for Senator Hill: are the pharmaceuticals that our state governments procure in Australia excluded from the agreement? They are in America. This is the document from their trade representative. If you like, I will seek leave afterwards to table it. It says very clearly:
Procurement of pharmaceutical products by state Medicaid agencies is excluded because coverage and reimbursement decisions are made by state officials, not by federal health authorities.
It is a clear out for every state in America to protect their purchases of pharmaceuticals and put them outside the free trade agreement.
I asked a question of Senator Hill in question time on 3 August relating specifically to the commitments that Australia had made in the exchange of letters on the PBS. In that answer Senator Hill made reference to paragraph 3, where it says:
3. In order to make its process of selection, listing, and pricing of pharmaceuticals and indications under its PBS more expeditious, Australia
shall:
(a) reduce the time ... ;
(b) introduce procedures for more frequent revisions ... ; and
(c) make available expedited procedures for processing of applications ...
The fourth paragraph was the one I put to Senator Hill:
Australia shall provide opportunities to apply for an adjustment to the price of a pharmaceutical under the PBS.
In his answer I do not believe Senator Hill addressed the issue of paragraph 4, because it clearly says it is a commitment by Australia under this agreement to provide opportunities to apply for an adjustment to the price of a pharmaceutical under Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is there. It is absolutely clear. The Americans have protected the purchasing of their pharmaceuticals by their state governments and two of their major agencies and put them outside of the agreement. My question to the minister is: why hasn't Australia done the same? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-12,"—I thank the One Nation senator for that thought-provoking contribution, which I am sure the minister is going to answer in a short while. We have before us amendments from the Labor Party to enable a challenge to be made to head off evergreening—this process by which big corporations can delay the expiry of patents so that they can enrich themselves over an extended period of time through knocking out the opposition of generic, cheap drug producers.
I draw your attention to an interview on the ABC's The World Today program just a couple of days ago with a world-famous expert on the matter of the delivery of pharmaceuticals to the public and an American patent law expert. Professor Kevin Outterson is an Associate Professor of Law at West Virginia University and has been mentioned earlier today. He said that the big pharmaceutical companies will find a way around the legislation—that is, the amendments—possibly by challenging them at the outset. I will come back to that. Associate Professor Outterson said:
It—
the amendment—
does have the potential of a large penalty that goes to the Commonwealth if a company improperly tries to block a generic, and it also has the potential for a part of the penalty to be paid directly to the generic company, which I think is an innovative step.
The difficulty I see with it overall though is that the standard for triggering this payment is whether they've been unreasonable in filing their application.
He said:
I think the language that they chose—
that is, the opposition—
saying is there a reasonable prospect of this pattern being valid, is just too soft, it's too easy for a law firm to give an opinion to a pharmaceutical company—`Yes, there is some reasonable prospect that your patent will be upheld'. That could be a one in ten chance, or a one in five chance. It won't take much for a law firm to be able to give that easy of an opinion.
Professor Outterson went on to say:
If you took the same legislation and the same structure and implied a slightly higher standard, more likely than not it's often used internationally in tax opinions, then you would have a more substantial piece of legislation.
I have had Margaret Blake in my office in contact with a number of people and now the Greens will bring forward amendments which take that very clear reasoning from Professor Kevin Outterson and raise the bar—the standard—in this easygoing Labor amendment. I therefore seek leave to move together Green amendments (1) and (2) to opposition amendment (2) on sheet 4371.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(1)	Amendment (2), omit paragraph 26C(3)(b), substitute:
	(b)	are more likely than not to succeed;
(2)	Amendment (2), subsection 26C(4), omit “have reasonable prospects of success”, substitute “are more likely than not to succeed”.
There we have a change of wording to Labor's amendment which I think Labor will see the good sense in. It probably raises the bar for the test for a renewed patent from `have reasonable prospects of success' to `more likely than not to succeed' from a 10, 20 or 30 per cent level to a 50 per cent level. It is a tighter wording and a better legal phraseology to ward off the evergreening pressure that will inevitably come to Australia as it has to North America.
By the way, it is worth noting that in Canada they also have an oversight body with professional expertise to assess patent applications and they knock out 50 per cent of them. It is called the Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison. It is something that we should have here—a public body to take action. We should not rely on the generic companies to do so, because in Australia most generic companies are subsidiaries of brand-name pharmaceutical companies anyway. The body, as with the Canadian one, would need both patent expertise and pharmaceutical expertise. That should be a matter of government action and I hope Labor will take that one up if its fortunes are realised and it gets to be the next government. 
Stiff penalties are, of course, a second component to reduce the impact of evergreening. The millions of dollars that could be there are very small relative to the potential billions of dollars that drug companies could make from certain brand names. Then you could have a positive incentive for the generic companies to manufacture a drug, for example a 180-day exclusivity period for the first generic company to enter the market—that is, it would be protected from competition from other generic manufacturers for those 180 days. The ALP amendment only addresses one of those components and, of course, it does not address the appeal or review mechanism at all, which hovers now over the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme with the prospect of rising prices. Again, the Greens have come forward with an amendment to tighten up Labor's amendment, which is not strong enough and which will be easy game for the big pharmaceutical companies.
I want to follow up on what Senator Harris had to say about the Prime Minister's lunchtime press conference. First of all the Prime Minister says that you cannot see the legal advice. He will not show it to you—it would be a threat to the country and Mr Latham had better not show it to you either. We are debating this matter in the parliament and I think it is a matter that should be debated by all parties and it should be available to be seen by all parties. We can judge whether or not it is in the public interest. That aside, he does have this extraordinary letter from Mr Zoellick—read President Bush. It says that the United States is not going to intervene now and say what it thinks about this fairly trifling amendment that the Labor Party has brought in, which is causing so much domestic dispute and headlines in Australia. It says, `Put that through your parliament or whatever over there; we reserve the right to act on it later.'
This is John Howard at his most transparent. Here is the Prime Minister coming out for the second time today to talk about this issue and what he says is, `The Labor Party amendment, minor as it is, is a threat to society as we know it. It is a threat to our relationship with the United States.' The United States, backed up by the Prime Minister—he says, `Good on them'—is reserving the right to take action further down the line. Instead of saying, `Go paddle your own canoe,' he says, `Yes, you've got a right to take Australia on during the election campaign after parliament has put this legislation through and it might show the Labor Party up.' Let me warn the Prime Minister, as a friend, about public opinion in Australia. Australians will not like to have the sword of Bushocles hanging over their heads in the run to an election, where President Bush is able to act and say, `We won't have this free trade agreement if the amendment that the opposition put through is not taken off or ameliorated,' or more particularly, `We won't decide until after the election's over; we'll just leave everybody in a state of tension and apprehension.'
That is a Prime Minister John Howard special. Leave people feeling anxious in the run to the election. He does it every time. He is building it up now and his friend Mr Zoellick at the behest of the White House and George W. Bush is saying, `Hey, we can worry people over there in Australia. We'll leave this all messy and you can blame the opposition.' What a patently transparent, poor piece of politics this is. Instead of the Prime Minister defending this country, he is sending letters to the White House to enhance his election strategy. That is reprehensible, but it is getting a bit obvious, isn't it? The Prime Minister might just come a cropper if he tries to hang the threat of the American drug companies running this country and its pharmaceutical prices over the head of the electorate in the run to the next election. Let him try it. As far as the Greens are concerned, we think that Labor has caved in. It is not just pharmaceuticals; it is all those other issues, from quarantine to jobs to cultural content. 
But what this episode shows is that the United States corporations know that all they have to do is wait for a bit—wait until it is all out of the parliament, get the signatures on the paper and have the exchange of letters that finalises the matter—and then they can strike. They do not have to come to the parliament and they do not have to be worried by any legal systems in Australia. They go to what is called a joint committee—appointed, no doubt, with their assent, by the governments—this ayatollah of trade, and say, `We've got a dispute here. Here's what our lawyers say. Settle it for us.' The Australian people cannot stand in that court and put their point of view, and neither can the American people; it is just a corporate fight-out. At the end of the day, if Australia loses there then the taxpayers pay whatever the penalty is. 
At lunchtime today, Prime Minister Howard held up a bit of paper from the White House and said, `There's a penalty clause here if our democracy asserts itself.' What he did not say is that taxpayers could have to fork out billions of dollars because he signed away our rights. It is extraordinary. He is saying, `Be anxious, everybody. This free trade agreement's unsettling the relationship between us and the United States.' What he should have been saying was, `Be anxious, everybody. You're all locked out. If these drug companies and President Bush don't like the decision made on the last day of sittings of the Senate, it ultimately could end up facing a dispute mechanism with millions or billions of dollars compensation required.' Alarmist? Ask the Canadians. Alarmist? Ask the Mexicans who have been at the wrong end of suits brought under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The powerful corporate sector, in this case the pharmaceutical industry, are quiet. Have you noticed? The big corporations are not saying anything on either side. They have gone quiet on this issue because they know it is in their interest to get this legislation through this Senate, have the exchange of letters completed between President Bush and John Howard, and then strike—with this corporate-friendly, faceless joint committee which is out of the reach of the parliament and the people of both countries.

The goal of the free trade agreement is to provide improved access for Australian goods and services—this is from our perspective—to facilitate economic growth and to look towards our goal of employing a further 30,000 Australian employees. Senator Brown laughs at that. The Greens do not believe in economic growth; they just talk about redistribution. That is what we are seeking to do. 
—Answer the question.
—Senator Brown is engaged in a filibuster. He is now putting down amendments to amendments, and so it goes on. I was answering the question. What I was about to say is that we are determined that the benefits that Australia can get out of the free trade agreement will not be achieved by sacrificing important protections and values within our existing system. In the aspect of public health that we have been talking about, the benefits that flow to Australians through our PBS system in relation to the cost of medicines, we have been saying that that will not be affected by the free trade agreement. It was an area that the Australian government were determined to protect, and it is an area which the Australian government remain confident we have protected. We therefore have a win-win outcome. We provide the opportunity for further economic growth, with all the benefits that flow to all Australians from that, whilst at the same time preserving and protecting a system designed to ensure that Australians have access to affordable medicines. I am very pleased that, out of a very long and difficult negotiation, we were able to achieve that win-win outcome.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I have a series of questions. They all relate specifically to the PBS component of the free trade agreement, not to the general benefits that the government's spurious claims relate to, which are based on no analysis. They believe there will be an increase in jobs, even though the study they are quoting provides for a loss of jobs in a whole raft of about a dozen different sectors. These questions relate specifically to these changes. Does the government believe that there is any public health benefit to be provided by making these specific changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—We are debating the opposition amendments. It remains our view that, fundamentally, the opposition amendments are not necessary—that the protections we pledged to maintain have been achieved through the agreement and the implementing legislation before the chamber. However, we are realistic enough to know that we are not going to be able to implement the free trade agreement without the votes of the opposition. The benefits of being able to achieve our goal of implementing the agreement as a whole are overwhelming. Therefore we are prepared to agree to the opposition amendments. We do have some concerns about their consistency with the agreement. We made representations to the opposition asking them to, in some way, improve their amendments so that that issue would be less likely to be a problem. But, because of where we are in the electoral cycle and their focus on wanting to demonstrate that they have confidence in their position, they were not prepared to accept the representations that we made to them.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I am trying to be really specific with the questions. I am just looking for answers; I am not looking for political speeches about your view and the Labor Party's view on legal opinions and about putting in place arrangements that require more legal opinions to be got. I am actually looking for answers about the changes that are being made to the Therapeutic Goods Act by this implementing legislation, not the specific amendments that the Labor Party is putting forward. I am looking for answers about the changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act that the government has agreed to that would be enacted in the implementing legislation we are being asked to pass. Does the government have a view as to whether there are any public health benefits from the particular changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act that we are being asked to vote on? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I want to ask for clarification from the minister. But, before doing that, I will make it very clear that at the commencement of this committee stage the question was put to this chamber: is it the wish of the committee to take the bill as a whole? The answer was yes. So the inference that we keep on getting from Senator Hill that our questions are not related to specific amendments does not stand because it is the right of any senator to raise questions on the complete bill. My questions are in context because we are speaking about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
I just want to draw your attention to something I find somewhat amusing. We have sections in the bill that refer to ROOs, the rules of origin. We have sections that have the alphabetical suffix of BAD. I am just wondering whether there is any link with the Prime Minister having his press conference in the blue room today. According to a document from the Prime Minister's own web site, during that press conference the Prime Minister stated:
Can I start by reiterating that the Free Trade Agreement does not in any way weaken the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Free Trade Agreement will not in any way lead to increases in the price of medicines or pharmaceuticals in Australia. ... I would never and Mr Vaile would never have agreed to the FTA if that had been the case.
I put this question to Senator Hill again: how do you reconcile the Prime Minister's statement today with the commitment made by Minister Vaile in the exchange of letters between himself and the US Trade Representative, Mr Robert Zoellick, in paragraph 4, which says, `Australia shall provide opportunities to provide for an adjustment to the price of a pharmaceutical under the PBS'? If there was no intention of providing that legal avenue to apply for increases, why did Australia ever agree to that section being in the side letters?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—Whilst I take some advice on that particular issue, I will try to answer the previous question that Senator Harris put to me. As best I understood it, there was a concern about price. I want to draw Senator Harris's attention to the very significant growth of generics within the PBS under the existing system—a growth that we believe will continue and that might even improve with the modifications that are included in this enabling legislation in relation to listing. There are now more than 700 generic products on the PBS, covering more than 180 different medicines. They already represent about 20 per cent of PBS-subsidised medicines. As I just said, the role of generic medicines is likely to expand over the next few years as the patents of several high-cost drugs are expected to expire. Somebody made mention of that this morning as if these changes would be a threat to that occurring, which is not correct.
As a matter of interest, the way price referencing works under the PBS is tougher than in most other countries. We have recently strengthened price referencing. We have improved the method for comparing monthly treatment costs within particular groups of drugs. The impact is that, when a generic product is listed on the PBS at a price lower than its branded counterparts, the list price for the branded counterparts comes down to the level of the generic. That is consistent with our view that not only do we want the generics to get a fair opportunity because they provide downward pressure on prices but also we want to make sure that that flows through. 
Also, where appropriate, generic drugs are fast-tracked onto the PBS in a matter of weeks and the changes I mentioned a moment ago, we believe, through greater transparency, are going to even further improve that listing process. They should be able to be fast-tracked because they are the same chemical entity as the branded version of the product and therefore do not need to be evaluated by the PBAC.
I would also like to remind Senator Harris of the changes that we included in the 2002-03 budget as a specific initiative to encourage participation by generic companies and uptake of generic medicines by consumers. These included changes to prescribing software to prevent software defaulting to the prescribing of branded product to the exclusion of the generic product, provision of generic medicines information for pharmacists and consumers and to increase awareness and understanding as part of the overall PBS awareness campaign. In exchange for these initiatives, generic companies offered price cuts on a wide range of generic products. As a result of that, the price of dozens of generic products was reduced and their branded equivalent price was referenced to them.
Contrary to what is being said by some, the government is very supportive of generics. It has a track record that demonstrates real efforts to assist the generic side of the industry and that assistance is being manifested in increased access and better price outcomes. As I have been saying for four days, there was nothing that the government was going to do in the free trade agreement with the United States that was in any way going to prejudice the benefits that we see from that growth in generics. We believe it is in the Australian national interest. That growth potential is something we will always determine to preserve.
I think it was Senator Harris who was talking about the purchase of drugs and asking why there seems to be a distinction. As I understand it, it is likely to flow from the fact that Medicade in the United States, I am advised, purchases the drugs and then resells them; whereas the PBS system in Australia is a subsidy rather than a purchase-reselling system. You may well find the language is different because it is being applied to differing systems. In neither case is the agreement intended in any way to reduce the capacity to obtain cheaper products through the generic options. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I thank Senator Hill for that clarification of Medicade. I now understand that they purchase the drugs and use them for resale. The document also says:
Procurement of pharmaceutical products by the Veterans Administration (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) is excluded from the Pharmaceutical Annex of the agreement ...
I assume from the terminology that the Veterans Administration would appear to be a statutory body within the US and obviously the Department of Defense would be. How is it that there is an inconsistency that the purchase of pharmaceuticals for what I believe to be those two government departments can be excluded by the American government? Are there any equivalent exclusions in the agreement for Australia's benefit?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—Again we are looking at two fundamentally different systems. As I understand it, the veterans body in the United States also purchases drugs. So you have different institutions—and I am not sure of the structure—with different ways of delivering products to their constituency. In Australia, the PBS system which we have is a universal system. I am not quite sure what Senator Harris is getting at, whether he is now concerned for the interests of Australian drug producers in terms of their access into the United States, which is the flipside of what we have been talking about. We sought to negotiate an agreement that gave us the widest access, which is the trade benefit, but also did not sacrifice the price protection Australians have, which is the PBS. We got the best option we could negotiate in terms of the access without having to sacrifice anything under the PBS. That is what we sought to achieve and we are pleased that we were able to achieve that outcome.  ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I make a final point. I understand from Senator Hill's answer the difference between the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the process in the United States. In the US the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense can purchase pharmaceuticals and resell them. My question to Senator Hill was not so much about access for Australia but about our negotiating position. If America is able to exclude from the agreement purchases by those two federal departments, is Australia able to negotiate an equivalent protection of purchases for our consumption?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—That is the point I am making. On our side, the protection we needed was to maintain the PBS, to not have to make concessions under the PBS that could threaten the price protection that is inherent within it. That was a no-go zone as far as we were concerned, and we are satisfied that the outcome does not in any way threaten that system. I have heard nothing in the four days of the debate in here or before it that, in my mind, questions that reality.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—I want to follow on with some questions on the PBS. I note that the government have relied upon the claim by the Centre for International Economics that the PBS provisions themselves will not raise the price of medicines in Australia. I ask the minister: if that is the case, why did the government think a separate review mechanism was needed in the free trade agreement in parallel to what is already a good system of both assessment and pricing through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee? That seems an anomaly to me, unless there is some rationale as to why the government thought that it ought to be included in the free trade agreement. 
If the government are convinced that the price of medicines will not increase, why have that provision in the free trade agreement in the first place? Is it not possible even at this late stage to have, for example, an exchange of letters with the United States to make it very clear and beyond doubt that the PBS or the review mechanism at least is to be removed? Doesn't the review mechanism agreed to by the government provide an opportunity for US pharmaceutical corporations to exert pressure and influence over the way that the assessments are conducted and, I suppose, on pricing itself? If the end result is to push up prices, will that not mean an increase not only in the price of medicines but also in the cost of running the PBS in this country and the cost of the copayments arrangement? 
Will the minister explain why it is that, if the government are convinced that the price of medicines will not rise, the review mechanism is there at all? You do not need a review mechanism when you have a very satisfactory system—one that already enjoys the confidence of the Australian people. Why is the review mechanism there? If he could provide some information about that, that would be useful. It is not enough to say that the price of medicines will not increase. Why have the government allowed what are essentially foreign corporations to have an institutionalised arrangement to request reviews about the assessment of drugs put on the PBS list in this country? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I guess the short answer is that it was something that was sought, and the Australian negotiators saw no downside in it. I remind the honourable senator that the review mechanism is available only in cases where the PBAC recommends that a drug not be added to the PBS. It gives an unsuccessful applicant an opportunity, but they would have to identify grounds for review and those grounds must relate to issues raised in the rejection of the drug for PBS listing by the PBAC. 
Reviews will be conducted by an independent expert, who will make comments back to the PBAC. The review process will not have the power to overturn the listing decisions of the PBAC. The PBAC will remain the gatekeeper to the PBS. In fact, it is possible to argue that the review mechanism provides increased transparency, which is perhaps a good thing in the PBS listing decision-making process. I have certainly heard senators in this place argue for greater transparency within that process. The review mechanism has been developed in consultation with the PBAC, the pharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders. The review mechanism in no way affects the fundamental architecture of the PBS—that is, the listing and pricing mechanisms for the PBS remain unchanged.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—It is a very curious comment that the minister makes in respect of transparency. He would be aware of the confidentiality provisions in the National Health Act, which effectively prevent the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee from being able to defend itself, particularly if there is a review. In terms of the review mechanism that the government are now agreeing can be put in place, the government have made no effort, from what I can see, to make suitable amendments to the National Health Act that would protect the integrity of the committee. Under that act, they essentially have no capacity to defend themselves because of commercial-in-confidence arrangements. I ask the minister, again, why he thinks the review mechanism needs to be put in place.
I also draw the minister's attention to the behaviour of US pharmaceutical companies in relation to the US administration. Is he aware of the US Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act, which essentially commits the US federal government to purchasing some $US600 billion in pharmaceuticals over the next decade but, at the same time, prohibits the government from using its purchasing power to negotiate better prices for drugs? That is the attitude, practice and behaviour of US pharmaceutical companies as they currently exist, and in this context the government are agreeing on what they see as a very benign inclusion of a review mechanism in the free trade agreement—in parallel, I might add, to a very good system that works in the interests of Australians and is already in place in Australia. 
Why have we allowed the door to be slightly opened for US corporations to seek those sorts of reviews? Isn't it about the price of medicines or at least reviewing things in such a way that the size, power and influence of US pharmaceutical corporations will far outweigh what we would expect under our system? This is particularly pertinent given my mention of the National Health Act. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee cannot defend themselves under commercial-in-confidence arrangements. It is one thing for the minister to talk about transparency, but the reality is that that can be done by those who seek a review. The PBAC will simply not be able to defend themselves, and nor have the government taken steps to ensure that that occurs. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—Senators have raised a whole range of questions that would have been far more appropriately directed to the two detailed parliamentary inquiries that examined this matter. When the experts were sitting across the table, you could have had a person-on-person exchange for hours, but I will do my best. I have taken questions now from three honourable senators and am having trouble keeping track of them, so I will stick to Senator Ridgeway's questions for the moment. 
Senator Ridgeway was developing an argument that there is evidence of drug companies being able to successfully exert power within the US system and was asking why that will not happen here. I think the answer to that is the one that I gave: we have a fundamentally different system. Yes, there can be a review of a decision not to list, but the review process does not have the power to overturn the listing decisions. Therefore, as I said, I certainly cannot see a downside in that or how that can lead to any unreasonable pressure. I would have thought the Democrats would say that, if it leads to greater transparency and more information on the table, it is probably a good outcome.
—Why is it there?
—It is there because it was sought, and we could see no downside. That is the nature of this negotiation. Each side obviously tried to argue for the greatest transparency in the other side's system. Within that there is a certain discipline, and that is probably a good thing. It is hard to quarrel against having the information on the table. The real issue for Australians is whether the Australian PBS and the benefits it provides in subsidised medicines will be under threat, and clearly they will not be.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—On that point, is it the case that, because the PBAC must make public all of its reasons for deciding not to list a drug on the PBS, there is a problem insofar as the agreement acknowledges the rights of innovative drug manufacturers but not the rights of government to negotiate the lowest price? It seems to me that a lot of the criticisms of what you have negotiated are that the principle is there which establishes and recognises the rights of innovative pharmaceutical companies but not the other right—which is part of the PBAC's deliberations and is one of public good—to negotiate a product at the lowest price. Is it not the case that by making those reasons transparent you open up to challenge any decisions in which the rights of the drug manufacturers are not paramount?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I welcome Senator Allison to the debate, but I do not understand that at all. Of course government has a big interest in negotiating the best possible price—government, on behalf of the people, pays the subsidy. I cannot understand that argument.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—So why was there not a principle included in the free trade agreement that acknowledges the government's right, if you like, to recognise the need to deliver pharmaceuticals at the lowest possible cost? That is the big criticism. That is what all the academics are saying is wrong with this free trade agreement—that you have recognised the rights of innovative drug manufacturers but you do not have written in the rights of consumers and taxpayers to low-cost medicines. Those rights are not written in. When it comes down to pharmaceutical companies taking action against the PBAC on the basis of their very transparent reasons for not listing, the argument goes that they are in a very strong position to take action because the decision by the PBAC to not list was weighted against them as innovative drug manufacturers and was taken on the basis of cost effectiveness and the need to deliver low-cost medicines. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—The issue as to how we determine our prices under the PBS was excluded from the agreement. That was our protection. We have a system; the criteria are well known. We believe it works well and ensures affordable medicines. I am amazed to hear Senator Allison's argument. She is in effect suggesting that that system should have been thrown into the negotiation. In this place, obviously I have heard arguments for us improving our PBS, and that is a debate that can always be had, but the debate today is about the PBS in relation to the free trade agreement with the United States, the opportunity for greater access into the US market. As I said, interference with our PBS was a no-go zone for us in this negotiation. We were not prepared to put that on the table. We did not have to. We got a reasonable outcome in terms of increased access without putting it on the table. That is why I say we achieved a win-win outcome.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—Again I ask why it is that the principle is there which recognises the rights of innovative pharmaceutical manufacturers as opposed to generic manufacturers or the public interest, in this case the interest of the Commonwealth, the government, in negotiating lower prices. Why was that corresponding principle not written in? That is what this agreement is most heavily criticised for by people who know much more about patent law and much more about the PBS than I ever will. For them, that is the key problem. What work have you done on that and why was there not a corresponding principle? As I understand it, that principle is in a whole lot of other treaties and in other documents. Documents on public health policy, for instance, have that spelled out explicitly as one of the principles of agreements that are entered into. Why was it not included in the FTA?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—It is difficult to compare this with other agreements unless you have the other agreements on the table and see what is being conceded on both sides. As I said, we were determined to keep the PBS and our listing criteria, pricing structures and so forth out of this negotiation. Now Senator Allison is seemingly saying that we should have added new provisions in relation to the PBS. It might be that these academics want different approaches to the PBS, and within the Australian domestic debate we can have those arguments. But, because we control the PBS, there is no value added in saying so. The issue is what you are conceding. We did not have to concede those matters. Our right to set the prices for our own medicines has not been affected by this agreement or by the implementation law that we have before the chamber today.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—Then can the minister explain what the advantage is in that principle being put into the free trade agreement—that is, the principle that recognises the rights of innovative drug manufacturers. Can you just explain the purpose, as you understand it. I presume that, if you have negotiated an agreement and the other party has come along with this provision that it wants put in, you, as a responsible party, at least understand the implications and motivations behind it. It has to have some reason to be there. What is that reason? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—When I answered Senator Ridgeway, perhaps before Senator Allison came into the chamber, basically I said that the US companies want greater transparency in terms of why a product was not listed. We do not see a downside in that. In fact, as I said, it could even be argued that it provided some upside. That was the last question. Before that, I thought Senator Allison was leading me into a more general discussion of the key principles in relation to the pharmaceutical part of the agreement, in which case I was going to draw her attention to the agreed principles as set out in annex 2-C, which states:
The Parties are committed to facilitating high quality health care and continued improvements in public health for their nationals.
And it sets out the principles, one of which is:
... the need to promote timely and affordable access to innovative pharmaceuticals through transparent, expeditious, and accountable procedures ...
But you can read those as well as I can—and presumably have.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—It is quite right that they talk about innovative drug manufacturers, but they do not talk about generics and they do not talk about affordability or low cost. Those words are not mentioned. Minister, I did not talk about transparency. I am talking about the principle, which is nothing to do with transparency. That is another provision of the agreement that you have signed off on. My specific question was this: why was it necessary on the part of the US—why did the US negotiate—to have this principle inserted in the agreement? And why didn't the government say, `If you are going to have that principle in, we want our principle in—the principle which is in so many of our other documents and which is about affordability, generic brands and lowest possible cost.' It is an unbalanced agreement unless you do that. Did you argue that there needed to be a corresponding balancing principle?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I guess this is a way to fill in a day; we can keep repeating the same points. But affordability is guaranteed by our existing system, which is protected under this agreement. It therefore does not need to be restated: we did not put the PBS system on the table. Why the American negotiators wanted a particular point made from their perspective is an issue for them. As far as we are concerned, we looked to see if there was any downside in their representation and, in this instance, we saw no downside. In fact, as I said to Senator Ridgeway—and I think I said to Senator Nettle—we even saw an arguable benefit to us in terms of greater transparency. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—Earlier I indicated that I would circulate the document that I quoted from. I have done that. It is the US-Australia free trade agreement—questions and answers about pharmaceuticals. I seek leave to table the document.
Leave granted. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—The minister gave an answer a while ago when Senator Ridgeway was asking about why we ended up with a review mechanism. The minister said, `The short answer is it was sought.' That makes me think what a stupendous group of people we have put in charge of negotiating an agreement. The United States pharmaceutical companies put pressure on their government to ask, `Can we have this?' and the Australian government's argument why a review mechanism has been included in the trade agreement is `it was sought'. Can the minister explain what has changed since 2000, when the government rejected the idea, which was proposed at that time, for a review mechanism or an appeal mechanism to the PBAC? Former Senator Tambling, who was the parliamentary secretary at the time, reviewed and reported on the matter. He recommended to the relevant minister that it not proceed, and the government accepted that advice and rejected the idea of a review mechanism to the PBS. What, if anything, has changed since that time that has made the Australian government believe that it is an appropriate thing to do? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I do not recall the detail of that recommendation. But if Senator Nettle is assuring me that it is in the same terms as the one in this agreement, which I presume is correct—I am sure that she would not seek to mislead me—it might not be the total answer but in part at least the answer is the very significant benefits that we get under this free trade agreement in terms of growing the Australian economy and providing jobs. Then we looked at specific requests from the party—and this, I am told, was the specific request from the US side—we assessed if there was any downside to that request and we assessed that there was not.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—It is an answer, Minister, for you to say, `We were given the advice that we didn't need it and we rejected it in 2000.'
—No, I didn't say that.
—Your information is on the record. The answer that you have given is that you believe there were other benefits in the trade agreement which outweighed the argument of the Australian government continuing to stick to the position they held in 2000 that our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme does not need an independent review or appeal mechanism. That is an answer, and I thank you for giving that answer. You have made it perfectly clear why the Australian government changed their position from the position they held in 2000. 
In an answer that the minister gave he put forward the argument that this review mechanism does not result in any changes of pricing for the pharmaceuticals involved. Can the minister explain why the side letter, at point 4 relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, says: 
Australia shall provide opportunities to apply for an adjustment to a reimbursement amount. 
If that is not about providing an opportunity to change the price that the Australian government pays to pharmaceutical companies in the United States, can the minister explain what that point refers to: `an adjustment to a reimbursement amount' in the side letter on the PBS?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,—My advice is that that is existing practice; it currently occurs. Pharmaceutical companies can seek an adjustment of price in changed circumstances.,SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,—It would be good news. They could be responding to competitive pressures. It is impossible for me to comment on the economics of individual drugs in the marketplace. I guess it would be possible to get some historical advice on adjustments that have been sought over the years. ,SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—Have the government done any modelling about what they think will be the financial implications of a review mechanism being put in place? Do they believe that the US drug companies will be asking for a reduction in the price that they pay, or do they believe that perhaps the pharmaceutical companies will be asking for an increase in the price that they pay? Has any modelling been done?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am told that modelling has not been done and that is probably because, if there is a review, there is no obligation to change the previous listing decision.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I do not know whether the minister had the opportunity to see the Four Corners program on this issue last week. A former member of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, Professor David Henry, from the University of Newcastle, was describing the great benefits—there are many—of the scheme that exists in Australia. One of the benefits that he described was that part of the cost-effectiveness, part of being able to keep down the price, is the fact that pharmaceutical companies put a case to the PBAC, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, as to why their drugs should be listed and what the price should be. Often there is a process of back and forth negotiations where the PBAC rejects their application. They are provided with reasons and they do more research and put forward, based on the information they have received from the PBAC, a case as to why they believe they should get a different price. They make adjustments and put forward another case. One of the mechanisms that keeps down the prices that the Australian government pays for the drugs, and which maintains the cost-effectiveness of the model, is this back and forth process of negotiation, whereby the pharmaceutical company puts forward a case, the case is rejected and it then puts forward another case. An inherent factor of the way the PBAC operates is the maintenance of the cap on prices that the Australian government pays.
This review mechanism allows for a pharmaceutical company that has had its application to list a drug on the PBS knocked off at the first opportunity to be able to go to another independent review. Rather than the existing process, where they would rejig the application if they believed they had a case and an argument to put forward and it would be put back to the PBAC, they will now go to an independent review mechanism. Does the minister acknowledge the value of the current system, whereby part of that cost-effectiveness is ensuring that pharmaceutical companies go back, restate their case and put it to the PBAC? Does the minister acknowledge that that is part of what keeps the cap on the prices of pharmaceuticals?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I did not see the program, but if the experts say that that does contribute to downward pressures, I would not quarrel with that. The point I would make is that that option remains available. If the drug companies would prefer to proceed down that path, they will do so. I do not think you should immediately assume that they would choose the review that may be open to them under this provision.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—It is a fair point from the minister that the company has the option of resubmitting an application to the PBAC or going to the review committee. The side letters to the trade agreement on the PBS say explicitly that Australia is providing opportunities to apply for an adjustment in the reimbursement amount. The side letter describes what the review process will do. If you are a pharmaceutical company that has the option of putting back your claim to the PBAC, which makes decisions explicitly about the cost-effectiveness of the drug, or the option of going to a review mechanism that has terms of reference that include providing for an adjustment to the reimbursement amount and support for innovation and research and development, then to me that choice is clear. If you are a pharmaceutical company with the option of a system that rewards innovation and provides opportunities for price changes or the option of another system in which the principles for making that decision include cost-effectiveness as well as medical outcomes, the choice is clear. The minister is right to say they have a choice. Perhaps we have different views as to which path the pharmaceutical company would go down to achieve those outcomes. 
I want to go back to the minister's previous answer that the reason we have this review mechanism is that it was sought. Can the minister be any more explicit about who requested the changes—whether they came directly from Bob Zoellick, the trade representative, or whether the minister is aware of the US pharmaceutical companies putting pressure on the trade representative's office to request those changes? Can the minister confirm that this was an issue that the President of the United States raised directly with the Prime Minister during his visit to Australia last October, as the Prime Minister commented on 2UE at the time? Maybe the minister can advise what the nature of those discussions was and whether any action was taken by Australian officials or ministers in response to the US President's specific direction around this issue.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I do not think that I can, and I really do not think this is the time to try to reconstruct the negotiating process. This was a position put to our negotiators by US negotiators. I think it is reasonable to assume that the relevant constituencies within each country are communicating with the administrations in each country. Even if I knew the answer, I do not think this is the place to canvass who said what to whom and when.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—The minister said the government did no modelling on what the impact of these particular changes might be. Is the minister aware of modelling that has been done by the two academics at the ANU, Dr Tom Faunce and Dr Buddhima Lokuge, in which they predicted that the cost of drugs to state public hospitals would increase by 12 per cent by 2008? Does the government have any response to that modelling that has been put forward by the ANU?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am sorry, I was distracted as I was being provided information relating to a previous question. It is not an easy process that we are engaged in today. That is why I respectfully suggested there might have been a better process over the preceding five months. I got the start of the subject but I missed the punchline.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I had the opportunity to participate in one of the three inquiries that the Senate had into the free trade agreement with the United States. I did not have the opportunity to be a part of the select committee over the last three months, so this is an opportunity for me, as a member of the Senate, to ask these questions of the minister. You have already answered one question by saying that there was no modelling done by the government on the impact of price changes on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Is the government aware of studies done by ANU academics on the impact of higher prices as a result of the free trade agreement on the budgets of state public hospitals? The academics predicted that by 2008 there will be a 12 per cent increase in drug prices for state public hospitals as a result of a delay in generic drugs coming onto the system. Given the government has not done its own modelling, has it taken the time to respond to the modelling done by ANU academics on this issue? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am told that within the Senate inquiry there was a roundtable with all the specialists, and the government advisers put their arguments as to why they believed that modelling was invalid. The problem with the process that you have adopted is that you do not get to speak directly to the specialists. That is why we have parliamentary inquiries. As somebody who is on a rapid learning curve on this subject matter, I cannot see that this review opportunity for a non-listed product could be in any way relevant to the pace of getting generics onto the list. If it is relevant in any way, I would have thought that it would be beneficial. I am not going to go through all the statistics again, but we are already seeing rapid growth of generics onto the list. We believe that is a good thing and something that should be supported. We certainly were not prepared to negotiate an outcome where that would be in any way threatened.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I am sorry, Minister, I did not make it clear. I had moved on to another area in which the government has negotiated to undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—that is, patents and the delaying of generics coming onboard because of evergreening processes. I have moved off the review section and am back on evergreening, which is the subject of the amendments we are dealing with now. I want to check the minister's previous answer about representatives from the Department of Health and Ageing and the trade negotiators' meeting with community groups. Are we talking about a meeting that happened in early March of 2004, which I understand were consultations by the Department of Health and Ageing with a raft of community groups? Is that the same meeting we are talking about?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—No, I am told that was another one. This was a PBS roundtable. I am more than happy if Senator Nettle wants to move onto the issue of the amendments before the chamber. Obviously, we have been very focused on the issue of the adequacy of our existing patent laws and whether there is any way in which practices that are sometimes utilised within the United States—and I think some argue Canada—could come into play in the Australian system. We are sure, as I have said earlier in this debate, that that could not occur.
I start to run into some personal experiences of sitting down with patent officials last week and others and discussing the operation of the system. I am satisfied that it is working well. The law is different to that in the United States, and I could go into that if it was really of interest to the chamber. The application of the law seems to be handled very efficiently. It seems to me that in the end even the Labor Party recognised that this would not become a threat to generics within Australia and that is why they switched tack onto injunctions from the patent listing procedures in this country.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I will continue questioning about the delay of generics. I was asking about the consultation the Department of Health and Ageing had with the negotiators and community groups in early March. My understanding from the community groups who were there—and indeed one of them talks about this in its submission to the select committee—is that representatives of the Department of Health and Ageing conceded that, as a result of the free trade agreement, delays in the introduction of generic pharmaceuticals can be expected. I understand that a transcript of the meeting was requested at the time and the individuals were originally told no. Subsequently, they were told they would be able to get one. To date, I understand it has not been supplied and I am wondering whether a transcript of that meeting is available and can be supplied to the chamber. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,—We seem to be in doubt as to which meeting Senator Nettle is talking about. There was apparently one meeting for which there was a transcript and another meeting for which there was not.,SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I am looking at one that occurred in early 2004. There were about 20 people there, including Stephen Deady, the chief negotiator; senior Department of Health and Ageing officials; representatives from—

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—We think the one that Senator Nettle was referring to was a community consultation, of which there is not a transcript. It was not recorded. I am getting a lot of nodding to that answer. But the same people, I gather, appeared before the Senate select committee under the guise of a PBS roundtable, including at least one of the academics.
—I think Tom Faunce was there.
—He is the one I had in mind. I am not sure about the other one. There were also health department officials and trade officials. I am told that they covered the same ground, that there was a transcript of that process and that transcript is available.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I move to another area of questioning now. Still within pharmaceuticals, annex 2-C5 headed `Dissemination of information' says:
Each Party shall permit a pharmaceutical manufacturer to disseminate to health professionals and consumers through the manufacturer's Internet site registered in the territory of the Party, and on other Internet sites registered in the territory of the Party linked to that site ...
My understanding is—and the minister can correct me if this is not the case—that direct marketing from pharmaceutical companies to consumers is prohibited under the law in Australia. Direct marketing to doctors is not prohibited, but direct marketing to consumers is illegal in Australia. This section of the annex talks about pharmaceutical manufacturers being able to put their information on the Internet. That would appear to me to be direct marketing to consumers because, clearly, we cannot limit access to the Internet only to doctors, who can currently be marketed to. Can the minister explain that issue and explain whether the agreement contravenes the current legal situation in Australia?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—The short answer, I am told, is that direct marketing is illegal in Australia except through the Internet, which is not illegal. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—On that point, it is my understanding that it is illegal in Australia at the present time to advertise pharmaceutical products on the Internet and that this was given up in the agreement. As I understand it, there is a blanket ban on pharmaceutical advertising, unlike in the US where there is plenty of it and it has driven up the costs of pharmaceuticals and the demand for the high-end, expensive pharmaceuticals as opposed to generics. Typically, people see expensive drugs advertised and go along to their GPs and say, `I must have those.' So there is a lot of pressure on GPs to prescribe expensive brands. As I understand it, part of the FTA was to water down our advertising ban by allowing it on the Internet.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—Without the free trade agreement, the position would be as I have just said. You could argue that, if there was nothing in the free trade agreement, the position that existed beforehand that goods could be advertised through the Internet would still be possible. The free trade agreement recognises that situation but provides that, if there is going to be dissemination of information through the Internet, then it must include a balance of risks and benefits and encompass all indications for which the parties' competent regulatory authorities have approved the marketing of the pharmaceuticals. It must be truthful, not misleading and so forth. So, in some ways you could argue that, if you were unhappy with this communication through the Internet, under the free trade agreement there is an attempt to provide conditions on it that I think most people would support.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I guess we all know that there are very considerable difficulties in regulating communications on the Internet. The Senate has addressed that issue before in different contexts; nevertheless, the agreement provides that, if this were to occur, there is an obligation on the states to ensure that what is being communicated is truthful, as well as the other conditions that I have mentioned. How effective the states will be in doing that is really another issue.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—I would like to clarify that answer.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am not sure why I am reading something that Senator Allison can just as effectively read.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,—I would like to ask some questions about the independent review. Who will be involved in determining what material is to be kept confidential in the review process? What sort of criteria will be used to determine what material needs to be kept confidential?,SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—We are off the Senate amendment and back onto the review process. The company will presumably argue that certain information is commercial-in-confidence. Until I get better advice, I think it would be the reviewer who would make judgment upon that, the independent expert conducting the review; but I would like my officials to reflect on that.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I would be very confident that the appointed independent reviewer would not be one who had a conflict of interest.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—As I understand it, in terms of the selected panel members as part of that review, the disciplines that are mentioned do not include public health. Can an explanation be provided as to why that would be the case, given the public health interest in the PBS?
 (Senator Brandis)—I am sorry, Senator Allison, the minister was distracted. Do you want to ask your question again?
—The question was: in terms of the selection of expert members to the panel as a part of that independent review, why does the list of relevant disciplines in which those members could have expertise not include public health?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I want to ask some questions about another area of the free trade agreement that will undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—that is, the medicines working group. Minister, can you provide to us any terms of reference that will exist for the medicines working group?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I understand there is a consultation working group and that there are materials in relation to it on the web site of the Department of Health and Ageing. As Senator Nettle would know, the agreement makes reference to the medicines working group, that the parties agree to establish the group, and it sets out the objective, which is to `promote discussion and mutual understanding of the issues'. It says:
(c) The Working Group shall comprise officials of federal government agencies responsible for federal healthcare programs and other appropriate federal government officials.
I gather there is a process in place that is being led by the department of health on the Australian side to work out exactly how this will operate in practice.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—Minister, can you inform the chamber of the time frame for determining how this will work? We are considering the enabling legislation for the free trade agreement and this is a significant component of the free trade agreement. It appears we are being expected to pass legislation whilst an ongoing process is occurring on how the implementation of this component of the free trade agreement will occur. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am told that Minister Abbott has already published a statement that the working group will include representatives of the PBAC, industry and consumers. The timeline that I understand they are working towards is September. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—So the working group comprises members of the PBAC, Medicines Australia, the industry lobby group and a consumer representative. The document has called for comments to be presented to the Department of Health and Ageing by 20 August 2004. I am wondering why we are being asked to pass this free trade agreement before the date for determining how the implementation of this process, as a part of the trade agreement, is going to occur. We are still eight days away from the department's deadline for receiving comment about how this committee under the US-Australia free trade agreement might operate. What is the rationale for having the vote eight days before comments are even received from the public about how the process of implementing the agreement will occur?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I think the answer is that there are probably a lot of implementation processes that still lie ahead. That is not at all surprising. You negotiate a framework agreement, you negotiate implementation legislation and each party has to consider the other's implementation. You move ultimately to bring the agreement into effect. I have not counted them, but I suspect there are many different bodies that are established to facilitate the operation of the agreement. I do not find that surprising at all.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—I thank the minister for his answer. I suspect that you are right, Minister. I suspect that there are more and more. As we go through each of the different areas of the trade agreement, we find extra parliamentary committees that have been set up to make decisions about the implementation of the trade agreement for which terms of reference, membership and processes for public involvement have not been set. These are all for committees far outside the process, the scope, the ambit, the claim, the review of the Senate and the parliament.
—But not outside the scope of the agreement.
—No, they are part of the agreement. They are part of the agreement, which includes a large number of committees which sit outside of the scope of this parliament, to which the executive appoints a number of individuals who make decisions about how the agreement is implemented both in Australia and overseas. I agree that this trade agreement does that and provides that opportunity to the executive government to determine how the trade agreement will be implemented; this is another example of that. It is not something the Greens are supportive of. That is why we have had a series of amendments to try to bring that scrutiny, that sovereignty for decision making about our laws and agreements that have been made and implemented, back into the parliamentary process. This is another example of that and we are not supportive of it.
 (Senator Brandis)—The question is that Australian Greens' amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 4384 to opposition amendment (2) on sheet 4371 be agreed to.
Question negatived.
—The question is that opposition amendments (1) to (4) on sheet 4371 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—The Democrats oppose schedule 7 in the following terms:
(13)	Schedule 7, page 80 (line 2) to page 83 (line 12), to be opposed.
Amendment (13) effectively takes out schedule 7. Schedule 7, as we know, brings in a new certification scheme in which generic manufacturers must either certify that they will not infringe a patent or certify that they have notified the patent holder of their intention to market a drug. While this does not in and of itself delay the introduction of generic medications, we argue that it is likely to do so by deterring generic manufacturers from bringing the drug onto the market until all potential litigations have been dealt with. Our amendment simply strikes out all of the changes being proposed by the government and maintains the status quo.
We are essentially arguing with this amendment that we do not want to see any changes put in place as a result of the free trade agreement. Overall there are about 50 provisions within the legislation, not all of which are caught up with this legislation, that we say undermine the capacity of the Australian government to determine which drugs will be put on the PBS and which drugs can come off patent and be replaced by generics, and that undermine the capacity to promote affordability in drugs that are on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. So we see no reason whatsoever for this schedule. There are some arguments for transparency for this and that but we see no arguments at all that suggest that this is in our interests. We maintain the argument that changes to the PBS have been used as a trade-off for other changes under the free trade agreement, which may or may not be beneficial. Of course, there is certainly no agreement one way or the other on that.
We would rather not be dealing with any legislation relating to the PBS in this environment. There are unknown implications for our health system. The PBS should never have been on the table as part of a trade deal. The government promised us it would not be. It turned out to be. This amendment would effectively remove that important provision, as I said, which requires generic manufacturers to certify that they will not infringe a patent or certify that they have notified the patent holder of their intention to market a drug.
It is pretty obvious that the pharmaceutical manufacturers very much want this. They have been talking about these kinds of amendments for a long time. It is obvious that they will put in place measures to try to delay so-called evergreening—to try to delay the generic brand coming on stream. It must be the case that this provision would give the pharmaceutical companies some advantage. I would be really appreciative of the minister giving us assurances that there will be absolutely no disadvantage to Australia from this provision. But I doubt he can do that. Until we are satisfied that this is the case, the Democrats are not interested in supporting schedule 7.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—We have been debating these issues at length under other amendments and in our general discussion of both the implementation bill and the agreement itself. The issue raised by Senator Allison is: are generics disadvantaged under the implementation provisions? We have said that we sought to ensure that generics would not be disadvantaged. In fact, we are very supportive of the growth of generics. Earlier today I outlined to the chamber the extent of that growth in recent years, the benefits of that growth in keeping prices down and also specific initiatives that the government has taken in recent years to assist the growth of generics. I would argue that that establishes a background of a government that is very committed to this sector. That is not surprising because the PBS system is a government subsidy system and a very expensive one. We have had long and difficult debates on that issue in other circumstances in the Senate in the last few years. It is obvious that it is in the interests of government to maintain a downward pressure on costs.
To that background, we put to the chamber again that we went into this negotiation with a determination to protect the generic sector. We believe we have achieved that. When you look at what is required of that part of the sector, you see that it is not in any way onerous and, I would suggest, not in any way unreasonable. To be required to certify that the applicant does not propose to market therapeutic goods in circumstances that would involve infringement of a patent or to certify that the applicant does not propose to market the therapeutic good before the expiry of a patent is certainly not unreasonable. That the applicant has notified the patentee about its application to include goods in the register does not seem to me to be in any way unreasonable either. It is simply ensuring that the proper information is given and the relevant administrative authority has the information before it in order to process the application.
Senator Allison asks me whether I can assure the chamber. I repeat: the government is confident that these provisions do not in any way prejudice a growth in this part of the sector, that that growth will continue and that those medicines will benefit Australian consumers. Basically, that is what the PBS is all about and it is that system that we designated as a no-go zone from the start of these negotiations.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,—I would be grateful if the minister could explain exactly how this works to benefit Australian consumers.,SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—It ultimately benefits consumers in that it contributes to a more open system, one where special interests cannot be hidden, where full information is on the table and where the regulatory authorities are therefore best able to carry out their tasks in an effective way. So you cannot argue that there is a specific dollar benefit; rather, you look at the ultimate effect of the provision that is put in place. Our argument in trying to deliver a system that is more transparent and accountable is that it has to be in the public interest. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—Perhaps the minister can take advice about examples where this advice might have been useful had it been available to the body doing the decision making. How is this useful to us as opposed to the United States pharmaceutical companies? That is the gist of my question. You say that the transparency helps the decision-making body to make the right decisions. Can we have examples of where, in the past, under the current arrangements, that has been a problem? How is that a problem for us now that can be overcome by this measure? How will we be better off?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I cannot provide an answer in the terms that Senator Allison is seeking, but a system that is more transparent, that better reflects and that in a fair way recognises the interests of both parties—a patent holder and an applicant seeking to have a generic medicine registered—and that has within it greater accountability has to be in the public interest. 
I made the point that I do not think the Democrats are prepared to accept—it certainly seems to me to be valid—that if we are talking about the bottom line being quality medicines at fair and affordable prices, we have an interest in encouraging both the pharmaceutical companies that are prepared to invest huge sums of money in new products whilst at the same time also encouraging those who are prepared to promote generic alternatives. Looking at the trend of the PBS in recent years, it seems to me that that has been basically heading in the right direction. Whether there will be a net benefit with the adoption of these amendments is difficult to say. I could try to develop an argument to suggest that there might be, but the test will be over time. However, I cannot see how the argument about what is unreasonable about it and how that could be translated into higher prices stands up at all.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—Why is it that this is just about generics? Why did Australia not negotiate as part of the agreement for, say, pharmaceutical companies to give notice prior to bringing in a new so-called `innovative' drug—the so-called `me-too' drugs where they change a molecule here or there or do a minor modification to that pharmaceutical—and claiming that it requires a new patent? Typically this happens at the end of a patent period. The pharmaceutical companies say, `This is coming off patent so we'll create a new one which is just like the old one, except that we can argue under the patent laws that this is different.' As I understand it, the majority of cases which come before our courts are related to the question: why was there not a requirement that any company whose drug was coming close to the end of the patent would need to advise whoever might be interested in the fact that they intended to replace that with a me-too type drug?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—This is moving away from the provisions that are included within the implementation bill and referring back to the effectiveness of Australia's existing patent law, which is another debate we have had, and in effect expressing a concern that the experiences that have occurred in the United States under their law might translate to Australia. The best advice that we have is that that is simply not going to occur, largely because of the differences in law that does not facilitate it in this country and in the administration of the Patents Act. 
In the circumstances that Senator Allison outlined, a new patent would simply not be given. Furthermore, under our legal system you do not have the same opportunity to hold up a generic whilst you debate it within the patent registration system. As I said, even the Labor Party after a week of agony have come to the conclusion that the Australian patent system is sound and that the sorts of abuses that Senator Allison outlined have not occurred historically within this country and are not going to occur under existing law. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-12,"—Minister, there are cases right now on this very subject in our courts. As I referred to earlier, the Clayton Utz paper—which was circulated to most senators a few days ago—demonstrates that this is precisely what the current arguments are. To suggest that there is no so-called `evergreening' in this country already is quite false. It has already been established that these are the kinds of cases that are currently out there. I do not think you are able to assure us at all that this is not simply going to make it easier for those pharmaceutical companies to keep generics out of the scene. I would have to say that it is not very convincing. The reference in this document says:
Most of the Australian patent action in 2003—
and there has been quite a lot—
has been in connection with the introduction of bio-equivalent generic pharmaceuticals in challenge to the monopolies which are guarded jealously by the innovator pharmaceutical companies. In this regard, the Federal Court currently has litigation before it concerning omeprazole, paroxetine, epirubasin and other products. The 'generic v big pharma' battles are very interesting because it remains to be seen whether Australian courts will follow the very firm lead given by the UK courts which are now effectively obliging generics entering the market to obtain declarations of non-infringement and/or challenge the big pharma patents before launching their products.
That last sentence seems to be precisely what this legislation is doing—to oblige the generics entering the market to obtain declarations of non-infringement. That seems to me to be going down the path of accommodating big pharmaceutical companies. The report goes on to say: 
The power of the big pharmas is seen as well in the current free trade agreement negotiations between Australia and the US which involve the US seeking major concessions from Australia with respect to access to the Australian market ... 
I repeat: major concessions with respect to access to the Australian market for US pharmaceutical companies. The report continues:
The US wants Australia to modify its PBS reimbursement scheme so as to ensure that US pharmaceutical companies are able to charge higher prices for their products in Australia, the increase being funded by an increased PBS subsidy. 
This is not some radical lobby group. This report was prepared by Clayton Utz, who do a great deal of work in intellectual property law and who did this analysis last year. That is what they say; I am not making it up. It is not as if the Democrats or the Greens or anyone else are imagining that this is a possibility. It is coming from academics, as we have already said. It is coming from lawyers and people who work in this field. It is certainly coming from advocacy groups, who are very worried about it. It is not coming so much from the generic manufacturers because, as we all know, they are mostly owned by the pharmaceutical companies. I think it is a real concern, Minister, and I do not know that you have satisfied us that it is not a problem.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-12,"—The Prime Minister this morning said: `No Prime Minister in his right mind would agree to any agreement which weakend the PBS.' It is one of the most thought-provoking statements from the Prime Minister in a long while. That being so, one has to ask: what on earth is the PBS doing on the ER table for the free trade agreement? What is it doing there at all? The best way to make it safe is to keep pharmaceuticals outside the reach of the free trade agreement. In fact that is the only way you can say that there is not going to be a change that might weaken the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 
It was a classic statement from the Prime Minister who is so adept at saying: `Trust me. I'm making a decision for the nation. He's got weapons of mass destruction,' and, `Boat people could be terrorists and they throw their children overboard.' In this case, he is saying: `The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is totally safe because I say so. But I've put it into the reach of the free trade agreement, just the same.' That is daft. I do not believe it. Millions more, I suspect, do not believe it either and will not when they see the results of this free trade agreement. The Democrats and the Greens have said: `Let's make sure. Let's take the Therapeutic Goods Administration amendments out of the reach of the free trade agreement.' That action would achieve what the Prime Minister has assured us is the case anyway, but it would make it totally safe.
 The opposition is going to join the government in voting down the Democrats' and the Greens' amendments. Why is that? The drug corporations have more than the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in mind. They have a couple of countries now opened to them for maximising their profit lines, and they are amongst the most profitable—if not the most profitable—industry in the United States because they rip the tripe out of the wallets and purses of people who are sick. They charge three to four times the prices that people in Australia pay now for major drugs for curing or offsetting cancer and for treating chest disease, heart disease, arthritis and a whole range of other illnesses. That is not ethical or humanitarian; it is all about making big dollars.
One of the worries these companies have, of course, is the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which is about delivering affordable medicines to people who have those diseases. Instead of making those sick folk feel safe by saying, `The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is out of the reach of the free trade agreement'—a very simple thing to do—the Prime Minister left it right in there. The Labor Party has decided to leave it right in there too. The Democrats and the Greens—and I guarantee One Nation, as well—would take it right out, but we do not have the numbers. It is not going to be much good coming back a bit later and saying, `The Prime Minister proved that he was not of right mind back in 2004'—waiting for this example to come true. I do not think the Prime Minister is in a right-thinking frame of mind in putting Australia under the thrall of this free trade agreement. But he just loves it. It does his heart good to be promoting trade in this way, at the expense of all the other values that are being sold out at the same time. Unfortunately, the Labor Party is going to support it.
This is a critical amendment. It would protect our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme 100 per cent—we would not have to trust somebody's word or work out whether somebody was of sound or right mind by putting the PBS into this threatened zone. Unfortunately, we will have to wait to find out and, if the Prime Minister is shown not to have been in his right mind when he did this, it will be too late. We will not be able to back out. The question is: is the Labor Party in its right mind or will it vote down the amendment from the Democrats and the Greens? We are about to see.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I asked the minister a question about the legal status of advertising directly to consumers via the Internet. I have just gone on to the Therapeutic Goods Administration web site, and it indicates that advertising directly to consumers is not permitted, and that is also stated in a media release by the National Prescribing Service. I flag that as something that the minister could check and get back to us with an answer, or a clarification if needed. 
—That's what I said.
—I remember the minister said that currently you can advertise directly to consumers via the Internet. 
—Via the Internet you can, but not otherwise.
—The Therapeutic Goods Administration web site says:
Advertising direct to consumers is not permitted (prohibited by the Act).
The caveat that the minister provided in his answer before was `except via the Internet', so I seek clarification. Also, a media release from the National Prescribing Service mentions an article in the journal Australian Prescriber which says: 
... advertising of prescription drugs to the general public is illegal ...
So I seek clarification on that. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—If Senator Nettle wants me to, I will get out the principal act and read the provision, but I am assured that the provision says that advertising to consumers is not permitted; it is prohibited. What is being said is that advertising on the Internet is not advertising directly to consumers.
—Ha, ha!
—It is a question of interpretation. You do not have to believe me.
—That's why I want to find out.
—If you just want to laugh about it, you can laugh and go and read the act yourself. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—That is why I am asking the minister to confirm for me where in the act it says that it is okay to advertise directly to consumers via the Internet. When I look at the Therapeutic Goods Administration web site, it says you cannot advertise directly. It is an absolutely spurious argument to say that putting information on the Internet is not making it available to consumers. That is an absurd argument—to say that you cannot advertise, but if you do it on the Internet it is not advertising. That is ridiculous. If you can find where it says that in the act, sure, I will check it out.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-12,"—If this parliament wants to legislate next year to knock out indirect advertising on the Internet, do we say this applies to everybody except American companies? We would be able to do it then, wouldn't we? But if we say that it applies to US companies, we are infringing their right to flog their drugs on the Internet.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I seek some clarification from Senator Hill as to schedule 7. The section in the government's bill, as it is intended to substitute it, says:
(3) If:
(a) the therapeutic goods are therapeutic devices; and
(b) the evaluation of the goods for registration has been completed;
the Secretary must:
(c) notify the applicant in writing of his or her decision on the evaluation within 28 days of the making of the decision and, in the case of a decision not to register the goods, of the reasons for the decision ... 
That is repeated through different sections of the schedule. My question to Senator Hill is this: for the purpose of this legislation, is the secretary or a delegate of the secretary a public servant? I will just clarify it. I am asking this question: under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, as referred to in schedule 7—are both the secretary and the delegates of the secretary public servants for the purposes of this legislation? In other words, are they public servants? Yes or no?
—The secretary of the department of health is a public servant.
—I take it from Senator Hill's answer there that the secretary of health is the person that is mentioned in this section. I am just seeking clarification. When we read through the section—and I am now speaking to subsection 25(3), but on the opposite page, under 4A: line 5 on page 81—we have these words:
(4A) Civil proceedings do not lie against the Secretary (or a delegate of the Secretary) in respect of loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by another person as a result of the Secretary (or the delegate) including therapeutic goods in the Register in reliance on a certificate required under subsection 26B(1).
I take that to read that the government sees the necessity to protect the secretary or a delegate from civil proceedings in relation to the issuing or the declining as a result of the evaluation process. That is why I directed my question `are they a public servant?' to Senator Hill. Why would you have to protect a public servant from civil action when they would have statutory immunity?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—The answer is that this relates to a certificate which is the certificate of another party. It is the certificate of the applicant. What the provision says is that you cannot therefore hold the secretary or the delegate—the secretary's representative—responsible for the content of the certificate. It is not an action of the secretary that is being judged. Senator Harris might say to me that he would find it difficult to see how an action might lie against the secretary for the content of a certificate which clearly under the act the secretary has not developed, and he might have a reasonable argument there. But I therefore assume that this is to remove any risk associated with that matter—any possibility, even if that possibility is slight.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I understand what Senator Hill has conveyed in his answer: the government's position is that they are indemnifying the secretary from any civil proceeding that would result from the issuing of a certificate. If a public servant has done something manifestly wrong—and I am trying to think of an example that would be applicable here—such as agreeing to issue something that is so profoundly against sound science, I could understand somebody mounting a charge, and that what the secretary or a delegate had done was so manifestly wrong that they would lose their statutory immunity. But my understanding is that our public servants, in the duties that they carry out, are protected by statutory immunity. I am absolutely amazed to find that in the proposed amendment the government feel that they need to protect them from civil proceedings of any sort. 
If the secretary or a delegate granted a certificate, and some time in the future a drug—for example, thalidomide—was found to have an adverse effect, the public servant would automatically be covered by statutory immunity. Why do we have to write into the act an indemnity against civil proceedings? Is there something in the FTA that, all of a sudden, has the potential to expose our public servants to civil proceedings? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—As I understand it, the certificate does not warrant the quality of the product. So I think the reference that the honourable senator just made is inappropriate. This is a certificate as to whether there is an existing patent or otherwise. The protection for the public servant in this provision seems to me to go beyond statutory immunity in that the section simply says:
Civil proceedings do not lie ... 
Why does it go that far? It is because the certificate that is referred to is not the certificate of the secretary. As I said to Senator Harris, I find it hard to imagine how you could found an action anyway. If this is simply reinforcing what seems to be obvious, there must have been somebody involved in the process that was—Senator Harris might think, and I might agree with him—unduly nervous. Nevertheless, it therefore does not seem to me to be something to be particularly concerned about. If it reinforces what seems to be obvious then it hardly seems worth objecting to.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I agree with what Senator Hill is saying that, yes, in the normal sense of the procedure that indemnity should be there. The concern that I have is: if somebody is unduly nervous, is it because there is something in the free trade agreement that exposes those public servants? If that were the case then I, like the public servants, would be quite nervous. If Senator Hill tells us that there is nothing in the FTA that reverses any of the statutory immunity then, yes, it is an excess. I am not saying that you should take it out; I am just questioning why it is there. What is the necessity for putting it in there? 
Question put:
That schedule 7, as amended, stand as printed.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-12,"—Schedule 9 relates to the Patents Act 1990. I want to put several questions to the minister. First of all, the schedule describes several amendments and I want some clarification from the minister. Evidence to the Senate inquiry into the change to the Patents Act in Australia varied widely. It seems that there have been some quite broad commitments from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with respect to the flexibility retained by the Australian government in the implementation of the changes to the Patents Act and general issues. I would like the minister to outline very specifically, and build on the description contained in the explanatory memorandum, the actual effect of schedule 9 on patents, particularly software patents. 
I mention software patents in particular because, in all of the evidence collected through the Senate inquiry, this was an area of genuine concern. Indeed, it has been the attention of columnist Ross Gittins, who has spent quite a bit of time putting together some column inches on the issue of concern about software patents. The general fear in the software community relates to the harmonisation of the intellectual property regime—harmonisation in the sense that in the US there are a number of different types of patents that are allowable, including business process patents. The concern in the software community is that this type of patent will become more prevalent in Australia.
The types of patents that have caused most concern are the very generalised business process patents, patents that include the look and feel of web sites and so forth, and patents that pick up what you would describe as generic sequences of coding in software applications that could create new vulnerabilities for software coders in Australia. The sorts of new vulnerabilities that were articulated through the Senate inquiry include things that open source software coders believe will make them more vulnerable to increasing litigation. I will refer to some comments by Mr Henry Ergas, the former Chair of the Intellectual Property and Competition Committee, contained in the Senate inquiry report. He states:
The FTA foreshadows further “harmonisation” in patent law, which most likely means future increases in patent protection.
He goes on to say:
Ironically, while Australia is being obliged to adopt IP laws that can disproportionately favour producer interests, US policy-makers have taken a more critical stance on their IP laws. Late last year, the US Federal Trade Commission (the US counterpart to the ACCC) released a report on the proper balance between competition and patent laws.
The FTC report, which follows a three-year investigation, highlighted the anti-competitive effects of two emerging problems in the US, namely the granting—
and this is the key point—
of excessively broad patents, that is, those that cover an excessively wide range of follow-on activities, and the granting of too many trivial patents.
He makes the following summation:
... these misapplications of patent law can have an adverse effect on innovation ...
and so forth. In the evidence of the inquiry, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade came back with a denial that the sentiment about harmonisation in the free trade agreement would lead to this outcome. The committee heard quite conflicting evidence, and what I am really seeking from the minister is very specific clarification on patent law and how it is likely to affect, and how the government anticipates it will affect, the applications of software patents and the software patent regime generally. It is worth quoting DFAT's response to this. The committee report states:
The free trade agreement does not change in any way the scope of what we currently consider to be patentable or what would be patented in Australia. We currently allow patents for software, and there will be no change to that. We are not being required to take a United States approach in relation to that type of patent, so I do not think that that concern is well founded. It will be business as usual for IP Australia in terms of granting patents.  
That particular reference comes from DFAT official Toni Harmer. 
Labor are particularly concerned about this. Hence, in our response and statement relating to the free trade agreement, we have expressed the view that this is an area where we need to keep a close watching brief. If there is evidence that the patent law, particularly relating to software patents and its impact on open source, is being used and abused in an anticompetitive way, then we clearly have a problem. That is why establishing a Senate select committee on intellectual property, which will comprehensively investigate and make recommendations for an appropriate IP regime for Australia in light of the significant changes required to IP law by the AUSFTA, is such a critical element of Labor's policy response to this agreement. Minister, I put those questions to you. There are many other witnesses I can refer to—Mr Russell and Mr Scott; I have mentioned Mr Ergas—who have made quite strong points about their fear for increased litigation based on the harmonisation goal that is so firmly expressed in the agreement. I am very interested in your response to that problem.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I will have a go, but I actually thought Labor was supporting those provisions. Senator Lundy refers to detailed submissions that have been made on these issues, and it seems to me the more appropriate time to test both sides of the argument would have been across the table in either of the two committees that considered these matters at length. I am told that harmonisation is not actually referred to in the free trade agreement, and it is not totally clear to me whether Senator Lundy is referring to the patent or the copyright system.
—Patent.
—If Senator Lundy is talking about patents, as I understand it there is a concern in the United States in that the test is a lot less demanding than the test in Australia. But I am advised that what is being done through the implementation of this agreement does not change the Australian test in that regard. That is correct, the expert tells me. I accept that these interest groups have a genuine concern or they would not be making their point, but the advice we have is that in the application of the Australian patent law there is not a real concern in that regard and this agreement will not alter that. With respect to Senator Lundy's goal, which I presume is to ensure that the patenting of this software or the processes within the software is not unduly restrictive, my advice is that there is no real concern in that regard. If she wants to explain to me the basis of her concern, I will get people to work on it; however, these people have been wrestling with these issues now for a very long time and that is their view.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-12,"—My reading of the agreement is that the Patents Act is not overly amended and it does not introduce the sorts of changes needed to meet their expressed concerns. I am seeking from you an assurance that that is the case and that the government does not expect that increased litigation is likely. I place on the record Labor's firm position that we will keep a watching brief on this issue, through the Senate select committee process that we propose, to ensure that any changes in the treatment of the management of patents in the software area are not used for anticompetitive purposes or for the exercise of selective enforcement with teams of lawyers, which was one of the views collected in the evidence of the inquiry. I think the minister has confirmed that. If he has any other comments, so be it. I do have some comments on copyright, which I would like to make later. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—The advice I have is that, on this issue, our patents law is not affected by the agreement or by the implementation bill. The closer alignment that is sought in some areas does not relate to this particular issue.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—The Democrats oppose schedule 9 in the following terms:
(15)	Schedule 9, page 85 (line 2) to page 163 (line 27), to be opposed.
I want to talk about schedule 9 because the issue of intellectual property, in chapter 17 of the free trade agreement, is possibly the most neglected part of the debate. Whilst there have been various views put forward by various stakeholders and experts in the various committees that have met, the result is that, because the focus has been on the PBS and Australian cultural content, the most far-reaching chapter of the free trade agreement has been pretty much neglected. 
Whilst the Labor Party in opposition have said that they would look at putting into place a Senate select committee on intellectual property if they got into government, this really is an issue for a separate inquiry because it has far-reaching consequences. If anything, the agreement either pre-empts or directly contradicts current Australian debate about appropriate reform to our copyright law, particularly in terms of proposed changes to Australian law that go further than what the free trade agreement currently offers and, in some instances, further than current US copyright law. So chapter 17 of the agreement is potentially one of the most significant, with what I would regard as the most far-reaching reforms. It will have a direct and serious impact on Australian innovative industries.
Some of the changes, such as the ratification of the World Intellectual Property Organisation treaties, are positive reforms but there are aspects of the chapter that deal with the extension of the copyright term, anticircumvention devices and the liability of Internet service providers with respect to copyright infringement, which I think are very dangerous developments. Quite frankly, the government does need to provide some answers in respect of that chapter.
Senator Lundy referred to yesterday's article by Ross Gittins. I thought it was an excellent piece. He stated that a primary objective of the US government's trade policy has long been to make the world a more congenial place for US exporters of intellectual property. In many respects, the US is trying to get other countries to harmonise their IP laws with US laws. The end result is that we will be policemen prosecuting citizens who pirate American intellectual property and enhancing the ability of US companies to protect their rights in other countries' courts. As Ross Gittins pointed out, this is all very well for the Americans but it offers little benefit to us—just costs. He asked why, and mostly it is because we are a heavy net importer of intellectual property and we have to bear the cost as a result.
The section dealing with intellectual property is the longest chapter in the agreement. I think it presents us with a puzzle because our government has repeatedly assured us that it has given the Americans little of any value so there is nothing for us to worry about, but when you listen to US politicians and lobby groups you hear them say that they are well pleased with the precedent that our deal sets for the many free trade agreements the US intends to reach with other countries. I ask how this particular conundrum can be resolved, because in many respects I think we have aided and abetted the United States in extending its capacity to reach into other countries to run, if you like, the IP market for the entire world, and to do that in such a way that the laws of the other countries, or the way in which they operate, will be to the benefit of America because we will all become IP outposts for US IP holders, IT companies and so on. 
What our government is talking about now is what the Americans are thinking for the future, and there is something in that. For example, we do not know what the future will be like when it comes to the media landscape and we are accepting amendments to our system through the free trade agreement that will have an impact that we cannot predict. An analysis has not been done on that, and I would be interested to hear from the minister and certainly from his officials what they believe will be the outcome. I do not believe that anyone can escape the free trade agreement once it is locked in. Kim Weatherall from the University of Melbourne has provided what I believe to be an excellent summary of the impact of the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill. She says that the bill:
makes IP much more complicated than it already was;
makes consumers more likely to be both criminally and civilly liable;
makes consumers liable for copyright infringement when they watch an unauthorised copy of a DVD;
makes our law more protective than US law in key respects;
introduces no measures to mitigate the shift of any copyright balance in favour of copyright owners;
makes no attempt to reduce the costs to society of copyright term extension;
makes no attempt to take into account the recommendations of JSCOT;
And she says further that it makes no attempt to take into account the recommendations of the Senate committee and so on. I think that Ms Weatherall's strongly held view is that even if the parliament does decide to support the free trade agreement it should not accept this part of the implementation bill. There is a good reason for that because, given that it is the most lengthy part of the free trade agreement, first and foremost, there has been a high degree of a lack of public consultation. When there are such radical and significant changes being proposed to copyright law without public consultation, the government is enacting intellectual property policy by trade agreement. This is one of the arguments that has been raised as part of this debate: we do not get to see the free trade agreement and deal with the specifics of it, and we are certainly not dealing with the full ramifications of the biggest chapter in the free trade agreement—the chapter on intellectual property.
There are many factors in this bill that are unpredictable. There are many things that I imagine could be ironed out through a proper process, and it seems to me that the whole thing is being rushed through. I have to ask the question: to what end? It seems to me that we are meeting an artificially determined deadline, and I again ask whether that is the proper process when it comes to dealing with intellectual property law changes in Australia and also changes to copyright law. This is an unacceptable process in the first instance.
The second reason why the schedule should be opposed is that the FTA goes even further in a couple of areas than the FTA requires. People may ask why that is so and what gains could possibly be had from being even more protective of IP than the United States of America. I ask whether anyone has read the government report that pointed out that Australia's interests are not served by having stronger IP laws than the internationally accepted standard. I ask whether anyone has looked lately at the balance in intellectual property, because the FTA Implementation Bill goes further and is more protective of IP in several respects than the FTA requires. It narrows some exceptions that used to prevent consumers being liable for copies of performances made at home solely for personal and domestic use—in fact, there is nothing in the FTA that requires this. The bill goes even further than the FTA requires by imposing criminal liability in ways in which the effect is likely to be unpredictable. It also makes it a copyright infringement to play an unauthorised copy of a DVD, for example, or to view, even unknowingly, copyright-infringing material online. 
Historically it is the person who makes the unauthorised or pirate copy who infringes the copyright, not the consumer. But the government has stated its intention that copyright should not unduly intrude into the private or domestic sphere. The Senate select committee expressed exactly the same concern. So this result is quite surprising, and I ask the minister to clarify whether the changes will shift the liability from those who infringe copyright more directly—the pirates, if you like—to the consumer. Nowhere in the free trade agreement does it mention that copyright owners must have an electronic use right. I think this idea should be discussed and clarified because it extends the provisions about decoding encrypted satellite broadcasts to all forms of broadcasts, and I understand that includes cable. The third reason why this schedule, and more particularly the bill, should not be supported is that it does not take advantage of the many areas where there is flexibility to introduce exceptions into Australian law. For example, there is nothing in the bill about a fair use provision or about extending exceptions to copyright infringement, despite the fact that it already exists in American copyright law, as I understand it.
The fourth reason concerns performers rights provisions. These are quite remarkable, I have to say, because performers rights in Australian law at the moment are really rights to prevent unauthorised recording of performances and unauthorised distribution of those unauthorised recordings. After the implementation bill, performers will have moral rights in their performances so far as those performances consist of sound and co-ownership of copyright in sound recordings of their performances. In effect, it means that they will not have copyright in films. They will not have moral rights in their performances so far as those performances consist of something other than sound, and for existing recordings the copyright will really only mean a right to get an injunction against infringement by third parties. I will have more to say on that when I come to my later amendments—Nos (16), (22) and (23)—as I think it needs to be debated in more detail.
I think the government realises that there is more in this and that it needs to provide some answers. The concerns being raised by me have also been raised by constituents of mine in the performance and arts sector. The matter has been raised as a result of the Senate select committee process and I believe it has also been raised through JSCOT. In many respects, the implementation bill—I repeat—makes IP much more complicated than it already is. It makes consumers in this country—not the pirates any more—more likely to be both criminally and civilly liable, particularly when it makes consumers liable for copyright infringement for watching an unauthorised copy of a DVD. It makes our law more protective than US law in key respects. It introduces no measures to mitigate the shift of any copyright balance in favour of copyright owners. It makes no attempt to reduce the cost to society of copyright term extension, which is important when you consider the costs involved for institutions like universities, libraries, schools and so on, and it makes no attempt to take into account the recommendations of the various committees. It seems to me to be a dreadful, short-sighted and irresponsible process that has been gone through. 
The argument is that this schedule ought not be included. I cannot understand for a moment why the government would go into this negotiation and set new precedents in a free trade agreement. It is only because they want to aid and abet the United States in spreading its IP tentacles across the world into other countries. That is essentially the effect of it. We will become the IP outpost; we will get out there and police all of this for the United States. They do not need to come here any more. They have institutionalised, if you like, their capacity to do so because we have said that the free trade agreement will allow that. That is a good enough reason, from my perspective, for opposing this schedule. It is another example of where the free trade agreement itself is fundamentally flawed.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—The Australian Greens have a similar amendment to the Democrats relating to schedule 7 and seek to remove this component from the free trade agreement. Copyright—and intellectual property law more broadly—is always balanced between the rights of owners and producers and the users and consumers of an idea or intellectual creation. Currently, changes to technology, particularly the development of digital technology, are posing challenges to intellectual property regulation.
In Australia, various reviews and consultations have been under way for some time on how to adapt our intellectual property laws to the new environment. These include the Copyright Law Review Committee, the Intellectual Property and Competition Review Committee and the digital agenda review by the law firm Phillips Fox, which reported in January this year. The last time such significant changes were made to copyright law, they took place after three years of consultation with stakeholders, leading to the digital agenda act in 2000. There has been no such level of consultation before the changes set out in schedule 9, despite the bill and the US-Australia free trade agreement reversing some of the policy underpinning the act. We need to evolve laws carefully so as not to upset the delicate balance between producers' and consumers' rights. In their submission to the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, the Council of Australian University Librarians identified concerns such as the balance between copyright owners and copyright users being tipped in favour of owners in the United States and this trade agreement heading in a similar direction. 
The process of change is being disrupted and, in some cases, reversed by the changes that have come about as a result of the free trade agreement. The change process in the trade agreement pre-empts the resolution of Australian discussion about how to get the balance right. In fact, the changes to copyright law in this bill undermine this important balance. By adopting the worst aspects of American law, we are undermining the creative potential of many industries and the creative enjoyment and participation of our citizens. The copyright changes outlined in schedule 9 of the bill make copyright more restrictive and penalties and infringements more severe. These are often infringements such as the ordinary, everyday practice of copying and using materials, which we have become familiar with. The trade agreement emphasises criminal liability rather than civil liability even though a breach of copyright is really a private loss and therefore more amenable to civil redress. 
In some areas, the bill implementing the trade agreement actually goes further than required by the trade agreement. For example, this legislation criminalises conduct that results in infringement rather than conduct that is a significant copyright infringement as required by the trade agreement. A tourist returning from Bangkok with a large amount of pirated DVDs could be prosecuted for breaching copyright even though he or she did not intend a breach of copyright; the tourist's conduct resulted in a copyright infringement but the conduct itself was not a copyright infringement. Currently, copyright exemptions exist for sound recordings made solely for the purpose of the private domestic use of the maker and for indirect sound recording for certain purposes. Under the trade agreement, copyright exemptions for sound recordings will only exist for the purpose of research or study, criticism or review and news reportage.
Under the trade agreement, Internet service providers have increased responsibility for the content of web sites and other Internet services that they host. This creates an enormous responsibility for Internet service providers who can become, as has been seen in the United States, bombarded with copyright demands. In order to take a safe path they err on the side of caution and cut people off from their services, thereby having an impact on free speech.
Some of the changes that we have seen in the United States through the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act are also proposed in this trade agreement—for example, the changes that relate to technology protection measures. Article 17.4(7) of the agreement requires Australia to provide civil and criminal liabilities for the circumvention of TPMs and trafficking in such TPMs, even when such TPMs are not used to infringe copyright. There are serious concerns that, once legislation is introduced, as is required in the next two years, many corporations will use such protections to extend their monopoly control well beyond that of the copyright. The serial monopolies can be used to control accessories associated with a particular product, as was pointed out by Linux Australia's submission to the Senate select committee. In their submission, they cited Brendan Scott, an Australian intellectual property lawyer, who said:
We are already in a position where it is possible to embed microprocessors onto most manufactured items. Manufacturers in the US have already embedded such processors into garage doors and printers allowing them to control after markets for these products. For example, a printer interrogates the consumable cartridges to determine their origin and if they are from a competitor refuse to operate or, worse, will operate to a lower standard without alerting the consumer. The anti-circumvention provisions will prevent competitors from making functional accessories. You don't need to be too bright to realize that this will become an increasingly common practice for manufactured items—if you can do it for garage doors, why not tractors?
Over time we will see the emergence of the kinds of serial monopolies (and the attendant price gouging) for product areas that we have seen in the software world. In an attempt to protect the US music industry from market competition what will emerge is a reduction in competition across broad swathes of the economy—whether it's the farmer who wants a combine harvester to work with their tractor, or the IT manager who wants their PDA to interface with their GPS devices—
that is, the intellectual technology manager who wants their personal digital assistant to interface with their global positioning system devices—
Economics tells us we will get increased prices and lower quality in these circumstances. 
A range of other examples have also been provided by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a citizens rights organisation that works in the area of digital technology in the United States. They describe the problem as follows:
Every year numerous illegitimate patent applications make their way through the United States patent examination process without adequate review. The problem is particularly acute in the software and Internet fields where the history of prior inventions ... is widely distributed and poorly documented. As a result, we have seen patents asserted on such simple technologies as:
• One-click online shopping
• Online shopping carts
• The hyperlink
• Video streaming
• Internationalizing domain names
• Pop-up windows
• Targeted banner ads
• Paying with a credit card online
• Framed browsing; and
• Affiliate linking.
	...	...	...
The harm these patents cause the public is profound.
Unlike most technologies, software and the Internet have attracted a vast number of small business, non-profit, and individual users—each of whom has adopted and built upon these resources as part of their daily interaction with computers and the online world. From open source programming to online journaling to political campaigning, the average citizen is using new technology online and on her desktop as often as any traditional company.
With this increased visibility, however, comes increased vulnerability. Previously, patentholders had only targeted competing companies. These companies have established legal departments and outside counsel and are thus able to defend against illegitimate patent threats. Now some patent holders have begun to set their sights on the new class of technology users-small organizations and individuals who cannot afford to retain lawyers. Faced with million-dollar legal demands, they have no choice but to capitulate and pay license fees—fees that often fund more threat letters and lawsuits. ...
Illegitimate patents can also threaten free expression. More and more people are using software and Internet technology to express themselves online. Website and blogging tools are increasingly popular. Video and audio streaming technology is ubiquitous. Email and Instant Messaging have reached users of all ages. Yet because patents can be anywhere and everywhere in these technologies, the average user has no way of knowing whether his or her tools are subject to legal threats. Patent owners who claim control over these means of community discourse can threaten anyone who uses them, even for personal non-commercial purposes. We lose much if we allow overreaching patent claims to reduce the tremendous benefits that software and technology bring to freedom of expression.
There are other examples in the United States of companies that are claiming patents over video streaming, sending out a whole variety of legal letters to colleges that are using the video streaming technology to provide distance learning, thereby threatening opportunities for those colleges to provide the education services that they do.
A statement was issued last week in Melbourne by the Open Source Software Industry Association and Linux Australia, warning that the US-Australia free trade agreement posed a grave threat to Australia's entire software development industry due to the large legal framework on intellectual property rights that are required for adoption within this pact. The spokesperson, Brendan Scott, spoke significantly about the resources that software houses had to resource to be able to obtain patents and the experience of the United States patent laws. He talked about non-trivial pieces of software that contained as many as thousands of codes of processes and algorisms, each of which could infringe one or many US software patents. The number of insights from industry about their concerns in this area continue endlessly. 
Professor Peter Drahos from the Australian National University described it this way in his submission to the inquiry:
Australia's concessions in the IPR—
intellectual property rights—
chapter come at a time when there is an emerging view within the US that IPR protection has gone too far. ...
Australia has signed onto a set of US standards in the FTA at a time when there is considerable doubt in the US about the suitability of those standards for a truly dynamic and effective knowledge economy.
The other component of this copyright section of the US-Australia free trade agreement is exemplified and known as the `Disney clause', originally put in place by the United States to protect Disney's monopoly of the Mickey Mouse image. It has now been exported here, care of the Howard government, with the support of the Labor opposition. The Disney clause, which is in part 6 of schedule 9 of this bill, extends copyright from 50 to 70 years. This will have a huge impact on the rights of universities, libraries and educational and research institutions to have cost-effective access to materials for academic, research and public purposes. They will now pay royalties for an additional 20 years, long after the death of the author, so that big business can continue to profit.
The changes are retrospective, so work still under copyright will have their copyright extended by 20 years. This includes photographs. The impact on photographs is illustrated by an example provided in the Parliamentary Library current issues brief on the issue, which states:
... the extension of the duration of copyright in photographs involves a much greater retrospective extension than is involved for other works under AUSFTA, largely because it is coming from a lower base level. This is well illustrated by the case of Max Dupain, one of Australia's most famous photographers. Assuming passage of this Bill and Assent by the end of 2004, any photos published by Dupain in 1955 and later will maintain their copyright until 2062, 70 years from Dupain's death in 1992. Without passage of the Bill, photographs published in 1955 would become available next year. The photographs published before 1955 are already in the public domain and this will not change. For these photographs, this Bill will provide effectively prolong their copyright by 57 years. Under the general extension to copyright, no work or other matter would have its copyright prolonged by more than 20 years.
Philippa Dee of the Australian National University conducted research on the economic impact of the agreement for the Senate select committee. She estimated the potential increased net cost to Australia in royalty payments at $88 million. The Greens are not prepared to impose this burden upon the community. We believe that the most appropriate safeguard that can be put in place is in the form of the proposal that we are debating at the moment to remove this schedule from the bill. This is a way to protect Australian culture, Australian industry and Australian consumers.
Part of the trade agreement, as others have mentioned, was pointed out by Ross Gittins in his article on Wednesday of this week—that is, the significance of this area of the debate and the impact we have seen in the United States, whose primary objective of their trade policy is to make the world a more congenial place for US exporters of intellectual property. As such, we will be proceeding with this proposal to remove schedule 9 from the bill.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—I have a couple of questions for the minister on copyright extension. With regard to the CIE report that the government has relied on so extensively to support its arguments about the free trade agreement and about why it ought to be passed, the Senate select committee noted that the CIE report did not even address the question of intellectual property and, more particularly, the costs to be borne of additional royalty payments as a result of extending copyright by a further 20 years. I would ask the minister whether or not he is aware of any investigation or review that has been done by the government. I understand that one may have been done by DCITA that looks into the likely impact of the extension of a copyright term by 20 years. Is that publicly available? Is the minister prepared to release any of that information to make it quite clear to the parliament and certainly to the public what the additional costs, which were identified by Dr Dee as part of the Senate select committee process, will be? Quite frankly, they have been overlooked. 
Considering that copyright was originally established to encourage education and learning, I would ask whether or not it is a valid argument to extend copyright by a further 20 years and whether or not that is an incentive to be educated and to learn, given that most information does go into the public domain after 50 years. An additional 20 years, taking it up to 70 years after the death of an author or creator, essentially will mean that additional costs will have to be borne by someone. In this particular case, it will be taxpayers in Australia, particularly for libraries, schools and universities. I wonder whether the minister might be able to say whether there has been any analysis done by any government departments or at least by government, or whether it is asking CIE to look at that particular question, because that was completely missed in the CIE report. The government has made very little mention at all of what is the largest chapter in the free trade agreement.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—My advice is that the CIE report did make reference to these matters. In relation to the extension to the copyright term of 20 years, it recognised that in some instances this could impose costs on consumers. It found that these costs are unlikely to be significant and are difficult to quantify. The CIE report also noted that copyright obligations in relation to technological protection measures and Internet service provider liability may impose costs on consumers and Internet service providers respectively, but the costs are impossible to quantify.
The amendments implementing the ISP liability obligations have been done so as to minimise costs for ISPs. You have to look at that specific issue to a background where the outcomes are that the copyright amendments will bring Australia in line with international norms and the practice of the world's largest IP market whilst preserving Australia's traditional balance between owners and users. The amendments will benefit Australian exporters by creating a more familiar and certain legal environment, thereby reducing transaction costs, and will help Australian innovators by helping them attract US investment. That is the flipside to the very pessimistic assessment of both the Greens and the Democrats. It demonstrates to our trading partners the benefits of strong intellectual property laws and reinforces Australia's reputation as one of the world's leading countries in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—I am not surprised by the minister's response. Whilst he might regard the views being expressed by the Australian Democrats and certainly by the Australian Greens as pessimistic, I would suggest that they are realistic. I understand that copyright term extension in the free trade agreement was included at the eleventh hour. It was not part of the negotiations to begin with. You may want to address that particular issue—why all of a sudden at the eleventh hour copyright extension was thrown onto the table. 
The main advocate was the Motion Picture Association of America. That includes the United States copyright owner group which represents firms such as Walt Disney, Sony Pictures Entertainment, MGM, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Studios and Warner Bros. Given the size of this industry and its influence in the United States—which might classically be called `Hollywood'—I think there are legitimate concerns in Australia about the effect of a 20-year extension, but, most of all, when you consider the ramifications of the IP chapter in the free trade agreement, quite frankly I think it is leaving our own industry open to being swamped by Hollywood. I do not see the government going out of its way to provide the right sort of support to industry. It may talk about our film industry not producing the right sorts of films but at the same time you cannot deny that we produce world-class actors and technicians. There are many well-known Australians producing what are usually foreign films made on domestic soil.
Concerning the main advocate for copyright term extension, when you consider the group that have been named, I would say that the Democrat amendment is realistic, not pessimistic. It highlights the point that the way in which the government have gone about introducing what is the most extensive chapter in the free trade agreement—with very little input, with very little public consultation and certainly very little debate more broadly with consumers in this country—means that we do have a right to be concerned. Essentially, we are opening ourselves to prey to larger groups and that ought to be a concern to the minister and certainly to the government. 
One of the things that it is important to point out on this occasion is that besides the raft of cases that have and are occurring in relation to copyright issues in the United States, the reality is that effectively not only have we agreed to extend by a further 20 years but also we are wearing the cost of that. We also need to keep in mind that we are a net importer of copyright material. If we are importing, there is a cost involved in that as well. When you consider that we are talking about educational and learning institutions, quite frankly is that a cost we are prepared to pass on to schools, libraries, universities and so on? It is appalling that the government have not had a proper debate but, most of all, that they seem to think that this is a pessimistic response. I would say it is very realistic and I think the government are being quite fanciful when they think that everything will be right—that sort of attitude. The reality is that that is not the case.
I daresay your officials would agree that the intellectual copyright laws are so complex that to turn around and try to produce such an extensive chapter in the way we have, without a proper review in this country, is a dereliction of duty on the part of the government. There is a need to reform copyright law in this country. That is the view of all stakeholders out there, but that is not what the government is doing. It is pre-empting in many respects what those changes might be. It has not had a proper debate. We have gone through the select committee processes and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties inquiries, the other inquires and so on. We still do not have a report from DCITA who looked at the question of a 20-year extension. If it has been done, I certainly have not seen it out in the public domain so that everyone can access it to see what it says. Quite frankly, we are putting in place a range of precedents, changing our laws to accommodate the United States for their intellectual property regime. We have not looked at our own needs. We have not done an assessment, a review or an analysis of what is in our best interests. Quite frankly, it is a dereliction of duty, which is why this schedule is being dealt with in this way.  
Most of all, the free trade agreement is flawed on many accounts. The opposition, talking about 42 reasons why it is that they think there is a problem with the free trade agreement, come up with two. One of those 42 deals with establishing a Senate select committee to look at this particular question. We are going to be looking at it after the fact, not beforehand. It has not been looked at properly through the various committee processes and there has not been proper debate out in the broader community.

3A After section 42
Insert:
42A Defence of fair use
	(1)	A fair use of a copyrighted work or other subject matter does not constitute an infringement of copyright.
	(2)	A fair use includes purposes such as:
	(a)	research or study;
	(b)	criticism or review;
	(c)	reporting the news;
	(d)	judicial proceedings or professional advice;
	(e)	parody or transformative use;
	(f)	time-shifting, space-shifting, or device shifting;
	(g)	reverse engineering or making interoperable products.
	(3)	In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:
	(a)	the purpose and character of the use; 
	(b)	the nature of the copyrighted work or other subject matter; 
	(c)	the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;
	(d)	the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
	(4)	The defence of fair use cannot be excluded or modified by agreement or contract law.
	(5)	The defence of fair use cannot be excluded or modified by technological protection measures, and electronic rights management information.
There is a range of views out there among those who have an interest in copyright law and I am seeking to have some debate about this issue. Given that we do not have a fair use provision in our copyright law, but, most of all, when you consider the way this particular chapter has been dealt with, it strikes me as an oddity that while we have allowed the United States IP laws to infiltrate Australian law we have not even looked at the doctrine of fair use. 
We decided to move this amendment to address a fundamental matter of concern about the free trade agreement. I do not expect that the government will support the amendment. Perhaps the opposition will look at it—although that is very unlikely, given that they have already got their sweet deal. The government are enacting intellectual property policy through a trade agreement—that is essentially what is happening in this case. We are not dealing with legislation that looks at a proper process of consultation and debate about changing intellectual property policy in this country. We are talking about a free trade agreement that says what the policy is going to be. The way that the government have gone about dealing with intellectual property—without proper debate and consultation with the Australian community—is quite unacceptable.
Again I refer to Ms Weatherall, who argued in her evidence before the Senate select committee that the government should undertake a review to ascertain precisely how Australia's obligations under chapter 17 of the free trade agreement will sit with its domestic legislation. She said that it is not appropriate to take on extensive obligations to enact further laws protective of IP interests without a full analysis of how these provisions will operate in the context of Australian law which is and—under the US free trade agreement provisions—will remain different from US laws in certain key respects. Any Australian government that considers acceding to such a treaty should undertake to review those areas of Australian IP law where they are stronger than those provided elsewhere in the world and to undertake to redress that imbalance.
On that particular question, Dr Matthew Rimmer of the Australian National University told the Senate select committee that the defence of fair use should have been enunciated in the free trade agreement. He said: 
It is such a fundamental doctrine that affects all the different areas of intellectual property, and its absence from the free trade agreement is very significant. Even if this government, for instance, made legislative changes and recommended that there should be a defence of fair use, they could be wound back. But if you tried to make changes in relation to the areas that are mentioned in the free trade agreement and you violated those articles, you would be subject to a trade action. So the failure to include the fair use provisions in the free trade agreement makes it very provisional. Even if this parliament makes those reforms, they can be very easily wound back by a later parliament. That is the real significance: what is included in the free trade agreement is then locked into that free trade agreement because it is subject to those very strong alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the possibility of trade sanctions if you violate a particular article or even if you violate the spirit of the agreement.
Mr Charles Britton from the Australian Consumers Association, in answer to the same question, told the committee that a fair right defence would guarantee the rights of consumers. He stated that, in the legislative changes required to implement the free trade agreement, at the very least there should be enactment of a fair use right for Australian consumers, which would harmonise the law with current consumer behaviour and protect consumers as the digital environment moves from the control of copying to the control of access. The joint standing committee recommended something along the same lines in terms of the changes being made to the Copyright Act. This does raise real issues. 
The application of fair use in the United States as determined by its legal system does specifically provide for several unique copyright doctrines—namely, time shifting and space shifting. An example of time shifting is when consumers record a television program for later use on a device such as a video recorder or, more recently, on other types of storage mediums. Space shifting in this case is when digital content is recorded onto a different device from that to which it was originally assigned—for example, purchasing a CD and copying it on to an MP3 player. We all get these iPAC pocket PCs here in parliament. We have the capacity to download things off the Net. We ought to ask whether or not as politicians we are doing the right thing, given what the free trade agreement will do in relation to IP changes. 
There is a need to redress the balance, because all of the discussion about the IP chapter refers to harmonisation of Australia's and the US's IP systems. As far as I can see, harmonisation simply means accepting all of the aspects of their system that protect their copyright owners and none of the aspects that protect copyright users in this country. Where is the balance in that? Where is the harmony? I ask the minister to get advice from his officials about whether or not it is regarded as a fair balance between the rights of users in Australia and the rights of owners in the United States with the changes that are being made. 
We all know that intellectual property is about balancing the need to protect the interests of the creators against those of the public domain. Our amendment is about trying to tip that balance back a little so that consumers have an opportunity to get a fair go, as they do in the United States. Why was there an oversight of this issue in the first instance? 
I want to make it quite clear that we fully recognise that this amendment will not be supported. It is more about the debate. The Democrats are quite frankly outraged that the government is enacting intellectual property policy through a trade agreement and is not having a proper process of consultation and debate in Australia with Australians. They are huge and complex issues and they should be the subject of an intense and comprehensive public debate in this country, not one that took place in Washington. 
We are pitching this proposal at a number of audiences, including people involved in the promotion of education and learning; the protection of cultural heritage, particularly by libraries and cultural institutions; freedom of speech and consumer rights; and the fostering of innovation in IT and open source software. 
An amendment of this sort will attract the attention and support of students, teachers, librarians, consumers and people who are iPod owners—perhaps even the pocket PCs, which I have mentioned—and computer engineers. I read an interesting article last week that spoke of the surprise that must be felt by all iPod owners when they discover that they can download music that they legitimately own onto their iPod device. Under this free trade agreement, I can buy a CD and think that I can do whatever I like with it—but the reality is that I would be wrong.
We need to look very carefully at the changes to our copyright regime that are being enacted by the free trade agreement. It is a big deal and it deserves more attention than a promise and a tick that the free trade agreement is going to be all right for this nation. When we proposed this amendment last week, a number of people in the copyright industry called my office to speak about many issues they have raised in this context and an appropriate way to implement the changes to Australian law as a result of the free trade agreement. We have maintained all along that we know that this amendment has no chance of success. It has been suggested that the amendment should have been drafted along different lines, taking out the current fair dealing provisions of the Copyright Act and replacing them with our new proposed fair use defence. But we have also received advice that that is not necessary; they can work side by side.  
While activities such as research and study tend to be allowed in the US under the fair use defence—largely because of case law there—as we would be adopting fair use from scratch until the courts start to outline what fair use is, we have no assurances that fair dealings would be covered. That means in theory that some fair dealings could become unlawful. Retaining both fair dealing and fair use in many respects will allow any existing lawful uses to remain lawful, while also providing judges with an opportunity to decide what is and what is not an infringement on fair use grounds. It has been suggested that further amendments are required to this schedule regarding reproductions—deleting the exception to the exception that currently exists.
I do not want to go on too much longer because the point has been made that we need to consider what the ramifications are going to be. That has been overlooked and, quite frankly, there ought to be more debate about this. I hope that Senator Lundy—now that she has come into the chamber—might also engage in this debate and give us an idea of what the opposition proposes to do, beyond just having a Senate select committee inquiry into IP.
There are real issues about IP law in this country being dictated by the free trade agreement. Everything about the development of IP policy now becomes subordinate to the FTA. That is what is happening in this case and that is why the free trade agreement ought not to be supported. It puts in place many rules for future technologies of which we are not yet aware. I wonder sometimes whether the government have thought long and hard about this. 
I come back to my original question: why was it thrown onto the table at the eleventh hour? That is what I understand happened, from discussions with other people who were involved in these negotiations. Copyright extension was not on the table at the beginning. I do not know why we ventured down this path without proper analysis—even the minister did not instruct CIE to look at this more closely—and without the issue having been raised not just by the Senate select committee but also by stakeholders out there in the community. It is a real issue and it should have been resolved properly.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I think the issue is as Senator Ridgeway has described: intellectual property issues were not paid due attention during the course of the Senate select committee's inquiry on the free trade agreement, and that was certainly an observation made by the Labor senators who participated in it. That is precisely why the Labor Party have come back with a comprehensive response to many of the concerns raised. 
In a statement by Mark Latham on the day that Labor announced our response to the free trade agreement, Labor said we will ensure that Australia's copyright and intellectual property laws continue to provide a fair balance between the interests of creators, owners and users. We made several very strong points, which are worth going through here. First of all, we would require the Attorney-General to report annually to parliament on the impact of changes to the Copyright Act 1968 on universities, libraries and educational and public research institutions, particularly with regard to any increased costs they may bear. 
The monitoring mechanism that Labor have identified relates to the fact that Dr Philippa Dee identified an increase in net cost to Australia because we are net importers of copyright. That is a pretty well established fact. The fact that reports provided to the Senate select committee, such as the CIE and the Allen Consulting reports, were so robustly challenged on the merits of their research and methodology indicates that we do have an issue here. I say to the Democrats that that is why Labor have responded so vigorously on this policy point.  
The second issue relates to examining options for broadening the fair dealing and copyright usage provisions of the Copyright Act. In doing so, a Labor government will draw on recommendations from numerous government initiated reports addressing copyright issues that have not yet been acted upon. One of those is a review of the digital agenda. 
The point is that there is a case for Australia to look at fair use—and that is why we have stated this—but I do not think the amendment put forward by the Democrats is well thought through or comprehensive or sophisticated enough to address what is, quite correctly, an extremely important issue. Labor have identified that a Senate select committee is needed to look at these issues so that we might achieve, for the first time, a level of sophistication around intellectual property debates in this place. But we need to do it carefully. Because of the implementation process of this free trade agreement, we have that opportunity.
A Labor government, if elected, will have the opportunity to get into the nitty-gritty detail of the appropriate style and shape of a fair use regime that fits with the fair dealing regime in Australia and achieves the purpose of providing an appropriate level of protection for consumers on issues such as time shifting and space shifting of content on different devices in the home. It is true to say that there is a gap. If we do not address the fair use issue, we may well end up in a position where the balance tips too far in favour of copyright owners and too far against consumers. Again, that is exactly why Labor have articulated this response to this issue.
The other point worth making is that the Senate report goes a lot further with respect to recommendations. Recommendation 7 of the Senate select committee report says:
Labor Senators further recommend that the issue of such use of copyright material should be referred to the Senate Select Committee on Intellectual Property to investigate whether universities, libraries, educational and research institutions should be exempt from paying royalties after 50 years.
There is what can only be described as a very strong recognition of the issues in this—and a plan under Labor to address it.
The third point relates to the issue of technological protection measures, TPMs, as they relate to circumvention devices. Labor's position is that we will ensure that it is permissible to sell, purchase and use legally manufactured video, DVD and related software items, including components, equipment and hardware, regardless of place of purchase. This seems to challenge some of the more shallow interpretations of the act. There are questions about criminality—new offences and criminal offences in relation to circumvention and anticircumvention devices. But we know from the response from the department when Labor pressed these points about TPMs in the agreement that this is what the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade came back with:
The viewing of non-infringing material from other countries is a legitimate activity and the obligations of the FTA target piracy. We do not agree that permitting the sale of region-free DVD players in Australia would contravene the provisions of the AUSFTA provided that the legislation is implemented in a manner consistent with the FTA. 
The issue of multizone DVD players will be considered as part of the implementation process. The agreement also provides for a 2 year transitional period to implement these provisions, which will present the opportunity for public submissions in this area.
So this agreement does not put in place a foregone conclusion about the way in which Australia is able to legislate around these TPM provisions. That is why Labor is able to say that we will ensure that it is permissible to sell, purchase and use legally manufactured video, DVD and related software items, including components, equipment and hardware, regardless of the place of purchase. This at least in part satisfies some of the concerns around the pressure on Australia to adopt aspects of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a piece of legislation that exists in the US. The Senate committee in paragraph 3.172, found:
Contrary to assertions made in submissions and in evidence at hearings, Mr Stephen Deady, Special Negotiator, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Estimates hearing that the AUSFTA would not involve Australia being forced to adopt the DMCA ...
Stephen Deady is quoted as saying:
I know in some of the consultation and discussions we have had with you, and others on the committee and elsewhere, that there is a question about how much of that US legislation we need to bring into our own system. We have tried to explain that the commitments we have entered into in this chapter do not require us to bring into our legislation the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Nonetheless, as I said, Labor is concerned about this—hence our statement.
I want to move on to the broad issue that I spoke about earlier this evening in relation to software patents. Labor has committed to establishing a Senate select committee on intellectual property to comprehensively investigate and make recommendations for an appropriate IP regime for Australia in light of the significant changes required to Australian IP law by the AUSFTA. That Senate select committee will give us the opportunity to explore these issues in detail. We have an implementation period available to us, and we will make good use of it. We as a parliament are now in a far more enlightened position to make a far more informed assessment about the likely impact of changes to our intellectual property law, and it is appropriate that we do that in a timely and considered way so that we do not make mistakes.
Finally, the other recommendation put forward by Labor relates to recommendations 7 to 9 in the Senate select committee report. Earlier I mentioned the monitoring role of the cost-effective access to material by libraries and educational and research institutions. That relates to the extension of copyright and it is a very important issue. The other recommendations relate to the expansion of fair use and the establishment of the committee.
The other issue I want to mention here is related to chapter 3. I am not sure if it has been particularly traversed. It goes to the issue of performers' rights. I understand that the Democrats are moving amendments or have moved amendments in relation to performers' rights, and I have a couple of comments about that. First of all, to cover a bit of background, in 1996, as part of its election platform, the Howard government committed to introduce performers' rights. There has been little action since. It has taken until now—and then only at the insistence of the United States in the free trade agreement—for the government to respond to this issue.
However, the proposed model, not surprisingly, does not have the support of Australian performers. The government's proposed model for performers' rights will not benefit Australian performers in many respects, including that there is no declaration of a collecting society for the rights. Unlike similar rights holders, performers alone will be left without the protection of provisions of the act which relate to the operation of such collecting societies. It is not intended to increase the value of the sound recording right in section 152, notwithstanding the increased number of creators who will be sharing the right. Employed performers will not benefit from the legislation at all, with their rights being transferred automatically to the record company or producer. This is not the case with the vast majority of jurisdictions where similar rights are granted, including the United Kingdom, which recognises the special nature of the performer-producer relationship. 
The Howard government's flawed approach to moral rights legislation for writers and directors in films will be extended to performers working on sound recordings and pursuant to this virtual waiver—as put in place but termed `consent', which I think is highly misleading—to all future but unspecified acts, and may be put in place as a condition to getting the job. This `consent', as it is described, can include a consent to all derogatory treatment of the work. 
In addition, producers may force performers to sign their rights as a condition of engagement—and I know this has been a consistent concern with respect to moral rights under the Howard government. Labor is of the view that the Democrats proposed amendments to the legislation address some of the concerns but they are not good enough. The Democrat amendments will not do anything to extend the rights being granted to performers working in audiovisual production. In the age of the dominance of the audiovisual media and the increased flexibilities available for the exploitation of audiovisual works, it is essential that the rights of performers are acknowledged. The Democrat amendments obviously do little to rectify the flawed moral rights legislation not only for performers but also for other creators. 
All of these issues need to be addressed in a considered way. That is why, if a Labor government are elected, we are committed to reviewing the legislation as part of our proposed Senate select committee on intellectual property to endeavour to introduce a model of performers' rights, which will be comprehensive and genuinely in the interests of performers. We will get that balance right. We do not believe that anything before us this evening achieves that balance, and it is only Labor that have a plan for the way forward to fix some of those problems.
I have a few minutes remaining and I raise a specific issue in relation to part of the bill concerning criminal offences relating to copyright. I am seeking some clarification from the minister specifically about item 154 in the bill, where the explanatory memorandum refers to the insertion of a new offence relating to a significant infringement of copyright on a commercial scale. The explanatory memorandum states:
The offence is intended to implement the obligation under the Agreement that criminal procedures and remedies apply to a person who has committed significant wilful infringement of copyright on a commercial scale who may be acting with no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain. 
It seems that the words `wilful' and `knowing' in relation to the criminal activity are missing in the wording of the legislation. They occur in the agreement, they occur in the explanatory memorandum, but they have been deleted from the legislation. I would like an explanation as to why that is the case. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—What a weak response from the opposition. Quite frankly, it ought to be supporting these sorts of changes. Whilst Senator Lundy talks about what the Labor Party will do if it gets into office, the question that needs to be asked, given this massive cave-in to support the free trade agreement, is: what will it do if it does not get elected to office? That is what stakeholders out there want to know. Although the free trade agreement specifically allows certain things to happen, the reality here is that, if you want to talk about drawing a line in the sand, we ought to keep reminding ourselves that the free trade agreement makes the Australian national interest subordinate to whatever it is that is written into the text, including the way that we develop everything from environmental policy, social policy, health policy and cultural policy to intellectual property policy. That is the reality of what we are faced with here.  
A Senate select committee somewhere down the road will be dealing with issues in the context of the cement that is already set. That wet cement is over there in the free trade agreement. You guys have decided to support it because you think it is a great idea. You have not considered all of the issues that have come up here before the parliament and, most of all, we still do not get to debate the free trade agreement. We are just dealing with the enabling legislation, which is why I raise the issue about the most significant chapter in the entire free trade agreement: chapter 17, dealing with intellectual property. It is the longest; it is the most significant. There has been no public consultation out there with the stakeholders and the broader community. What do we get? A response from the opposition: `When we get into office, we will have a Senate select committee. We will get out there and inquire about intellectual property.' The reality is that it is much more than just saying what we will do later; it is about what we can do now. The free trade agreement is fundamentally flawed on 42 grounds. You named them; you have just named the third one, which possibly should have been part of the package of a sweet deal with the Prime Minister that perhaps the White House could have signed off on and said, `Yes, we can live with that.' But we know that that was not going to happen. Why? Because the whole issue about intellectual property and the changes of copyright law have come about because of the strong influences, if you like, of US corporations which have a vested interest in making sure that their ownership of copyright and the way that that is policed across the world is done through these types of preferential trade agreements. 
We have aided and abetted the United States in making sure that they can do exactly the same under other trade agreements with other countries. The opposition come in here and say, `We're going to deal with it later on if we get into office.' But, after having this massive cave-in, the question ought to be: What will you do when you're still in opposition?
I ask the minister a specific question in relation to the extension of civil liability under the free trade agreement. As he would know, the free trade agreement specifically allows Australia to limit civil and criminal liability to public institutions, such as nonprofit libraries or archives, educational institutions and public non-commercial broadcasting entities where they were not aware and had no reason to believe that their acts were unlawful. This bill does not make that exemption regarding the civil liability. I ask the minister: why has this limitation not been legislated? Was there something that the negotiators had in mind? Is there a problem that they anticipated and therefore they have not looked at this particular question? 
I also want to ask the minister, with reference to the extension of civil liability, whether he is prepared to answer the question for the Hansard record, just to highlight the flaw in the free trade agreement, of how many ministers in the Howard government have copied CDs for personal use—or, given their age, I might ask how many have copied vinyl onto tape. The reality is that it is being put out there that, as ridiculous as it may sound, we have allowed US laws to be extended into this country such that acts of that sort can now be dealt with as a matter of civil liability. 
I ask the minister whether or not he agrees that these provisions clear the way for a ridiculous amount of civil litigation, which has not been tested yet but is sure to arise given the way these cases are dealt with in the United States. I am sure that all of us think about these things from time to time—we put in a video to record the television or we program it when we go out for the night so that we can have a look later. How are the laws going to apply in those particular circumstances? Can the minister give an answer on that? That is the question here. What is the effect of the free trade agreement, even in relation to something as simple as that, which Australians do every night of the week, every day of the year?
You should be changing the law to make sure that there is a fair use provision available so that Australians do not end up being prosecuted for a civil offence—or perhaps, in some cases, even a criminal offence. I ask again: how many ministers have copied CDs or vinyls? Won't this provision under the free trade agreement lead to civil liability claims? It fundamentally highlights some of the flaws in the intellectual property chapter of the free trade agreement, which is another reason why it ought to not be supported.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I want to respond to Senator Lundy.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Minister, I am not sure whether Senator Harris has any questions so that we can do it all at once.
—If I do not do it this way, I will let Senator Lundy down because she will have been passed by. I want to answer the question that she raised, which I thought was an interesting one: it is principally a draftsman's decision. The language that is within the agreement is not commonly included within our criminal law but, interestingly, page 133 of the explanatory memorandum states:
The offence is intended to implement the obligation under the Agreement that criminal procedures and remedies apply to a person who has committed significant wilful infringement of copyright on a commercial scale ...
In effect, it picks up the words that are in the agreement. In relation to the term `knowingly', I presume there would have to be intent or recklessness. Again, it was unnecessary for the parliamentary draftsman to specifically state that. That is the explanation I have been given.
Because I was searching for that answer, I missed the specific question that Senator Ridgeway asked. I heard him talking about the circumstances at home where somebody might be copying from vinyl onto tape. Senator Ferguson has done a lot of that in his time! I am not sure what the specific question was. If it was whether I believe that the changes that exist in this implementing legislation will lead to further litigation, we do not think so, because the focus is still on piracy on a commercial scale.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—To clarify for the minister, the question went to the extension of civil liability under the free trade agreement. As I understand it, the free trade agreement specifically allows Australia to limit civil and criminal liability of public institutions. I have mentioned everything from non-profit libraries, archives, educational institutions to public non-commercial broadcasting entities. But the bill itself does not make this exemption regarding civil liability. Where civil liability has not been dealt with, I ask about the extension of civil liability in those particular cases where people may think they are doing the right thing but find that, as a result of the free trade agreement and the integration—it is more than harmonisation—of US IP laws, the way has been opened for civil litigation to occur, presumably by record companies, television companies and so on, which seems to be the norm in the United States. Given that we are now opening that way, is there now not the possibility of civil liability actions being taken? ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—I am quite surprised at the minister's response, given that this is the government's policy. Chapter 17 was written by the officials in the negotiating team, and they do not even know what the answer is going to be. I have made it quite clear.
—We're having trouble interpreting your question.
—I have made it quite clear that our understanding of chapter 17, as a result of information that has been provided to us by experts in the field, is that there will be an extension of civil liability in the same way as in the United States. You have to remember here that we have not gone through a process of full public debate and consultation to amend our IP or copyright law. We have decided to change our laws as a result of bringing in a free trade agreement with the United States, and in the process we have allowed the laws of a foreign country to dictate what the terms are going to be in Australia, particularly in relation to civil liability. Minister, given that this is your free trade agreement, it is your policy and it is the laws that you are going to put in place that we are all going to be subject to, you should have some idea of an answer in relation to this particular part of chapter 17 of the free trade agreement.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I have a whole team of experts here, and none of them can understand what this is about.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I have another question in relation to item 154. The issue is a clarification. I will read the explanatory memorandum in relation to item 154 `Offence relating to significant infringement of copyright'. It states:
The offence is intended to implement the obligation under the Agreement that criminal procedures and remedies apply to a person who has committed significant wilful infringement of copyright on a commercial scale who may be acting with no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain. This enables the offence to impose criminal liability on a person acting with no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain in certain circumstances.
Minister, can you tell the chamber what those certain circumstances are, and is this provision designed to capture and create a new criminal offence relating to peer-to-peer or file sharing on the Internet?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-12,—It does actually say `no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain in certain circumstances'. I am seeking clarification because it relates to that and the fact that it has to be a wilful infringement of copyright on a commercial scale.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—If Senator Lundy refers to pages 132 and 133 of the explanatory memorandum, she will see that it does make reference to the fact that it may occur on a commercial scale even though the person acting has no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain, but the damage is still done. I think that is the point that is being made. It may not be the individual in breach who personally benefits, but there is somebody suffering a loss on a commercial scale, and that is what is sought to be dissuaded.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I would like to put on the record that One Nation supports Democrat amendment (17). The purpose of the amendment is to introduce a new section into the act at the end of the section pertaining to fair dealings. The title of the section is quite significant: `Defence of fair use'. Division 3 of the act itself sets out in section 40 fair dealing for the purpose of research or study, in section 41 fair dealing for the purpose of criticism or review and in section 42 fair dealing for the purpose of reporting news. The new section 42A sets out what is a defence. It is much clearer and, on that basis, One Nation indicates to the chamber that we support that amendment.
There has been a lot of discussion this evening—and this morning when the Prime Minister held his press conference—about how altering domestic legislation may actually put the whole free trade agreement in jeopardy. I find that difficult to understand. If that is the case for Australia, as I indicated earlier to the chamber in a document that I tabled, that is not the case for the United States or the opinion of the United States Trade Representative. They say very clearly that nothing in this free trade agreement or any trade agreement prevents congress from changing a US law in the future.
This chamber should support this Democrat amendment—and I think Labor should as well. Not only would this assist anybody trading with the US; it would also assist people domestically. I do not see any mischief in this amendment at all. I think it is quite sound. In the Senate select committee report One Nation recommended in relation to chapter 17 of the free trade agreement on intellectual property rights:
... that nothing in this Agreement will preclude Australia from legislating to ensure that no additional financial burden or other restrictions as may be applicable to intellectual property rights is experienced by any person or entity embarking upon scientific development, research or experimentation.
I think it is perfectly reasonable to expect that people who embark on scientific development, research or experimentation should not be financially burdened or have any other restriction placed upon them. A report of the Industry Functional Advisory Committee on Intellectual Property Rights for Trade Policy Matters—the acronym is IFAC—to the president, the Congress and the United States trade representatives applauded the US negotiators for incorporating into this agreement the obligations set forth in the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performance and Phonogram Treaty, which are so critical to creating the legal infrastructure for e-commerce, for the distribution and transmission of protected material over the Internet and for products in digital format generally. In particular, IFAC applauded the negotiators for convincing Australia to come into full step with and adhere to key provisions of those treaties, consistent with the manner in which they were implemented by the US in 1998 in their Digital Millenium Copyright Act. So the Americans have this very clear understanding that Australia has agreed to come into line not only with America's copyright—all of the sectors within chapter 17—but also with their position on digital format generally, adopting their protections against digital transmission on the Internet. That is quite a huge step, and other speakers have spoken about their concerns. 
Another interesting comment that IFAC make, and this may not bode well for Australia, is about the Free Trade Area of the Americas and the level of intellectual property protection it contains. Our free trade agreement should set a new baseline for future free trade agreements, including the Free Trade Area of the Americas. Stop and think about it. We are no longer talking about Mexico, the United States and Canada. We are now talking about America entering into a free trade agreement with the entire American continent, north and south.
—What's your problem?
—The problem with that, Senator McGauran, is that this free trade agreement between us and America will become the basis for an American free trade agreement in the Americas. Ultimately there will be implications for Australia when American companies are domiciled in all areas within those states. How will we work out the rule of origin? Does that have any effect on this agreement? In conclusion, I want to reinforce the fact that the Democrats' amendment has the ability to introduce into the Copyright Act a section which clearly sets out a defence for fair use. I also say that, if it is good enough for the Americans to be able to alter their domestic law after the free trade agreement has been put into effect, Australia should not have fewer rights.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-12,"—I enter this very long debate for the first time in my capacity as Democrats spokesperson for IT. I want to give a voice to the many people who have contacted me to talk about their concerns. I have received letters, emails and phone calls with respect to their fears about what the free trade agreement will mean for things like access and use of open source and copyright provisions for software and software development. I am conscious that Senator Ridgeway has moved this amendment and spoken to open source within that.
Two news articles have come to my attention in recent days. They come from very different areas—one from Europe and one from Australia—but they both speak about these concerns. They are brief, so I will read parts of them and then ask some questions of the minister. The first article was reported in the IDG News Service on 6 August, and it says:
The City of Munich has put its Linux plans on hold in response to fears over software patents.
And this goes to the heart of my concerns. The article continues:
The city has cancelled a call for bids on the Linux migration project, called the LiMux Project, planned for July, according to the city's CIO, Wihelm Hoegner. Hoegner made the announcement on the LiMux Project mailing list ...
The city's decision reflects growing concerns in Europe and the US that software patents could be used to derail open source projects, which depend on freedom from intellectual property licence fees. Such projects also generally don't have the financial resources or patent arsenals necessary to fend off intellectual property lawsuits. 
Software patents currently are not allowed in the EU, under the European Patent Convention, but many believe a directive currently going through the EU's legislative process could change the situation dramatically. “Patent law: patentability of computer-implemented inventions”, known as the software patents directive, would open the floodgates to US-style software patents, according to critics.
... Alderman Jens Muehlhaus, called attention to the situation in two motions calling for the mayor of Munich, the Social Democrat Christian Ude, to analyze how the EU software patent directive affects Munich's Linux project.
Meuhlhaus said a cursory analysis of the city's proposed Linux client software turned up conflicts with more than 50 European software patents. The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII), which coordinates anti-software patents activities in Europe, carried out the analysis for Meuhlhaus.
A company holding one or more of these patents could issue a “cease and desist” order to the Munich government, effectively shutting the city's computer systems down or forcing the payment of licensing fees, Meuhlhaus said. In response—
and this gets to the core of my question—
the city said it would halt the Linux project until it could thoroughly analyze the legal and financial risks.
The question I direct to the minister is: what, if anything, has Australia done to analyse the legal and financial risks of the FTA if its impact on open source is to have the same impact on Linux that we are seeing in Munich? The article continues:
Munich's decision underlines the dangers posed by allowing software patents in Europe, according to consultant and developer Florian Mueller, who works with ... software patent issues. He said the city of Munich, in its recently-completed feasibility study, had proved that open-source software could compete with proprietary software from companies such as Microsoft, but the introduction of software patents would put this competitiveness in danger.
“Open source software will survive any new legislation. The question is, can it be competitive three years down the line?” Mueller said.
That too is the question for Australia, in the same context. The article further states:
So far most people have ignored the software patent issue, saying `it isn't going to happen to us'. Now they're starting to see that it is a clear and present danger.
The decision comes shortly after a study found that a total of 283 registered US software patents, including 27 held by Microsoft, could be used as the basis of patent lawsuits against the Linux kernel. The study was funded by Open Source Risk Management (OSRM), a company that provides insurance against lawsuits related to the use of open source products, and conducted by patent attorney Dan Ravicher, executive director of the Public Patent Foundation and senior counsel to the Free Software Foundation.
Munich's actions are being closely watched as a bellwether for the fortunes of Linux in the public sector, in Europe and elsewhere. Following the city's initial strategic decision to migrate to Linux, a year ago, the City of Paris ordered its own investigation into a switch to open source. The city of Bergen in Norway recently decided to consolidate older Windows and Unix servers on Novell Inc.'s Suse Linux Enterprise Server 8. Other recent wins for Linux include the French Ministry of Equipment and Allied Irish Banks.
My second question, then, to the minister is: what is Australia and its departments doing in watching the development of this process throughout Europe? On 6 August, the same day as the IDG article appeared, I read online, and closer to home, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald. It is an assertion, but the article makes the claim:
The US-Australia Free Trade Agreement poses a grave threat to the entire Australian software development industry due to the legal framework on intellectual property which is required upon adoption of the pact, the Open Source Industry Association and Linux Australia have warned.
Fair enough; that is their assertion. The article goes on: 
In a statement issued in Melbourne today, both organisations said the FTA would hamper Australia's ability to efficiently compete in global markets. “Much like the introduction of a flawed patenting regime for pharmaceuticals, adoption of a flawed patent regime for software is not in Australia's interests,” the statement said. 
Brendan Scott, a spokesman for the groups and a lawyer himself, said the effects would be felt by all developers, not merely those who worked with open source software.
... any non-trivial piece of software could contain as many as thousands of code processes, algorithms or software modules, any one of which could infringe one or many US software patents.
And here is the key quote:
“Most Australian developers have probably built products which `infringe' on US software patents. Introducing a system which makes it simpler for these patent holders to bring such legal hooks into Australia is very damaging to the local industry,” Scott said.
He pointed out that Australian developers would face huge fines if they recreated software processes—
and this is the fundamental point—
while being unaware of the possibility that they may been patented. “Ignorance of such patents is no excuse. In future, Australian developers may not be able to make any software without the fear of paying ransom.”
The key point of clarification I seek from the minister here is: is it a fact that being ignorant of these patents is no defence? The article goes on:
Scott said a majority of local developers lacked the money and time needed to check their software code-bases against the tens of thousands of software patents which could flood the market if Australia degraded its stringent software patent laws.
“US patent law allows for the imposition of punitive damages. If Australia adopted a similar law, local developers could be sued for many times more than any actual `damages' they may have caused the patent holder, merely as a warning for others,” he said.
He said huge software houses had the resources to obtain patents. “The introduction of US-style software patenting will therefore be a one-sided affair, and definitely not in the local industry's favour,” he cautioned.
Even if an Australian developer owned a patent, he or she, in most cases, would not have the money and time to pursue a case against a big company. “Most software patents are owned by huge ICT firms, which keep them to be used when necessary to do an opponent serious damage or for legal leverage in deal negotiation. They are not used to `extend the art and science' of technology,” Scott claimed.
We have seen that most vociferously with the film, picture and recording industry in the United States through the processes of the DMCA. The article continues:
He was of the opinion that a large number of software patents in the US had been granted for processes or algorithms which are exceptionally vague or, even worse, quite obvious to most competent software development practitioners. 
“They should not have been granted in the first place, as they are not `novel'. By degrading Australia's patent system to match the US approach we will handicap our local developers needlessly.” 
Scott also warned that there were an equal number of issues which would arise with the introduction of DMCA-style legislation, also mandated by the FTA. “... anything which stops academic research into security and which also stops any endeavour towards software interoperability engineering is a serious problem for R & D in this country,” he said. 
He was referring to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act which was signed into law in the US on October 28, 1998. The DMCA's stated purpose is to update US copyright laws for the digital age. 
Both organisations said they backed the proposals made by David Vaile of the UNSW's Baker & McKenzie Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre as a means of starting to tackle the problems posed by the FTA.  
Vaile's proposals— 
not the minister's: David Vaile's from the university—
Tighten the criteria for software and `business process' patent applications. 
Establish a public interest litigation fund to enable Open Source software developers, integrators or users to respond to anti-competitive and tactical patent infringement claims, if they would otherwise be unable to do so. 
Official support for global `prior art' research projects to assist research of the viability of such claims.
Change the IPaustralia.gov.au page to make lodged patents easier to track, so that developers can protect themselves from bogus patents. 
Limit the implementation of controversial DMCA-style laws, to the extent they'd inhibit development of open, compatible tools for common file formats and networks. 
Introduce US `Fair Use' amendments to Copyright Act. 
These encapsulate many of the arguments put to me by way of letters, phone calls and emails. I have taken the time to place them on the record as a summary of the kinds of concerns that we Democrats also have. I would finally like to ask the minister: Senator Lundy, who spoke before me, was emphatic in her claim that the DMCA had absolutely no effect, no impact and no access to the Australian jurisdiction and did not form part of the free trade agreement. What I and many others would like to hear is an emphatic, unambiguous confirmation of that from the minister.
If the arguments that we have heard from the likes of David Vaile and others are wrong then they need to hear that loudly and clearly now to put to rest the very real fear that many in the Australian community have about the DMCA—that it is going to reach into Australia and have the adverse effects that people hold genuine fears of. It is an incredibly invidious and powerful piece of legislation dreamt up by the film, picture and recording industry in America and introduced under the influence of former President Clinton, I believe. I would seek an undertaking from the minister that that is the case. If it is not the case then people also need to know that this is the path the government is going down and that the fears and concerns expressed in the correspondence and opinion pieces will be played out, in which case we Democrats are keen now to be on the record as saying, `We were there to argue against that.'",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I thought I had addressed these issues in response to questions raised by Senator Lundy. We talked about the issue of patenting software and the differences between the US patenting system and the Australian patenting system. Basically, I said my advice is that the free trade agreement will not have an effect on Australia's current approach and treatment of applications to patent computer software. Consequently, this will not affect the take-up and spread of open source software.
Computer software is already patentable in Australia if it meets the patentability criteria of being `new', `inventive', `a manner of manufacture' and `useful'.
Basically, it is business as usual for IP Australia in processing patents. I think that the fears that have been expressed are largely unfounded, although I understand that there is always a clash of commercial interests. I understand why Senator Greig is interested at least in seeing that the open source software industry gets a fair go. He would probably also argue, I would hope, that those who invest heavily in something that is patentable receive adequate protection for their investment as well. That is a clash of interests that we always find in a debate on intellectual property. The fears that are being expressed—fears relating to a concern of a translation of US patent law to Australia—are, as I said, on my advice, unfounded as the Australian patent law is not significantly affected by the agreement or the implementation law, even if some of the concepts are incorporated within the agreement. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-12,"—`The Australian patent law is not significantly affected ...' That is a great word to watch: `significantly'. The adjective `largely' in `the fears ... are largely unfounded' is there to let the minister and the government off the hook, but all it does is confirm people's concerns. There is no categorical assurance in this at all. As ever, it will go to the faceless people in the tribunal set up outside the reach of this parliament to determine. There has been no countermanding of that argument all the way through here. It is a very difficult and complex area. Other speakers have pointed to the Ross Gittins article, and the Democrats have come forward with this amendment. In an awesomely complex area where some people feel they will gain and others feel they will lose, the one thing we know is that this does not protect the interests of Australia. It is not watertight; it is `largely'—`you can largely feel okay about it'—and `significantly' without worries. The words there point to the fact that there will be arbitration on this. As soon as it goes to arbitration, let the Australian industry know that nothing in this parliament can save them. There is not even a report-back here.
By the way, if there are citizens who want to join in that suit when it occurs, they can write a letter. The tribunal might deign to look at their letter; it might not—it does not matter, because they cannot go and take part in it. If the matters are confidential—and which company would say that they are not?—nobody will be able to know what went on. What is more, they are beyond the reach of freedom of information. So there we are.
We will be supporting the Democrat amendment. We know there are difficulties for some people in it, but the reality is that the Labor Party is going to make sure that the government does not allow this to be amended or fixed at all. See you in the faceless court. Or read about it somewhere down the line. There is nothing more hopeful that can be said about this. We are dealing with imponderables which will be sorted out under the weight of the huge American cartels and the most powerful IP and IT industry in the world—by a long shot—going to court over matters that are not defined in this legislation.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-12,"—Without having the benefit of Hansardtext, I felt that the minister was being judicious in his answer when he prefaced it by saying, `There is nothing currently ...', leaving me with a fear that perhaps what he was suggesting was that at some future point, if the Australian government or its departments were to change tack in terms of policy direction or administrative application, the fears of which I spoke do come into play. Was that just a turn of phrase that the minister used? Or is there an inherent suggestion in his answer that, while the fears that I have articulated tonight may not come into play now, they may in the future? Is there something which can trigger the application of the DMCA or the patenting deals that I have spoken of and articulated from articles? Do they have potential application in the future?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—As I understand it, there is nothing in the agreement or the implementation bill that would do that. If a future government wants to change Australia's patent law, that is a different thing, but, of course, it will have to go through a legislative process. Does this government have an intention to change it to a position closer to that of the United States? It has no such intention, but I cannot speak for future governments in future years. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—I am going to ask the minister some questions in relation to copyright extension and copyright duration. In particular, does the minister agree that the free trade agreement with the United States will not provide uniform standards with respect to copyright duration in Australia? It is a relevant question when you consider the copyright term of Australia and whether or not that will be harmonised with other major trading partners in Asia, the Middle East, Canada and New Zealand. More particularly, it goes to the question of whether we are going to have a series of different arrangements with different trading partners. Doesn't the extension of the copyright term by 20 years not only set a bad precedent but also put us out of sync with our other trading partners?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I think the answer is that it moves us closer to the largest economy in the world and, to the degree that the intellectual property laws become closer, it facilitates doing business in either direction. What do I think will be the trend in relation to other states? I suspect the trend will be in the same direction in due course, but that might take a while.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—On the question of balance between copyright owner and copyright user, I wonder whether the minister might make some comment about the free trade agreement with the United States and the precedent that is being set there. Essentially, because we are a net importer of copyright material, as I understand it most of what will occur will be that copyright users will have a lesser set of rights than copyright owners. Isn't it the case that it does not provide international harmonisation with respect to user privileges in other parts of the world? The question really is about balance. Isn't the balance being altered here in this free trade agreement in favour of the United States, which is predominantly a copyright owner, compared to arrangements that already exist in other parts of the world in terms of the balance between user privileges and other copyright owners outside the United States?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I hesitate to say it but, again, the Democrats are looking at these issues somewhat negatively. It is true that we are a net user, but some of us have great confidence in the intellectual capabilities of Australia and the opportunities to build strong, internationally-competitive business based on intellectual property. I believe that, the more we can encourage that and support it, the better off we will be. We have looked to a dynamic economy that grows particularly at the intellectually demanding end. It is interesting to see that between 1996 and 2000 Australian copyright industries grew annually by an average of 5.7 per cent. I suspect that, particularly with greater opportunities to sell into the largest economy in the world, that can be further accelerated. But to encourage Australians to invest in intellectual property is going to require giving them reasonable protection for their investment. With regard to the short term, I think I understand what Senator Ridgeway is saying, but that is a concession that is made in order to have the opportunity to grow, which is provided through this agreement.
In relation to third countries, yes, I can see that with different systems throughout the world that provides difficulties. Greater harmonisation would benefit all. That is obviously going to take time but, as the number of bilateral agreements around the world accelerates—and they seem to be occurring everywhere at the moment—we might find that harmonisation in these areas or movement in that direction occurs much faster than we would otherwise think.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-12,"—I know that this is a very recent thing but it has just come to my attention that the High Court has granted special leave to hear the appeal in Sony v. Stevens and that it will now have an opportunity to determine the definition of technological protection measures and temporary copies. So the question that comes from that is: does the minister feel that it is appropriate for parliament to be pre-empting the decision of the High Court by providing much tighter technological protection measures and much tighter protection of temporary copies under the free trade agreement? Following from that, has the minister or the government obtained any legal advice as to the possible outcome of the High Court case?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—This is late-breaking news, I gather, Senator Greig. It is very difficult to get instructions on the run. The parliament is the master of its own destiny. The parliament sets the law. The High Court interprets the situation as it existed at the time the case was brought. So be it. The idea that the parliament should not determine the appropriate future legislative structure because previous matters are being litigated does not seem to me to be particularly persuasive.

These amendments relate to performers' rights, which is a particularly important issue, mostly because of what the free trade agreement says or does not say on performers' rights. I remind the chamber that, back in 1996 during the election campaign, the Howard government committed to the introduction of rights for performers. Since then we have not seen anything come from the opportunities to meet this commitment. It is only at the insistence of other governments that our government is even prepared to look at this issue, namely in the form of the proposals in the free trade agreement. They are performers' rights essentially in name only. In all other respects the government is asking us to vote to enhance the rights that are already enjoyed by powerful record companies. That is the effect of this particular part of the free trade agreement.
The amendments we are proposing are the bare minimum necessary to take account of the inequities and inequalities of bargaining power between performers and big record companies with regard to performances in sound recordings. Our performers' rights amendments are essentially intended to achieve four main objectives: the first is to provide a regime for performers pursuant to which employment status is irrelevant; the second is to ensure the legislation provides an arrangement which is genuinely beneficial to performers; the third is to provide for a declared collecting society, as with other rights holders; and the last is to ensure that the rights regime does not provide performers with lesser rights than other rights holders.
The issue of performers' rights in the context of the free trade agreement epitomises, I think, the serious problems with the agreement generally because performers' rights have been in need of addressing for some years in this country. The issues involved are crucial for Australian performers regarding their rights in sound recordings and should be discussed more openly with the performer groups and individuals in Australia, and those whose interests are at stake should be able to make a contribution to the legislative changes. Certainly industry representatives have been active in their concerns about the lack of rights for performers. Unfortunately, they have received little attention due to the deal put together by the government and the ALP. 
The government has an obligation to listen to the needs of Australians and to respond to them. Quite frankly, the Australian parliament should be where laws are made which so directly impact Australians in such a negative way. In particular where such crucial rights are being taken from performers or not enshrined in new law our democratic processes should not be circumvented in this way. That essentially is what is happening under the free trade agreement. We are making the discussion that we should be having in Australia subordinate to discussions that have taken place with the United States about what the new regime should be even for performers in this country.
It is an insult to the Australian public that this government thinks that between them and President George W. Bush they can come up with laws which Australia's parliament is held to ransom to approve. If the free trade agreement is not included in our domestic law, the United States is entitled to compensation. I ask the government how it is that this government feels entitled to put Australia in that position. The minister might want to clarify whether or not compensation is to be payable.  
To oblige the parliament to pass laws detrimental to Australia in so many different areas through a trade agreement with the United States—policy making by trade negotiation with America—is not good enough as far as the process goes and certainly as far as the national interest is concerned. There should have been negotiation in a legislative process about balancing the interests of Australians, not about trying to find a balance between the interests of Australians and the interests of Americans. We should have looked first and foremost at the domestic situation, but that did not occur. The Prime Minister made his commitment way back in 1996, but we have not heard anything since then. Over the past eight years, we have had an opportunity to do something; we now have a government that is forced to respond in a free trade agreement on performers' rights, but only in name. It does not give them the rights that they are entitled to and which they should receive as creators in this country. 
Our amendments are the result of in-depth consultation with industry representatives, specifically Lindy Morrison and the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance. Lindy and Simon Whipp from MEAA have worked tirelessly for the sake of performers' rights and deserve to be acknowledged for the work they have done over many years. The provisions we have sought to amend effectively strip performers of any legal rights by allowing employers to be defined as makers, usurping the role of the performers' legal rights. 
We also seek to include amendments to the Copyright Act which ensure that payments made by broadcasters for sound recording of live performances are actually received by the performers. At the moment, whether or not Australians realise it, our performers do not get the payments in those circumstances. They often end up in that big kitty bag that is held by record companies. So the power differential between performers and record companies means that at any opportunity record companies are more easily able to negotiate with performers for broadcasting payments to be delivered to them. Through our amendments, we seek to minimise the opportunities for this to happen by providing that the Australian Attorney-General—not the United States Attorney-General—can declare a collecting agency specifically to collect these payments and not leave it to the PPCA, which is controlled by the record companies. 
It is shameful that this government and indeed the ALP—who have been missing in action on this question—will not be supporting performers' rights through supporting this amendment. It is vitally important that we understand that this issue has been around for quite some time. We put forward these amendments as serious ones that do need to be taken into account, but again this highlights the fundamental flaws in the free trade agreement. It is a debate we should have been having over the previous eight years, not one that has come about just because the free trade agreement has landed on the shores of Australia. Effectively, we are now being told that, because of the free trade agreement, we will get performers' rights in name only but nothing beyond that. I wonder whether the minister might want to respond to those particular issues.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—The government has a fundamentally different approach from the Australian Democrats on this issue. As I understand, we are implementing our obligations consistent with the World Intellectual Property Organisation obligations and the Performances and Phonograms Treaty, which will provide performers with new economic rights and the embodiment in sound recordings and moral rights of both their recorded and live performances. The existing protection for performers' live performances will also be broadened to include protection against unauthorised non-broadcast transmission such as those via the Internet. This performers' rights model is based on a joint authorship approach which deems performers to be makers of sound recordings jointly with the current owners of copyright as the owners of the original master sound recording and therefore joint copyright owners at first instance. 
As joint owners, performers will have the same fully assignable economic rights as current owners in sound recordings. Performers will also have moral rights in their performances, including the right to be known as the performers of their performances and the right to prevent their performances from being subjected to derogatory treatment. Performers' moral rights are similar to those granted to authors by the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Act 2000. The scheme ensures that Australian performers benefit from copyright protection which is consistent with international standards and which supports commercial opportunities for recording artists. 
As I understand it, the Democrats advocate moving in a different direction, which would be inconsistent with the international standards as set by, as I said, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the Phonograms Treaty.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-12,"—I move Australian Democrats amendment (3) on sheet 4361:
(3)	Clause 2, page 1 (lines 9 to 12), omit subclause (1) (but not the table), substitute: 
	(1)	Each provision of this Act specified in column 1 of the table commences at the later date of either:
	(a)	the day as specified in accordance with column 2; or

	(iv)	Australia and the United States sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, done at New York on 18 December 1979;

	(viii)	Australia and the United States ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (of May 1992).
I will talk very briefly about this amendment as I am mindful of the time. This amendment is about making the commencement of the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 conditional upon the fulfilment of various other international obligations. The government are intent on pursuing bilateral trade deals and have been criticised for their blind pursuit of this approach rather than focusing their attention on efforts in the multilateral area, where there is greater scope for benefits for both Australian producers and those of the developing world. 
As Jagdish Bhagwati has stated, the effect of this proliferation of bilateral trade deals is like that of a `spaghetti bowl', and I have to agree with him because that is the outcome. The more free trade agreements that are signed, the more incompatible the standards and rules of origin will become. As it stands, crisscrossing rules of origin requirements are making it harder and harder for Australian businesses, especially small to medium enterprises, to comply with the various requirements of various countries. It probably will not be a big problem for the larger corporations; they will be fine. But what about small and medium businesses and their capacity to sell their products in a wide variety of markets?
So in many respects the preferential trade deal approach by government is flawed. We should be concentrating our efforts on trade liberalisation through the World Trade Organisation to ensure that developments are uniform and open to all. Binding international obligations are an area of some concern to the Australian Democrats, hence this amendment. The fact is that both Australia and the US are citizens of the international community with all the rights and obligations that go along with that. Trade agreements are becoming more and more complex. They are now covering a range of social, cultural and environmental impacts that cross over into areas of international responsibilities, unlike any that existed in the past. Through FTAs such as this, we are carving up benefits for us and our mates but we also need to consider all of our international obligations.  
This amendment seeks to make entry into force of the free trade agreement conditional upon the ratification of other international treaties. We should use our strong relationship and friendship with the US more effectively. A key characteristic of a good friendship is not merely blindly following along with whatever our friends decide to do. Friends are in the best position to let their mates know when they need to get their act together. In this regard, our government needs to take advantage of its strong friendship with the Bush administration—presuming it is there and it is a real one—to let them know that it is unacceptable for the US to take leadership in world affairs while not ratifying some of the most important international treaties operating in the world today. It seems to me that mates do not let mates get away with that sort of thing. 
This amendment would ensure that the free trade agreement does not come into force—that is, the US would not get any benefits from the deal until they do a number of things. They ought to sign and ratify the optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, like many other Western nations. They ought to sign and ratify the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. Both Australia and the US ought to sign and ratify the optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
Both Australia and the US should sign and ratify the optional protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the United States ought to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Given the way that events have transpired over the past few weeks, particularly in terms of relations between Britain and the United States, the United States ought to permit David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, who are currently detained at Guantanamo Bay, to be repatriated to Australia. And both Australia and the United States ought to ratify the Kyoto protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Some might think that these are laughable, but the reality is that free trade agreements, where they extend so far into social, environmental and cultural policy, ought to also deal with the standards that exist within societies across the world. If we are to have this spaghetti bowl arrangement across the world, with a series of trade agreements that go beyond just trade to the question of social policy within communities, part of that also has to be about making sure that the standards that we expect of one country ought to be applied to ourselves—that it is not just a one-way street.
We believe that it is entirely appropriate for Australia to use opportunities that may be presented in the free trade agreement to formalise a strong relationship with the US but that we should use our influence as best we can to encourage them to meet their important international responsibilities. Of particular note is a very important and timely matter in terms of the amendment relating to the Foreign Judgments Act. The negotiation of the free trade agreement would have been an ideal opportunity to lock reciprocal arrangements in place. It is important for corporate accountability and for the protection of Australian interests under this free trade agreement. Reciprocal arrangements such as would be required under this amendment would enable us to go after the assets of companies such as James Hardie in the United States. 
This amendment requires that Australia and the United States enter reciprocal arrangements under the Foreign Judgments Act. It is designed to ensure that asbestos victims of James Hardie can obtain compensation. As my fellow senators will no doubt be aware, the New South Wales government has initiated an inquiry into the conduct of James Hardie Industries and their asbestos funding shortfall. This inquiry, headed by David Jackson QC, is currently hearing evidence. Although we will not see the final report until 21 September, it is clear that James Hardie will have an estimated $2 billion liability payable over the next 40 years for asbestos related injury to employees and customers. Back in 2001, they created a compensation fund of $293 million, which, they argued, would pay for all future claims. At about the same time—we all now know the story—it moved its headquarters to the Netherlands and all of the James Hardie assets are now in the Netherlands and the United States.
For any court to order that James Hardie pay the asbestos victims, Australia needs to enact the reciprocal foreign judgments legislation with either the United States or the Netherlands. We understand that the government is approaching the Netherlands about this. However, the government has not raised it with the United States, where most of the assets are being held. I believe that there is an opportunity to do so through the free trade agreement.
By supporting the amendment the Senate will be not only sending a very strong and powerful message but also increasing the prospects that the victims of James Hardie asbestos will be properly compensated. It will ensure that all Australian companies cannot just move offshore when they want to in order to avoid debts or to avoid liability or compensation to be awarded by Australian courts.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-08-12,"—I find it passing strange that, as Senator Ridgeway has pointed out, the US free trade agreement did not include the ratification of the Foreign Judgments Act. In this debate, we have heard a lot about how one of the benefits of this agreement will be the closer meshing of the corporate and economic activities of Australia and the United States. It strikes me as a serious oversight that the government has not completed that process by ensuring that the recognition of judgments in one country by the other will be brought into play. If we are going to have closer economic relations, then obviously in both countries we need closer respect for the rule of law and the courts to ensure that those closer economic relations can be operated on a proper and civil basis. I ask the minister whether the matter of the enforcement of civil judgments through the Foreign Judgments Act was raised with the United States. If not, why not? Does the government have any plans to follow up the US-Australia free trade agreement with action to ensure that the Foreign Judgments Act is in fact complied with by United States corporations?",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1

It strikes me as a serious flaw in the free trade agreement that the government has let this fall through the cracks. I ask the minister again whether the government has raised with the United States the enactment of a reciprocal agreement on the Foreign Judgments Act and whether that will be raised as a matter of some priority to complete the circle of obligations under this agreement or whether we are simply going to allow judgments in this country not to be recognised in judgments of the United States.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-12,"—I am still working on the previous question, but I draw your attention to article 14.7.6 at the top of page 14-6, under the competition part of the agreement, where it says:
The Parties shall work together to examine the scope for establishing greater bilateral recognition of foreign judgments of their respective judicial authorities obtained for the benefit of consumers, investors, or customers who have suffered economic harm as a result of being deceived, defrauded, or misled; and shall report on the feasibility and appropriateness of, and progress toward, greater recognition of such foreign judgments at the first meeting of the Joint Committee.
We think that that is the only reference to the subject matter within the agreement.

At the eleventh hour the Democrats have sought to change the name of the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 to the Restricted Trade Agreement Bill. We propose to change the name, because we have to be fearless and frank about what we have under the free trade agreement. It simply is not a free trade agreement; it is much less. I think that the government itself has agreed that this is nowhere near a completely free trade agreement. It leaves in place plenty of barriers and sets a dangerous precedent in a number of ways that will indicate to the world trading community the terms Australia is willing to accept in trade deals.
We went through a number of options when trying to decide the best name for this legislation. It is probably good to put a bit of humour into this debate right at the end. Some of the options that we considered were `The Unfair Trade Agreement Bill' and `The un-Australian Bill'—which was a particular favourite of mine. What authority do we have for such a statement? None other than the Deputy Prime Minister himself, Mr Anderson. This was a reference to his comments at the beginning of the year, when he said that `to accept a deal without sugar would be un-Australian'. That is what he said and that is what happened. Not a full week later the trade minister ticked off on a deal that did just that. The deal is un-Australian; it will harm our long-term trade interests in an economic, social, cultural and environmental sense. A final option was to rename the legislation the `51st State of America Transition Bill'. We made the considered judgment, however, that the government and the ALP were unlikely to accept any of these alternatives—or even the one that we chose—because that would be to admit the truth.
The government and the ALP know that this is a substandard deal that will do more harm than good to our country; nevertheless, they are all going to support it. They cannot deny, however, that this is not a free trade agreement or a fair trade agreement in the proper sense of the term. In February, when the deal was announced, the opposition leader, Mr Latham, said:
This is not a free trade agreement, it is not a free trade agreement at all, it's a partial trade agreement that from our assessment this morning is not in Australia's interest.
Later, whilst speaking on the Sunday program he described the free trade agreement as a `restricted trade agreement which is a major concern'. The government should agree that the title of this bill is misleading. It does infer that this deal will open up trade between our two countries when, in fact, it is all about opening up the areas America wanted and maintaining the restrictions that would have brought real gains to Australian producers. This is a restricted trade agreement—it is time that we called a spade a spade—which is why the Democrats are seeking to amend the title of the bill. I think the government have based most of their sales pitch relating to this FTA on the assumption that it will bring a significant economic benefit to Australia. They talk about the analysis, but they have not weighed up the costs in the process because they have not bothered to look at those questions. 
While the Democrats believe that wide-ranging trade agreements of this nature should be assessed according to a broader set of criteria than mere economics, it is useful to look at the vastly divergent views about whether the government's loudly proclaimed benefits are ever likely to eventuate. We recognise that modelling is an inexact science and that there are a range of different assumptions that can be used to produce remarkably different results. However, I think the government have deliberately misled the Australian people with respect to the benefits of the deal. They have done so according to results from their own economic modelling study. It is useful therefore to consider the CIE report that the government are basing their projections on and to outline some of the shortcomings of the analysis.  
The debate has probably been exhausted in terms of going through those issues, so I will not repeat them. I make the point in closing that we have to be genuine when we talk about the effect of the free trade agreement as subordinating the national interest to the interests of the United States. As I have said many times, social policy and, more particularly, health and IP policy and policy concerning the environment and culture have all been subjugated to the text of the free trade agreement. It will be the deciding factor as to how we deal with these crucial issues into the future. While we would expect the free trade agreement to be a great opportunity to carve out something unique, positive and progressive, we may get some winners and some losers. There are those who are happy and who will say that they will get some benefits from it. But, quite frankly, even when you consider the hoops which have to be jumped through in the various states for small and medium enterprises and the costs involved in doing that, I would imagine that they will come back to Australia and say, `Let's just deal here or deal in any other country.'
I will not delay the chamber anymore. I just wanted to give a very brief explanation about this particular issue. I do want to say finally that I appreciate the work done by Senator Hill and the officials who have stayed for the past couple of nights. I am sure that everyone has families and other commitments that they need to get to, but I thought I would acknowledge the work that has been done. Thank you.

The issue she was interested in satisfying herself of was that it was not unbalanced—that the provision that is in the Australian enabling bill is complemented by a similar provision in the American legislation. The provision that provides for this verification process is at article 4.3.4 on page 4-5 of the act, which relates to Customs cooperation. I will not read it out. I remind the chamber that, under the American system, the act is voted on by the congress. There is also enabling legislation by the US Congress that has a head of power, and then the implementation of a similar provision is intended to be through a US regulation.

I am not quite sure, from what the minister said, whether that does not exist yet, whether it is to be placed in a regulation or whether it does exist and the free trade agreement will be recognised by regulation. Senator Nettle is now with us, but what she was seeking was the place in the US legislation where this complementary provision now exists.

... the exporting party, through its competent authority, shall permit the importing party, through its competent authority, to assist in a verification conducted ...
On the Australian side, we went straight from that to the enabling legislation. On the American side, they bring into law the agreement, which was the provision that I just read out. They then pass enabling legislation that has within it a head of power, which is section 103 of the US enabling legislation. Under that head of power the US is intending to issue a regulation. When those processes are finished, the outcome should be complementary provisions on both sides, albeit achieved in different ways.

US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION (CUSTOMS TARIFF) BILL 2004
Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I move One Nation amendment (1) on revised sheet 4367:
(1)	Page 3 (after line 11), after clause 3, insert: 
4 Exclusion of services provided by governmental authorities
	(1)	For the purposes of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, all services the subject of a customs tariff which are supplied by a governmental authority in the exercise of its responsibilities are excluded from the provisions of the Agreement.
	(2)	For the purposes of subsection (1), a governmental authority includes:
	(a)	a central, regional or local government and any authority of any of the governments listed in this paragraph; and
	(b)	a non-governmental body when exercising of powers delegated by a central, a regional or a local government or an authority of any of the governments listed in this paragraph.
The reason for moving this amendment to the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004 relates to the difficulties in being able to move amendments to various bills because of the way the bill is structured. I spoke earlier about the implementation bill changing 10 bills, and now we have moved to the next implementation bill, relating specifically to Customs. One Nation's concern about this particular bill relates to a side letter dated 18 May between Ambassador Zoellick and the Hon. Mark Vaile. Both parties make a commitment in this letter, which says: 
During the course of their negotiations concerning Chapter Thirteen, the Parties discussed Article 13.15 (Recognition). Based on these discussions, I have the honour to confirm the Parties' shared understanding that the scope of measures covered by Article 13.15 is no less extensive than the scope of measures covered by Article VII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and paragraph 3 of the GATS Annex on Financial Services.
I know that the side letter is speaking primarily about financial services. The real concern that One Nation has with that commitment the way it stands is that it brings into the American free trade agreement the sections of GATS that also refer to services provided by government authorities. For the benefit of the chamber I will read the One Nation amendment:
(1)  For the purposes of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, all services the subject of a customs tariff which are supplied by a governmental authority in the exercise of its responsibilities are excluded from the provisions of the Agreement.
(2)  For the purposes of subsection (1), a governmental authority includes:
(a)  a central, regional or local government and any authority of any of the governments listed in this paragraph; and
(b)  a non-governmental body when exercising of powers delegated by a central, a regional or a local government or an authority of any of the governments listed in this paragraph.
By introducing this amendment, One Nation is taking the reference to government services as it stands in GATS and excluding it from the free trade agreement. One Nation believes this is imperative because the majority of our local governments—I will work on the local government level—currently have the ability to award a contract for services in their particular area and an increased grant of up to 10 per cent to a company that has local status. In excluding government services as currently defined in GATS, we are preserving the ability of, as the amendment says, a central, regional or local government or an authority of any of the governments listed in this paragraph. So we are excluding them from the implications in relation to the General Agreement on Trade in Services.
The second thing this would achieve, and probably the more important, would be to clarify the definition of a government service. As it currently stands in GATS, a government service is a service that is not supplied commercially or by one or more service providers. The concern that One Nation has with that definition in GATS is that, historically, government services have had an equivalent service in private enterprise. For example, there are state funded hospitals and there are private hospitals. Under the definition in GATS, hospital services provided by a state government are not excluded. If they are not excluded from GATS, they are not excluded by the definition of these side letters and they are not excluded from the free trade agreement.
Private enterprise has capacity on our railways. Schools are a more frightening aspect of GATS. For the benefit of the chamber, it encompasses not only our lower level state schools but also high schools and universities. By agreeing to write these into the free trade agreement, the Australian government is writing in the ability for any American provider of a service to, in a legal sense, raise an argument that they should have access to government services that they would normally have been excluded from. When I introduced this amendment, I did raise the difficulty of addressing these structural issues in light of the way the agreement has been written. The only way we could partially exclude them would be through the customs tariff bill. I know it would be an unusual way to achieve it, but the difficulty is how to address the issues of concern through the structure of the free trade agreement. It is very difficult to find any government service that is not provided by a service provider, with the possible exception of reticulated water. Our electricity is well and truly catered for by private enterprise; therefore there could be no claim that the provision of electricity should be excluded from GATS. 
One Nation put forward a number of recommendations to the Senate inquiry into the free trade agreement. Item 10 of article 1.2, `General definitions', of the free trade agreement says:
GATS means the General Agreement on Trade in Services,contained in Annex 1B to the WTO Agreement;
Item 22 sets out very clearly that a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis nor in competition with one or more service suppliers. One Nation recommends that all services that are supplied in the exercise of a government authority be excluded from the Australia-US free trade agreement. That is the reason that One Nation has moved this first amendment to the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004.

5 Free trade agreement subordinate to national interest
		No action by way of customs tariff reductions may be taken under this Act or its regulations that has an adverse impact on rural and regional economies and the viability of family farming.
The purpose of this second amendment is to raise the issue of the national interest. The one thing that this trade agreement sets out to do is undermine the ability of the Australian government to protect our national interest. One Nation's amendment (2) states:
No action by way of customs tariff reductions may be taken under this Act or its regulations that has an adverse impact on rural and regional economies and the viability of family farming.
We have only to look at chapter 3 in the free trade agreement to find that under this agreement all US agricultural imports into Australia, many of which are grown on corporate farms that are heavily subsidised by the US, will gain immediate duty-free access. In the US in the early 1960s and 1970s, predominantly family farms were producing the majority of the primary produce in America. They were encouraged to expand to get greater economies of scale, so families bought up farms around them. Subsequently, as a result of low commodity prices, which I believe were to a large degree manipulated by the futures market, we saw the natural rise and fall in prices following the natural market responses to supply and demand. So if it was a good year we saw an increase in the prices of commodities such as grains; if it was a year when there was an overabundance of supply, we would see those prices drop. What the futures market has the ability to do is take out those natural fluctuations in the market. So from the 1960s through to the early 1980s we saw a gradual reduction in family farms in America. We saw the gradual encroachment of corporate farms. In America today we see subsidies for their primary producers to the extent of something like $US386 billion over 10 years—that is $US3,860 million per annum. Of that, 80 per cent currently goes to corporate producers.
What concerns One Nation is that we are seeing the same thing happen in Australia: we are seeing the gradual erosion of our family farms. They are gradually being taken over by larger corporations. Why is this happening? It is happening because of several things. Yes, the drought conditions are part of it, but the larger part is again the control of the commodities in the futures market, which is taking away the ability of the producer to get the advantage of the normal fluctuations in the market. So the purpose of this amendment is very clearly to protect and to allow the government to ensure that no adverse action will be taken by the government in relation to our rural and regional economies, particularly the viability of family farming.

6 Protection of textile, footwear, apparel and leather industries
		No action by way of customs tariff reductions may be taken under this Act or its regulations that has an adverse impact on the textile, footwear, apparel or leather industries.
This is one of the major areas of concern that has been raised by the workers around Australia. They see very clearly the difficulties that their fellow workers in the United States have been subjected to. When NAFTA came in there were a subsequent 600,000 jobs lost in the United States itself. We saw, as a result of NAFTA, American companies translocating down to the edge of the Mexican border. The senators who were in the chamber over the last successive days will be well aware of the number of companies that have translocated as a result of that. What is actually facing our workers in the textile, footwear, apparel and leather industries is exactly what those American workers faced as a result of NAFTA.
I find it amazing that our Labor senators can sit in the chamber and agree to a piece of legislation that, as a result of the free trade agreement, is going to alter the customs tariffs that will be payable on textile, footwear, apparel and leather industries. Currently, some of those existing tariffs stand at up to 20 per cent until 2005. They are all going to be reduced under this legislation to as low as five per cent and the job losses from those reductions will be quite substantial. The government will say to us, `That is balanced by the increase in jobs in the other sectors.' I say to the government very clearly: tell that to somebody who is currently working in any of those industries.
Some of the workers have indicated their concern. I have an AMWU petition which does not comply with the normal requirements of Senate petitions, so unfortunately it cannot be tabled in this chamber as a petition. It very clearly states:
Mr Howard—
Don't trade away our jobs
The US Free Trade Agreement will destroy Australian manufacturing jobs
It is addressed to senators and the Leader of the Opposition and it was faxed to the Hon. Mark Latham, Senator Stephen Conroy, Senator Brandis, Senator Cook, Senator Ridgeway, myself, Senator Boswell, Senator Ferris and Senator O'Brien. Those workers say:
We are writing to you with deep concern about the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement.
This agreement, if ratified, will have disastrous consequences for our manufacturing industry. 
Since we are a small country with an economy that is roughly 4% of the US economy, we are not participating on a level playing field. If we open ourselves to the US markets with no tariffs or protection, it can only mean the loss of thousands of jobs.
The manufacturing industry in Australia has declined dramatically over the last 20 years as many companies have moved offshore to the low wage manufacturing economies of Asia. The Free Trade Agreement will mean a further decline particularly in high-value manufactured goods, because we will be competing with the most powerful and technologically advanced manufacturing nation in the world.
In closing, they say:
I urge you to vote down the legislation to have the agreement ratified.
We now know that that is not going to happen. Within the context of these petitions, there are over 1,000 signatures from businesses right across the board. I will just flick through and pick up a couple of them. Autoliv, VARIAN, Trico—some of these have employees in the hundreds. Blackwell and IXL have a considerable number of employees. Lockwood—all of their employees are concerned about it. VisiPak—the list just keeps on going. We are getting such a reaction from the employees of so many companies around Australia who are concerned that as the reduction in tariffs comes in, their jobs go out of the door. That is the reason why One Nation believes that it is important that the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004 be amended so that no action by way of customs tariff reductions can be made that would impact on the textile, footwear, apparel or leather industries.

7 Protection of the environment
	(1)	Under this Act or its regulations, any action or measure necessary, including by way of increasing customs tariffs, may be taken to protect the environment from the adverse impact of imported products or produce.
This amendment has been extensively spoken to regarding the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004, but there are also impacts in relation to the environment in the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004.
Regarding the thrust of this amendment, we only have to look at the recent instance of the outbreak that occurred in Central Queensland in relation to our citrus fruit. That outbreak came as the result of imports of plant material into this country, and we saw the amazing devastation that this one instance perpetrated. I think all of the issues in relation to the environment and the dangers that we are exposing our environment to through this legislation have been well covered in the chamber. It is obvious that the position of both the government and the opposition is to vote down all amendments by One Nation, irrespective of their validity and their benefit to the environment or the Australian people.
What we are actually seeing, as I have said earlier, is not converging politics but converged politics. We are at the point where, on major issues, there is no opposition in this parliament. We have two parties whose philosophies are so similar, particularly in relation to issues like free trade agreements and GATS. All we have to do is see who was in government when the negotiations for GATS took place. It was the Labor Party. When the Liberal Party took government, what did they do? They implemented the policies that the Labor Party had commenced the negotiations on. And so we go on and on. We have converged politics in Australia. What Australia needs is a strong, viable opposition in our parliaments, and that is gradually occurring. It is not going to happen overnight; it is going to take some years for that to develop, but develop it will because the people of Australia view with great concern the decisions that are being taken in this chamber by the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties. 
Protecting the environment should be one of the greatest issues that we as senators fulfil in this chamber. We are placing the environment substantially at risk in relation to the situation that is transpiring. If we look at agriculture, all we have to do is look at the possible impacts on agriculture in Australia. If we look further, we can see that there is the ability, I believe, in this document for the Australian government to actually implement temporary relief. I will come back to the footwear, apparel and leather industries.
One Nation recommends improved safeguard measures to deliver temporary relief to injured import sensitive Australian industries and to improve safeguard provisions to provide relief against import surges. These provisions must be allowed: only a specific quantity of a select product is to enter into Australia at zero duty rates, and higher tariffs should automatically be triggered when imports reach a specific level or volume. One Nation recommends that Australia must have the ability to restrict imports for temporary periods if, after investigation carried out by competent authorities, it is established that imports are taking place in such increased quantities—either absolutely or in relation to domestic product—as to cause serious injury to the domestic industry and producers of like or directly competitive products. Those issues must remain—
 (Senator Chapman)—Senator Harris, I advise you that we need to report progress before midnight.
—That is your call, Mr Temporary Chairman; that is your duty.
—It is in the standing orders.

The PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. Paul Calvert) took the chair at 9.00 a.m. and read prayers.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I will not detain the chamber for any great period of time this morning, because it is very obvious that we have two sets of rules here. We have one set of rules that apply to America and we have a very different set of rules that apply to Australia and in relation to our legislation. I referred yesterday to a US document headed `US-Australia Free Trade Agreement—Questions and Answers About Pharmaceuticals'. Even though these references pertain to pharmaceuticals, I think it is worth while reiterating them this morning as they are relevant to the different outlook of the United States and the different position that it claims to be in in relation to this free trade agreement. One question that was put in that document is:
Does the U.S.-Australia FTA prevent Congress from passing drug re-importation legislation?
The answer is:
No. The FTA reflects current law in the United States.
It continues—and this is the important wording:
Nothing in this FTA or any other trade agreement prevents Congress from changing U.S. law in the future. Even if a dispute settlement panel found the U.S. acted inconsistently with the FTA, it could not require Congress to amend the law.
So we have both sides of the argument there. In other words, the Americans can have two bob each way. The Americans clearly say that they can change US law in the future if they want to, but they do not have to change US law even if a dispute panel finds that the US has acted inconsistently with the free trade agreement. Yet in the Australian media this morning we have the outstanding statements of the US Ambassador to Australia saying that if we make any amendments to the enabling legislation America may pull out of the deal. Is that a balance? Of course it is not. That is one set of rules for the United States and a totally different set of rules for Australia.
Speaking to the amendment that I have before the chair, there could be no issue with a higher priority for the Australian people than the environment. Yet each time the crossbenches have brought an amendment into this chamber to effectively protect workers' jobs, the environment or the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme they have been voted down. It has been said time and time again in this chamber by the government minister, Senator Hill, that we cannot alter any of this legislation, because it reflects our commitment under the treaty. Well, if we cannot why can the Americans? It should be a balance. What is good for the US should also be good for Australia.
The amendment I moved late last night is to protect the environment. Under this act or its regulations, any act or measure necessary, including by way of increasing customs tariffs, may be taken to protect the environment from the adverse impacts of imported products or produce. I commend the amendment to the chamber. It will be interesting to see whether the government and the opposition are again willing to put the environment of this nation before their commitment to getting the FTA through. 
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-08-12,"—I move One Nation amendment (5) on sheet 4367:
(5)	Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 3), after the Schedule heading, insert:
Customs Act 1901
1A After subsection 50(2)
Insert:
	(2A)	For the purposes of paragraph (2)(aa), a specified circumstance includes a circumstance where it is established that the importation of like or directly competitive products are being imported in increased quantities, either absolute or in relation to domestic production, and the importation is having a negative impact on the domestic industry.
There we had a classic example. That was the exact example for the Australian people. There was not a word of defence by the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or The Nationals to have a very open statement—the statement being the ability to protect the environment. No, they want their FTA. It really makes you wonder whether what we are seeing is the government and the opposition delivering the best legislation that money can buy.
Here is a very simple amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to protect the jobs of Australian workers in, for example, footwear and textiles, where Australia currently has 60,000 to 70,000 workers employed. If this amendment is agreed to by Labor and the Liberals, under exceptional circumstances it will allow the government to restrict those imports where they were found to be adversely affecting the jobs of workers. I will put it as bluntly as I can. If we have no response from the Labor Party nor support for this amendment, it will send a clear and concise signal to every worker in Australia that the Labor Party has abandoned them, because the thrust of this amendment is to protect them. It is not to stop imports; its purpose is to protect the jobs of Australian workers, the very people the Labor Party is committed to defending. If it abrogates that commitment and does not support this amendment then it is clear that the Labor Party has walked away from its members. I commend this amendment to the chamber.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Harris's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2004-08-12,"—I seek leave to move a motion to enable two government business orders of the day to be taken together for their remaining stages.
—I ask what those orders of the day are.
—They are the two terrorism bills: orders of the day Nos 2 and 16—Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004 and Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004.
Leave not granted.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,37,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-08-12,"—I think I just started my speech in the second reading debate on the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004 and the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004. As I said, these bills were effectively one bill—that is, the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2)—and that bill was then split to facilitate some of the issues in the other place. Schedules 1, 2 and 5 were put into the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004 and the remainder were kept in the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004. The bills are now cognate so we can deal with the schedules together, as was provided for in the original No. 2 bill.
I welcome the opportunity to speak on not only the bills but also the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) which provides a view on the two bills before us today. The committee considered the provisions which now form part of the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) because they were in the bill which was originally referred by the Senate before the No. 2 bill was split in the House of Representatives. The committee received 95 submissions and took evidence from 16 individual witnesses. I think that is indicative of the high level of community interest in applying appropriate scrutiny of legislation of this kind.
The government and opposition members of the committee joined in a bipartisan report and recommendations. This continues an approach of the committee which goes back as far as the first antiterrorism legislation considered by parliament after September 11 and which has endured through many parliamentary debates. The committee made 10 recommendations in respect of the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) which now apply to both No. 2 and No. 3. The majority of the recommendations relate to the proposed association offence and suggest sensible change to address problems raised in evidence before the committee. For example, the committee recommended that the presumption against bail enacted in the Anti-Terrorism Act 2004 not apply to the proposed offence in light of the fact that it is a less serious offence than the other terrorism offences and does not require any involvement with a terrorist act, actual or planned. The opposition were in a position to consider sensible amendments in respect of that, and we think that the ability of the government to address terrorist and terrorist related offences is important in the fight against terrorism.
The Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3), as I have said, is the balance of the schedules—it reproduces what were formerly schedules 1, 2 and 5 of the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2). Schedule 1 contains amendments to the Passports Act relating to foreign travel documents. Upon the passage of the Australian Passports (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill, that act will be renamed the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act. Schedule 2 contains amendments to the ASIO Act dealing with the surrender of passports and the movement of persons in the context of requests for ASIO questioning warrants. Schedule 3, which was formerly schedule 5 to the No. 2 bill, contains amendments to the Crimes Act concerning the use of forensic procedures in disaster victim identification.
Provisions of the bill have been considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, as I earlier indicated, as part of its inquiry into the No. 2 bill. This is because, as I have said, it was referred to the committee as the No. 2 bill, which contained all five schedules. The committee took a balanced approach which recognised the need to ensure our laws deal strongly with terrorism but also are appropriately targeted at and respond to the problem and do not potentially criminalise areas of legitimate behaviour or activity. Schedule 3 is the least controversial proposal in the bill. In essence, it will enable the national DNA database to be used for disaster victim identification and criminal investigation in connection with a mass casualty incident within Australia. 
The amendments were recommended by a committee chaired by Mr Tom Sherman AO which was reviewing the provisions put in place by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 2002 following the Bali bombing. I look forward to ensuring that that committee report is available and read in conjunction with the report in relation to the Bali bombings that was provided to the Senate yesterday. Both of them provide a broad view on how we can deal with not only the broader issue but also some of the narrower issues that come up and on how we then ensure legislation properly deals with those issues and provides sufficient powers to our law enforcement officers to ensure these sorts of things can be avoided where possible.
In respect of schedule 2, which concerns the machinery of the ASIO questioning warrant regime, the amendments would require that persons who have been notified that the Director-General of Security has sought the consent of the Attorney-General to request a questioning warrant are obliged not to leave Australia, to surrender their passport to the director-general and to not exit Australia without the director-general's permission. The director-general must return any passports as soon as practical if consent or a warrant is refused. This builds on changes passed in the ASIO Legislation Amendment Act 2003 which enabled the confiscation of a passport upon notification of the issuing of a warrant. The Senate committee understandably heard concerns about these provisions, and the ASIO questioning warrant regime was itself controversial and no doubt remains a controversial issue in parts of the community. The Senate committee appreciated, as they said, the serious implications of restricting a person's freedom of movement, but ultimately determined that the amendments were appropriate to deal with cases where it might be necessary to prevent a party from leaving the country before it has been possible to obtain a warrant. In reaching this conclusion, the committee had regard to the safeguards that were incorporated into the warrant regime in the course of parliamentary debate last year and the year before that.
In particular, before seeking the Attorney-General's permission to request a warrant, the director-general must be satisfied that the statutory criteria in section 34C of the act are met. Schedule 1 of the bill concerns foreign travel documents. The schedule creates power to demand, confiscate and seize foreign travel documents so that a person suspected of a serious offence or specified harmful conduct is prevented from leaving Australia using the document. The schedule also creates offences relating to false or misleading statements in connection with and forgery of foreign travel documents. Again, the committee heard a range of concerns about these provisions, but in the final analysis was persuaded of the need for them and was reassured at the conclusion by the presence of an administrative review mechanism. However, the committee did not seek an explanation from the government of why the defence of reasonable excuse was provided in the offences in schedules 21 and 22 but not those in sections 18, 19 and 20.
Another matter on which the opposition seeks some clarification from the government is whether the offences in sections 18 to 22 cover all kinds of false foreign travel documents—for argument's sake, if you take a situation where a person procures a genuine foreign travel document in a false identity by deceiving the relevant overseas authority as to their identity and that deception occurs overseas. I am sure during the debate in the committee stage the government will be able to provide an answer in respect of that issue. On one view, such a travel document appears not to fall within the definition of `false foreign travel document', because it has been issued by the foreign government and has not been altered in an unauthorised way. On this view it does not appear to give rise to an offence under sections 21 or 22 and, because the relevant deception occurred overseas, it does not appear to be an offence under sections 18, 19 and 20, which are subject to standard geographical jurisdiction. We would be interested, as I said, in hearing the government's advice or view on whether such a situation in fact would be covered. In summary, with the benefit of the submissions and evidence to the Senate committee and the committee's report, we believe parliament can now be satisfied of the need for this legislation. As I said earlier and have repeated during the debate, we will be supporting the passage of that legislation. 
We have dealt with schedules 1, 2 and 5. By a process of mathematics, there are also schedules 3 and 4. For the benefit of the chamber I will briefly deal with some of the more succinct issues that were covered in relation to 3 and 4. The Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 contains schedule 3, which proposes a new offence of associating with a terrorist organisation, and schedule 4, which proposes a new mechanism for interstate transfer of prisoners on security grounds. These proposals also attracted considerable controversy during the Senate committee's inquiry.
In relation to the association offence, the committee made bipartisan recommendations: that a number of terms in the offence be defined; that a presumption against bail not apply to the offence; that there be changes to the exceptions relating to religious practice and legal advice or representation; and that the operation of the offence be subject to an independent review. Labor have raised several amendments with the government. We note that the government has responded with the amendment it will be moving later, which Labor will not oppose.
The Labor Party carefully considered these proposals and the submissions and evidence about them presented to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. As I said earlier, Labor is determined to ensure both that our laws deal strongly with terrorism and that they are appropriately targeted at the problem and do not criminalise legitimate social activity. The proposed offence requires the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that an accused intentionally associates on two or more occasions with another person, knowing that the other person promotes or directs the activities of a listed terrorist organisation, and in doing so intentionally provides support to the listed terrorist organisation and this support assists the listed terrorist organisation to expand or continue to exist. This imposes a heavy burden on the prosecution and appropriately targets conduct that intentionally supports a listed terrorist organisation to continue or expand its activities.
We believe officials of the Attorney-General's Department have made a genuine attempt to craft stringent fault elements that squarely target criminal behaviour in the form of active intentional support of a listed terrorist organisation. We have also given appropriate weight to the evidence from Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty about the need for an offence of this kind. That said, however much we as legislators might be able to understand the checks and balances in this bill, there is force in the committee's observations that these subtleties will be lost on communities which are increasingly alarmed and alienated by the legislative proposals coming out of this government. Again, the opposition would urge the government to heed those warnings of the acting Race Discrimination Commissioner in his report Isma—Listen. Stopping the activities of terrorist organisations will require the cooperation and support of the whole Australian community. We simply will not get that cooperation and support if communities close ranks because they feel besieged. Feelings of alienation will only make people more receptive to voices of extremists rather than voices of reason. 
There were a number of drafting flaws in the offence which the Senate committee picked up, as I referred to earlier. We are glad the government is moving to fix some of these. The first effect of the government amendments, as I indicated earlier, will be that the presumption against bail created in the Anti-terrorism Act will not apply to this offence, and that is appropriate. The conduct targeted in this offence, while serious, is not of a character that should require an accused to show exceptional circumstances justifying a grant of bail.
The second effect will be that the scope of the exception for legal advice and representation will be expanded to include decisions relating to ASIO questioning, listing of organisations under the Charter of the United Nations Act, proceedings before military commissions, and proceedings relating to passports and travel documents. The government has not picked up the amendment of the committee relating to further definition of numerous terms. We acknowledge that this is a difficult exercise in practice, but we do think at the very least that this issue should be revisited in the independent review of the antiterrorism legislation which is, in fact, fast approaching.
The government has also refrained from moving an amendment to the exception for religious practice. There was some misunderstanding in evidence before the committee about the scope of this exception but, putting this aside, Labor did argue to the government that there is justification for broadening it. For example, the equivalent religious worship exception in the New South Wales Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which the government has professed to use as a precedent, does not distinguish between public and private places. However, we have not been able to persuade the government of this view and so at the very least we are seeking a clear statement from the government about the scope of this exception, including examples of the places to which it would apply and the reasons why the government believes it should not be broadened. Would it, for example, cover a place that, while sometimes used for private purposes, is opened up to members of the public for religious worship at a particular time and an association takes place during that worship?
Turning to the proposed mechanism for interstate prisoner transfers, the government really must acknowledge that it has not delivered a satisfactory outcome. When the government is dealing with an operational matter as fundamental as transferring prisoners on security grounds, you would expect the government to get the states and territories on board before putting a proposal to the parliament. After all, the states and territories have the responsibility for managing prisons. Instead, we have a situation where the Commonwealth, having been asked by the states and territories to address the issue, put legislation into the parliament and expected the states and territories to support it sight unseen. I am aware of plenty of accusations flying around about who failed to communicate with whom but, as the Senate committee pointed out, it is not the role of this parliament to resolve those communications. 
The Senate committee made a bipartisan recommendation that this schedule not proceed before further consultation with the states and territories, and Labor have argued for this to the government. However, the government is pressing ahead and will be amending the bill to apply the mechanism to Commonwealth offences only. We will leave it to the government to explain its position to the states and territories who will have to manage the legislation should it pass. However, we would be seeking a public commitment by the government to work cooperatively with the states and territories to try to address any outstanding operational concerns. We expect them to be able to put that on the record.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-12,"—The two bills before us, the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 and the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004, do a number of things. The first bill I want to address, the Anti-terrorism Bill (No.2), contains characteristics we have seen in previous antiterrorism legislation introduced by the government. It is riddled, we would argue, with imprecise definitions and it contains an increase in unaccountable power, new offences for which no proper justification has been demonstrated and a range of measures which are likely to have a disproportionate impact on Australia's Muslim community.
The Democrats find that the amendments to the Criminal Code Act 1995 are without a doubt the most disturbing amendments contained in this legislation and this was reflected in the evidence to the committee. The proposed new offence of associating with a terrorist organisation is extremely broad, poorly defined and has the potential to be applied in a way that impacts disproportionately on Muslim peoples. The Democrats strongly oppose the introduction of this offence. I received a letter yesterday from Amnesty International. In summary they said, in reflection of their submission:
- the proposed amendment may breach the right to freedom of association.
- there are already provisions in existing legislation that cover providing an organisation with support to conduct a terrorist act. The enactment of the proposed provisions cover conduct that is not directly associated with a `terrorist' act and may punish association for peaceful means.
They go on to argue:
- the definition of being a member of a terrorist organisation is too broad and vague, and that this vagueness is then compounded by provisions to cover the act of associating with a `member'.
These concerns remain. It still remains the case that the right of freedom of association may be breached by the passage of the bill and an innocent person may inadvertently commit an offence and be wrongly imprisoned.
Significantly, the exemptions to the offence involving `close family members' in clause 102.8(4)(a) of the bill do not cover an extended family which might include aunts, uncles and cousins. The committee's recommendations in this regard do not go far enough to address our concerns. Similarly, exemptions in relation to public religious worship in clause 102.8(4)(b) of the bill do not cover social meetings, education and counselling, amongst other activities, which could conceivably be conducted both in the place used for public worship and other places temporarily obtained for such religious worship and ancillary activities. The committee's recommendations do not go far enough to address our concerns.
Exemptions to the offence relating to the provision of humanitarian aid in clause 102.8(4)(c) of the bill and for the purpose of providing legal advice, clause 102.8(d) of the bill, continue to pose the threat of catching innocent activities, such as fundraising for the purpose of affording appropriate legal advice outside the specified exemptions. Furthermore, the evidential burden to make out these exemptions remains with the defendant and not the prosecution. This further erodes safeguards that innocent people will not be caught by this offence and face terms of imprisonment. The committee's recommendations do not adequately address these concerns and, as such, the bill should not be passed. 
With regard to amendments to the Transfer of Prisoners Act 1983, the Democrats share the concerns of the Law Council of Australia that these amendments:
... will allow for the transfer of remand prisoners without notice and without regard for the personal circumstances of the detainee, including their prospective distance from family or other support networks.
The Democrats agree that decisions regarding the transfer of remand prisoners should require the approval of a court. We are very concerned that there will be no opportunity for a person affected by such a decision to seek judicial review of that decision. We note and are concerned by the evidence regarding limited consultation in relation to these changes. The Democrats do not support the proposed amendments.
It is interesting to note that there was a news story relevant to this yesterday in my home state of Western Australia. An article by Trevor Robb from the West Australian entitled `Justice Minister slams Federal Government over security cooperation' read:
PERTH, Aug 12 AAP—The West Australian government today accused the federal government and national law enforcement agencies of failing to consult with state authorities over the detention of terrorism suspects.
Justice Minister Michelle Roberts said the Commonwealth had kept WA in the dark and also refused to allow state authorities to test new ways of securing dangerous prisoners.
Ms Roberts said federal law enforcement agencies had failed state counterparts in relation to Jack Roche, who was convicted in June of plotting with al-Qaeda to blow up the Israeli Embassy in Canberra.
“There was a situation in WA a few months back when we were overseeing Australia's number one terrorist prisoner and yet our authorities had literally been kept in the dark and not properly informed by the federal agencies,” Ms Roberts said.
“It was a totally unacceptable situation which could have jeopardised the safety of prison officers, other prisoners and the community.”
Ms Roberts said Canberra did not run any jails in Australia, yet proposed anti-terrorism legislation to allow interference in the management of state prisons.
“The states and territories run the prisons and yet the federal government ignores our years of experience in securing the most dangerous inmates,” she said.
A spokesman for federal justice minister Chris Ellison said there had been full consultation about the new anti-terrorism legislation, including a meeting with all States last December, and there was no intention to meddle in prison systems.
“It is vital that we are involved in the transfer of prisoners because the Australian Federal Police or ASIO may have information which may not be known by state authorities,” he said.
He agreed running jails was a state responsibility but said federal anti-terrorism legislation would not interfere with the way states ran jails or handled high-risk prisoners.
Ms Roberts said WA needed to make plans for housing dangerous prisoners who often had outside contacts with the will and resources to get them out of jail by any means.
She said the WA Government was now considering a high-tech, “ultra security” jail within the grounds of the existing Casuarina prison to handle dangerous prisoners considered at high risk of escaping. 
In considering the provisions of Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004 the chamber has the benefit of the recent inquiry conducted by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Time and time again, the chamber has received enormous assistance from the reports of Senate committees on a variety of legislation. The committee process is a vital part of the Senate's role in scrutinising new legislation and, most importantly, it facilitates the direct participation of the community in the legislative process. As a member of the Senate's legal and constitutional committee, I am very much aware of the significant workload of that committee, particularly in recent months, and I take this opportunity to again acknowledge the outstanding assistance of the secretariat and to thank them for their hard work. It should be noted that the committee report which was tabled on Friday afternoon was actually a report on the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 in its original form. Following the commencement of the inquiry, the government took three of the schedules from that bill and put them into the new Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004, which we are debating today.
The committee proceeded with its original inquiry, and consequently it covered the provisions of both the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 and the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004. The committee received 95 submissions. As the report notes, the vast majority of those opposed most aspects of the bill. Only one submission supported the bill, and that was from the Australian Federal Police. We Democrats have considered the evidence presented to the committee and we share many of the concerns raised in relation to both antiterrorism bills. 
As we know, the bill makes changes to three pieces of legislation. It amends the Passports Act to prevent those who are subject to an arrest warrant in a foreign country, or who are likely to engage in harmful conduct, from leaving Australia on a foreign passport. Specifically, the bill provides that those subject to a warrant for an indictable foreign offence—or who are prevented from travelling by a court order, a law of the Commonwealth or a condition of parole—or who are suspected of engaging in harmful conduct can be prevented from leaving Australia on a foreign passport. The bill also creates new offences in relation to foreign travel documents—for example, making false or misleading statements in relation to foreign travel document applications. These amendments are closely linked to the changes proposed in the Australian Passports Bill 2004. In fact, the provisions in that bill assume the prior passage of this bill.
We Democrats have a number of concerns in relation to these changes, and these concerns were confirmed in the evidence given to us during the Senate committee inquiry. For example, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre questioned whether there was even a need for the new confiscation powers and expressed concern that these powers could be inconsistent with the separation of powers. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, HREOC, argued that the new provisions could potentially infringe article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights relating to freedom of movement. The Castan Centre for Human Rights Law argued that an order for the surrender of foreign documents should only be made where a foreign arrest warrant, court order, bail or parole condition relates to a matter which is also a serious offence under Australian law. We Democrats agree. We do not believe that the minister's power should be predicated on the existence of an arrest warrant issued by a foreign court without any consideration of the nature of the laws and the legal system of the foreign country or the reasons for the issue of the warrant. For example, if a woman had been arrested for adultery in a foreign country governed by sharia law, would the minister make an order for the seizure of her travel documents? 
This brings me to the concerns raised in relation to the potential impact of the proposed amendments on refugees and asylum seekers. HREOC expressed concern that the new offences relating to the falsification of foreign travel documents may conflict with Australia's obligations under article 31 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 31.1 says that states:
... shall not impose penalties, on account of their illegal entry or presence, on refugees who ... enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.
As the committee report notes, HREOC argued that the drafters of the 1951 convention envisaged that a refugee fleeing his or her country of origin would rarely be able to meet the requirements for legal entry into a country of refuge. 
We Democrats concur with a number of the submissions to the committee that there is a need for a defence of `reasonable excuse' in relation to the foreign travel document offences and that this defence should expressly apply to a person who believes that his or her safety or wellbeing, or that of his or her family, depends on the use or possession of the false or cancelled foreign travel documents. We Democrats also believe that a person should be given an opportunity to challenge the basis of a demand for the surrender of their travel documents. In order to do so, it is vital that the person is provided with the details of any arrest warrant or court order on which the demand is based. However, there is no provision for that in the current bill. We Democrats strongly believe this should be rectified.
Perhaps the most concerning amendments to the Passports Act are those which seek to limit the opportunity for review of a decision by the minister to order the surrender of foreign travel documents. We are concerned that, pursuant to part 4 of the bill, there is no opportunity for judicial review of the minister's decision pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. In the absence of judicial review, it is particularly concerning that the government has sought to place restrictions on the process of review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In particular, the bill provides that, if the minister certifies that his or her decision involves matters of international relations or criminal intelligence, the AAT will have no choice but to either affirm the minister's decision or remit it to him or her for reconsideration.
That process is entirely unsatisfactory, particularly given the enormous impact of the minister's decision on a person who is subsequently prevented from leaving Australia. It continues the disturbing trend towards more opaque decision making on the basis that decisions relate to security or, in this case, international relations or criminal intelligence. In evidence to the committee, the Attorney-General's Department made the point:
Only where the Minister has certified that a decision involves matters of international relations will provide the Tribunal be restricted to affirming the decision or remitting it to the Minister for consideration. 
Of course, that is not the case; that is not true. The AAT will also face this restriction if the minister certifies that the decision involves matters of criminal intelligence. The obvious point that needs to be made here is that, given the various circumstances in which the minister can make an order for the surrender of foreign travel documents, it is clear that in most cases the decision will relate to matters of either international relations or criminal intelligence. This means that in almost all cases in which an order is made for the surrender of documents, the minister will be able to make a certification pursuant to proposed section 23(3), and consequently the AAT will be emasculated and unable to conduct a proper review. 
Schedule 2 to the bill makes amendments to the ASIO Act, and in particular it deals with the controversial questioning and detention provisions introduced by the ASIO Legislation Amendment Act 2003. The amendments provide that, if the Director-General of ASIO has sought the Attorney-General's consent to make a request for the issue of a questioning warrant in relation to a person, that person must surrender every passport—whether Australian or foreign—that he or she has in his or her possession or control. We strongly oppose these amendments. In considering the amendments, the Senate should remember that the questioning regime contained in the ASIO Act is not restricted to those suspected of involvement in terrorism; rather, it applies to any person who might have information that is relevant to ASIO.
As we have said previously, this means that ASIO could detain and question innocent Australians just because they happen to go to school with or live next door to someone who is suspected of terrorism. This bill seeks to demand that these innocent Australians surrender their passports to the authorities before the Attorney-General has even consented to the making of a request for the issue of a questioning warrant. Section 34JC of the ASIO Act already provides that a person who is subject to a questioning warrant must surrender his or her passports. These new amendments bring forward that obligation so that it kicks in before a prescribed authority has issued the questioning warrant, before the request has even been made to the prescribed authority and before the Attorney-General has even consented to the making of a request for a questioning warrant. These provisions have incredibly serious consequences for those individuals who might be affected by them. To put it simply, innocent Australians will be required to surrender their passports or face five years in prison, and this will occur in the absence of any judicial or even ministerial scrutiny. We Democrats unequivocally oppose these provisions.
According to the explanatory memorandum, schedule 3 of the bill seeks to amend the Crimes Act to `facilitate effective disaster victim identification in the event that a disaster causing mass casualties (such as a terrorist attack or an aircraft disaster) were to occur'. We support these changes in principle, but we note that they go much further than the government first intimated. They are not restricted to incidents involving mass casualties but they extend to any incident involving a Commonwealth offence or a state offence that has a federal aspect, in which one or more Australians have died. They will also apply to incidents involving the death of an alien, pensioner, Commonwealth employee, resident of a territory or member of the Defence Force, if the minister determines that they should apply.
We Democrats would have much preferred these amendments to be restricted to incidents involving mass casualties; however, we are prepared to support the amendments for three reasons. Firstly, we note that a determination by the minister in these circumstances is disallowable and therefore subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Secondly, the data matching permitted is restricted to the matching of different DNA profiles on the unknown deceased persons index of the database. Thirdly, we note that the federal Privacy Commissioner has expressed support for the amendments. It is for these reasons that we support the amendments contained in schedule 3 of the bill. 
However, we are very concerned and angry, although not surprised, at some of the cynical politics that the government has displayed in coupling these amendments with the very controversial amendments to the Passports Act and the ASIO Act. We note that, in his second reading speech on this bill, the Attorney-General indicated that the shadow minister for homeland security had written to him offering to expedite schedule 5 of the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2)—in other words, the provisions relating to the identification of the victims of disasters. It appears that the shadow minister for homeland security did not mention the more controversial schedules 1 and 2, yet the Attorney-General included them in this bill. We Democrats will be moving amendments to oppose schedules 1 and 2 of the bill, with a view to expediting the passage of schedule 3. The passage of these amendments is a prerequisite to our support for the bill. Of course, I will speak later on our amendments during the committee stage of the debate.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—In the hour since we found out that the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004 and the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 were to be debated now—and I was going to take responsibility for the legislation for the Australian Greens—I have been reading a number of speeches made by government members about the legislation. I have been reading about the concerns of Mr Georgiou in the House of Representatives and Senator Brandis and Senator Mason in the Senate. I have been reading about the concerns that Mr Georgiou had about the guilt by association components of the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 and how the provisions go further than what was originally proposed by the government after September 11.
In his speech on the second reading of this legislation in the House of Representatives, Mr Georgiou listed a number of different examples of people who would be caught under the legislation and went through four different scenarios. He went through a scenario about a journalist who is writing about a terrorist organisation—and who is thereby associating with that organisation—and who makes more than one phone call to that organisation being jailed for three years as a result of the legislation that is proposed. He also talked about an example where a community leader appears at a meeting next to a terrorist leader or somebody who is defined as a terrorist leader. Under the legislation this could be defined as helping the organisation or supporting the organisation, and therefore such a person would be liable for three years in jail despite the fact that they merely shared a platform with the individual concerned. He went on to list examples about an uncle, a schoolteacher, a caterer or a person who rents a hall to a member of a terrorist organisation. He talked about religious leaders, social workers and lawyers also being caught by the legislation. He also raised the same concerns that Senator Greig raised about exemptions relating only to direct family members and not including uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, mothers-in-law or fathers-in-law but including people who are part of a same-sex couple.
It is interesting to read through the concerns put on the record by Mr Georgiou and also the concerns that Senator Brandis and Senator Mason raised during the debate in the committee stage of this bill. There are components of the committee hearings where Senator Brandis is talking about the wide definition of terrorism that exists in laws we currently have around terrorism, and there is also discussion between witnesses and Senator Mason and Senator Brandis about organisations. The examples that they give are branches of the Greens, the Labor Party or the Liberal Party who have given financial support to organisations such as Fretlin being caught under this legislation if this legislation had come in before we saw the independence of East Timor. There is clearly a large amount of opposition to these bills, not just on this side of the chamber but also from government members.  
Let me go to the detail of what is in the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004. The bill introduces a new offence of associating with a person linked to a terrorist organisation. It allows the Attorney-General to transfer convicted and remand prisoners to another state in the interests of security. Australia already has far-reaching antiterrorism laws. The Commonwealth Criminal Code criminalises such acts as being a member—even an informal member—of an organisation that the government prescribes as a terrorist organisation. Now, the bill proposes to make it an offence to even associate or communicate with people connected to such organisations. This will disproportionately infringe freedom of association and imposes guilt by association. Furthermore, the offence depends on the exercise of executive discretion in declaring an organisation to be a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code; this is an exercise of discretion which is itself based on an overly broad existing definition of terrorism.
As a result, the police and the government have very broad discretion on how the law is applied, and it is of grave concern that it may be selectively exercised. For example, there is already evidence that antiterrorism laws have been selectively applied to Muslim members of the community. In other areas of the law, selective application is regarded as objectionable and undesirable, so why should it be allowed in this case? What is particularly alarming is the combined effect of this amendment and the newly introduced bail provisions—which were supported through this parliament by both major parties—where a person charged will be granted bail only in exceptional circumstances. A person could very easily be charged and locked up in jail on the thinnest of evidence even before it is tested in a court of law. This means a person could end up being in jail for doing nothing more than phoning somebody twice, even if he or she is later found to be innocent.
Other issues raised in the bill include the minister's decision to transfer prisoners not being open to judicial review. Limits are also placed on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's ability to review decisions of the minister if he or she issues a certificate in relation to a decision to seize a person's passport. Fundamental to the concept of democratic government is the fact that all administrative decisions must be reviewable in order to instil and ensure public confidence.
Some of the provisions that are outlined in the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004 relate to a person's passport. They grant the authorities the power to prevent people from leaving Australia even before an ASIO warrant has been issued against them. They grant to authorities the power to seize foreign passports from suspects. Existing laws already give ASIO more powers than an intelligence-gathering agency should have, in the view of the Greens. ASIO will be given further powers to seize a person's passport even before a warrant has been issued against them. ASIO's role is to gather intelligence, not to have the unconstrained power to be able to prevent a person from leaving a country simply by making a request for a warrant to be issued for that person's questioning or detention. ASIO's functions and operations are not easily open to scrutiny, which makes the vesting in ASIO of this sort of power particularly dangerous and open to abuse. Concerns have also been raised by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission about giving ASIO the power to seize foreign passports from suspects, as in schedule 1 of the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004. These concerns relate to the impact on everybody's right to freedom of movement, particularly that of asylum seekers. Asylum seekers may face criminal penalties for using false travel documents to seek asylum. 
The war on terrorism has ushered in some of the most significant changes to our civil and political rights since the beginning of the last century. In some cases, important principles of law hundreds of years old and designed to protect the innocent have been swept aside. Rights such as the right to a lawyer, a fair and open trial, to be innocent until proven guilty and to avoid detention without charge or trial are all under threat. Terrorism is a real threat, but removing civil rights not only will undermine our democracy but also can contribute to even greater hostility, which fuels support for terrorism. Like Western policies in the Middle East and Central Asia which are driving support for terrorism, repressive domestic laws risk intensifying the conflict and undermine the very freedoms which our leaders purport to be protecting.
Terrorism will never be prevented through military means or undermining democracy and removing civil rights. This is something the government clearly does not understand, despite the mess in Iraq which it helped create. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, recently gave a speech on the government's white paper on terrorism in which he highlighted again the myopic vision of this government when he claimed that there are no `root causes' of terrorism. Of course there are underlying causes as to why there is support for organisations such as al-Qaeda. We know what some of these are. They are the Israel-Palestine conflict, the US strategic energy policies in the Gulf backing authoritarian regimes, and now, of course, the illegal invasion of Iraq. To deny these not only denies reality but condemns us all to an endless cycle of conflict that could last, as Mr Downer has said, as long as the Cold War.
Since September 11, the federal government has passed almost 30 separate pieces of terrorism legislation. The government now has the power to ban organisations. A raft of new offences have been created based on the broad and subjective definition of terrorism. ASIO and the police have been given extensive new powers to detain and question people without charge. And new powers have been put in place to freeze and confiscate assets. This is a global problem, with security agencies in the United States and Europe also grabbing more unaccountable power. Many national liberation movements have been criminalised, and in countries like China and Indonesia past repressive policies are gaining new legitimacy as part of the war on terrorism. The most notorious example of this global problem is the detention without charge or trial of the people being held at Guantanamo Bay. The Howard government, through its terrorism legislation, has backed President Bush's prison camp and his kangaroo courts, the military commissions. The opposition has backed the government at almost every step down this road. Despite widespread opposition from community and legal groups, both major parties have refused to protect human rights and civil liberties. Like the law and order auction that occurs at a state level, we see both the major parties competing to be tough on terrorism, following each change with a plan for another.
There are, of course, more bills in the running, not just the two bills that we have before us. The National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004 will allow secret evidence to be used in trials for terrorism offences. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has recently found that the Muslim, Arab and Asian communities in Australia have been experiencing growing racism and discrimination since September 11. In part, this is caused by the government's refugee and terrorism policies. In fact, the fear that new terrorism laws will be used for racial profiling is a part of the problem. Communities have responded in different ways to this. One example is the establishment of the Australian Muslim Civil Rights Advocacy Network. A brochure which they produced was launched in Sydney during the hearings into this legislation. The Terrorism laws: ASIO, police and you guide provides useful information to the community and is a positive response that that community has made to try to explain what will be the impacts on Muslim communities of the legislation that is being proposed. 
I want to read out some comments that have been made by Joo-Cheong Tham, who is an associate law lecturer at La Trobe University and has appeared as a witness before the inquiry into this and other terrorism legislation put by the government. He says in an article that he wrote:
Two and half years after September 11, it is clear that the Coalition government has developed a distinctive modus operandi when proposing new anti-terrorism laws. Its formula rests on five key strategies.
First, capitalise on terrorist incidents by proposing new anti-terrorism measures in the wake of such events and justifying them on the basis of being `tough on terror'. So a raft of anti-terror legislation was proposed shortly after the September 11 attacks. Similarly, the Brigitte affair prompted far-reaching offences which have the effect of cloaking much of ASIO's activities in secrecy. The Madrid bombings provide the justification for the latest tranche of changes.
The second key strategy of the government that he identifies is:
... propose changes which have nothing or very little to do with these terrorist incidents. It is hard, for example, to see the link between the Brigitte affair and making secret the exercise of ASIO's powers to compulsorily question and detain without trial when these powers could but were not used against Willie Brigitte. What the proposal to ban persons who have trained with terrorist organisations from publishing their memoirs has to do with the Madrid bombings is equally a mystery.
The third strategy he identifies is:
... fetishise proposed anti-terrorism measures by depicting them as imperative in the `War on Terror'. Imply that failure to adopt such measures will mean, in the extreme case, the murder of innocents. Insinuate that those who fail to support such measures are, at best, unintentional allies of terrorists. In December 2002, for instance, the Coalition government strongly hinted that the ALP's delay in supporting a detention without trial regime would result in further terrorist attacks and that blood would be on the ALP's hands if these attacks occurred in the ensuing summer.
The fourth strategy he identifies is:
... ignore the existing panoply—
or raft—
of anti-terrorism powers. Imply that measures are needed because a gap exists. Hence, the present proposal to extend the detention/interrogation time of persons suspected of `terrorism' offences to 24 hours is made without any public acknowledgment of ASIO's extensive powers. These are powers which can result in a person not suspected of any criminal wrongdoing being detained incommunicado for rolling periods of seven-days and interrogated for up to 24 hours with no right to silence and only a heavily circumscribed right to legal representation.
The fifth strategy he identifies is:
... pretend that the proposals only target persons engaged in extreme acts of political/religious violence. Ignore the fact that the proposals and current laws impose guilt by association by making illegal conduct peripherally connected with acts like bombing and hijackings. Obscure the fact that these laws draw in their net certain acts of industrial action and political activity.  
The current proposal—
this is one that has now gone through parliament—
to extend the detention/interrogation period, for example, is portrayed as if it only targeted terrorist suspects when it, in fact, catches persons suspected of committing a `terrorism' offence; an offence that can be committed merely by possessing a thing related to a `terrorist act'. `Terrorist act', in turn, embraces certain acts of industrial action. Thus, a person holding a leaflet promoting picketing by nurses is, arguably, committing a `terrorism' offence.
We have, in sum, a formula based on opportunism, exaggerations and misrepresentations. It is these elements that lend substance to the charge that the Coalition government is exploiting the real fears that the Australian public has of terrorism and taking advantage of community perception that it is better at handling security issues than the ALP—
or anybody else—
It is this formula that makes up the politics of fear in the `War on Terror'.
Such politics might prove to be an electoral winner for the Coalition but there will be clear losers. The health of Australia's democracy will be eroded by the acidic effect of fear and misrepresentations. Laws that trench upon established rights and liberties and do very little in preventing extreme acts of political violence will be on the statute books—
and they are appearing on the statute books—
Most of all, there will be the sharp irony of Australians being no less safe from extreme acts of political violence but, in fact, all the more vulnerable to the arbitrary state power.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-12,"—It is important to emphasise what the Senate is debating here to make sure that the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 and the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004 are not just waved through and that people listening to this debate do not think, `It's just another bill at the end of a long sitting fortnight. Why don't they all shut up and go home?' We are debating, examining and outlining the detail of the legislation because it affects every single Australian and every single person in Australia. Its reach is such that it will affect every one of us, so everybody needs to be aware—or at least needs the opportunity to be aware—of what is in it and what its consequences will or could be.
That is why the Democrats believe it is not appropriate to be debating the legislation on a Friday, when the Senate is not normally sitting, in a deliberate and commonly used process of trying to enable enactment of legislation through exhaustion, hoping that senators will decide, `It's going to get through anyway; so we'll just make a few perfunctory comments and let it be over and done with, and then we can all go home.' Frankly, that may be understandable but it is not satisfactory at the best of times and it is certainly not satisfactory in dealing with legislation like this which does affect every single Australian, every single person in the country and every person who may be in Australia in the future.
The legislation directly takes away individual freedoms and individual rights. There can be no dispute about that. Even the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, who is certainly no slouch at restricting people's rights and has a long record of doing so, says that the bill `does not unnecessarily encroach upon individual rights and freedoms'. The qualifier `unnecessarily' is a nice subjective term—a single word that tries to alleviate all concern and say, `It's not a problem. None of this taking away of rights and freedoms is unnecessary, so don't worry about it.' Frankly, it is not only unnecessary but also extremely dangerous. It does give more power to the government. Not just this government but governments throughout history—particularly once they have been in power for a little while—do not seem, funnily enough, to be able to see any problem with giving themselves more and more power and with giving more and more power to themselves in a way that prevents the courts from being able to properly scrutinise the exercise of that power. 
In adding to the comments that my colleague Senator Greig has already made, I would like to focus on a couple of specific aspects. Firstly I emphasise, to ensure that the Democrats' position is not misrepresented, that we do not oppose the component of Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 which deals with amendments to the Crimes Act. We believe those measures are important and desirable and should be passed expeditiously. That is on the record; it is in the Democrats' dissenting report on the examination of the bill by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. We support the passing of that component expeditiously; it could even be done now. It is clearly acknowledged to be not only justifiable but also desirable. But there are other significant components that are not only undesirable but extremely dangerous.
It is worth noting the concerns of others in the community. As I mentioned, this legislation went through the Senate committee process—often the only real mechanism for enabling the truth to be exposed about what the legislation will actually do. Many concerns were raised by people in the community with the expertise and the experience to understand what its ramifications would or could be. The Law Council of Australia, representing a range of constituent state law councils, said:
... the new laws have the potential to operate harshly and will unfairly target members of minority groups, especially those of the Islamic faith.
The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties gave a brief but very chilling assessment of one of these bills. I remind the public that we are dealing with two bills that have been pushed together and so the government is attempting to push through today a wider range of attacks on our freedoms. The Council for Civil Liberties spoke specifically about the component of the legislation that deals with the offence of association with a terrorist organisation. It is the sort of thing that sounds really simple, understandable and justifiable when it is first spouted by a government minister: `We want to be able to catch people who are hanging out with terrorists.' Who would be against that? But when you look at the detail of the power, the enormity of the power and the fact that in many respects that power is being given to a government minister with no significant scope for judicial oversight of its use, you see that it is rather different.
These sorts of offences of making it illegal to associate with certain groups of people tend to be called `consorting legislation' and, as was stated in the submission of the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, experience with existing consorting legislation at a state level has shown how it has been open to abuse. It has actually been the genesis of much police corruption. It is always possible for us to make mistakes when we are passing legislation. You have a look at it and you think, `It might be used this way; it might be used that way.' You then make an informed judgment and see how it goes. But when you already have similar sorts of powers operating and you have clear evidence that they are actually being misused—and, according to the submission of the Law Council, not only being misused but actually generating police corruption—then you would be a fool if you were to allow similar sorts of powers to be enacted in other areas or other jurisdictions. It is one thing to make a mistake—we all do that—but not to learn from those mistakes and continue to build on them moves from common human frailty to dereliction of duty. The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties said that consorting offences had been consistently held to be unconstitutional and a breach of the Bill of Rights in the United States and that, globally, they were not aware of any comparable jurisdiction that had similar provisions in its antiterrorism legislation. What that says is that we are actually going further in this particular attack on people's freedoms than any comparable jurisdiction, as far as the Council for Civil Liberties are aware, and certainly further than the United States in this area of consorting offences. As they say, consorting offences have been consistently held to be unconstitutional and a breach of the Bill of Rights of the United States of America. It is a reminder how weak our protections are in Australia against such attacks on our freedoms. 
I repeat the point I made earlier today: the High Court decision last week that addressed mandatory detention might sound like it is just something that affects failed asylum seekers, but it was a clear demonstration that we do not have any constitutional protections against government ministers exercising powers that will deny people their freedoms in the most extreme ways. As long as they can get them into law and get them through the parliament, the courts cannot protect us. If the parliament passes these laws, there is nothing in the Constitution that will protect us. We have no bill of rights, we have no implied rights, explicit rights or underpinning rights that will allow the protection of Australians from misuse and abuse of these powers. They are not there. The only protection left is the Senate. The Senate is the only thing that can stop governments giving themselves these powers through legislation.
That is what we are doing here today. We are allowing laws to be put in place that will give the government these enormous powers to restrict and infringe on people's right of association. We can translate it to another common debate in this chamber about industrial relations. For a government and a party—in the Liberal Party—that regularly talks about freedom of association in an industrial context, as indeed does the Labor Party from the point of view of freedom of association within trade unions, to allow a provision to be put into law that can make it a criminal offence to associate with somebody, even unwittingly, I think is extraordinary.
I would draw the attention of the Senate to the submission that came from the Australian Muslim Civil Rights Advocacy Network. I have spoken in this chamber before about the fear, the apprehension and the concern that exist already in Muslim communities in Australia with the laws that are already in place, let alone the extra ones that are being proposed here today. There is quite clearly a strong belief amongst many in the Muslim community that the existing antiterrorism legislation, the ASIO legislation and other legislation that has already been passed are acting and operating in a way that is targeting the Muslim community specifically.
I remember that, when I raised these concerns before, I think it was Senator McGauran who said, `That is just outrageous. There is nothing in this legislation that even talks about Muslims. How could you say that it is targeting Muslims?' I am not saying that there is anything specific in these bills—I do not think there is any mention of the word `Muslim' or `Islam'. So in one sense it is quite easy to say, `Yes, of course they don't target anybody; they are completely neutral.' But you cannot—when you are doing your job of examining legislation properly in the Senate, anyway—just look at the black-and-white words on the page; you have got to look at what the likely or potential impacts will be and learn from what is already happening and learn from what people in the community believe. We have Senate inquiries not so that we can all sit around and read things a little bit more closely; we have them so that we can hear from the public and hear from the community. 
The Muslim community are very concerned not just about the whole trend of the laws but about the implementation and the operation of those laws. I would urge anybody who actually cares about defending the right of association and the freedom of religion—which, again, many in this place would normally speak positively about—as well as people who are concerned about the future viability of multiculturalism and ethnic diversity in this country to read the submission from the Muslim community that was put to the Senate committee inquiry. They are making it quite clear what they believe is already happening. It is not good enough for us to say, `Well, they've got it wrong. That's not what we mean to do. We're not really targeting them.' If you have a clear belief as a community that you are already being targeted, that is the reality. Our saying that it is not happening does not change that reality. We have to listen to these sorts of messages and these sorts of views, because it is these people's lives that are being affected by what we are doing.
It is not likely to affect the lives of most of us here in this chamber, although frankly we cannot discount that possibility either, because as politicians we do a lot of associating with people in the community. It is part of our job. We are supposed to associate with people, communicate with them, support them, listen to them, work with them. People in the press gallery—the vast throngs up there at the moment, listening intently—will have their right to free speech and their ability to work with, examine, explore and expose the truth through people in the community potentially being impinged by this legislation. There was evidence before the Senate committee that outlined how these sorts of laws can specifically be used to restrict freedom of speech within the media, to harass journalists who are seeking to get particular groups in the community to reveal the truth. All it needs is a decision by a government minister for a group or a person who is associated with a so-called terrorist entity and anybody else who talks to them to come under the auspices of these laws. Anyone who attends a meeting with them can come under the auspices of these laws.
As the Muslim community said, the exemptions that are in the bill that say it is okay if you are associating with someone in a place used for public religious worship in the course of practising religion are far too narrow. The Muslim community, as with many others, has large community and religious festivals at outdoor venues. They have classes, they have study groups, they have social events, they have other celebrations—religious events. But the fact is, as the submission from the Muslim community says, they have already suffered unprecedented levels of racism and discrimination in the last few years. There is a trend, which already existed and is now growing, of creating isolation between the Muslim community and the wider Australian community. That is a bad thing in general but even for the focus of this legislation, supposedly aimed at restricting and tackling terrorism, the last thing you want to do is start building divisions, separation and isolation within the Australian community.
To tackle terrorism, the best thing is not to have a whole bunch of laws giving the government more power and taking away the freedoms of the public; it is having as much communication and as much cohesion amongst the entire community as possible. It is when the cohesion amongst the community breaks down that things become much more serious and lead to greater isolation within the Muslim community. It would lead to people not wanting to talk to one another, not wanting to associate with each other and not wanting to be seen with other people from that community for fear of falling foul of this legislation. That fear already exists under laws that are already in place, so it cannot be blithely said that these are invalid concerns or concerns that are understandable but that will not come to pass. They have already come to pass and we cannot just ignore that reality. 
When we are talking about restricting people's rights to freedom of association, it means putting in place legal and therefore social barriers to interaction between people within the community. It increases suspicion. Everybody looks sideways at different people, thinking that they had better not hang out with a particular group of people because they are a bit suspect. The fact is that every proscribed organisation so far in Australia has a Muslim link to it. But nobody would suggest that every terrorist related organisation is linked to Muslim activity. The fact is that a large proportion of organisations that have been proscribed in the United States have no Islamic association. It just happens to be that all the ones in Australia do. That fact has not gone unnoticed by people in the Muslim community.
We do need to be quite cognisant of the seriousness of the powers that are being proposed in these two pieces of legislation, particularly anything that restricts freedom of association. Anything that puts in place the threat of a government, a government agent or the police being able to charge or act against someone in the community for being seen with somebody else makes it easy for us all to recognise and sense just how easily that can be misused. We all know groups in the community get targeted politically and rhetorically and they get a veneer of suspicion put over them for various reasons. We have seen it repeatedly in recent years. For it to potentially be made illegal to be seen to be associated, even inadvertently, with particular groups—it is not saying you know they are doing something untoward—can be misused. Someone else thinks they are doing something untoward and you are hanging out with them—that is enough. These are extreme restrictions on our freedom and, as the High Court showed last week, we do not have any other protections in the Constitution. We give these powers to the government, they have got them and they can use them however they want, and there is no protection for Australians against those powers being misused. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-08-12,"—I thank senators for their contributions to the second reading debate on the two antiterrorism bills we are dealing with together this afternoon. This is a Liberal government, and the Liberal Party is a party whose principal tenet is the freedom of the individual. We understand as well as anyone else the human rights that all Australians expect and should have, and their political and civil rights. I would like to make it very clear at the outset that perhaps the most fundamental civil right of all is the right to human security. These bills are about allowing Australians to go about their work and their daily lives in security. That is a goal that most Australians accept and understand.
All senators are well aware of the provisions of these two bills. I am not going to take up the time of the Senate by going through the elements of the bills in any great detail. Nor will I respond to the issues that have been raised in the speeches made in the second reading debate, as I am confident—in fact, it has been indicated to me in the speeches of senators—that these issues will be raised again in the committee process which is to occur immediately following the conclusion of the second reading debate. 
However, I would like to correct the record on something that Senator Greig said—not in this debate but in some of the preliminary motions leading up to this debate. He suggested that the offence relating to association with terrorist organisations was designed to put same-sex couples in jail. This bill provides for completely the opposite. The bill provides for an exemption from the association offence. The exemption recognises same-sex partners as close family members. The exemption means that same-sex partners can be exempt from the offence where the association is a matter of family or domestic concern. So the concerns that Senator Greig mentioned earlier were completely erroneous and a complete misreading of the government's intentions. Senator Greig did not mention that in his speech in the second reading debate, so perhaps he had already received advice to that end. I wanted to put that on the record so that there was no misapprehension.
The amendments to the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 3) 2004 address two very important practical issues that are significant to the security of this country and all Australians. They go some way to dealing with the consequences of a terrorist attack or a national disaster. The procedures in schedules 1 and 2 for the surrender of passports will play a vital role in enabling Australian authorities to effectively seal the border to escaping terrorists. There is not much point in having a sophisticated system for the surrender of Australian passports if the suspect can avoid that system simply by using a foreign passport. The amendments concerning foreign travel documents will also enable authorities to take travel documents from those suspected of other serious crimes such as child sex offences. All countries need to work together to impede the movement of criminals across the globe.
These bills are not directed at ordinary Australian citizens; they are directed at criminals of the worst kind. In some of the speeches we have heard in the second reading debate, that principle seems to have been overlooked. These bills are all about attacking criminals and terrorists so that Australians can go about their normal daily work and life in the recognition that they and their families are safe. I am pleased to see that senators understand the need for the amendments the bills are making. The amendments will make a difference in our efforts to prevent a terrorist attack.
The provisions of schedule 3, which would enable authorities to use federal forensic procedures laws to identify the victims of mass casualty incidents, are sadly a lesson that we have learnt from the Bali attack. No longer can this country rely on myriad state laws to deal with such incidents. Following Bali the parliament met the challenge by enacting a federal law, and we need to do the same in preparation for a possible domestic incident. It is pleasing to see our parliament meeting these challenges in a sensible fashion.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, in its report dated 6 August, supported the provisions contained in schedules 2 and 3 of the bill. The committee recommended that the government review some of the proposed foreign passport offences in schedule 1 and report to parliament about whether a reasonable excuse defence should be incorporated. The government has reviewed the offences and does not believe such a defence is appropriate in these circumstances. I would like to convey my thanks to Mr Tom Sherman, whose review of the provisions enacted immediately following the Bali attack identified the need for the forensic amendments. The review, as senators will recall, was made up of officers from the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner, the Ombudsman, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Federal Police. 
I am pleased that the Senate has been able to agree to the important reforms contained in the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004. The bill is yet a further contribution to the development and consolidation of the counter-terrorism laws, which are essential to ensure that terrorists and their organisations are confronted and dealt with. The terrorist organisations depend on contact and integration with communities in order to survive and expand, and we have seen examples of that. The bill seeks to cut off this source of support for organisations that engage in acts of terrorism from behind the veil of the broader community by making illegal the associations through which that support is gained.
The bill also recognises the continuing risk a person in custody may pose to Australia's security. Where there is a security risk, the bill will enable the transfer between states of federal prisoners and those on remand. It is the government's hope that state and territory governments will soon see the way clear to agree to the measures that would provide the same protection in relation to all prisoners. Security transfer orders will necessarily involve a balancing of the interests of the administration of justice and prisoners' welfare against the interests of security. I recall Senator Ludwig asking for some assurances from the government in relation to the negotiations with the state and territory governments, and I will be happy to give those during the committee stage of the debate. These amendments are necessary to ensure that any threats to our security can be managed wherever they arise. I commend the bills to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-08-12,"—by leave—We seem to be having urgency in government priorities made on the run across the chamber, without any discussion with people on the crossbench. There appeared to be very little discussion with the opposition, who are unclear as to what the position is. All of a sudden we have the Manager of Government Business in the Senate coming into the chamber and moving a motion to say that these bills are urgent. All of a sudden the government have reprioritised the lengthy list we had before and said, `These are our bills, these bills are urgent and we want the Senate to immediately acknowledge that these are the urgent government priorities.' We have not even had put forward a proposal, an explanation, a reason or a rationale. There has been no discussion beforehand. The Manager of Government Business in the Senate has simply come in and said to the Senate, without any notification: `Join with me and say these are the priority urgent bills for the government.' 
It is not acceptable. This is not the first time today that it has happened. We have had the government coming in and saying: `All of a sudden we have changed our minds. These bills which were not urgent yesterday are automatically urgent.' Now they have changed it again and they are going to add on another few bills. They say, `These are the bills we are going to say are urgent now.' It is the most obscure way to run business. They are ramming stuff through with no discussion beforehand. They say: `This bill is urgent. Now this bill is urgent. Now these three bills are urgent. We are going to change our minds.' There is no discussion beforehand; they just come in and, bang, say that these bills are urgent. They cut off the discussion that is occurring right now. It seems to be the most absurd way to run a process. We are already sitting far longer because the government and the opposition could not reach agreement on their fiddling around the edges of the free trade agreement. It is not what the Greens think is an acceptable way to be running government business here in the Senate. (Quorum formed)
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Ian Campbell's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>URGENT LEGISLATION</title>,<title>Declaration of Urgency</title>,Bills,40,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-12,"—The Australian Democrats oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 3 (line 2) to page 17 (line 16), to be opposed.
Democrat amendment (1) seeks to oppose schedule 1 and therefore remove it from the bill. With this amendment, the Democrats are not saying that there is no need for the Passports Act to be updated. We agree that the time for legislative changes has probably come; however, we have some concerns with the provisions in schedule 1, which we believe need to be worked through carefully. We agree with the shadow minister for homeland security that there is a compelling reason to expedite the passage of schedule 3 to this bill and we are willing to support the passage of that schedule. However, the government has made it difficult for us to do so by coupling it with schedules 1 and 2, which the Democrats are not prepared to pass in their current form. What we are saying to the government with respect to schedule 1 is: `Go back and start again.' 
In its current form, the schedule raises a number of issues. As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, the Democrats have a number of concerns with the changes proposed in schedule 1, and these concerns were confirmed by evidence in the Senate committee. We are persuaded by the argument of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, which argues that an order for the surrender of foreign documents should be made only where a foreign arrest warrant, court order, bail or parole condition relates to a matter which is also a serious offence under Australian law. The Democrats do not believe that the minister's power should be predicated on the existence of an arrest warrant issued by a foreign court without any consideration of the nature of the laws of the legal system of the foreign country or the reasons for the issue of the warrant. You may recall that the example I gave during my speech on the second reading debate was in relation to adultery and sharia law and whatnot from a Middle Eastern country.
One of the primary concerns that the Democrats have with schedule 1 is the potential impact on refugees and asylum seekers. We are disturbed by the evidence that the new provisions may be inconsistent with the convention relating to the status of refugees. The Democrats believe that there is a need for a defence of reasonable excuse in relation to foreign travel document offences and that this defence should expressly apply to asylum seekers and refugees. As I have said, the Democrats also have serious concerns with the restrictions, on review of the minister's decision to order the surrender of foreign travel documents. The limitations placed on the AAT are unacceptable, particularly given the enormous impact of the minister's decision on a person who is subsequently prevented from leaving Australia.
Given the likelihood that the minister's decision will relate either to international relations or to criminal intelligence, the AAT in almost all cases will be restricted either to affirming the minister's decision or to remitting the decision to the minister for reconsideration. So there is a range of concerns that we Democrats have with schedule 1 in its current form, and we do not believe it should be expedited in the same way as schedule 3. We believe the government should go away and attempt to address the concerns raised in evidence to the Senate committee, particularly the concerns about the potential impact on refugees and the severely limited review mechanisms. It is on that basis the Democrats are opposing schedule 1. Madam Temporary Chairman I seek leave to move Democrat amendment (2) now so that it may be dealt with together with amendment (1).
Leave granted.
—The Democrats oppose schedule 2 in the following terms:
(2)	Schedule 2, page 18 (line 2) to page 20 (line 20), to be opposed.
Democrat amendment (2) seeks to oppose schedule 2 and, consequently, to remove it from the bill. Our concerns are somewhat different from the concerns I have expressed with schedule 1. In this instance our concerns are more substantive: we are not asking the government to go away and redraft schedule 2; we are simply asking it to abandon this schedule altogether. The Democrats strongly oppose the provisions of schedule 2, primarily because they enable travel documents to be seized from innocent Australians who are not even suspected of involvement in terrorism. Unfortunately, this is already provided for under section 34JC of the ASIO Act; however, schedule 2 takes that one step further by enabling the seizure of documents before a prescribed authority has issued the questioning warrant, before the request has even been made to the prescribed authority and before the Attorney-General has even consented to the making of the request for a questioning warrant. As I said in my contribution to the second reading debate, these provisions have incredibly serious consequences and we cannot support them. We believe they both ought to be removed from the bill.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-08-12,"—by leave—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government's amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber yesterday. I move government amendments (1) to (4):

(1)	Schedule 3, item 2, page 3 (line 17), at the end of the definition of close family member, add:
		; or (f) cousin, uncle or aunt of the person.
This amendment seeks to respond to concerns of the Australian Muslim Civil Rights Advocacy Network, which argued in its submission to the committee that family is very important in almost all Arabic and Islamic cultures, and in particular the extended family bonds of cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents. It is not uncommon for several generations of families to be living in the same household, or for a group of related families to live in the same street. It is not unusual, for example, for cousins and uncles to meet each other on a daily basis to share their experiences and problems. We Democrats do not believe that the Muslim community should be penalised for spending time with their extended families. Accordingly, we are seeking to insert an additional paragraph into the definition of `close family member' to ensure that it covers uncles, aunts and cousins.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (NO. 3) 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,41,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-08-12,"—The opposition does not support this amendment. The question of penalty was one that we considered closely; indeed, it was raised by the shadow minister in the other place. On balance we are prepared to accept that there is justification for a more serious maximum penalty than that which applies under state and territory consorting offences. That is because the stringent elements in this offence, which are absent from consorting offences, mean that it applies to more serious behaviour. Also, the opposition is satisfied that the investigative powers that will be available if this penalty is maintained, such as those under the surveillance devices regime—which, hopefully, we might get to in the next sitting period—are appropriate, given the terrorist-related nature of the conduct being targeted.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-TERRORISM BILL (NO. 3) 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,41,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-08-12,"—The government also opposes the Democrat amendment. It is something we did look at; it is restricted to closer family. We think the amendment would undermine the effectiveness of the proposal. In any case, if a person does not intend to support the expansion or existence of a terrorist organisation they will not be guilty of any offence.

 (3)	Schedule 3, item 3, page 4 (line 29), omit “3 years”, substitute “6 months”.
As I have already made clear in my second reading speech, we Democrats unequivocally oppose the proposed new offence of associating with a terrorist organisation. We maintain that opposition and we will be voting against the bill. However, we know that the bill is likely to be passed despite our opposition and it is on that basis that we are now seeking to reduce the penalties which apply to that offence. Democrat amendments (2) and (3) will reduce the penalty from three years to six months. This responds directly to a recommendation made by AMCRAN in its submission to the Senate committee, and it is an attempt to reduce the impact of what is an incredibly problematic and draconian offence. It is important to remember that this offence does not target suspected terrorists or members of terrorist organisations. It applies to those who may come into contact with such individuals or organisations. This is not an offence that we believe should be punished by up to three years imprisonment.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-12,"—Thank you. With 12 minutes to go before the guillotine falls, let me just briefly say that the Greens will be opposing this bill. The bill will take away the right to vote from some prisoners but not others. The right of every person to vote is recognised in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The European Court of Human Rights on 30 March this year ruled against a blanket restriction on convicted prisoners. There will be effectively thousands of Australians behind bars who will have their vote taken away by this legislation. Let me remind the Senate that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended in 1993 that all prisoners in Australia, except those convicted of treason, be granted the right to vote because, firstly, prisoners should not be punished twice and, secondly, retaining the right to vote assists with the rehabilitation of offenders. That is the Senate's own advice from the expert committee that looked into the matter. Let me also quote from a Canadian judgment. In 2002, Chief Justice McLachlin said:
... denying penitentiary inmates the right to vote is more likely to send messages that undermine respect for the law and democracy than messages that enhance those values.
The whole basis of the respect for the rule of law rests on the participation of citizens through the democratic selection of their representatives making the law. How will prisoners subject to this feudal concept of civil death have respect for the law if they are banned from participating in its formation? One has to remember that it is our job to encourage people to take part in society, to feel empowered to be in society and to feel they have a role in society—not to take away that role. The one thing parliament should not do is intervene in the courts. This is effectively mandatory sentencing. This is effectively saying that the vote should be taken away from this group of prisoners without the court having the ability to levy that punishment—if it is expected to be a punishment that should be meted out against the international law and the proper precept of democracy.
On behalf of the Greens, I will be moving these amendments: firstly, to repeal all the provisions of the electoral act which remove the right of a prisoner to vote; secondly—and these are fallback provisions—to return to the five-year imprisonment threshold for the loss of the vote; and, thirdly, to oppose the retrospective nature of this bill—that is, extending it to people who commence serving a sentence before the provisions were passed—and to retain the definition of a sentence of imprisonment. It is again remarkable that the big parties have allowed this process of infringing international law, mandatory sentencing and interference in the courts through mandatory sentencing to not only creep into more and more law but also grow in the strength of application. It is a wrong law and it should be voted down. ",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PRISONER VOTING AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-12,"—Given the time, I will be extremely brief. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Prisoner Voting and Other Measures) Bill 2004 is a demonstration of the government's commitment to ensuring the integrity of the electoral system. When it passed the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Integrity and Other Measures) Act, it was the parliament's intention that people who commit offences against society sufficient to warrant a full-time prison term for an electoral cycle or longer should not have any entitlement to vote and elect the leaders of this society. They would be deprived of this entitlement whilst serving that prison sentence.
The legislation will give effect to that intention by preventing all prisoners who are serving a full-time sentence of three years or more, including those whose sentences began before the commencement of the legislation, from enrolling to vote or being enrolled to vote, and therefore being eligible to vote. The bill also removes items from the enrolment integrity act relating to the early close of rolls for referenda, which were overlooked during debate on the legislation in the Senate. This will ensure consistency with the removal of all other early close of roll provisions during the debate on that act and will maintain the current seven-day time limit for the close of rolls after the writs are issued for an election or a referendum. 
Finally, the bill will clarify that all provisions relating to proof of name and address requirements for enrolment commence at the same time. Amendments made by the Senate to the enrolment integrity act contained different commencement dates which made the commencement of the scheme unclear. The amendments will remedy that and will remove the uncertainty having been brought about by the earlier amendments. I commend the bill.

Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
In the weeks from 31 May to 13 June, 2004, I undertook a study tour of Germany, in the first stage to Bonn, Germany, to observe proceedings at the International Conference for Renewable Energies, hosted by the Federal Government of Germany held between 1 and 4 June, and to take part in the International Parliamentary Forum on Renewable Energies hosted by the German Bundestag held in parallel with the International Conference on 2 June. 
At the International Conference, Australia was represented by an official delegation of officers from the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources (Mr Bruce Wilson, General Manager, Environment Branch, Delegation Leader), Australian Greenhouse Office (Dr Greg Terrill, Branch Head, International and Strategies Branch; Mr Denis Smedley, Manager, Renewable Energy Technologies Team), Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Peter Heyward, Assistant Secretary, Environment Branch; Mr Mike Byers, Executive Officer, Climate Change Section). I thank all these officers for the excellent advice and support they provided me during the course of the Conference and the Parliamentary Forum.
The Parliamentary Forum was chaired by Dr Herman Scheer, a Social Democrat (Government) member of the German Bundestag. Dr Scheer was assisted by Ms Michaele Hustedt, a member of the Green Party in the Bundestag. The programme of the Forum comprised six sessions: four plenary debate sessions and the opening and the closing sessions. The topics of the four plenary sessions were, in order: Parliamentary Initiatives in Industrialised Countries; parliamentary Initiatives in Developing Countries; Parliamentary Initiatives on North-South cooperation; and parliamentary Initiatives for International Institutions—Joint Promotion of Renewables. I chaired the fourth sessions, and took the opportunity to deliver a speech outlining Australia's approach to renewable energies and the considerable progress we have made. I thank Mr Denis Smedley of the AGO especially for his considerable assistance to me in preparing this speech. 
The International Conference was well planned and managed by the Germany Federal Government, with generous support from the Governments of the State of Nordrhein-Westfalen and the City of Bonn, and the Germany renewable Energy industry.
The Parliamentary Forum was one of a number of “side events” of the International Conference, and was attended by some 200 members from various parliaments. Discussions covered a wide range of topics, not always as indicated by the programme. The level of passion and intensity many of the participants brought to the discussion often reached impressive heights, their contributions frequently interesting and from time to time informative, but regrettably in most instances to my observation more or less impractical.
I also took advantage of my stay in Bonn to meet with Mr Richard Kinley, deputy to the Executive Secretary of the Climate Change Secretariat (UNFCCC), which is headquartered there. Mr Kinley kindly provided me with a briefing on the current status of Kyoto Protocol, especially with regard to the then widely reported news that Russia was on the verge of ratifying the Protocol. I understood that while Mr Kinley believed that Russia was closer to ratifying than previously, he did not expect any announcement of decision, if any, before October. I was also pleased to find that (1) Mr Kinley did not regard the coming into force of the Protocol as a necessary condition for further global collaboration toward reduction of greenhouse gas emission; and (2) the feverish assertions by Senator Brown and assorted environmental warriors that Australia had become international pariah for failing to ratify the Protocol were grossly exaggerated—Australia's efforts and achievements in greenhouse gas reduction were in fact well acknowledged. My meeting with Mr Kinley was arranged and facilitated by the Australian Embassy and DFAT. I thank Ms Alison Carrington of the Embassy and Mr Peter Heyward of the Delegation for their kind efforts.
Following the close of the International Conference, I joined a tour of the East Frisia region of Nordrhein-Westfalen State, described as a “wind energy region” with nearly 900 operative wind turbines, representing over 700 MW of installed generating power, outputting 1.2 MKWh in 2003 which was 54% of the total load. The 2-day tour was hosted by Ostfriesland Regional Council and the Council of the City of Aurich. Their hospitality, as well as the natural beauty of their countryside—even with the sight of the forest of wind turbine towers across the horizon—was gratefully appreciated.
The tour included attendance at the commissioning of the third E-112, 4.5 MW, of ENERCON. The designation 112 referred to the diameter of the rotor, in metres. ENERCON is Germany's leading wind turbine manufacturer, its main plant in Emden is East Frisia region's second largest industry—Volkswagen is the largest. ENERCON was a major sponsor of the East Frisia tour.
I understand that the proliferation of wind turbines in Germany generally was made possible by an energy tax regime which heavily subsidised renewable electricity generation; and in East Frisia in particular because it gave the farm owners there the opportunity to gain a source of steady supplementary income which made their farms economically viable. However, in recent years both of these factors have come under challenge—the cost of the subsidies has led to demand for reform which is now in process; at the same time environmental activists have become increasing vocal in opposition to wind turbines—which, ironically, are promoted heavily by the German Greens in government in coalition with the SPD.
In the second part of my study tour I visited Berlin, and met with officials of the German Environment Ministry—Dr Patrick Graichen (International Cooperation, Conventions and Climate Change); Mr Kai Schlegelmilch (Implementation of Germany's Climate National Protection Program); Mr Uwe Busgen (International and EU Renewables Policy)—and received briefing on Germany's renewable policy and general approach to environmental management. Of interest was the information that wind power was not regarded as a major player of future development of energy sources.  
I also met with a number of German experts on immigration law, multiculturalism and citizenship issues. These included: Dr Steffen Angenendt, Senior Research Fellow, Research Institute of the German Council on Foreign Relations; Ms Malti Taneja, Federal Government Commissioner for Migration, Refugees and Integration; Mr Till-Olive Rothfuss, a senior SPD parliamentary advisor on immigration.
As a summary of these discussions, I have incorporated below a short abstract of an article on immigration reform in Germany co-authored by Dr Steffen Angenendt.
“Immigration has long been one of the most hotly debated domestic political issues in Germany and in Europe at large. After many years without substantial action in this policy field, the Red-Green government which came to power in 1998 introduced two new laws, an American-style Green Card and a new citizenship law. From these beginnings the immigration reform campaign captured the public imagination and for two years a broad spectrum of figures from German life including a panel of experts summoned by the government took part in a lively debate on the issue. A law was eventually adopted by parliament and promulgated in spring 2002, but—in the wake of a voting scandal in the Bundesrat—it was struck down by the Constitution Court weeks before its scheduled entry into force. This paper recounts the story of the now defunct immigration law and seeks to shed valuable light on German politics by asking three fundamental questions: What were the main differences the political parties were unable to affect a compromise? Why have the political forces failed to turn virtually universal agreement on the need for immigration reform into an effective law? And what does the failure say about the functioning of Germany's democracy?”
Senators wishing to read the full text of Dr Angenendt's research report should please contact me.
I am extremely grateful to Ms Allison Carrington of the Australian Embassy in Berlin for her kind assistance in arranging and for accompanying me to these very informative meetings. I also thank Ms Miriam Kueller, senior research and project officer at the Embassy for the onerous task of interpreting for me at these meetings, a task she performed very efficiently. My special thank is due to Ms Pamela Fayle, Australian Ambassador in Germany, for her kindness of not only making her staff available for assistance, but also taking time from her busy schedule to brief me on current German political situation.
Finally, I thank Synergi Travel and Qantas for their efficient and friendly service.

Chair's Introductory Speech to Session IV—Global Renewable Energy Actions and        Institutions—Bonn 2 June 2004
Australia's Renewable Energy Approach
I am delighted to have the privilege of chairing this session and opening the discussion regarding the promotion of renewables. I thank Dr Herman Scheer, the Forum Chair, for inviting me to take this role.
I would like to take this opportunity to talk about what Australia has developed in terms of renewable energy, especially in the context of climate change measures. 
Domestic Action—Key Policies and Programs
Australia recognises the importance and the potential of renewable energy in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the sustainability of energy supply.
For 2004-5, the Australia Government has budgeted more than A$2 billion to fund a range of climate change measures across the economy, including the energy, transport and agricultural sectors, in a whole of government effort—including A$280 million through overseas aid.
Australia is making careful, targeted investments in developing the technologies that will deliver a vibrant economy with a lower greenhouse signature. The greatest intervention effort by the Australian Government so far, has been to support a greater role for renewables, including the introduction of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Targets (MRET) scheme. I should speak more on this aspect later. 
Australia's physical and geographic characteristics—ours is a large, hot and generally dry continent with a small, dispersed and yet highly urbanised population—make us a difficult candidate for a high level of renewable application. Only about 6% of total energy use in Australia comes from renewable energy. In the electricity sector, current use of renewable energy contributes nearly 11%. This is expected to expand significantly in the next decade.
On the other hand, Australia is blessed with an abundance of good renewable resources—solar, wind, tidal and biomass. 
Australian Government is providing a major boost to renewable energy as a key part of its overall strategy for reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. The Government, in partnership with industry, launched a Renewable Energy Action Agenda three years ago, to underpin the renewable energy industry in Australia, based on a competitive energy market with clear signals provided to investors. This Action Agenda aims to grow annual industry sales to $4 billion by 2010 and industry is playing a key role in its implementation.
A Renewable Energy Technology Roadmap has followed on from the Action Agenda. This outlines a long-term research and development plan that defines the industry's collective future and establishes clear pathways forward. Other more detailed roadmaps are now being developed for areas of special interest such as photovoltaics.
Key Policies and Programs
A key element of the Australian Government's renewable energy strategy is the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) scheme which was introduced in April 2001. The initiative, which will be in place until 2020, is a world-first in developing a legislated national renewable energy market based on an innovative system of tradeable certificates. The Australian Government remains committed to the measure and after almost three years of operation, an independent review of the MRET found that it is meeting its objectives, with industry taking up the challenge of delivering new renewable energy projects. 
MRET, coupled with other significant Government programs dedicated to renewable energy, are ensuring Australia is on track to achieve its Kyoto-compliance emissions target and positioning Australia for a lower greenhouse signature.
Coupled with this expanded market through MRET, Australia has introduced a suite of programs that have successfully supported project delivery and technology support.
Over the past five years, Australia has allocated over $300 million to programs that have encouraged deployment of existing renewable energy technologies and furthering industry capacity building.
These programs address a range of approaches, such as supporting solar power in homes and community use buildings; supporting the installation of renewable energy in remote areas; providing venture capital for small innovative renewable energy companies; showcasing Australian technology; and supporting the commercialisation of renewable energy technologies.
The potential of hydrogen to deliver significant economic and environmental benefits is also recognized and supported.
Thus, through a combination of providing and promoting the market “pull” factor, such as the legislated targets provided by the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target scheme, and the efficient and competitive provision of support—the market “push” factor—for the commercialisation and deployment of innovative renewable energy technologies, Australia is growing and developing a significant industry sector.
Successes
The results of these initiatives are impressive.
	Around 190 power stations run on renewable energy have been accredited across Australia, covering a wide range of technologies. 
	Wind power has grown at 30% per annum in Australia over recent years and could reach over 2,000 MW of installed capacity in the near future.  
	Over 5,000 households and community buildings across Australia have installed solar panels on their roofs and generate their own solar electricity. More than 1,700 of these are grid connected and can sell any excess electricity they produce back to the main grid. 
	50 projects have been supported to commercialise new renewable energy technologies, in areas such as photovoltaics, wind, wave, biomass energy, and enabling technologies such as battery and inverter technology. 
	Many of these technologies are already showing their potential for regional and international markets. For example the commercialization of dish and trough solar concentrators, the development of innovative photovoltaic cells, the design and development of specialised inverters, the integration of wind energy into diesel grids, and the design and manufacture of a solar and wind-powered hybrid passenger catamaran, are developments that are keeping Australia at the leading edge of renewable energy technology. 
	Isolated households and remote communities are installing photovoltaic power, wind turbines and micro-hydro generators to reduce their reliance on diesel fuel for power generation. Australia has much technology and experience to share that may be relevant to developing countries faced with the challenge of providing energy to remote rural populations. 
	Australia is at the leading edge of technical training and accreditation of renewable energy designers and installers. 
International Cooperation
In addition to domestic measures, Australia is also actively involved in a number of international forums which are undertaking activities to promote the uptake of renewable energy. For example, renewable energy forms an important component of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Energy Working Group (EWG) Type 2 Partnership Initiative, Fostering Regional Energy Cooperation in APEC: Energy for Sustainable Development. 
In particular, Australia has led a project which assessed the training needs and capabilities of APEC member economies for the planning design, operation and maintenance of renewable energy systems. An associated project is currently being undertaken which will develop and implement a system for accrediting renewable energy training in member countries. 
Australia also participates in International Energy Agency's (IEA) International Agreements specifically directed to renewable energy. There are nine such Agreements. All are practical and cost effective mechanisms to accelerate technology developments by sharing information and expertise and broadening the prospects of market deployment for renewable energy.
I understand that Australia is likely to join the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) and work with other partners to undertake the substantial program of work proposed to expand the global market for renewable energy. Australia considers REEEP a practical means of disseminating information about renewable and energy efficiency technologies and believes Australia has much to offer to the partnership, based on our experience with renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, policies and programs.
Australia is currently progressing bilateral cooperation on climate change with the United States, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, and China. These relationships provide a framework to focus on practical and measurable outcomes that benefit both countries, including opportunities for renewable energy development. They complement multilateral initiatives previously mentioned, including partnerships that emerged from the World Summit on Sustainable Development. 
Australia also participates in the International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy, and our work on hydrogen includes its generation using renewable energy.
Conclusion
Australia recognises the importance of a strategic plan for Australia's long term energy policy. As such, over the past 18 months, the Government has worked to develop a consistent and coherent framework for energy policy in Australia. While specific details are not yet available, it is anticipated that a major statement on energy to be released in the near future will include a strong component on the role of renewable energy. 
In all of these programs and relationships we aim to build the opportunity for the private sector to contribute its entrepreneurial skills, knowledge, networks, and resources. And we strive to include business more broadly in international collaboration initiatives.
