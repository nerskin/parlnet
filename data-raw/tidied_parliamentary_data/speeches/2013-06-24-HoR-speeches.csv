The SPEAKER
 (10:01):  I inform the House that the Department of Parliamentary Services has today released its innovative broadcast services, Parlview, onto the APH website. Parlview enables users to watch, pause, search and download parliamentary proceedings events and historical material. Progressively, Parlview will provide access to more than 55,000 hours of archived parliamentary audiovisual recording, dating from 1991. Much of this footage has never been seen by the general public. Near-live webcasts of parliamentary proceedings are still available on the APH websites, however, unlike Parlview, these webcasts are not searchable or downloadable. DPS is also working towards providing access to Parlview on mobile devices. I sincerely recommend to everybody to have a look at this new service the parliament is providing.

Mr MURPHY
 (Reid) (10:05):  Speaker, today is expected to be the last announcement of petitions and ministerial responses that I will make on behalf of the Petitions Committee during this parliament. And, as expected, we had quite a number of petitions presented today.


Speaker, in addition to these announcements, on behalf of the Petitions Committee I wish to present the committee's report entitled The work of the Petitions Committee: 2010-2013, together with the minutes of proceedings.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr MURPHY:
  by leave—Speaker, the report I present today records the work of the second Petitions Committee, the committee of the 43rd Parliament. 


Speaker, I could talk at some length about the committee's operations in this parliament; however, as chair of the committee I have provided the House with regular updates about the committee's work and the House's petitioning process, so I will not do that again today. Instead, I will let the report speak for itself in terms of the committee's overall operations from 2010-2013, its formal framework, the issues that recur and the issues that we expect to arise.


Importantly, I want to raise something that may not be apparent from the face of the report. I want to thank the deputy chair, Dr Dennis Jensen, the member for Tangney, and all my committee colleagues—some of whom, like the member for Forde, are in the chamber today—for their unfailing enthusiasm for the process of petitioning the House of Representatives. I thank my colleagues for their wholehearted support for the work of the committee and for their cooperation and cohesion. Their hard work has made it a pleasure for me to chair the Petitions Committee of the 43rd Parliament. In particular, I would like to thank the committee's secretary, Ms Catherine Cornish. The committee could not wish for a better committee secretary, nor could the committee wish for a better inquiry secretary than Ms Sharon Bryant, ably assisted by the research officer, Ms Susan Dinon, and administrative officer, Ms Jenny Jackson. 


All of the committee secretariat have worked very cooperatively with the committee in a very good-humoured way, and it has been an unalloyed pleasure to work with the secretaries and the members of this committee. It is the best committee I have ever been on and it promotes democracy here in our country. I am very proud of the work of the committee and I cannot thank the secretariat, and my colleagues on the committee, enough for all their hard work. Together we have endeavoured to ensure the committee lives up to the expectations of the House when it established the committee and of those people who seek to engage with the House to bring their concerns to the attention of the executive. I move: 


That the House take note of the report.

Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (10:09):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee’s report entitled Report of the inquiry intopotential reforms of Australia’s national securitylegislation.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr BYRNE:
  by leave—I am pleased to present this report. It has been 12 months of intense labour by members of the committee and I have five minutes to speak about it. Recent events such as the Boston bombings and the murder of a British soldier in the streets of London remind us of the impact of terrorist attacks and the continued need for the government and its security and intelligence agencies to maintain vigilance, preparedness for and defence against terrorist attacks.


The committee recognises the need for our security and intelligence agencies to be appropriately resourced, and to be granted powers which are often intrusive, in order to undertake their role. However, these intrusive powers must always be balanced by appropriate safeguards for the privacy of individuals and of the community. This recognises that Australia is a democracy which values personal freedoms and imposes limits on the power of the state. The committee's report reflects these fundamental values.


In May 2012 the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, asked the committee to inquire into a package of potential reforms to Australia's national security legislation. The committee was provided with a discussion paper outlining the reforms the government wished to have the committee consider. The committee was tasked with examining potential reform, of which three objectives were: to modernise lawful access to communications and communications data; to mitigate the risk posed to Australia's communications network by foreign technology and service suppliers; and to enhance the operational capacity of intelligence community agencies. The terms of reference contained 18 reform proposals involving 44 specific items across three reform areas. Importantly, the context for the committee inquiry included the serious challenge presented by new and emerging technologies upon agencies' intelligence-gathering capabilities. The committee received 240 submissions. Three submissions were received in largely identical terms from 5,300 individual members of the public. These submitters expressed opposition to the reforms put by the then Attorney-General, particularly with regard to the proposal to introduce a mandatory data retention scheme. I thank all those who contributed to the inquiry.


I note that the committee was faced with several difficulties. These included that the terms of reference were wide ranging and canvassed some of the most complex and significant reforms to national security legislation ever to come before the parliament. The absence of detail in the discussion paper concerning mandatory data retention also significantly impaired both the public discussion and the committee's consideration of the issue. Against this backdrop the committee was deliberate in taking the time needed to examine carefully the issues before it. Despite these challenges, Speaker, I am pleased to advise that the committee has produced a comprehensive and, critically, unanimous report which carefully considers both the needs of our national security agencies and the right of the individual. 


The committee made 43 recommendations. In the time available to me, I will note three of the committee's principal recommendations. First, the committee recommends that the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act should be comprehensively revised, with the objective of designing an interception regime which is underpinned by clear privacy provisions—provisions which are technologically neutral—by the maintenance of investigative capabilities clearly articulated in enforceable industry obligations and by robust oversight and accountability which supports administrative efficiency. Second, in recognition of the need to ensure the protection of privacy and security of data and critical infrastructure, the committee recommends the adoption of telecommunications sector security reforms. Third, the committee recommends targeted reforms to legislation which supports the AIC in discharging its duties and equips it appropriately to protect the Australian community.


One of the main proposals the committee examined was that of mandatory data retention—that is, a regime which would potentially require telecommunications companies to retain communications data, such as subscriber details, for a period of time. The committee felt that whether or not to introduce a mandatory data regime is ultimately a decision for government. However, the committee has taken note of the views of concerned members of the public, which are summarised in this report. In fact, the option of a committee being asked to recommend the establishment of an intrusive power, without draft legislation, provided an almost existential moment for the committee. With the events of America with PRISM, the public must have confidence in its parliamentary oversight agencies. Therefore, the committee was extremely careful in putting forward a model, if the government chooses to go down that track. It is the government's decision to include intrusive powers and then bring that back to the committee.


In the time available, this work could not have been done without the committee secretariat, particularly Jerome Brown, Robert Little, James Bunce, Cameron Gifford and Simon Lee. I thank the committee members. They are the most responsible committee I have served with. They had civil liberties in mind. They had the protections of the community in mind. This committee is the best I have ever worked with; it discharged its duties absolutely admirably.


I commend the report to the House.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (10:14):  I have some observations and comments on the outstanding leadership of the chair of the committee, the member for Holt. Committees work well only when leadership is offered and is present, and the leadership of the chair of this committee, Mr Byrne, has been greatly appreciated. I am glad he got to thanking our team: the committee secretariat and, may I add, particularly the specialist advisers that assisted us with what is in fact a very difficult area of public policy.


I do not intend to try to canvass all of the issues. I will go right to the nub of the matter. The nub of the matter is in recommendation 42, which deals with data retention. Data retention is a matter that the government has been asked to look at in the context of organisations losing their capacity to obtain intelligence information if required, because people will use the facilities where no data is kept and that opportunity to interrogate it would be lost. It is important to understand that, in the Australian context, no data is ever interrogated without a warrant. It requires a warrant either from the Attorney-General—in relation to the security agencies' access—or from law enforcement officers. I think it is very important to understand that, when these issues are discussed in terms of privacy, matters like these are examined only when the warrant system permits it.


I am sorry the Attorney, who was here for my colleague's speech, has left. For my own part, I think the handling of this issue by the government has been appalling. The government should have brought forward, as the chair mentioned, precise recommendations in the form of draft legislation that we could comment on in a meaningful way. The committee came to a view that it was not prepared to comment on it without the government going that extra step.


I want to speak about these issues in the context of some observations made by the shadow Attorney only this weekend. I have long been of the view that terrorism is something that will remain with us far longer than we would like, and I was very surprised when there was a statement by the Prime Minister about where we are, suggesting that 10 years after 9-11 circumstances had changed and the same urgency did not attach to terrorism. But, shortly after, we saw the events mentioned by the chair in Boston and the events in London, and I might add to that what is happening now in Syria. I am not blowing any secrets when I say that from newspaper reports there are suggestions that there are numbers of Australians who have gone abroad to participate in these activities in Syria, who are being trained and prepared in a way which would make them, on return to Australia, highly susceptible to engaging in terrorist activity here. All of the agencies, it is reported, believe that those are matters that they have to examine.


The committee's report has dealt with a lot of matters which, if the members had been given their druthers, they would have put off as well. But we have been able to obtain a remarkable degree of unison of view, which recommends reforms that should be progressed now to ensure that our agencies are able to deal with the threats that remain in a real and substantial way. I think these issues need to be looked at with regard to privacy questions but also with regard to the risks that are there. This matter will be addressed by a new government. I hope whoever is there will be able to deal with these matters, given this report, promptly and quickly and that the substantial reforms that the agencies need will be implemented.



The SPEAKER:  The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the honourable member for Holt wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a later occasion?

Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (10:35):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Papua New Guinea, 8 April to 13 April 2013. From 8 to 13 April this year I was privileged to lead the Parliamentary Delegation to Papua New Guinea. The purpose of the visit was to allow Australian parliamentarians to engage with the parliament of Papua New Guinea around issues of mutual importance to our longstanding relationship. With Papua New Guinea being one of Australia's largest aid recipients, having received approximately $493.2 million in official development assistance this financial year, the delegation also wished to engage with stakeholder organisations and representatives to learn more about the current state of economic and social development in Papua New Guinea and to be informed specifically about programs being delivered there by AusAID. 


As the delegation's visit took place in the lead-up to Anzac Day, the delegation also laid wreaths at the Bomana and Lae war cemeteries. The delegation visited the capital, Port Moresby, and visited Lae, the capital of Morobe Province. At both locations the delegation met with government officials, business representatives and local service providers, in addition to engaging in tours of major infrastructure. Matters discussed during these meetings and tours included the broader trade investment and aid program between countries, financial transparency, immigration, parliament to parliament assistance, further developing the capability of Papua New Guinea's public sector, agency to agency exchange between the two countries, women's electoral participation, ending violence against women, the availability of and access to education and vocational training and improving health outcomes.


The benefits of economic development from foreign investment into Papua New Guinea were discussed and observed in the context of major infrastructure projects such as the Papua New Guinea liquid natural gas project, major improvement and modernisation of the Lae Port and the Motukea Island international wharf project. 


The delegation learnt of the challenges facing the delivery of health care in metropolitan and rural Papua New Guinea through a visit to the Port Moresby General Hospital and the National Orthotic and Prosthetic Service and witnessed the tireless work being undertaken by healthcare workers and the generosity of donors from the private sector in support of their services. The delegation was informed that funding to improve health outcomes in Papua New Guinea is aimed at improving access to health services for those who may not otherwise be able to receive services because of financial disadvantage, long distance or underlying societal inequities such as low status in society, limited education and exposure to gender based violence. 


In learning about the progress and delivery of education and vocational programs, the delegation visited and met with representatives of the Australian-Pacific Technical College in Port Moresby and the National Polytechnic Institute of Papua New Guinea in Lae. The delegation heard about the challenges faced by education institutions and the achievements they had accomplished in assisting to upskill graduates and improve worker mobility across the Pacific region. The Australian government is continuing to work with the government of Papua New Guinea to improve health, education and training, administrative, and law and order outcomes, which in the longer term are expected to yield positive economic results for Papua New Guinea. The delegation believes that progress could be assisted by increased strategic government funding into health and education services and into programs to improve the skills base of its people.


Importantly, the delegation also heard about the work being undertaken to assist victims of gender based violence by one of the eight family and sexual violence units established across Papua New Guinea as a result of funding from the Australia government under the PNG-Australia Law and Justice Partnership. In addition, programs to assist in supporting victims of family and sexual violence and programs to assist in women's empowerment are expected to improve societal attitudes and meet global development goals. There is currently a high level of foreign investment in Papua New Guinea which is expected to also make a sustained positive impact on the economy and which the government of Papua New Guinea is best placed to divest by establishing mechanisms for national wealth sharing. 


I would like to thank all those who gave their time to meet the delegation to discuss issues of mutual interest to Australia and Papua New Guinea. I would also like to thank Her Excellency Deborah Stokes, Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea; Ms Margaret Adamson, the deputy head of mission at the High Commission, and AusAID officers who assisted and accompanied the delegation during its visit to Papua New Guinea. I also thank Stephanie Mikac of the Papua New Guinea secretariat, who supported our visit and our report. I thank the members of the delegation; I love it when we work so well together across the parties. I know this delegation was absolutely committed to seeing Papua New Guinea prosper. I commend the report to the House.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:40):  I am delighted to speak to this report as a member of the parliamentary delegation to Papua New Guinea and, importantly, as someone who holds a firm belief that Australia's international diplomacy would be well served by a significantly increased focus on our region. I believe that the best use of our resources, knowledge and support is in assisting our regional friends and neighbours. In difficult economic times we can achieve so much more in our own backyard. These views are reinforced by my visits to Papua New Guinea—a good friend and a good ally.


The links between our nations are not merely the links of geography. The link that highlights our closeness is the friendship between people. From the desperate days of World War 2, when Papua New Guineans stood steadfastly beside us, to the ready support demonstrated by PNG's response to our requests for assistance on Manus Island, to the thousands of students educated in Australia, these links have helped to define our relationship. Yes, Australia has provided substantial assistance to PNG over the years, but the point I make is that it is not a one-way street. I know from my own experience of the importance of friendships made by PNG students and their Australian classmates going back over generations at schools like Marist Brothers Ashgrove, Brisbane Boys College and St Peter's, in my electorate of Ryan. In Australia there is a great saying: mates look after mates. The people of Papua New Guinea have been strong and true mates for generations, always there to support us—and that is something that we should never forget.


It is against this background that we should recognise that the time has come for Australia and PNG to build a relationship as one of equals, of good friends who come to the table to work together for our mutual benefit. What is good for Papua New Guinea is good for Australia. Together as friends we need to shift our relationship to one of economic and social partnership, particularly as PNG has already set out on the journey of managing an increasingly strong economy built on resources but showing genuine awareness of the importance of health, education, infrastructure and, importantly, the status of women. The delegation's visit reinforced that view.


I am not saying that PNG is without problems. It faces all the challenges of a developing country and it is essential that we provide our ongoing support as PNG builds on its vigorous democracy and strong national institutions to fight the challenges that beset developing countries across the globe: the challenges of corruption, the challenges of geographic isolation of many of their people, continuing violence against women and unequal economic development, as well as successful completion of the peace process in Bougainville.


Our meetings on this visit with PNG leaders such as Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato and Treasurer Don Polye and with Prime Minister Peter O'Neill on my previous visits demonstrated the fact that the leadership of Papua New Guinea has more firsthand experience and knowledge of Australia than many of our leaders do of PNG. Simply put, PNG leaders often come to Australia without hoopla and fanfare. On our side, apart from a few, our visits tend to be short and formal. I have been joined on visits at various times by the members for Herbert and Kooyong and Senator Ian Macdonald. Of course, the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the Hon. Julie Bishop, has met frequently with PNG leaders both here and in Papua New Guinea. She has a real understanding of our relationship and where it should go. I also make special mention of member for Macquarie, Louise Markus, who has a special understanding of Papua New Guinea and the former Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, Richard Marles, who is very well respected.


As I have noted previously in this place, the most telling point of this visit was the renewed sense of optimism that I found in Papua New Guinea. Today I wish to acknowledge the importance of visits like this—and, indeed, on this occasion, it coincided with Australia Week and a very thought provoking speech by the Reverend Tim Costello. Like the speaker before me, the member for Newcastle, I wish to acknowledge the support and assistance of the Australian High Commissioner to PNG, Deborah Stokes, and her staff, who assisted with our trip. It is only by getting to know our friends and by understanding their challenges and achievements that we can best build the informed and effective relationship that true friendship demands.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (10:45):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I present the committee's report, entitled Troubled waters: inquiry into the arrangements surrounding crimes committed at sea, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr PERRETT:
  by leave—many Australians will recall the tragic death of Dianne Brimble in 2002 on board a P&O cruise ship. I again pass on my condolences to all of her family. The New South Wales coroner found that Ms Brimble's death was caused by the effects of a drug administered by a known person. Despite numerous prosecutions, no manslaughter convictions or custodial sentences were imposed in relation to her death. One underlying reason for this was P&O's failure to properly secure the crime scene after her death. Despite our inquiry, Australians learnt of another tragedy occurring on a cruise ship just last month. Paul Rossington and Kristen Schroder fell overboard 15 hours before vessel staff were alerted to their disappearance. Their disappearance is not considered suspicious, but it underlines the importance of safety measures on cruise ships to prevent tragedies from occurring.


Although the industry is now better equipped to respond to crimes committed at sea and despite the complications of international law, there is more for the industry and for the Australian government to do. Where Australia has jurisdiction under international law, the committee has recommended the Australian government act to make cruising safer and to ensure justice for victims of crimes on cruises. Where Australia does not have jurisdiction, the committee has made clear recommendations about Australia working harder at the international level to bring about an improvement in the industry.


The committee recommended that Australia introduce a mandatory crime reporting regime as well as crime scene management protocols which cruise operators would need to comply with in order to access Australian ports. The report also makes the case for Australia to pursue much stronger action within the International Maritime Organization, the international body charged with developing the laws that regulate maritime conduct. This should focus on matters like closed-circuit television systems; man-overboard detection systems, which is a developing technology; and, importantly, a responsible service of alcohol code. We have also recommended the enactment of legislation requiring cruise operators to provide passengers boarding vessels in Australia with information about protecting their safety, as well as information about crisis services and their rights when accidents or crimes occur—and let us hope they do not.


Finally, and on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to Mr Mark Brimble, the former husband of Dianne Brimble, whom we met with and from whom we heard evidence in the inquiry. Mark fought for years to ensure that justice was served for Dianne's death, and he has made an enormous contribution to the safety of all cruise passengers, not just in Australia but all around the world. He, along with the chair of the International Cruise Victims Association, Mr Kendall Carver, gave invaluable assistance to the inquiry, and their evidence has been crucial to the committee's deliberations and to this report. Mark Brimble's tireless and unwavering commitment to justice and to the safety of all cruise passengers has been inspirational to many people, and, on behalf of all Australians, I again thank him for his steadfastness. 


I would also like to thank the secretariat: the secretary, Dr Anna Dacre, whom I see is in the chamber and whom it has been a great pleasure to work with in this parliament and the 42nd Parliament; the inquiry secretaries, Natalya Wells, who has since gone on to different waters, and Thomas Gregory, who compiled most of the report; and senior researchers Dr John White and Ms Lauren Wilson.


I would also like to thank all of the social policy and legal affairs committee. I would particularly like to thank the deputy chair, the member for Pearce, who I do not think is going to be able to speak on behalf of the opposition. This is a unanimous report from the committee. I would particularly like to thank the member for Pearce for her great contribution to the committee throughout the last three years. She has been a pleasure to work with. I wish her well in her future endeavours. I commend this report to the House.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports—Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts) (11:22):  I present reports of the delegation of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to Timor-Leste and Indonesia. I present this report as leader of the delegation and not as Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts. 


The principal purpose of the delegation's visit, which took place between 7 and 11 November 2011, was to meet and conduct discussions with counterpart committees in the national parliaments of Indonesia and Timor-Leste. In doing so, the committee sought to deepen the connection with members of these parliaments and to help build Australia's relationship with Indonesia and Timor-Leste.


The visit followed the proposal made by the Presiding Officers in 2008 for an exchange program with the foreign affairs committee of the Indonesian parliament, Komisi I, and was first recommended in the committee's report on its major inquiry into Australia's relationship with Indonesia, entitled Near neighbours—good neighbours.The Near neighbours report noted that such meetings would represent a 'valuable connection' between the foreign affairs committees of both parliaments and would allow for both parties to air concerns, exchange viewpoints and, on occasions, clarify misunderstandings. The delegation's visit provided exactly this opportunity for connections between parliamentarians to be established or renewed, concerns to be aired and viewpoints to be exchanged. 


In Indonesia, the committee held discussions with the chair and members of Komisi I—or Commission I—the Indonesian parliament's committee on foreign affairs and defence, and Commission VI, the committee on trade investment and industry. Our discussions traversed issues such as the suspension of live cattle exports, Indonesia's recently passed State Intelligence Law and de-radicalisation across the archipelago, the people-smuggling issue and the positive role Indonesia aspires to play in developments in the Middle East, particularly as a model for a successful transition to democracy. Encouragingly, Indonesia's counterparts stated with confidence that, although the presidential election in 2014 may be more of a test for the country's nascent democracy than other recent elections, there was, 'No road back to the authoritarian past.' The delegation was pleased to note that, despite the irritants which arise from time to time, the relationship with Indonesia is now of such breadth and depth that it can withstand such challenges. 


Nevertheless, the delegation is of the view that the Australian government should, at all times, adopt a respectful communication and dialogue with both Indonesia and Timor Leste. In Timor Leste, the committee held discussions with the chair and many members of Commission B—the parliament's committee on foreign affairs, defence and national security. Issues included maritime security and illegal fishing, the development of the Greater Sunrise oil and gas fields, Timor Leste's need for foreign investment, employment and other challenges. Discussions were held in a very respectful atmosphere, and I think the people in the committee were very pleased that we had come to them. Among the other appointments, the committee had the honour of meeting the President of Timor Leste, his excellency Jose Ramos-Horta. The president spoke very candidly to us, including about priorities of Australia's development assistance, greater access for the Timorese people to our Seasonal Worker Program and full vocational training in Australia, which would be clearly welcomed, as expressed by him, as would assistance to encourage investment in ongoing defence and police training support.


I am pleased to note that, following the visit, the committee commenced an inquiry into Australia's relationship with Timor Leste. This is timely, as the UN mandate has now expired and the Australian-led International Stabilisation Force recently departed the country. It is an appropriate time to be recasting the relationship in Timor Leste's post-independence era. In both Timor Leste and Indonesia, the delegation was pleased to be able to visit a number of aid projects funded by Australia, such as sanitation projects in Indonesia, and support for agriculture, water and food initiatives in Timor Leste. These projects are manifestly assisting in their respective country's development and improving the lives of ordinary people. Our assistance helps create tremendous goodwill towards Australia in these countries. A theme which emerged in both Timor Leste and Indonesia was that Australia's trade and investment relationship with both countries is seriously underdone, particularly given the significance of the broader relationship between our countries. The delegation believes that this issue must be given greater attention. 


On behalf of the delegation, I thank our counterparts in the parliaments of Timor Leste and Indonesia, who made time to hold constructive discussions with us. I also thank our ambassadors, their staff and the officials of various government agencies stationed in Indonesia and Timor Leste for their invaluable assistance. I also thank the secretary of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Mr Jerome Brown.


The delegation hopes that the exchanges between foreign affairs, defence and trade committees in Australia, Indonesia and Timor Leste will take place on a regular basis and continue to assist with the strengthening of bonds of friendship and facilitating greater understanding between our countries. There is probably nothing more important for Australia than our relationship with Indonesia, in particular. They are an enormous nation of tens of millions of people, mainly of the Muslim faith, and it is no coincidence that we have good and peaceful relations with them. Any moves to jeopardise that ought to be taken very seriously by the Australian people.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (11:28):  On indulgence, I would also like to speak on the outcomes of the delegation, which I had the privilege of joining between 7 and 11 November 2011. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade visited Timor Leste and Indonesia in order to have discussions with their national parliamentarians and to deepen the connection and understanding between our respective countries. The visit to Indonesia followed shortly after the suspension of the Northern Australian live cattle trade with Indonesia, and during the focus on the plight of young Indonesian fishermen who had been manning people smuggler vessels and have consequently ended up in detention in Australia, hence there was an expectation of lively discussion. We were pleased to find that, notwithstanding these serious matters, such is the strength of our relationship with Indonesia, with our counterparts as members of parliament and officials, that we were able to continue our dialogue quite openly on these, as well as a range of other important matters. These included our trade relationships, our foreign aid contributions, human rights and democracy, climate change responses, counter-terrorism initiatives and the development of the justice sector.


In Timor Leste, we were briefed on the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections. We were particularly concerned that we could support them with volunteers or observers as they aim to have a free and transparent election.


We also wanted to talk about the exiting of the UN personnel, given that the UN mandate was expiring shortly, the country's development challenges and the efficacy of Australia's foreign aid contributions. We are in fact Timor-Leste's largest bilateral aid donor, contributing the equivalent of A$104.2 million in 2011-12. In the period from 1999 to June 2011, Australia donated $1.04 billion in emergency and developmental aid to Timor-Leste, so clearly it is most important that that aid is properly targeted and that it responds to the greatest needs of the country.


When in Timor-Leste, we were able to also focus on our combined efforts to combat illegal fishing, and to promote tourism and education exchanges. We looked very carefully at the recent investments in some fishing vessels and, as we stood on the wharf and heard about the trials and tribulations associated with manning those vessels and having the resources to combat illegal fishing, we shared their concerns, including the fact that the pillaging of their fisheries, a rich natural resource, needs to be addressed urgently. In addition, they need greater support to develop their great diving prospects for tourism, and education exchanges between our two countries need to continue, as we were able to see how valuable they could be.


We were keen to hear how the country aims to meet the challenge of having some 50 per cent of its population under 19, given the poverty, poor nutrition and unemployment or underemployment that typically impacts on the smaller populations away from the capital of Dili. There were also issues to be discussed in relation to the Greater Sunrise gas fields resource and associated infrastructure, a matter of great interest to both of our countries. We had full and frank discussions about the location of that infrastructure and how Timor-Leste intended to make sure that the royalties flowing from their gas fields are used for the betterment of future generations, not just for the here and now.


One of the highlights of the time I had in Timor-Leste was when I went with the deputy chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade—that is, the member for Gilmore, Ms Jo Gash—up to a very small village which had received support from some of her own constituents in the form of solar energy panels. Despite the very poor soils and low-level subsistence agriculture that was sustaining that village, they met us with a huge feast and some beautiful woven tokens of their friendship. The children sang songs and the leaders of the village made impassioned speeches. As the rain fell down gently, I could not help but remember how generous those communities had been in the Second World War, when they helped our soldiers to hide and then counter the Japanese invasion. These small villages continue to have real issues with poor nutrition, and the stunting of their children's growth is evident. It was an important delegation. (Time expired)

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (11:33):  The rest of the world has moved to ethanol, and once again Australia is wildly out of step with the rest of the world. I hold up here, and I am quite happy to table, a map which shows all the Americas, with the exception of a tiny little piece up here—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Owens
):  The member for Kennedy has made his point with the map.




Mr KATTER:
  are under ethanol, and all of Europe, China, India, South-East Asia and even half of Africa. In fact, the only country on earth without ethanol outside the Middle Eastern and Russian oil-producing areas is Australia. The only country on earth without ethanol is Australia.


The Americans are the biggest producers of ethanol in the world now by a long way. They are much bigger than Brazil. Their original ethanol bill was not for renewable energy and not to help their farmers but was a health bill. It was the air quality control bill in the United States which first introduced ethanol right across all of America. Mr Iemma, former ALP Premier for New South Wales and probably one of the few people with a sense of decency in politics in Australia today sadly has left politics. He said he could not go another day having upon his conscience the death of hundreds of people in his state that did not have to die.


What precipitated the action in the United States was the lung cancer cardiopulmonary mortality and long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution report that was done in California. The graph is here for all to see. When there is a doubling of motor vehicle emissions, there is a doubling of the death rate from lung cancer and other lung and heart diseases. To quote the head of the AMA:



More people die from motor vehicle emissions in this country than die from motor vehicle accidents.


I find it silly for me to get up in this place and talk about farm suicides. No-one cares. It is silly for me to get up and say that maybe 2,000 people die in Sydney and Melbourne every year that simply do not have to die. Only one leader in this country in recent history has acted upon that matter. The LNP, to their shame, almost halved the 10 per cent in New South Wales down to 6½ per cent.


The reduction gives you some indication of a reduction in the dangerous emissions. I think there are 23 reports in the US Congressional Library and 21 of them say that it is around 28 per cent reduction in CO2. I emphasise that I am not particularly worried about the CO2 but I am very worried about the deadly emissions that are associated coming out of motor vehicles. If CO2 is reduced by 28 per cent, clearly the other emissions are going to be reduced as well.


In the case of sugar cane, it is more like 72 per cent. Those figures vary dramatically. If you are burning cane, obviously you get more. For those who are worried about CO2 in this place, my party holds to the position that there is a problem that will arise in the oceans so there should be some restraints on CO2, but also massive restraints because you burn ethanol and CO2 goes up, you burn petrol and CO2 goes up. The huge difference in the case of ethanol is that the grain and sugar cane pull it back down again next year, so it is just going up and down like a yoyo. It does not go up there and stay up there.


I addressed a meeting in Meridian in Western Australia of 1,063 people from the grains industry in Australia. They were grain growers in a desperate plight. I know many of my friends in the grain industry are up against the wall. In the sugar industry, even though we have had good prices for the last three or four years, the long-term outlook for sugar is dreadful. We have sold all of our sugar mills and they would never have done that if they saw long-term future in the industry.


We also have a dreadful situation where maybe 200,000, 300,000 or 400,000 head of cattle are going to die of starvation. If this was America that situation would not exist, because they now produce over 100 million tonnes of super high-grade feed called distillers grain. It is a by-product of the ethanol industry in the United States. I have information for those who say, 'We can't replace fuel production with food production; people will starve.' The American report I am holding—and this is also in the Australian report, that coloured document—says that one tonne of distillers grain replaces 1.22 tonnes of corn. In actual fact, we end up with more feed from distillers grain. The reason for that is that the starch is removed, so you have an infinitely more valuable product. You can put dead grass in with this product and get an outcome which is almost as if you are lot feeding. When ethanol came in there was said to be a 15 per cent improvement in grain prices. It was tremendously helpful for the grains industry, and we look forward to the same outcome in the grains industry in Australia. 


In the sugarcane industry about 60 per cent of Brazil's production went into ethanol, not sugar. We went into sugar. For something like 11 years, we were on $274 a tonne whilst half of Brazil's production was on over $400 a tonne. They were murdering us in the international marketplace. We worked at a loss for a period of 11 years in that industry. Most of my growers will never get out of the debt was incurred in those years. 


No-one seems to be particularly worried in this country that we have, probably, one of the lowest self-sufficiencies in petrol of any advanced country on earth. We went from a position where we had 90 per cent self-sufficiency some six or seven years ago, and now we are down around 35 per cent. I will not take the time of the House to pull out the graph, but the graph is there. The federal government's bureau of resources graph indicates that we are at about 35 per cent self-sufficiency now.


Every year we send $19.5 billion overseas to the Middle East oil-producing countries. The United States is no longer sending their $230 billion. They will be self-sufficient in oil. Instead of sending that $230 billion to the Middle East, that money will go into the American economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a government that was a little bit enlightened here and that would take that $20 billion and put it into rural Australia, where it would yield enormous benefits for us! But, no—we send it over to the Middle East. It is incompetence on a grand level. When I filled up my motor car in Sao Paulo it was 74c a litre in Australian dollars. When I filled it up in Minnesota in the United States it was 84c a litre. Why? Because those two countries have ethanol, which is considerably cheaper than the price at which you can buy oil anywhere in the world. When I came back to Australia it was $1.39 a litre. In our sugar mills we can produce electricity for virtually nothing. Cheap electricity, cheap petrol— (Time expired)

Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (11:44):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment I wish to make a statement on the current committee inquiry into the role of the technical and further education system and its operation.


On Thursday, 21 March 2013 the committee adopted an inquiry into the TAFE system referred to it by the minister for tertiary education. The committee received 172 submissions from interested individuals and organisations and in excess of 1,000 responses to a Unions Australia organised survey. The committee held an initial public hearing in Canberra with the Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education. A further hearing was conducted in Brisbane on 7 June 2013, at which key stakeholders, including TAFE Directors Australia, appeared and roundtable discussions were held with employer and industry associations, community organisations and unions.


TAFEs have played a critical role in the training and development of Australians for more than 100 years. For many Australians, TAFEs provide a critical pathway to training and skills, which are needed to access real employment. They also play a critical role in regions and in providing access for disadvantaged groups. As TAFE Directors Australia board member, Kaylene Harth, stated at the committee's hearing in Brisbane:




The quality of the qualification, the usefulness and applicability of the qualification once issued, is really its value in the workplace and how it helps position the individual in getting greater skills that can be applied in the workplace.



The inquiry comes at a time of significant change in the VET systems of states across Australia. All governments have agreed to reform the system through the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development and the National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform to respond better to the changing needs of the Australian economy and the increasing need for highly skilled workers. The department noted that the continued role of the public provider—TAFE institutes—is central to our national training system.


This committee heard students, teachers and school administrators alike express concerns about their public providers being placed under enormous financial pressures and strains. Unfortunately, the committee has not had as much time as it would have liked to examine the topic, with the inquiry coming to the committee only a few months before the end of sittings of this parliament. This problem with time constraints, along with the heavy workload of bills referred to the committee for inquiry, has not allowed the committee to really get its teeth into this very important area of further education. I am of the strong opinion that the inquiry should be rereferred in the next parliament to this committee's successor so that it may receive the complete consideration that it deserves.


As this will be the last statement I will make as Chair of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues for the commitment and enthusiasm they have shown in the committee's varied inquiries in this 43rd Parliament. I would particularly like to thank the deputy chair, the member for Grey, who has been on this committee as long as I have, and the former chair of the committee, the member for Kingston, Amanda Rishworth, for their dedicated work and tireless efforts. I would also like to thank the very hard-working and professional staff of the committee secretariat, who are in the chamber today, including the committee secretary, Glenn Worthington; the inquiry secretary, Siobhan Leyne; the previous inquiry secretary, Sara Edson; senior researcher Lauren Wilson; research officer Casey Mazzarella; administration officer Emily Costelloe; and a whole host of others who have helped committee do its job through this period of time. Each and every one has been an absolute pleasure to work with, and their services have proven to be invaluable.


Education and employment are vital to the economic prosperity, national productivity and social fabric of Australia. The committee's program of the 43rd Parliament has been challenging and rewarding, varied and complex, and it has made a valuable contribution to work this House. I thank the House.

Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (11:57):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report for 2013 relating to referrals made May 2013. 


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms LIVERMORE:
  by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of 2013, addressing referrals made 2013. This report deals with two referrals, with an estimated total cost of $115.9 million. The first inquiry examined the development and construction of housing for Defence at Warner in Brisbane, Queensland. The project cost is $91.3 million. The project will develop land for housing construction and Defence Housing Australia will build 130 dwellings for Defence members and their families. The 355 other residential allotments will be sold to the general public. The committee was assured that Defence Housing Australia and its contracted consultants have undertaken the appropriate risk assessments in determining that the filling works for tranche 2 of the Warner site are appropriate. The committee is satisfied with this project and recommends that it proceed.


The second inquiry examined the redevelopment and construction of housing for Defence at Sandford road, Enoggera, also in Brisbane, Queensland. The project cost is $24.6 million. The project will demolish the current seven two-storey brick and weatherboard town houses, which are outdated and do not meet Defence guidelines. Defence Housing Australia will then construct seven new townhouses and 48 apartments, all to be occupied by Defence members and their families. The site adjoins Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera. The committee was impressed with the proposed design and congratulates Defence Housing Australia on maximising the use of such a valuable piece of land adjacent to Gallipoli Barracks.


The committee is satisfied with this project and recommends that it proceed. I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries. This is the last report for the 43rd Parliament. During this parliament the committee has completed 47 inquiries with a total value of over $5.8 billion. I have been chair of the committee for the last ten inquiries and have been fortunate enough to step into the role with the committee already having a well-established bipartisan approach to its scrutiny of public works.


I thank the previous chair, the member for Page, for paving the way with her excellent work as chair. I also thank all other members of the committee for their dedication. I also take this chance to thank the committee secretariat, Dr Alison Clegg, Anthony Overs and Fiona Gardner, for their professionalism and for the good-natured way that they kept us focussed on our tasks as we travelled around Australia. Finally, I acknowledge the contributions made by the member for Mallee to the work of this committee. The member for Mallee has been a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for the majority of his parliamentary career going back to 1996 and his dedication and integrity have been invaluable. His expertise, enthusiasm and corporate memory will be sorely missed and I wish him well for his post-parliamentary life. I commend the report to the House.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (13:52):  As a member of parliament I regularly receive many petitions. However, 7 May, I must confess, was the first time that a petition was delivered to me on horseback. My colleague Senator Ronaldson, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, and I received this petition with 10,200 signatures, calling on the federal government to support a national Boer War memorial on Anzac Parade in Canberra, to honour the 23,000 men and women of Australia who served our country in the Boer War; some 1,000 of whom gave their lives. I particularly want to pay tribute to Vietnam veteran and Boer War veteran descendant Lieutenant Colonel Miles Farmer OAM, and Captain Mike Fitzgerald, who, in Boer War Light Horse uniform and with his horse 'Boy', came from Sydney especially to present the petition. Like many other families, I have a special interest, as my great-uncle, Major Edmund Righetti, volunteered as a private to join the Victorian first contingent to go to the Boer War in 1899. 


Sadly, there is still no national memorial to honour those who fought so courageously in this battle, which marks the birth of the Australian Defence Force which has served our country so well these past 110 years. Those involved in this conflict deserve to be remembered with a fitting memorial. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you join me in urging everyone here to support this project. I seek leave to present an out-of-order petition. There is one wrong word; that is why I need to seek leave to present it.


Leave granted.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I move:


That the House record its deep regret at the death on 22 June 2013 of Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird MG while on combat operations in Afghanistan, place on record its appreciation of his service to his country and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


On Saturday the opposition leader and I joined other guests just outside Yungaburra on Queensland's Tinaburra Peninsula. It is a place the Leader of the Opposition and I have been before. We went there for Ben Chuck's funeral. Following Ben Chuck's funeral his parents, Gordon and Susan, have worked hard, alongside other family members, for those lost in Afghanistan to create a beautiful memorial to those lost. It will be an avenue of honour where 39 trees have already been planted in tribute. There is a memorial statue there and a memorial board. It is a place of remarkable physical beauty and it has been wonderfully done. Many family members were in attendance on that day for the opening of the memorial and you could see, particularly as they walked forward to lay a floral tribute to their lost family member, the grief that is still wracking those individuals. You could see a lot of grief but you could see a lot of pride in service too. 


Remarkably, as that service was coming to an end the first news was coming through that had been more death and more wounding in Afghanistan. These are always cruel things to hear but in that moment it seemed particularly cruel to hear this news. It was a reminder that our work in Afghanistan is not yet over. There is work to do and there is still danger and there is still risk. So today we move a motion of condolence for the person who will have the 40th tree planted at that memorial, the 40th Australian who has died in our name in Afghanistan. His name is Corporal Cameron Baird and he was 32 years old when he died. Cameron was in the Australian Army for most of his adult life. He died a young man. Corporal Baird was a soldier from the Sydney-based 2 Commando Regiment. In 11 years in uniform Corporal Baird served in Afghanistan on five tours and served in Iraq and in Timor Leste. The Chief of the Defence Force said yesterday in paying tribute that his mates describe him as one of the most iconic figures in the regiment. This is truly extraordinary praise in a unit with so many fine soldiers home to some of our most elite fighting forces and in a unit which has paid such a high price in our action in Afghanistan. 


Four years ago Corporal Baird won the Medal for Gallantry. As members of the House would know, that is one of the highest military honours that anybody can win. Four years ago he won that Medal for Gallantry; two days ago Corporal Baird lost his life. At approximately 3 pm Saturday Canberra time Cameron Baird, from Burnie in Tasmania, was killed in action in a valley in Afghanistan where he was fighting to disrupt an insurgent network targeting our area of responsibility in the Uruzgan province. He is survived by his parents, his brother and his partner. They will never forget him and we will never forget him. We offer our most sincere condolences to his family.


At the same time an Australian Special Forces soldier was seriously wounded. He is now recovering from those wounds but our thoughts are with him as he undergoes that recovery and with his family, who have learned of his wounding and will be by his side as he does recover. A Royal Australian Air Force airman operating with the joint terminal attack control team was also wounded. His wounds are of a more minor nature but our thoughts are with him too. Our thoughts are with that Special Forces soldier and that airman as they recover. Our thoughts are also with their comrades who were with them when this death and wounding occurred. 


It is a very sad day for this parliament, Speaker, a very sad day for the Australian nation, and I know every member will be offering their most sincere condolences. We best honour our loss in the spirit we see from the families whenever we have the privilege of seeing them gather together and their spirit is always one of wanting us to honour their sacrifice by seeing the mission through.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:06):  I rise to support the words of the Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister has noted, when the avenue of honour at Yungaburra was opened on Saturday we hoped there would be no further additions to it. Before the opening was complete that hope had been dashed. Corporal Cameron Baird is our 40th casualty. He was from the 2nd Commando Regiment. He was on his fifth tour of Afghanistan. The Defence Force chief, David Hurley, described him as someone who in combat as a team commander was the man to watch, never happier than when the situation demanded decisive action and courage. We grieve for his family, we grieve for the other two Australians wounded in the same incident.


This death is a reminder that it is a difficult and dangerous mission in which our forces are engaged in Afghanistan. We owe it to the Afghan people; we owe it to ourselves; we owe it to our soldiers, particularly those who have paid the highest possible price; and we owe it to the values for which this nation stands not to flag in that mission.

Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (14:07):  I rise to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing condolence to the family, friends and mates of Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird. He is survived by his parents, his brother and his partner.


Corporal Baird is our 40th fatality in Afghanistan, our first this year and our first since October last year. As the Prime Minister indicated, in the course of the battle in which he was fatally wounded, two other Australian soldiers were wounded, bringing to 256 the number of Australian soldiers wounded in Afghanistan, 10 this year.


As our 40th fatality, his death will of course be a tragic reminder to 39 other Australian families. He was a Medal for Gallantry recipient from the 2nd Commando Regiment at Holsworthy. Our Special Operations Task Group has paid a heavy price and the commandos have paid a heavy price for their great work in Afghanistan. Corporal Baird is the 20th fatality from our Special Operations Task Group, the 12th from the 2nd Commando Regiment. He was on his fifth tour of Afghanistan, following upon tours in Iraq and Timor-Leste. As both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said, he was regarded as an iconic figure at Holsworthy and an iconic figure of the commandos. As the Chief of the Defence Force said and as the Leader of the Opposition quoted the chief over the weekend: 'When there was action, he was the man to watch and he was never happier than when the situation demanded someone to take decisive action.' And that was certainly the case when he received his Medal for Gallantry. 


For those families who gathered together with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Chief of the Defence Force on Saturday afternoon in North Queensland, the news on Sunday morning would have been particularly distressing for them. Our thoughts were with them on Saturday afternoon when I spoke to the chief and the Prime Minister, and also on Sunday again.


This is a terrible blow to Corporal Baird's family and a terrible blow to the commandos. On Wednesday last week I, along with the shadow minister for defence science and personnel and the Governor-General, attended Holsworthy to mark the awarding to the commandos of the Eastern Shah Wali Kot battle honour, the first battle honour to be awarded to an Army regiment since the Vietnam War, such is the contribution that the commandos and their members have made to Afghanistan.


Corporal Baird's death underlines that Afghanistan continues to be difficult and dangerous. The risk may have changed but, nonetheless, the risk remains, particularly for our special forces. Transition to Afghan-led security responsibility in Uruzgan has commenced and is on track. Our main base in Tarin Kot will be closed by the end of the year and around 1,000 Australian soldiers will return home at that time. The transition to Afghan-led responsibility for security across all of Afghanistan has also started with the formal, final tranche of transition occurring last week. All of the districts in all of the 34 provinces in Afghanistan are now subject to Afghan National Security Force responsibility.


Our condolences go to Corporal Baird's family, his friends and his mates. His contribution and his sacrifice and that of the commandos will never be forgotten. Lest we forget.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (14:11):  I join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and Minister for Defence to honour a fallen commando, Corporal Cameron Baird MG, who was tragically killed in action whilst serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan.


Corporal Baird MG is the 20th member of the SOTG to fall in combat in Afghanistan. Our elite soldiers have paid a disproportionate price. But note this: of these 20 exceptional souls, 10 have been special force patrol commandos, including Corporal Baird MG. It is both extraordinary and understandable that half of our special forces fallen have been battlefield commanders. For that is the Australian way: our warriors have always led from the front. When Corporal Baird won his Medal for Gallantry, in 2007, it was for displaying complete disregard for his own safety, when he led his team forward under heavy fire to recover a mortally wounded team member. Like all our fallen SF commanders, Corporal Baird was disciplined but young. His was not a vocation but a calling. He was physically and mentally tough, yet vulnerable, as they who lead from the front always are. Such a leader is never a number; he is more than a rank. He, like them all, lived life free of the fear of death, because death was their daily companion. He faced it unflinchingly to the end.


Like Spartans before him, he and his ilk rarely worried about the number of the enemy; they simply worried about where they were. Such valour can never be taken; these men own it, such as the special forces commanders, who always lead from the front, and such as Corporal Baird MG. Lest we forget.



The SPEAKER:  As a mark of respect, I invite honourable members to signify their approval by rising in their places.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:14):  by leave—on a very different matter, I move:


That this House mark the 25th anniversary of this parliament building, honour those responsible for its design and construction, and thank all those parliamentarians and parliamentary staff who have served the nation during that time.


In moving this motion I acknowledge that this is a new building but one which stands on very old country. So I begin by honouring the traditional owners, the first people to meet and confer on this land.


Today we celebrate this building, this building which rises from that ancient soil to tower over this city. The competition for this building was held in 1979 and we could easily have acquired a brutalist structure that would have dated and faded with the decades. Instead, our nation has been blessed with a monumental building of grace, a building of character and of quality and a place that will endure.


Writing in 1914, Walter Burley Griffin said that this structure would be the foremost building of the Commonwealth, and in this masterpiece his vision for our nation's capital has been triumphantly realised. It was, of course, the work of Romaldo Giurgola, one of the post-war era's finest architects, and this is his finest work. It is to be deeply regretted that he was too unwell to join the ceremony this morning to mark the 25 years of this building. Aldo came to love this country so much that he joined our national family, and we do regret that he is not here in person.


Like Griffin, Aldo Giurgola was an American architect who saw from afar the possibilities of this site. Aldo had designed many buildings, including office towers, museums and libraries, but this was something apart, as he well recognised when he said:


… if Australia’s new Parliament House was to speak honestly about its purpose, it could not be built on top of the hill as this would symbolise government imposed upon the people.


The building should nest with the hill, symbolically rise out of the Australian landscape, as true democracy rises from the state of things.


A House of the people for government of, by and for the people.


But this was not the work of one man alone. From the beginning this edifice was a partnership between architects and designers, tradespeople and labourers, stonemasons and weavers, planners and public servants: 10,000 people in all, who worked on or for this site. To all of them, from the most senior architect to the most junior apprentice, go our nation's thanks. Your work on this building really is one of those stories to tell your grandchildren.


When the Queen opened this parliament a quarter of a century ago she said that this building was a confident expression of Australia's faith in parliamentary democracy. Now, 25 years on, we are so at ease in this building that we do not call this the 'New Parliament House' anymore. It is just 'Parliament House'. In fact, its predecessor down the hill is now 'Old Parliament House', and is currently fulfilling its third career as a museum of the democracy that we honour today.


Like the old one, this Parliament House now has a history of its own: great national moments, like the passage of the Native Title Act and the Apology; state visits, like those of presidents Bush—father and son—Clinton, Hu Jintao and Obama; and the daily school visits that do not get recorded but which stay in a child's heart forever.


But mainly this is a working parliament, a building where democracy has its daily expression—what Bob Hawke called:


… the forum for our differences and the instrument of our unity.


So I pay tribute to you, Speaker, to your colleague, the President in the other place, and to all our colleagues on both sides of both houses. I especially pay tribute to the happy few who have served in both the 'Old Parliament House' and in the new. I am thinking here, of course, of the former minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock, the members for Scullin, Mackellar, Fisher and Lingiari, and our colleague on the red leather benches, Senator Ron Boswell.


Above all, I want to pay tribute to every member of the parliamentary staff who nurture and sustain this building. Sustaining the operation of this building takes a community of workers the size of a small town. It is a job that you do with pride, and this place shines with the result of your pride every day.


We care for this place, ultimately, not because of what it is but what it stands for. This is a House of freedom—freedom hard won and jealously kept, because that freedom belongs to all Australians. So this building belongs to all Australians. No citizen can be a stranger in this place. It is a home worthy of our democracy. It is the fourth place our parliament has sat, and it will be the last. This is our democracy's enduring home, superbly designed, lovingly maintained and a gift to the nation that it symbolises and serves so well.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:22):  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I would have to say it is not an unexpected one. To the Leader of the Opposition: what I am proud of is that I have led a government focused on jobs and growth, and what of course we have seen under this government is jobs continuing to be created for working Australians, opportunities for themselves and their families to make a life—a focus on jobs and growth. That focus on jobs and growth has informed our budget strategy. Yes, we have made billions of dollars of responsible savings—more than $40 billion in the last budget alone—but we have focused our economic strategy, our budget strategy, so that there will be more jobs. We do not accept the Leader of the Opposition's plan to cut to the bone and to drive our economy into an economic standstill and to cost people jobs.


At the same time we are investing in the sources of growth for the future. We have a strong economy, but it is one undergoing a number of transitions: a transition from the peak of the investment boom in mining to the peak of the production boom; a transition as we look to seize the opportunities that will come from growth and change in our region of the world; a transition as information technology remakes our age; a transition as the world tackles climate change and moves to decouple economic growth from growth in carbon pollution. On these things the government I lead has a very proud track record.


We are the political party committed to investing in the future: investing in the National Broadband Network so our nation is not left behind; investing in traditional infrastructure so that there are no blockages which prevent us from seizing the opportunities of this century; investing in our relationships in the region so that those opportunities flow to our country; ensuring that we price carbon in the most efficient way, the way that former Prime Minister John Howard believed in getting it done, so that we can grow our economy without growing carbon pollution; and, most importantly of all, having the faith that if you invest in the skills and capacities of the Australian people you inevitably build a stronger, smarter and fairer country. That is what our early childhood agenda has been about, and more apprenticeships and traineeships than ever before, more university places than ever before, including places for poorer children, and now, this week, ensuring that through this parliament we see a new way of funding and improving Australia's schools because they are our future. I am proud of that track record and we will be pushing to deliver on it for the future. (Time expired)

Mr MURPHY
 (Reid) (16:37):  From this side of the House and on indulgence, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the member for Mallee on his valedictory speech. I know that I can sincerely say that the member for Mallee is a much loved and widely respected member of this chamber and I congratulate, you, Member for Mallee, on your service to your electorate and your service to this chamber. 


I have had the great privilege and honour of working with you on committees and I also congratulate you on your service to this nation. I hope that you and Pam in your future endeavours succeed in everything that you set out to do and, when you finally depart public life, may you and Pam have a long, happy and healthy retirement. Well done.


On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Broadcasting Legislation, I present the committee's report incorporating dissenting reports entitled Three broadcasting reform proposals.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr MURPHY:
  by leave—The parliament established the committee at the same time as the government released its broadcasting legislation reforms in March of this year. The government's package of bills was in response to two thorough high-profile reviews—the convergence review into the policy and regulatory frameworks around converging media and communications; and the Finkelstein review into codes of practice, convergence and the production of quality news.


The committee's terms of reference centred on three potential policy changes that the government considered could also be implemented: abolishing the 75 per cent audience reach rule for television; providing that a program supply agreement alone could indicate control of a broadcaster; and giving the Australian Communications and Media Authority the power to require on air reporting of its findings.


The committee held a public hearing into the first term of reference on Monday, 18 March 2013 here in Canberra. It received submissions on all three terms of reference from 13 organisations. 


The committee supports the first policy proposal, because the reach rule is becoming redundant with the advent of the internet and converging media; however, there was concern at the hearing whether local regional news would continue if the reach rule were abolished. Therefore the committee's support for the proposal is based on two conditions: there should be legislation or legally enforceable undertakings to support local content in regional Australia; and there should also be a clear definition of local content to ensure that regional viewers have access to appropriate levels of high-quality, locally devised and locally presented programming.


The committee does not support the second proposal. There was no support for it during the inquiry; however, it may be appropriate to revisit this issue at a later date, especially given that governments and the parliament regularly review and change broadcasting policy. The committee supports giving the Australian Communications and Media Authority the power to require on-air corrections, clarifications and directions based on its findings. 


The authority demonstrated to the committee that there is a gap in the sanctions it can impose on broadcasters. Industry expressed a range of concerns during the inquiry about on-air reporting of regulatory findings; however, these issues can be addressed and doing so will ensure that the measure will be fair on broadcasters.


Finally, on behalf of the chair, I thank the organisations that assisted the committee during the inquiry through submissions and participating at the hearing. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to the inquiry and the report. I thank the House.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (16:43):  I am pleased to be able to continue my remarks on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. Before the debate was adjourned on Thursday, I was speaking about the general context of this legislation, in particular, suspicion in the community and in this parliament that the legislation is being constructed by the minister and the government for two reasons only: the first as an attempt to seek to divide Australians on the basis of place of birth for some sort of perceived political advantage; and, second, as an attempt to distract from their real policy failure—the decision to weaken Australia's border protection laws.


Over the past weeks the evidence that these suspicions are correct has proved compelling, so much so that the Australian Financial Review has concluded in its editorial this morning under the heading 'Populist policies an embarrassment' that:


The federal government has yet again been caught out using hyperbole to position the 457 visa scheme as a core issue in the populist politics that dominate its agenda. Freedom of Information documents obtained by The Australian Financial Review have revealed that Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor had no evidence from his department to back his claim in late April that there had been ""10,000 rorts"" of 457 visas as he sought to justify a government crackdown on the scheme. Mr O'Connor's error is an embarrassment to a government that will today attempt to force changes to the scheme through Parliament in a last ditch attempt to find issues it thinks will appeal to voters who are likely to desert it at the September 14 election. Its continued pitch to protectionist elements within the labour movement runs contrary to all objective evidence suggesting the 457 scheme is as a modest and controlled system for allowing guest workers to supplement the workforce.


If the government can provide no justification for changes to this visa then there is not a basis for this legislation.


The 457 is a temporary visa designed to fill temporary skills shortages in the short term. It can be held for a maximum of four years by the visa holder. The role of the government should be to analyse the figures, find out where the skills shortages are and provide Australians with the opportunity to gain the skills to fill these in-demand occupations. That is where the focus of this government needs to be. The government's cuts to higher education in the budget certainly do not assist with this goal.


A point that needs to be remembered is that it is a temporary visa only and the statistics show that it is working as intended. In 2012-13, Western Australia recorded 21.1 per cent of lodgement applications by location. This 6.4 per cent decrease on the number from the previous year demonstrates the flexibility of the current system and perhaps indicates a slowdown in the boom that many commentators, including the former resources minister, have been discussing. For members interested, the top nominated industry for application in Western Australia in the last year was mechanical engineering technician. There was a notable 51 per cent decrease in geologist 457 applications in Western Australia, however. The point to make here is that the 457 visa seems to be flexibly responding to the market conditions and doing exactly what it is supposed to do, and there would seem to be no need or justification to change that status quo.


I note that on 21 March 2012 the then immigration minister, Chris Bowen, stated: 'The statistics clearly show that the 457 visa program is working extremely well for Western Australia.' Referring to a young kid sitting at home in Kwinana, the Prime Minister said:


I believe we’ve got the visa settings right particularly with short term 457 visas.


On this basis, it was a surprise to many when straight after the third Rudd-Gillard leadership crisis in March, which precipitated the resignation of Minister Bowen, the new immigration minister, Brendan O'Connor, backed by the Prime Minister, starting putting about some divisive rhetoric on 457 visas—and I will speak about that divisive rhetoric. I was in my electorate on the weekend and met Mick from Atlanta, Georgia. He was originally from India but came through the USA and he is over in Western Australia doing a job for a company. No-one in Australia was available to do that work, so he was brought in from the USA on a 457 visa. He says that he now feels like he is the pariah in the system because of this legislation. He said that, because of this legislation, he feels as though he cannot tell anyone that he is on a 457 visa as he feels as though he is stealing other people's jobs. He asked me to please pass on a message to the government: 'I'm not here stealing anyone's jobs; I'm here because no-one else can do this job.' He said, 'I've been trained in the US to do it and that's why I'm here.'


The government started talking about rorts in the system and, under pressure to provide some sort of justification, the immigration announced 10,000 cases of abuse in the system. In trying to justify these comments on the program in March, Minister O'Connor referred in the House to a Department of Immigration and Citizenship document on strengthening the integrity of the 457 program, provided to his Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration earlier this year. However, when the coalition managed to obtain a copy of the document under freedom of information, we found that the document did not suggest any widespread rorting or concerns with the program, but rather put forward a number of sensible housekeeping measures to improve program integrity. Subsequently, it was revealed in the Financial Review that the minister's personal office admitted within two hours that it had no evidence to back up Minister O'Connor's claim of 10,000 rorts; however, the pretence has been kept up ever since—culminating in this legislation today.


The bill intends to amend the Migration Act to reinforce the obligations of employer sponsors of 457 visas; require prescribed classes of sponsors to undertake labour market testing for Australian workers prior to recruiting from overseas using the 457 program; require evidence of that labour market testing and provide for exemptions from labour market testing in some circumstances; enshrine the kinds of sponsorship obligations that the minister must ensure are prescribed in regulations; empower Fair Work inspectors under the Migration Act, including their access to employer premises, for the purposes of the act; provide for inspectors to determine whether an employer has contravened a civil penalty provision or other employer sanction provision; and extend the period that an employee can seek new sponsored employment from 28 days to 90 days. I understand feedback from the Migration Council of Australia and a number of industry groups to these changes has been universally negative towards the new labour market testing requirements in particular. It does seem that this is a major area of concern associated with this bill.


The people I employed from overseas never came on a 457 visa. They were from New Zealand, but we were required to employ them initially back in the eighties because there was a shortage of skilled refrigeration mechanics. I am sure the intent of most companies in Australia is to provide jobs to Australians before having to employ overseas people on 457 visas. So I do not support this bill.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (16:51):  The Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 is about a very serious matter, and that is the capacity of the country to bring in skilled workers when we cannot find those people in Australia, where we do not have the particular skills or skilled Australians are not prepared to move to parts of the country where the jobs are going begging. This is particularly the case in rural and regional Australia. I have to say that, without access to temporary sponsored visas—which we colloquially call 457 visas—the food manufacturing and processing industry in northern Victoria would have suffered very significantly from lack of human capacity.


Northern Victoria is an ideal place for conducting the business of raising pigs. Huge piggeries which are very scientifically advanced are to be found in places like Yarrawalla and on the Patho Plains. These are very sparsely populated areas. They are flat and they have access to good quality water, but they are a long way from any capital city. In fact they are a long way from major country towns. So when we try to employ qualified piggery managers or operatives, ideally with some veterinary background and experience, the owners and managers of these piggeries have drawn a blank. They have not been able to attract skilled workers to come and work in these piggeries. 


One enterprise I would like to refer to is at Yarrawalla, which is about three or four hours from Melbourne and about another hour or so from a major centre. They now have a skilled workforce who have been attracted by the use of the 457 visas—these people have come from the Philippines, where many of them had in fact been trained as veterinarians. I had the great pleasure of conferring citizenship upon the three families of these skilled workers in this local piggery this Australia Day. These younger family members now attend local schools. The schools were in decline in terms of their population numbers. As a result of these families now filling up the desks in small schools in places like Pyramid Hill, we have revitalised the communities themselves. 


So, as a consequence of being able to access the skilled workforce, in this case from the Philippines, to work in these enormous piggeries, some of the biggest in Australia, and benchmarked as world's best practice, we have also revitalised our communities and managed to have new citizens who can be given all the opportunities that our country has—with their young children now attending our local schools. We also have had numbers of 457 skilled workers taking up the important and significant work in our abattoirs in places like Tongala. 


Again, the local managers and owners of these abattoirs would be more than happy to engage local people, to employ local people, without going through the hassle of the application process for a person via a 457 visa. But unfortunately when they put out applications for workers in the abattoirs—these are skilled workers, people who can also take up a management position—they draw a blank. They do not get applicants for these positions. 


At the Tongala abattoir, run by Greenhams, a very successful, 100 per cent export abattoir that sends ground beef to the USA, they are now dependent on international backpackers for their workforce, given it has been made that much harder for them to attract skilled 457 visa holders. That abattoir is a major employer in its own right and it is of critical importance to the dairy industry, since it processes cattle that are no longer required to produce milk.


We have dairy operations in Kyabram in my area—again, some of these dairies are among the biggest milk producers in Australia. They employ 457 visa holders—again many of them from the Philippines—who are prepared to work long hours, the back-to-back shifts, in a dairy operation where there are thousands of cows milked over a 24-hour period, seven days a week. 


The suggestion guiding this legislation or what has prompted this legislation, we are told, is major rorting of the whole business of temporary sponsored visas in Australia. As the previous speaker said, when we asked for the evidence of this 'massive rorting'—apparently 10,000 rorts Minister O'Connor proclaimed in this place—none was forthcoming. An FOI inquiry could not give us any documentation or information that backed up the allegation that the 457 visa system was corruptly used and, to use the old-fashioned term, was simply being rorted. There is no evidence of systematic or widespread rorting of the system. In fact it is a brilliant scheme. 


I was particularly pleased when I was the shadow minister for immigration to track a lot of the sponsored visa holders, including Chinese workers who were making sure that abattoirs could still be operated along the Murray River. I tracked all of the state government employed 457 visa holders, who backfill the long-term vacancies in allied health positions through much of regional Australia and also in metropolitan Australia. It is ironic that some of the biggest employers of 457 visa holders in the country are state governments. 


I was shocked, I have to say, and I suspect my colleagues were equally amazed, to hear that the Prime Minister herself has even had to find a temporary sponsored visa holder to fill a media position in her office. I am not suggesting she rorted the system in finding that person. I am not suggesting that person is replacing somebody else. He undoubtedly has a unique set of employment characteristics that brought him to that position. This is not evidence of rorting the program. What I worry about is that again it is the dead hand of the unions getting engaged in a program where people who come do not typically end up joining a union; they simply go to work with the sponsor and they simply fill a position which has not been able to be filled by an Australian worker. 


We are told that this new legislation will require evidence of labour market testing to accompany an application for nomination. Does this government seriously think that employers do not first look around in an informal way and see if there is an applicant who is nearby or who can be lured after fairly careful efforts in recruitment? Does this government seriously think that employers turn first to a 457 visa holder, given the paperwork involved and given the costs involved in establishing a new temporary skilled visa holder in the workplace? Of course it is nonsense to suggest that the local market is not now tested by someone contemplating as a last resort having to go offshore to find themselves a temporary sponsored visa holder. That is not the case. 


And then we are told that there will be exemptions from the labour market testing regime in circumstances where there has been a 'major disaster' or where the skill level of the nominated occupation is equivalent to skill level 1 or skill level 2 as provided for in the Australian And New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations or ANZSCO. So we already have exemptions to all of this. Again there was an implication, I have to say, from the minister when he talked about the rorting, that a lot of these 457 visa holders were somehow being paid less than the equivalent locally employed person in the same industry in a similar job. Again, the evidence is to the contrary. When you are desperate to have someone give you the skilled work that you need to keep your enterprise going, when you perhaps look forward to a transfer of their skills or technology to further enhance your own domestically recruited workforce, you certainly do not lure them paying them less. You typically find that the 457 visa holder in my part of Australian is paid equivalent to or more than a locally engaged staff member. 


I have to say that in the case of my 457 visa sponsors they typically also find accommodation for the person, they ensure that families are properly accommodated and are quickly integrated into the community, because they are very concerned that their efforts in attracting the 457 visa holder do not lead to a very short-term relationship. They want that new skilled worker to stay. When the coalition was in government, the Australian expectation was that a lot of these skilled workers would in fact become Australian citizens and there was a rate of about 30 or 40 per cent conversions when we were in government to people taking up permanent residency and citizenship. I would hope that number has grown since that time.


So this Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill is based on a fallacy. The fallacy is that there is widespread rorting and abuse of a system which has skilled workers coming in to fill positions that cannot be filled in Australia. I now have in my area of northern Victoria numbers of employers who are in despair because they were able to access these sponsored visas in the past and now the red tape, the go-slows, the innuendos about their motives are such that they are finding that they cannot access the temporary sponsored visa regime at all. So what do they do? They cannot get local workers to step up and do the tasks. We are an area of declining population and we have a brain drain in our part of the world where people who are more technically qualified tend to leave the area and go to metropolitan alternative places to live and work. We have had an experience of the most superb workers coming and becoming enmeshed in our communities under this 457 visa scheme. 


I have to restate that in meddling with this scheme it appears to me to be nothing more than the dead hand of the unions trying to take control of a workforce with no regard to the needs of the employer, with no regard to the needs of the actual industry itself. There seems to be no perception or conception of the difficulties in rural Australia in attracting a skilled and qualified workforce. I think that is a huge shame. The fact that half of these amendments to the bill are to do with inspectors, enforceable undertakings with the minister, looking at special civil penalty provisions for those who have committed an offence against the relevant provisions—the whole thing sounds like the earlier era of some fascist regime. I think it is a shame. I with the coalition oppose this business. I hope that common sense will prevail or it will be just another piece of legislation we have to make sure does work when, if the Australian public sees fit, we return to office after 14 September. 


Finally, let me stress that this is an excellent government run skilled migration program which uses temporary sponsored visas. We have provisions in the regulations to ensure that people who come have an adequate English-language facility. We have within this set of migration regulations already adequate safeguards should there be a rare moment of someone trying to exploit the system. There are rules about wages that have to be paid. This was a well-managed system but, sadly, it has been destroyed under this government. If there is an abuse of the system now, let me say that it is by this government trying to insert into the workforce of Australia a whole lot of additional regulations which will simply make it harder for our manufacturing sector and our service sector, our health services sector, and will make them even more despairing of how they going to sustain and retain an adequate workforce. I have to hope for the sake of my piggeries, my abattoirs, my dairy operations, my hospitals, all the allied health professionals who come out here on a 457 visa; I have to say to them, 'Just hang on and we will do our best to make sure that the system is not destroyed as we wait for the next election.'

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2013-06-24,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:05):  I am quite staggered at the previous speaker. What an extraordinary contribution. I have heard her in this place on a number of occasions say she has 200 empty shops in Shepparton. If we allocate two jobs per shop, which is pretty moderate, that is 400 jobs gone in Shepparton. SPC said there would be a 500 jobs gone as a result of the cutbacks there. So that is 900 people in your town who have lost their jobs, yet you say we should be bringing people in from overseas to man the jobs in your electorate. That is what you said. You also made reference to a brain drain from your areas. Everyone left behind is brainless, are they? What an extraordinary contribution. We are desperately short of jobs in country Australia and this member is advocating that we bring people in from overseas to take what jobs we have got left there. Extraordinary. It never ceases to amaze me.



Dr Stone interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  The member in her Murray electorate has 7.1 per cent unemployment. I would think that means thousands of people without any employment in the electorate, and she is advocating that we bring people in from overseas to take what few jobs are there. What an extraordinary contribution. People come in here and they do not think at all or have absolutely no communion with ordinary people. Another extraordinary part of the member for Murray's contribution was that she was condemning the ALP. They brought in 125,000 people, whereas her mob brought in only 38,000 people. She should have been congratulating them. I am condemning the ALP for bringing in 125,000 people; she should be praising them.


The implication of the Liberal speakers in this debate is that Australians are lazy and useless. The member for Murray also added that we had a brain drain, so we need these people to come in. So we are also stupid. That was a most extraordinary contribution.


Why in the year of our Lord2013 do we suddenly need to bring in 100,000 migrant workers—section 457 workers—a year? About 200,000 migrants are actually coming in as well. So there are 300,000 people coming into Australia each year. I do not know how many jobs we have in Australia, but I know that we have lost 1,500 in my hometown of Charters Towers. When we were desperately waiting for the jobs to come down from the opening up of the giant coalfields called the Galilee Basin, which will double Australia's coal reserves, we suddenly found out that all of the big developers involved in it were announcing that they were going to bring their workers in from overseas. Who was facilitating it? Not the Liberals, but the Labor Party. Then the Labor Party wonders why they are on 29 per cent of the vote. Do you think all the people out there are stupid, do you? You bring 125,000 workers in here for one reason: to undermine our pay and conditions. 


When I walk out that door there I look with great pride at the picture of Charlie McDonald, the first member for Kennedy. I have copies of six of his first seven speeches to this place. Men literally died. Three were shot dead at the picket line at Dagworth Station and Waltzing Matilda was written two weeks later. The entire executive of the AWU was thrown in jail for three years with hard labour because they went on strike. When we fought and won our pay and conditions, one in 31 were going down the mine and dying. What did they do? They brought people from supercheap countries overseas to come in and take our jobs in the mines. Then they brought people in from supercheap countries to cut the cane in our canefields. We fought and died for the pay and conditions and then we got nothing out of it. Is it any surprise that about 100 years ago, the member for Kennedy—God bless him, his picture is out there—in six of his first seven speeches tried to protect the pay and conditions which they had fought and died for? But they have been sold out by the Labor Party. God help this country if the Liberals get in. They will bring in 400,000 workers a year. If they are praising the Labor Party for bringing in 125,000 workers, clearly they will bring in a hell of a lot more than that.


They say these workers are going to go back overseas. I have not noticed any in my electorate going back overseas. They are put in pretty permanent digs here. I think we are all human in this place and we do not like to throw people out of the country—



An honourable member interjecting—  




Mr KATTER:
  I would have to go along with the interjection—it is probably a bit of an exaggeration with respect to some people in this place. I do not notice these workers going home, but I do notice them bringing in their families. Even if you are bringing in only 300,000 a year, 200,000 migrants are now coming into the country every year. If you add those figures up over 10 years and the fact they are bringing in their families, what will be left for existing Australians? Where are we going to get jobs?


When a 457 worker is brought in, the employer holds the deportation order. He can send them back any time he likes. So he has much more than a master-servant relationship. If anyone says, 'They're not being brought in on account of pay and conditions; they are all paying award wages,' why are they bringing them in? Out of 1.3 million people seeking full-time employment in Australia we cannot find anyone to man the mines in the electorate of a member for Western Australia, who allowed 1,700 workers in because poor Gina could not find any workers for her mine in Western Australia. It is funny: Andrew Forrest could find them. I am told that he found almost 2,000. He trained up our First Australians. A lot of them do not speak English really well and a lot of them cannot read or write but, over a long period, he trained them and made them into very worthwhile employees. He still has 400 or 500 working in his mines today over in Western Australia. He can find them. But the member representing Fremantle and Rockingham has 25 per cent unemployment in his electorate, yet he is saying that we have to fly 1,700 people in from overseas to man the mines in his area. 


I am a person who believes in the power of the streets, the power of the ordinary people whom you run into when you walk down the street in your town. In my first speech in this place I said, with some anger and rage, 'Ask yourself the question: how many times have you walked down the street in your town and just listened to people—not talked to them but listened?' That day, after this big mining magnate in Western Australia made the statement: 'We have 1,700 workers to be flown in,' so they could work for, I would suspect, a lot less than she would get Australians working for—and my parliamentary Chief of Staff was with me—I said, 'We're going to record everyone we run into today who can't get a job.' That afternoon, in a little country town, we ran into nine people and the next morning we ran into nine people who had been seeking work for over a year. One of them came over to me and was almost in tears. He was selling his motorbike. He had been trying for over a year to get a start in the mines. He was a qualified tradesman and, as far as I was concerned, a decent bloke.


A week later, I was in the RSL in Townsville and nine young blokes—very decent style young blokes—all soldiers, all of them qualified tradesmen, had been applying for over six months to get a start in the mines, and they could not get a start in the mines.


The last speaker was crying about her farmers—probably a quarter of the farms in Queensland would be foreclosed on now if it was not for the jobs that we got in the mines. There would hardly be a family that did not have someone working in the mines in Queensland. Those properties are only allowed to survive because we have our sons and daughters working in the mines and, in many cases, the farmers themselves working in the mines. One of my very good friends, one of the Fish family, had to go away from his property for two years, working in very courageous circumstances in the mines to try and keep body and soul together. He came out and survived the crash at the time in the market and a drought that he was having. It was only those jobs in the mines that enabled us to survive.


As the last speaker said, some of her farmers have people working for them. I do not condemn them. Heaven only knows how they are making ends meet, but it would be worthwhile if the people in the opposition and the people in the government spent their time trying to give the farmers a fair go instead of forcing them to get people from overseas to work on their farms.


I am not going to go over today. We are not talking about the value of the dollar, which the Liberal Party doubled from 52c to over 90c. That drove all of our farmers in Australia into penury and closed stacks of mines in Australia, including mines in my own electorate.


The other thing that intrigues me is why we came to this conclusion in the year 2010. We never had to bring any section 457 workers in before that date. Why did we suddenly have to bring in 100,000 year? What went on? I suspect it is a very interesting story. I suspect that some people got in the ears of the government and I can tell you they were not trade union leaders as the last member of parliament asserted. I can assure you they are not. But some people got in the ears of the ALP government. They already control the mob on this side—they are all puppets on a string.


This mob over here who profess to look after the workers of Australia—shame upon them! That great party was founded on the principle that we do not fly in workers from overseas to take our jobs off us as Australians. There are a few people who need a bit of a kick in the backside and a bit of a cattle prod to go and do some work. That might be true and that was the fault of the free marketeers in this place who separated the function of writing the dole cheques from the function of allocating the jobs. They were separated under the free market policies—I cannot remember whether it was Keating or Costello, but one of them. Once those jobs were separated, there was no way you could compel anyone to work because they could continue on the dole indefinitely. The mechanisms for stopping the dole were completely destroyed.


The people involved in the job allocations have made an awful lot of money. I do not begrudge it to them. Good luck to them if they see the opportunity to make money. I do not begrudge it to the people who are getting 457 workers, particularly people like farmers. Who can begrudge it to them? What else are they expected to do?


We have a parliament that sits aside, and we are on a policy now of bringing in 20 million people over the next 10 or 15 years. Twenty million people are being brought into this country. Have we got enough expansion in jobs? Have we got enough money to pay our welfare? Have we got all these things so that we can afford to bring people in from overseas? Can we do that as a nation? Have you spoken to a person on the pension in the last few weeks? I have, and they are doing it damn tough. Yet you are bringing these 457 workers in to take those jobs worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.


Remember that all of our mining companies were flogged off to foreigners. The six mining companies that account for 85 per cent of our production were all Australian owned 16 years ago. Thanks to the Liberal Party, the National Party and the ALP, all of the six of them are gone. They all foreign owned. If we are not getting the wages—they go into the pockets of fly-in foreign workers—and if the profits are going into the pockets of foreign owners of the mines, what the hell do we Australians get out of the mining industry? A big hole in the ground: that is what we get! (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2013-06-24,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (17:20):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. This is another piece of legislation which must be condemned by this parliament. This bill has all the hallmarks of policy failings that this government is renowned for. It is a bill which is essentially seeking a headline rather than delivering good public policy for our nation. It is a bill which has been drafted without any facts to support its intent. It is a bill that seeks to distract Australians from the government's failed border protection policies.


Before I address some of the specifics of the bill, I think we need to reflect for a moment on the context in which this immigration bill is being presented to the parliament. When federal Labor was elected to government in 2007, there were just four people in detention. Under John Howard's leadership, the federal coalition government had successfully implemented a border protection policy which had essentially stopped the boats—a policy based on temporary protection visas, the Pacific solution and turning boats around, where safe to do so.


It was so successful that federal Labor endorsed the coalition's border protection policy in the lead-up to the 2007 federal election. But, as we now know, this election commitment would become just another broken promise.


It started in 2008 when the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, changed the rules and relaxed the processing procedures for those who arrived illegally by boat. The abolition of the Howard government's border protection policy sent a very clear message to people smugglers, and the message was that Australia was once again open for business to people smuggling or, at the very least, to those who could afford to pay the people smugglers for their passage to Australia.


Just over five years later, all Australians are paying a very big price for a policy which Mr Rudd created and Prime Minister Gillard has exacerbated. Since 2008 we have seen more than 700 boats arrive illegally on our shores. They have transported more than 44,200 illegal arrivals and the cost to the taxpayer has now topped $10 billion. These facts are very relevant to the bill we are debating today because all members would be very well aware how angry hardworking ordinary Australians are about this policy failing. It is this anger which the government is attempting to appease. It is the attention to this issue which the government hopes to distract with this legislation.


But the reality is the government cannot hide behind the facts. They failed with the East Timor solution, when Prime Minister Gillard did not even consult the East Timorese government. No-one was therefore surprised when it fell over. The Prime Minister then proposed the Malaysia solution, but Malaysia was not a signatory to the UNHCR refugee convention. Hence, another ill-conceived thought bubble never saw the light of day and was never brought before this parliament for a vote. And as the government struggled through a botched policy process the boats kept coming, the number of illegal arrivals exploded—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member might like to refer his remarks to the bill before the House.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  I am. This is very relevant to the bill.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member is not referring to the bill.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  It is very relevant to the bill before the House, Deputy Speaker. I am putting the bill in context; it is very relevant. We had the number of arrivals exploding, which brings us to where we are today: a desperate attempt to create a distraction. The government has confected an issue alleging systematic abuse of 457 visas. That is despite the government's own advisers saying there is no evidence of the widespread rorting of the 457 migration program. 


While it is true that under this Labor government the number of 457 skilled migration visas issued has grown to their highest level, the government has failed to demonstrate that this has occurred because Australian employers are employing skilled workers from overseas in preference to Australian workers. Indeed, it is clear that the majority of Australian businesses prefer employing Australians who have the skills rather than employing skilled people from overseas, but the reality is that many businesses cannot find someone with the skills and experience they are seeking. Given such a circumstance, one would have thought the government would have welcomed a situation where businesses which cannot find Australians with the skills to fill a vacant position would employ an overseas worker through the 457 visa program. The 457 visa recipient would earn wages, pay their bills, pay taxes, cover the cost of things such as health care—they would be contributing to our nation's productivity and delivering a skill which would otherwise not be available. In most other progressive democracies this would be viewed as a good thing, but not in Australia under this government. This government would prefer to support illegal boat arrivals.


It is ludicrous that this situation would exist in Australia, but we should not be surprised by this government's approach to those who wish to contribute to our nation's wealth and we should not be surprised by this government's attempt to demonise Australian businesses. What is happening here is that uncertainty for business is being created, business confidence is being undermined and we are putting a brake on growth. It is of great concern. The 457 migration program plays an important role in securing short- and long-term skilled migrants that Australia has always needed and will need into the future, and we need certainty.


In my electorate there is a dependence on 457 visas. Over the past decade we have seen an explosion in the blueberry industry on the Coffs Coast. We have seen double-digit growth in blueberry production and this has been delivered through two major business models. Costa Berries, or Blueberry Farms of Australia, as many know them, is a massive operation which employs more than 2,000 people over a 12-month period. They produce premium blueberry product which generates tens of millions of dollars in wages and the cost of production, but their work is very labour intensive. Peter McPherson of Blueberry Farms has advised me of the difficulties of recruiting highly skilled labour in the field of horticulture. The business is reliant on the use of 457 visas and it brings workers in from countries such as Mexico and Chile. Why does the government want to impose more red tape on this business? Why is the government so keen to drive up the cost for this important industry?


Also on the Coffs Coast is a group of around 70 farmers who independently grow blueberries. Many of these farmers are members of the Indian community, which is heavily involved in the local community, particularly in the area of Woolgoolga. These farmers have got together and built a processing facility and they call their venture Oz Berries. The ongoing expansion of Oz Berries is one of the true industry success stories on the Coffs Coast. The processing facility was established in 2006 with the support of a $233,000 grant from the Howard government. From day one it has been a challenge to cope with the growth within this industry. Stage 1 was complete, then they leased a neighbouring building, and only last year installed a new packing machine to improve the service provided to local farmers. The exponential growth of the blueberry industry has been great for farmers and a real boost to the local economy. Today Oz Berries employs more than 60 people and turns over more than $27 million each year. The 70 farmers employ hundreds of additional people on their properties. Both Oz Berries and Costa Berries are vital to our local economy and they both need to use 457 visas in order to get the skills and the labour that they need.


I would like to address some of the specifics of the legislation in the time I have left. The bill will do a number of things. It will be amending the Migration Act to reinforce the obligations of sponsors of 457 visas. It will require prescribed classes of sponsors to undertake labour market testing for Australian workers prior to recruiting from overseas using the 457 visa program. It will require evidence of that labour market testing and provide for exemptions from labour market testing in some circumstances. It will enshrine the kinds of sponsorship obligations that the minister must ensure are prescribed in regulations. It will empower Fair Work inspectors under the Migration Act, including their access to employer premises for the purpose of the act. It will provide for inspectors to determine whether an employer has contravened a civil penalty provision or other employment sanctioned provision. And it will extend the period that an employee can seek new sponsored employment from 28 days to 90 days. So here we go again: the heavy hand of a federal government is effectively going to make the 457 application process not worth the effort of applying. The whole intention of the 457 visa system is to provide a quick solution—and I stress 'quick solution'—to the fluctuations in demand for skilled and semiskilled workers where such demand cannot be met by the Australian workforce. But this government wants to make it so difficult that business will throw its arms up in the air and say it is all just too hard.


Not only is this legislation wrong; it also represents another broken promise from this government. I remind members opposite of some of the comments made by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and other members of the Labor government. I will start with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said in a doorstop interview in Beijing on 27 April 2011:


So I’ve got a very clear focus on lifting labour force participation by Australians and lifting skills—so a young kid sitting at home in Kwinana without a job and without any hope can get the skills he or she needs to get that opportunity in the northwest of our country. Now even with increased labour force participation and increased skills we will need skilled migration. I believe we’ve got the visa settings right particularly with short term 457 visas. 


'I believe we've got the visa settings right' were the Prime Minister's words. It cannot get any clearer than that. The Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, Wayne Swan, had an interview with Chris Uhlmann on 7.30 on 20 April 2007. Uhlmann asked:


You've been talking a lot about workforce participation recently, but do you still need to lift the skilled migration intake? 


The Treasurer said:


Well certainly what we do need to do is to respond to the needs of our economy, and we have done a lot domestically in terms of training skilled labour. We will have to do more and we'll also have to do as much as we possibly can to lift domestic labour force participation. And the Prime Minister has made that very clear.


I think you would be aware that in terms of temporary skilled labour, the 457 program is not capped, so business does have the opportunity to bring in more skilled migrants, should they require them, for particular projects. 


So both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have been spruiking their support for the 457 visa program, but now, because of the asylum seeker debacle, they have decided to target skilled migration.


The coalition believe there should be a crackdown on any rorting of the 457 visa system but it is incumbent on the government in the first instance to produce the evidence that demonstrates that there is a problem. As we debate this legislation today this government has been unable—and I stress 'unable'—to table any evidence. As a result, the coalition will not support this bill and we will seek to refer it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. We will oppose this legislation and call on members opposite not to let this government further undermine the productive capacity of our nation.


This is government by the unions for the unions. You would imagine that the government would have learnt by now that bad policy is bad politics. This is another example of bad government policy foisted upon this country because the government needs a political distraction. We will oppose this legislation. It is bad legislation: it is bad for business and it is bad for our nation.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:33):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. On what is now possibly the fourth last day of this 43rd Parliament the government is attempting to ram through this migration legislation, a contrived solution from this Labor government to a nonexistent problem. The coalition has serious concerns with this bill because it adds to the burden of regulation, obligations, compliance and enforcement on employer sponsors using the 457 visa program. This bill is the culmination of a union and government campaign to discredit the program and demonise foreign workers for political gain.


The 457 visa was introduced in 1996 and is the dominant component of Australia's temporary skilled migration program. In general, this visa allows a business to sponsor and employ someone from outside Australia in a skilled job. People holding this visa can work in Australia for up to four years, bring their family with them and travel in and out of Australia as often as they want. They pay their own way, including health care, and they do not access welfare.


People holding this visa can work in Australia for up to four years, bring their family with them, and travel in and out of Australia as often as they want. They pay their own way, including healthcare, and they do not access welfare. Fundamentally, the program is designed to provide a quick response to fluctuations in demand for skilled and semi-skilled workers where such demand cannot be met by the Australian workforce. Therefore, temporary skilled migration is vital to the efficient operation of the labour market, delivering significant benefits to the Australian economy.


Since its introduction the 457 visa program has grown in use and proven to be highly effective in meeting skill gaps in a number of industries for large resource or infrastructure projects. Approximately 70 per cent of 457 visa holders are in professional or managerial occupations, while 30 per cent are in trade, technical and clerical positions. According to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's Subclass 457: summary reportfor 2012-13, as at 13 April 2013 there were 108,810 primary 457 visa holders in Australia. This figure is up by 20 per cent on April 2012. This represents less than one per cent of Australia's workforce.


I strongly welcome the contribution of migrants to this country. On this point I note that the 457 program is not about what country people happen to come from but rather about what skills they can offer and what they can contribute to Australia. In 2012-13 some 21.1 per cent of applications granted were for citizens of India, 19.6 per cent from the United Kingdom and 8.3 per cent from the Republic of Ireland, while many countries from Asia, including the Philippines, China, South Korea, Japan, Nepal and Malaysia make up a significant component of 457 workers. These figures reflect the fact that Australia is a very attractive place to come to work and that people from all across the world want to contribute to the Australian economy and to Australian society.


The bill amends conditions in four areas: first, it introduces new labour-market testing; second, it amends rules relating to sponsor obligations and undertakings; third, it establishes powers of authorised inspectors; and, last, it extends the period during which a 457 worker can find new sponsored employment.


The most concerning aspect of this bill relates to the reintroduction of labour-market testing. At present, skills shortages are based on inclusion of an occupation on the Consolidated Skilled Occupation List, CSOL, which is updated annually by DIAC, drawing on advice from Skills Australia. These changes will require employers to provide evidence of labour-market testing, including information about their efforts to recruit Australian workers, relevant labour-market research trends, expressions of support from relevant Commonwealth or state authorities and any other evidence determined to be relevant. The actual period of labour-market testing required is not clear in this bill but will likely be variable, depending on the occupation.


These changes represent a significant regulatory impost on employer-sponsors. However, the Labor government has neglected to provide a regulatory impact statement, because the Prime Minister's office granted an exemption based on unspecified exceptional circumstances. This is despite the fact that labour-market testing requirements will undermine the very purpose of the 457 program to rapidly fill temporary skills shortages. Adding draconian measures such as labour-market testing to visa approval processes will add significantly to 457 recruitment lead-times and costs. At the very least, a full analysis  of such potential impacts of this bill must be clarified in a regulatory impact statement, let alone in a full  Senate inquiry as proposed by the coalition.


The Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and the Migration Council of Australia have together called this, 'unwarranted legislation which risks penalising all employers, their employees and skilled migrants, as well as undermining investment, skills transfer and development, and broader job creation. In fact, in the DIAC document on the 457 program produced earlier this year, obtained by the shadow minister for immigration under freedom of information, labour-market testing is not suggested or even mentioned. Clearly, the department does not believe that this is a worthy proposal—and neither does the coalition.


The strongest disincentive against abusing this program is that the costs involved in recruiting an overseas worker are significantly higher then when recruiting an Australian worker. It simply does not make rational economic sense for an employer to spend considerably more money to bring in someone from overseas, when the labour supply already exists in Australia to do that same job at the same level.


That does not mean that the system is perfect. I have heard from constituents who are concerned that their employer might be discriminating against Australians in favour of workers on 457 visas. It is absolutely critical that those concerns are reported and that DIAC identifies if an employer is abusing the 457 program. However, while individual cases have been identified, the Labor government has not in any way demonstrated why they cannot be handled within current safeguards. For months this Labor government has claimed that there has been widespread rorting of 457 visas, yet it has failed to produce any real evidence that it exists. This bill is therefore based on a false premise. In May this year, the minister publicly claimed that there were in excess of 10,000 cases of illegitimate use of 457 visas. He later admitted that he was merely 'making a forecast' and admitted that he did not have an exact or precise figure. 


In fact, we need only look at what the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and previous ministers for immigration have been saying on 457 visas. In 2011, the Prime Minister claimed


I believe we've got the visa settings right particularly with short-term 457 visas.


The then minister, the member for McMahon, publicly declared:


… demand-driven migration is delivering migrants effectively to the regions where they are needed—exactly how the 457 visa program is supposed to work. And anyone who tries to tell you the 457 visa program is not working, needs to take another look at the facts.


As recently as 20 January 2013, only five months ago, the then minister said:


The 457 visa program is designed to address genuine labour shortages that cannot be met from the Australian labour market and we believe we have this balance right.


What we see with the measures in today's bill, however, is this government inventing a problem. This Labor government has concocted a cynical, political ploy to demonise 457 workers to the detriment of the Australian labour market and the Australian economy. Those who know what is actually happening on the ground have pointed out to this government that there is absolutely no evidence of problems or rorting. The minister cannot produce an inquiry from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, because such an inquiry does not exist and there has been no reason to hold one.


Business groups, including representatives from the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and Migration Council Australia, have all disputed Labor's claims and have condemned the Prime Minister for demonising 457 skilled migration visa holders. They have called on parliament to reject this bill unless, as they said, 'the government provides hard evidence to back up its claims of widespread problems with the 457 program'. In fact, this government's own advisers have said that such evidence does not exist. This includes Michael Easson, chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, who said:


I do not believe that there is any credible evidence that the management of the 457 visa program is out of control …


Demographer Professor Peter McDonald, a member of the government's advisory council, has labelled the rhetoric coming from this government as 'nasty'. 


Since 2007-08, as a result of Labor's mismanagement of the budget—now approaching $300 billion of gross debt—the government has cut resources for compliance work in DIAC, including 457 monitoring, by over $20 million, or 30 per cent. This government has reduced monitoring visits to employers by two-thirds, and the number of employer-sponsored formal warnings has also dropped by two-thirds. The track record of this Labor government demonstrates that it has not been serious about supporting the safeguards already in place, and we must treat the measures in today's bill in that context. 


The shadow minister for immigration has therefore proposed an amendment which proposes that consideration of this bill not be concluded until we know all the facts about why we should consider this bill in the first place and what ramifications it will have should it be passed. This means that three processes must take place: firstly, that DIAC completes a full research report on the true incidence and nature of abuses and non-compliance within the 457 visa program, in comparison to other programs, to substantiate the requirement for the measures; secondly, that consultation by DIAC take place with industry and other stakeholders on the impacts of the measures contained in the bill; and, thirdly, that the government produce a regulatory impact statement related to the proposed labour market testing regime, as required by the Office of Best Practice Regulation. Only when these actions take place can this parliament truly assess the merit of this bill.


The coalition's position on 457 skilled migration visas is simple, clear and consistent. We recognise the critical importance of skilled temporary migration to the Australian economy and the well-being and living standards of all Australians. The 457 skilled migration visa program must be well-managed, providing rapid access to skilled workers not available in the Australian labour market and with strong compliance action to ensure high standards of program integrity. The coalition would never support the use of 457 skilled migration visas at the expense of Australian workers, and would not tolerate any employers who try to abuse the system. We must recognise, however, that skilled migrants have made a vital contribution to the building of our nation.


The coalition will not support this bill and is seeking referral to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The coalition has always been consistent on 457 visas and will be strong on policing our immigration laws on our borders, in the community and in the workplace.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (17:46):  The Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 must rank as one of the most disgraceful bills ever to come before this parliament. The bill adds to the burden of regulation obligations and compliance enforcement on employer sponsors using the 457 visa program. If one is to subscribe to the view that bills should only be presented in this place if they address a real and known mischief or for a bona fide purpose, then this bill fails on all accounts.


Ostensibly, the government claims that this bill is necessary to stop the rorts of the 457 visa scheme, but, when asked to produce evidence of these great rorts, Minister O'Connor first claimed that there were 10,000 cases of abuse. Only later, he incredulously said that the figure had been made up and he tried to back out of it. There is no evidence in the department, there are no reports, showing this alleged 10,000 cases of abuse in the program. Make no mistake, this bill has nothing to do with what is good for Australia—absolutely nothing to do with what is good for our country. 


This bill is about a desperate and dysfunctional government doing anything, saying anything, and attacking anybody in a last-ditch attempt to stay in power. It is all about the Prime Minister pitching to divide immigrants, seeking to create a stir in Western Sydney and scaremongering about foreigners taking the jobs of Australians. This bill declares a false war on skilled migrants to this country, and it is doing that because it is trying to support the unions and it is trying to stir up some perverse attempt to pit the political welfare of the unions against the good of this nation.


There is no crisis in the 457 visa program. There is no evidence of systematic rorting. What there is, though, is an overwhelming evidence of systemic policy failure by this government, and, in case anyone has any doubt about that, let us consider these not-so-impressive facts. After six years of the Rudd-Gillard government, Labor has delivered runaway cost of living increases. Labor has broken its promise on the carbon tax, and there is its administration of private health insurance, along with Grocery Watch and FuelWatch. We have seen a complete loss of control of the federal budget, with five consecutive budget deficits—with even more deficits forecast for the coming years. There is record government debt now approaching $300 billion and a yearly interest bill of $8 billion, and we have had a complete failure of border protection policies with almost 45,000 arrivals on 733 illegal boats resulting in a $10 billion budget blow-out. There was the gross incompetence and mismanagement of major projects like the overpriced school halls. There were the dangerous roof batts and now there are the blow-outs and delays with the National Broadband Network. And, of course, who can forget the ongoing saga that we are subjected to day and night of disunity, chaos and dysfunction with the Julia and Kevin soap opera of 'Who wants to be Prime Minister?' What is evident is that these proposed changes are being driven by not only an increasingly irrelevant union movement to improve union coverage and control of workplaces with 457 visas but also a desperate government and a desperate Prime Minister who are prepared to trash Australia's history of a migrant success story as part of their deeply flawed political strategy of class, gender and now ethnic warfare. 


Immigration has made Australia the nation we are today. Many of Australia's most significant nation-building infrastructure projects are built on the back of migrant labour. The most famous of these is the Snowy Mountains Scheme. In my own electorate of Brisbane, migrants helped to build the iconic Story Bridge. This theme of contribution and achievement throughout the nation is one that existed in the past and continues today. Another example from my electorate of Brisbane can be seen with the researchers employed under the 457 scheme at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, where world-leading research is being undertaken at the moment into AIDS and HIV, as well as dengue fever and malaria. Doctors on 457 visas provide health care to the people of Brisbane at the Royal Brisbane Hospital and at other hospitals in my electorate, but under this bill those doctors are 457 visa holders; they are second-class citizens. 


Immigration has made us a stronger Australia. Community confidence in the immigration program provides a foundation for social harmony and the continued success of our immigration program. As Judge Rauf Soulio said in his welcoming address at the inaugural Australian Multicultural Council lecture last year, 'multicultural Australia transcends the usual division of politics' and 'diversity is a defining strength of Australia'. Well, not any more. If this desperate and divisive government has its way with this bill, what we will have here is a divided country—a country made up of first- and second-class citizens; a country of those who are Australian and who were born here and those who are second class who were not born here. 


As a daughter of Italian migrant parents, I find this bill deeply offensive. My parents, like so many migrants from all over the world, came to this country seeking a better life. They were not born here, but they made Australia home for themselves and their children. They worked hard. They went to where the jobs were. They cut cane in North Queensland, and later they owned and operated the local corner store. I see the member for Indi is sitting at the table. Her parents, who are of Greek origin, also operated a local corner store. They worked hard, as did my parents. My parents then went on to run supermarkets. They were successful in developing a seafood export and wholesale business, which expanded to include one of Brisbane's finest dining restaurants. Since World War II, immigrants like my parents transformed Australia from a nation of some seven million to more than 22 million people from 260 different cultural backgrounds. In that time, immigration has seen more than seven million people settle here, including 750,000 refugees. Australia is arguably and without question one of the most successful immigration nations in the world, but the bill before us in the chamber today puts all of that at risk. 


In the event that there is any ambiguity, it is worth looking at exactly what the 457 visa actually does as opposed to what the government falsely claims it does. The 457 visa class was introduced in 1996 and has been highly effective in meeting skills gaps. That is why it was brought in: to meet skills gaps in a number of industries and for large resourcing and infrastructure projects. The majority of 457 visa holders are professional and managerial occupations and, as at 30 April 2012, there were 108,810 primary 457 visa holders in Australia. That is less than one per cent of Australia's workforce. So much for Labor's and the unions' scaremongering about stealing the jobs of other Australians!


The 457 skilled migration visa program plays an important role in securing the short-term and long-term skilled migrants whom Australia has always needed and will always need into the future. More than half of all permanent skilled visas sponsored by employers are granted to skilled migration visa holders who are already legally in Australia, and 457 skilled migration visas account for more than 30 per cent of all permanent migration to Australia.


The 457 visa is the dominant component of Australia's temporary skilled migration program. It is designed to provide a quick response to fluctuations in demand for skilled and semiskilled workers where such demand cannot be met by the Australian workforce. Temporary skilled migration is vital to the efficient operation of the Australian labour market. It delivers significant economic benefits; 457 visa holders pay their own way. They pay for their own health and they do not access welfare. Once again, I point out that they are totally legal. They have come to this country in a totally legal way.


But it is not just the coalition that is saying that this is a bad bill—and it is; it is a bad, bad bill. On 17 June this year, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and Migration Council Australia released an open letter that raised concerns at a lack of evidence and proper process associated with proposed changes to the 457 visa scheme in the bill, along with the considerable risks posed for investment, job creation and economic growth. The AIG, BCA and MCA all identify the proposed return of labour market testing as one of the most damaging initiatives in the bill. That was abandoned after a major departmental review in 2001, because it was not found to be effective. It was costly, ineffective and inferior to the system that we have in place today. The AIG, BCA and MCA specifically state:


Unwarranted regulation risks penalising all employers, their employees and skilled migrants, as well as undermining investment, skills transfer and development, and broader job creation to address a relatively small number of instances that may be dealt with through other means.


But all these groups do not just stop there in their criticism of the bill. They call on all parliamentarians to reject this bill unless:


the government provides hard evidence to back up its claims of widespread problems with the 457 program, and furthermore, shows why the few individual cases that have been identified …


Why can't they be managed within the scheme's existing frameworks? It has only been a few cases and they need to be examined under the existing structures. The groups continue:


the government subjects any proposed changes to the 457 visa scheme to a rigorous and transparent Regulatory Impact Statement before putting forward a legislative response.


As we have seen, the government has no hard evidence to back up its claims of widespread rorting of the 457 program, nor is it able to show how the few individual cases that have been identified cannot be managed within this particular program.


What we do know, though, is that this government, in conjunction with the unions, have started their scaremongering campaign and their false war—and it is a false war—on 457 visa holders. We know that employer confidence in the program has been significantly undermined. Most disturbingly, in the government's own report—theSubclass457 state/territory summary report: 2012-13 to 30 April 2013, from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship—there have been disturbing results. In my own home state of Queensland, there have been huge decreases in the number of primary applications granted in key areas that will have dramatic impacts on the economy and the community: in construction, we have them down by 10.2 per cent; in health care and social assistance, they are down by 11.8 per cent; in education and training, they are down by 6.4 per cent; in information, media and telecommunications, they are down by 14.6 per cent; in manufacturing, they are down by 12.8 per cent; in mining, they are down by a massive 32.3 per cent; and in professional, scientific and technical occupations, they are down by 12.8 per cent. What these figures show is the extent to which the government and unions have undermined the confidence of employers working in the engine room of the economy, an impact that will be felt by many constituents in my electorate and by the people of Queensland and Australia.


It is appropriate that I am speaking on this bill today, because this is an enormously significant bill for immigration in our country—and the government has lost its way. Not much has changed in the three years since the government lost its way, on this third anniversary, except for the fact that it is more lost than ever. Labor has definitely lost its way on this bill. The demonising of 457 visa holders who come to this country and contribute to our nation's wellbeing is a new low in divisive politics, even for this government and even for this Prime Minister. The role of government is to bring people together, not to set them against each other. Any government that seeks to pit Australians against other Australians for its own political gain is not fit for this office. The coalition remain consistent on our policy with 457 visas, a policy that all employers and all Australians can have faith in.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (18:01):  I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 today. Skilled migrants play a very valuable role in my electorate of Leichhardt. Whether it is as the chef at the local restaurant, a sugarcane worker, bed-and-breakfast operators or an engineer at one of our mines, these new migrants are employed, paying taxes and making a positive contribution to our society.


Unfortunately, the changes with this bill simply add to the burden of regulation and compliance on sponsors who use the 457 visa program. It represents a culmination of union and government campaigns to discredit the program and demonise foreign workers. It also highlights the absolute hypocrisy of the Gillard government, which clearly would prefer to see illegal boat arrivals put into the community on welfare rather than skilled migrants paying their own way and helping our economy to grow.


To state facts plainly, the measures contained in the bill require a thorough parliamentary inquiry. Skilled migration has been a key driver of Australia's economic performance, and the 457 program plays a very important role in securing the short- and long-term skilled migrants that Australia has always needed and will certainly go on needing in the future. More than half of all our permanent skilled visas sponsored by employers are granted to 457 skilled migration visa holders already in Australia, and 457 skilled migration visas account for more than 30 per cent of all permanent skilled migration in Australia.


What confuses me is that the Prime Minister and the previous minister for immigration spent years telling Australians and the international audience that they had the balance right on 457 skilled migration visas. Yet now, according to Labor scaremongering, there are 10,000 people rorting the system and it is out of control, so—guess what—let's have another knee-jerk reaction and again push something through the parliament and leave it for somebody else to mop up in the future. We now find that these proposed changes to the 457 scheme have not been based on any real rorting or widespread abuse, as the government claims. Labor has failed to produce any credible information from the department or anywhere else to suggest that widespread abuse exists.


Unlike Labor, we recognise the critical importance of skilled temporary migration to the Australian economy and to the wellbeing and living standards of all Australians. The coalition would never support the use of 457 skilled migration visas at the expense of Australian workers and would not tolerate any employer who tries to abuse the system.


As I have mentioned, in Leichhardt there are a wide range of businesses and organisations that benefit very much from this program. Among the hundreds of roles on the skilled occupation list, those relevant to my region include livestock and aquaculture roles, artists, professionals, tradespeople, park rangers, school teachers, university lecturers, childcare centre managers and fishery officers. However, it is hospitality and accommodation that are the keystones in our regional economy, and there are a number of roles that would not be filled if it were not for this program. From cafe and restaurant managers to chefs and cooks, to caravan, hotel and motel managers: these skilled migrants are vital and appreciated.


The Cairns Chamber of Commerce is a strong supporter of the 457 system, and it sees these visas as playing an important role in filling skill shortages, providing that the position cannot be filled locally. It recognises that our region has a small market in certain fields due to our location, particularly in higher skill positions. People holding these visas can work in Australia for up to four years, bring their families with them, and travel in and out of Australia as often as they want. This visa program exists to fill the temporary gaps and fluctuations in the market, and is very important in the tourism industry. These visas allow businesses to respond to any sudden need to fill positions. The chamber also works hard to ensure that the system has integrity and that our employers are actually doing the right thing.


I am not saying that the system is perfect by any means, but unfortunately the changes proposed by this bill fail to address any of the current flaws that I see in the system. I would like to highlight two case studies from Cairns. The first is a local Indian restaurant, Marinades, owned by Dev Rao. Dev is incredibly hard working and produces amazing food, but he has been driven to the wall because of the 457 visa situation for three reasons.


Firstly, as a result of new rules brought in, his chefs are not able to renew their 457s unless they pass an International English Language Testing System. While Dev appreciates that people living in a new country should learn the local language, the extent to which these chefs are exposed to English gives them a workable standard, but not enough to pass this very rigorous test. And understand this: these are not people coming here on full-time migration visas; they are coming here on 457 visas for up to four years. The skills that they have, particularly in the case of Dev, are skills that are picked up on the streets of places like Calcutta; they are not necessarily skills that come out of your normal trade schools and what have you.


Unfortunately, if a chef fails the test, Dev has two options: the chef can pack their bags and head back to India, or—this is really blew me away when I learnt about this—Dev must pay the chef an annual salary of $92,000, plus nine per cent super before the IELTS requirement is waived. This essentially says to the department of immigration that the chef is so important to the business that you cannot live without him. Dev did take the second option, and pays his chef what must be one of the best wages in the region. But again he is penalised because, as he says: 'I'm suffering financially. Restaurants don't make huge profit margins generally, but if I do find a candidate who has acceptable English, the department says that I'm not making enough profit, so how can I afford to be able to employ him?' They must realise that chefs in India who do speak good English are able to work in the Sheratons and other international chains. If they are that good, they do not need to leave their families and come to Australia to make the same money. Dev said that this must be addressed as the English language requirements are killing multicultural employers.


Secondly, Dev is required to ensure that his Australian employees receive industry training. Unfortunately, there is no accredited facility in Australia that teaches Indian cooking. Therefore, Dev has to create his own training modules, teach them, gain signatures from the staff to show that they have undergone the training, document all of this and then submit it to immigration. What a waste of time for a small business owner already battling staffing costs and compliance costs.


Thirdly, Dev tells me that the government-sponsored employment agencies will provide $6,000 to an employer if they give a new migrant on Centrelink benefits a job for 25 hours a week for 13 weeks. It does not matter if they do not speak a word of English; if they speak Hindi they can work in the kitchen. This is despite the fact that the chef on a 457 visa has worked for four years, understands all the health and safety laws, and yet is considered to be a risk to the community. It just does not make sense.


The second case I would like to highlight is that of the JCU dental school. This is a fantastic facility and one that I helped to establish. It trains young dentists and provides low-cost dental treatment to local residents. The dental school has five Irish dentists who, because they are not receiving enough hours at the dental clinic that brought them in on 457 visas, are volunteering their time to train students JCU students in Cairns. JCU wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, to see if they could legally employ them part time and pay them to continue training their students. As they said, 'We would of course prefer to pay these dentists, as it is unreasonable to expect them to volunteer their time continually.' Unfortunately, they were refused. Why, you ask, Madam Deputy Speaker? Because, even though medical doctors are able to work for other practices in addition to the one that sponsored them on their 457, dentists are not allowed to do so. JCU wanted the guidelines changed to allow the dentists to do likewise, which surely would have been a win-win situation on all fronts. The fact that this could not happen demonstrates yet another key flaw in the 457 process.


The bill that we are debating here today seeks to amend the Migration Act with a range of new requirements. It is important to note, from the feedback from Migration Council Australia, that a number of industry groups have been universally negative towards the new labour market testing regulatory requirements. I was in this place in 1996 when the 457 visas were first introduced and labour market testing applied. We remember that it proved to be cumbersome to implement and difficult to monitor, and it was dropped by the Howard government in 2001. Now Labor wants to reintroduce it by requiring certain classes of sponsors to undertake labour market testing for Australian workers, and show evidence of it, prior to recruiting from overseas using the 457 program. Employers are concerned that it will add to costs and delay for recruiting, for no effective purpose, if reintroduced. They also note that the costs to them for recruiting 457 workers from overseas are much higher than for recruiting a local worker, and overseas recruitment therefore only occurs when there are no local workers available. This is common sense to me. No employer is going to go to the effort and expense of recruiting and assisting a worker from overseas if somebody local down the road is suitable to fill that position.


Another key element of the bill is that it establishes the powers of authorised inspectors. There are two types of inspectors: compliance staff in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the workplace inspectors from Fair Work Australia. I recognise that feedback from industry groups has been less concerned with this aspect of the bill, in that they believe that the vast majority of employers will not be impacted and that any employer abusing the program should be identified. However, it should be noted that the bill also gives inspectors coverage of workers on student and working holiday visas in low-skill occupations with employers who do not have a sponsor obligation or role as such. In my electorate, many, many young people arrive on working holiday visas and seek to earn a bit of extra cash on their travels by picking fruit or working in one of the local bars or restaurants. Of course I do not condone any employer taking advantage of young people in this situation, but we need to be very, very careful that increased compliance costs are not seen to outweigh the benefits of employing these young people.


Lastly, the bill looks to extend the period that people can seek new sponsored employment. At the moment, if a 457 worker stops working for their sponsor, they have 28 days to find new sponsored employment or they must leave Australia. The bill proposes the extension of this time period to 90 days. This is consistent with one of the recommendations of the recent Migration Council Australia survey report and it has the support of industry groups. It provides some sensible flexibility to provide workers with a more realistic opportunity to find new sponsored employment. This particular element of the bill will certainly be supported.


As a whole, it is plain to see that this attack by Labor on skilled migration is a desperate distraction from their failed border protection policies. These policies have seen almost 700 boats arrive with more than 44,200 people on board, resulting in chaos and tragedy on our borders and more than $10 billion in budget blow-outs, not to mention the opening in my electorate near Weipa of the facility at the Scherger base, which has been converted from an Air Force base to a prison colony, which I think is absolutely appalling and certainly not the purpose for which it was built. 


The hypocrisy is quite blatant. The Gillard government would rather focus on discouraging skilled migrants who make a contribution from day one in favour of supporting illegal boat arrivals, who are put into the community on welfare. It just does not add up and that is why the coalition will not support this bill. We stand consistent in our policies on 457 visas and will be strong in policing our migration laws on our borders, in the community and in the workplace.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (18:15):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 and to support the outstanding contribution of the shadow minister, the member for Cook, and the subsequent statements by my coalition colleagues. What is abundantly clear to all on this side of the chamber is that the measures contained in this bill require parliamentary inquiry. As a result, I do not support the government's bill and I strongly support the amendment moved by the member for Cook.


Our nation has largely been built on skilled migration. We often hark back to the great engineering projects like the Snowy Mountains Scheme that have defined our nation's character. Skilled migration has been absolutely vital to these projects. Yet the Labor government are now attempting to ram through legislation that is nothing less than an attack on skilled migrants purely for short-term political purposes. This is also a hypocritical gesture as this government are determined to belittle and demonise overseas workers at the same time that they have 457 visa holders on their own staff in the highest office in the land. If the government's rhetoric is to be believed, their own staff members are stealing Australian jobs. As they well know, this is nonsense.


The government's bill has some serious problems, not least the fact that it has no regulatory impact statement and there has not been proper consultation. Just like in so many policy areas, this government seems determined to ignore the long-term consequences of its actions in the interests of its own short-term survival. This bill contains a bizarre back-to-the-future attempt to reintroduce labour market testing, which operated from 1996 to 2001 and was found at the time to be ineffective and costly, and produced a significant delay to employer recruitment action. The whole point of 457 visas was to enable the rapid assignment of skilled workers into vacant temporary positions, not to increase red tape and stifle the economy. As stated in a press release last year, the member for McMahon, the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, said:


Skilled migrants deliver major benefits to the Australian economy in terms of contributing to economic growth and offsetting the impacts of an ageing population.


Yet here is the Prime Minister attacking 457 visas to hide the inadequacies and incompetence of their failed border protection policies, which have enabled the arrival of 44,200 people on boats and contributed more than $10 billion to the current budget deficit. We must see Labor's attack on skilled migration for what it is: a desperate distraction designed to divert attention away from the chaos and tragedy that have occurred on our borders and their failed border protection policies.


The 457 visas are a well-established class of visa in Australia. They were introduced in 1996 and since then have grown in use and proven to be highly effective in meeting skill gaps in a number of industries for large resourcing or infrastructure projects. They are the dominant component of Australia's temporary skilled migration program and were hailed by this government as international best practice in facilitating access to skilled labour in 2011. The 457 visas are designed to provide a quick response to fluctuations in demand for skilled and semiskilled workers where such demand cannot be met by the Australian workforce. They allow a business to sponsor and employ someone from outside Australia in a skilled job. People holding this visa can work in Australia for up to four years, bringing their family with them, and travel in and out of Australia as often as they want.


The 457 visa program plays an important role in securing the short- and long-term skilled migrants that Australia always needed and will need well into the future. Around 70 per cent of 457 visa holders are in professional and managerial occupations, and the remainder contribute to trade, technical and clerical positions as part of the program. As at 30 April 2013, there were 810 primary 457 visa holders in Australia, up by 20 per cent on April 2012. 


Perhaps most concerning about this bill is that it is based on a false premise. The government have completely made up numbers to suggest the widespread abuse of the 457 visa scheme. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has publicly stated that there have been 10,000 cases of abuse in the program. However, he has subsequently admitted that he made this number up. He had no evidence to support it. The government have provided this House with no evidence of rorting, no inquiry from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship or from anywhere else to suggest that widespread abuse exists.


The government's own advisers say that there is no evidence of widespread rorting of the 457 skilled migration program. Demographer, Professor Peter McDonald, a member of the government's Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, has called the Prime Minister's rhetoric 'nasty'. Business, including representatives from the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia, as well as the Migration Council of Australia, have further disputed Labor's claims and condemned the Prime Minister for demonising 457 skilled migration visa holders.


Temporary skilled migration is vital to the efficient operation of the labour market. It delivers significant benefits to the Australian economy. The 457 visa holders pay their own way. They pay for health care; they do not access welfare. Yet this Labor government is effectively saying they prefer illegal boat arrivals who are put into the community on welfare, but skilled migrants who make a contribution from day one pay their own way and help foster growth in our economy and in our community.


The Prime Minister and the previous minister for immigration spent years telling Australians and international audiences that they have the balance right on 457 skilled migration visas, yet now the Prime Minister campaigns in Western Sydney, telling people that the system is out of control. Interestingly, the previous minister for immigration said in 2011 that anyone who tried to tell you the 457 visa program was not working needed to take another look at the facts. The Labor Party has failed to produce any evidence that the 457 visa program is failing or is being widely abused or rorted as it currently stands. I invite the Prime Minister and all members supporting this bill to take another look at the facts.


Under Labor, 457 skilled migration visa grants have grown to their highest level ever, with 125,070 visa applications granted between 2011 and 2012. If any rorts occurred, they happened on Labor's watch. Despite the Prime Minister's numerical fabrication, 457 visa holders represent less than one per cent of the Australian workforce. Yet despite this, skilled migration has been a key driver of Australia's economic performance. Labor's eagerness to trash-talk our skilled migration program by demonising skilled migration visas has two effects: it damages our international reputation and makes a mockery of the Asian century white paper, which barely lasted the Australian summer. It demonstrates that the Prime Minister has truly lost her way and has lost touch with the community she is elected to represent and to lead.


Since 2007-08 Labor has cut resourcing for compliance work in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, including 457 monitoring, by over $20 million or 30 per cent. Monitoring visits to employers are down by 67 per cent. The number of employer sponsors formally warned has also dropped by two-thirds. Just as Labor cannot protect our borders, they cannot police the immigration system here in Australia. Unlike Labor, the coalition's position on 457 skilled migration visas is simple, clear and consistent. We recognise the critical importance of skilled temporary migration to the Australian economy and the wellbeing and living standards of all Australians.


The 457 skilled migration visa program must be well managed. It must provide rapid access to skilled workers not available in the Australian labour market. It must have strong compliance action to assure high standards of program integrity. Skilled migrants have been vital to the building of our nation. Talking down skilled migration for political gain is a desperate distraction from the disastrous border protection policies and is a Labor tactic that just will not work with the Australian public. The coalition will be strong in policing our immigration laws and our borders—in the community and in the workplace. The coalition would never support the use of 457 skilled migration visas at the expense of Australian workers and would not tolerate any employer who tried to abuse the system.


Another effect of this bill is the immense burden of regulation, obligations, compliance and enforcement that it proposes to place on employer sponsors using 457 visa programs. It represents the culmination of a union and government campaign to discredit the program and demonise foreign workers. Early this year, Minister O'Connor's Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration put forward a number of sensible housekeeping measures to improve program integrity. Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest that these sensible departmental suggestions are being advanced by the government through this bill. Rather, the minister is plainly doing the bidding of the unions through labour market testing and Fair Work inspectors which position unions to play a more active role in workplaces with 457 visa holders and constrain the use of the program.


The coalition supports robust integrity in the 457 program and would support measures such as these to strengthen the program. Feedback on this program from the Migration Council of Australia and the responses of a number of industry groups to these changes have been universally negative towards the new labour market testing regulation requirements. Overall, the general view is that these changes are being driven by the union movement to improve union coverage and control of workplaces with 457 visa holders rather than being supported by any genuine evidence of widespread abuse in the program.


As mentioned, this bill re-introduces labour market testing requirements across all skilled level occupations. Under the bill, nominations from sponsors must demonstrate that they satisfy these new labour market testing requirements before a 457 visa is approved. These same labour market testing requirements applied when 457 visas were first introduced in 1996, however, they were dropped by the Howard government in 2001 after it became clear to us then that they were overly cumbersome to implement and difficult to monitor. 


Employers are concerned that the proposed re-introduction of this cumbersome obligation will add to costs and delay recruitment for no effective purpose. Employers note that the costs to them of recruiting 457 workers from overseas are much higher than a local worker. Overseas recruitment therefore only occurs when there is no local worker available. The bill does not make clear the actual period of labour market testing required but it is to be set based on the nominated occupation. Clearly, the requirements for labour market testing represent a significant regulatory impost on employer sponsors, yet the bill has been granted an exemption from a regulatory impact statement by the Prime Minister on the basis of unspecified exceptional circumstances. The bill therefore excludes any assessment of the real significant employer regulatory impacts.


The new labour market testing requirement undermines the very purpose of the 457 visa program which requires rapid filling of temporary skill shortages. The ability to quickly fill the vacancy by a skilled overseas worker is a paramount feature of the program. 


Indeed, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities was quoted in the Australian Financial Review as saying that when there are genuine skills shortages employers are able to quickly recruit temporary overseas workers through the 457 visa to fill skill gaps and keep the economy growing. However, the cumbersome process requirements proposed in this bill will add significantly to 457 recruitment lead times and costs. The extent of additional time and cost burdens for employers will be subject to decisions taken outside the legislation at ministerial and departmental levels on detailed aspects of the testing regime. Ultimately the time and cost burdens on employers as a result of these changes undermine the integrity of the 457 visa program and represent a desperate, ill-conceived move by a government focused too much on its short-term survival than the long-term wellbeing of the Australian economy supported by skilled migrants.


The coalition will not support this bill and is seeking referral to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislative Committee. The amendments moved by the coalition prove our consistent position on this policy issue. (Time expired)

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (16:43):  I am pleased to be able to continue my remarks on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. Before the debate was adjourned on Thursday, I was speaking about the general context of this legislation, in particular, suspicion in the community and in this parliament that the legislation is being constructed by the minister and the government for two reasons only: the first as an attempt to seek to divide Australians on the basis of place of birth for some sort of perceived political advantage; and, second, as an attempt to distract from their real policy failure—the decision to weaken Australia's border protection laws.


Over the past weeks the evidence that these suspicions are correct has proved compelling, so much so that the Australian Financial Review has concluded in its editorial this morning under the heading 'Populist policies an embarrassment' that:


The federal government has yet again been caught out using hyperbole to position the 457 visa scheme as a core issue in the populist politics that dominate its agenda. Freedom of Information documents obtained by The Australian Financial Review have revealed that Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor had no evidence from his department to back his claim in late April that there had been ""10,000 rorts"" of 457 visas as he sought to justify a government crackdown on the scheme. Mr O'Connor's error is an embarrassment to a government that will today attempt to force changes to the scheme through Parliament in a last ditch attempt to find issues it thinks will appeal to voters who are likely to desert it at the September 14 election. Its continued pitch to protectionist elements within the labour movement runs contrary to all objective evidence suggesting the 457 scheme is as a modest and controlled system for allowing guest workers to supplement the workforce.


If the government can provide no justification for changes to this visa then there is not a basis for this legislation.


The 457 is a temporary visa designed to fill temporary skills shortages in the short term. It can be held for a maximum of four years by the visa holder. The role of the government should be to analyse the figures, find out where the skills shortages are and provide Australians with the opportunity to gain the skills to fill these in-demand occupations. That is where the focus of this government needs to be. The government's cuts to higher education in the budget certainly do not assist with this goal.


A point that needs to be remembered is that it is a temporary visa only and the statistics show that it is working as intended. In 2012-13, Western Australia recorded 21.1 per cent of lodgement applications by location. This 6.4 per cent decrease on the number from the previous year demonstrates the flexibility of the current system and perhaps indicates a slowdown in the boom that many commentators, including the former resources minister, have been discussing. For members interested, the top nominated industry for application in Western Australia in the last year was mechanical engineering technician. There was a notable 51 per cent decrease in geologist 457 applications in Western Australia, however. The point to make here is that the 457 visa seems to be flexibly responding to the market conditions and doing exactly what it is supposed to do, and there would seem to be no need or justification to change that status quo.


I note that on 21 March 2012 the then immigration minister, Chris Bowen, stated: 'The statistics clearly show that the 457 visa program is working extremely well for Western Australia.' Referring to a young kid sitting at home in Kwinana, the Prime Minister said:


I believe we’ve got the visa settings right particularly with short term 457 visas.


On this basis, it was a surprise to many when straight after the third Rudd-Gillard leadership crisis in March, which precipitated the resignation of Minister Bowen, the new immigration minister, Brendan O'Connor, backed by the Prime Minister, starting putting about some divisive rhetoric on 457 visas—and I will speak about that divisive rhetoric. I was in my electorate on the weekend and met Mick from Atlanta, Georgia. He was originally from India but came through the USA and he is over in Western Australia doing a job for a company. No-one in Australia was available to do that work, so he was brought in from the USA on a 457 visa. He says that he now feels like he is the pariah in the system because of this legislation. He said that, because of this legislation, he feels as though he cannot tell anyone that he is on a 457 visa as he feels as though he is stealing other people's jobs. He asked me to please pass on a message to the government: 'I'm not here stealing anyone's jobs; I'm here because no-one else can do this job.' He said, 'I've been trained in the US to do it and that's why I'm here.'


The government started talking about rorts in the system and, under pressure to provide some sort of justification, the immigration announced 10,000 cases of abuse in the system. In trying to justify these comments on the program in March, Minister O'Connor referred in the House to a Department of Immigration and Citizenship document on strengthening the integrity of the 457 program, provided to his Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration earlier this year. However, when the coalition managed to obtain a copy of the document under freedom of information, we found that the document did not suggest any widespread rorting or concerns with the program, but rather put forward a number of sensible housekeeping measures to improve program integrity. Subsequently, it was revealed in the Financial Review that the minister's personal office admitted within two hours that it had no evidence to back up Minister O'Connor's claim of 10,000 rorts; however, the pretence has been kept up ever since—culminating in this legislation today.


The bill intends to amend the Migration Act to reinforce the obligations of employer sponsors of 457 visas; require prescribed classes of sponsors to undertake labour market testing for Australian workers prior to recruiting from overseas using the 457 program; require evidence of that labour market testing and provide for exemptions from labour market testing in some circumstances; enshrine the kinds of sponsorship obligations that the minister must ensure are prescribed in regulations; empower Fair Work inspectors under the Migration Act, including their access to employer premises, for the purposes of the act; provide for inspectors to determine whether an employer has contravened a civil penalty provision or other employer sanction provision; and extend the period that an employee can seek new sponsored employment from 28 days to 90 days. I understand feedback from the Migration Council of Australia and a number of industry groups to these changes has been universally negative towards the new labour market testing requirements in particular. It does seem that this is a major area of concern associated with this bill.


The people I employed from overseas never came on a 457 visa. They were from New Zealand, but we were required to employ them initially back in the eighties because there was a shortage of skilled refrigeration mechanics. I am sure the intent of most companies in Australia is to provide jobs to Australians before having to employ overseas people on 457 visas. So I do not support this bill.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (16:51):  The Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 is about a very serious matter, and that is the capacity of the country to bring in skilled workers when we cannot find those people in Australia, where we do not have the particular skills or skilled Australians are not prepared to move to parts of the country where the jobs are going begging. This is particularly the case in rural and regional Australia. I have to say that, without access to temporary sponsored visas—which we colloquially call 457 visas—the food manufacturing and processing industry in northern Victoria would have suffered very significantly from lack of human capacity.


Northern Victoria is an ideal place for conducting the business of raising pigs. Huge piggeries which are very scientifically advanced are to be found in places like Yarrawalla and on the Patho Plains. These are very sparsely populated areas. They are flat and they have access to good quality water, but they are a long way from any capital city. In fact they are a long way from major country towns. So when we try to employ qualified piggery managers or operatives, ideally with some veterinary background and experience, the owners and managers of these piggeries have drawn a blank. They have not been able to attract skilled workers to come and work in these piggeries. 


One enterprise I would like to refer to is at Yarrawalla, which is about three or four hours from Melbourne and about another hour or so from a major centre. They now have a skilled workforce who have been attracted by the use of the 457 visas—these people have come from the Philippines, where many of them had in fact been trained as veterinarians. I had the great pleasure of conferring citizenship upon the three families of these skilled workers in this local piggery this Australia Day. These younger family members now attend local schools. The schools were in decline in terms of their population numbers. As a result of these families now filling up the desks in small schools in places like Pyramid Hill, we have revitalised the communities themselves. 


So, as a consequence of being able to access the skilled workforce, in this case from the Philippines, to work in these enormous piggeries, some of the biggest in Australia, and benchmarked as world's best practice, we have also revitalised our communities and managed to have new citizens who can be given all the opportunities that our country has—with their young children now attending our local schools. We also have had numbers of 457 skilled workers taking up the important and significant work in our abattoirs in places like Tongala. 


Again, the local managers and owners of these abattoirs would be more than happy to engage local people, to employ local people, without going through the hassle of the application process for a person via a 457 visa. But unfortunately when they put out applications for workers in the abattoirs—these are skilled workers, people who can also take up a management position—they draw a blank. They do not get applicants for these positions. 


At the Tongala abattoir, run by Greenhams, a very successful, 100 per cent export abattoir that sends ground beef to the USA, they are now dependent on international backpackers for their workforce, given it has been made that much harder for them to attract skilled 457 visa holders. That abattoir is a major employer in its own right and it is of critical importance to the dairy industry, since it processes cattle that are no longer required to produce milk.


We have dairy operations in Kyabram in my area—again, some of these dairies are among the biggest milk producers in Australia. They employ 457 visa holders—again many of them from the Philippines—who are prepared to work long hours, the back-to-back shifts, in a dairy operation where there are thousands of cows milked over a 24-hour period, seven days a week. 


The suggestion guiding this legislation or what has prompted this legislation, we are told, is major rorting of the whole business of temporary sponsored visas in Australia. As the previous speaker said, when we asked for the evidence of this 'massive rorting'—apparently 10,000 rorts Minister O'Connor proclaimed in this place—none was forthcoming. An FOI inquiry could not give us any documentation or information that backed up the allegation that the 457 visa system was corruptly used and, to use the old-fashioned term, was simply being rorted. There is no evidence of systematic or widespread rorting of the system. In fact it is a brilliant scheme. 


I was particularly pleased when I was the shadow minister for immigration to track a lot of the sponsored visa holders, including Chinese workers who were making sure that abattoirs could still be operated along the Murray River. I tracked all of the state government employed 457 visa holders, who backfill the long-term vacancies in allied health positions through much of regional Australia and also in metropolitan Australia. It is ironic that some of the biggest employers of 457 visa holders in the country are state governments. 


I was shocked, I have to say, and I suspect my colleagues were equally amazed, to hear that the Prime Minister herself has even had to find a temporary sponsored visa holder to fill a media position in her office. I am not suggesting she rorted the system in finding that person. I am not suggesting that person is replacing somebody else. He undoubtedly has a unique set of employment characteristics that brought him to that position. This is not evidence of rorting the program. What I worry about is that again it is the dead hand of the unions getting engaged in a program where people who come do not typically end up joining a union; they simply go to work with the sponsor and they simply fill a position which has not been able to be filled by an Australian worker. 


We are told that this new legislation will require evidence of labour market testing to accompany an application for nomination. Does this government seriously think that employers do not first look around in an informal way and see if there is an applicant who is nearby or who can be lured after fairly careful efforts in recruitment? Does this government seriously think that employers turn first to a 457 visa holder, given the paperwork involved and given the costs involved in establishing a new temporary skilled visa holder in the workplace? Of course it is nonsense to suggest that the local market is not now tested by someone contemplating as a last resort having to go offshore to find themselves a temporary sponsored visa holder. That is not the case. 


And then we are told that there will be exemptions from the labour market testing regime in circumstances where there has been a 'major disaster' or where the skill level of the nominated occupation is equivalent to skill level 1 or skill level 2 as provided for in the Australian And New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations or ANZSCO. So we already have exemptions to all of this. Again there was an implication, I have to say, from the minister when he talked about the rorting, that a lot of these 457 visa holders were somehow being paid less than the equivalent locally employed person in the same industry in a similar job. Again, the evidence is to the contrary. When you are desperate to have someone give you the skilled work that you need to keep your enterprise going, when you perhaps look forward to a transfer of their skills or technology to further enhance your own domestically recruited workforce, you certainly do not lure them paying them less. You typically find that the 457 visa holder in my part of Australian is paid equivalent to or more than a locally engaged staff member. 


I have to say that in the case of my 457 visa sponsors they typically also find accommodation for the person, they ensure that families are properly accommodated and are quickly integrated into the community, because they are very concerned that their efforts in attracting the 457 visa holder do not lead to a very short-term relationship. They want that new skilled worker to stay. When the coalition was in government, the Australian expectation was that a lot of these skilled workers would in fact become Australian citizens and there was a rate of about 30 or 40 per cent conversions when we were in government to people taking up permanent residency and citizenship. I would hope that number has grown since that time.


So this Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill is based on a fallacy. The fallacy is that there is widespread rorting and abuse of a system which has skilled workers coming in to fill positions that cannot be filled in Australia. I now have in my area of northern Victoria numbers of employers who are in despair because they were able to access these sponsored visas in the past and now the red tape, the go-slows, the innuendos about their motives are such that they are finding that they cannot access the temporary sponsored visa regime at all. So what do they do? They cannot get local workers to step up and do the tasks. We are an area of declining population and we have a brain drain in our part of the world where people who are more technically qualified tend to leave the area and go to metropolitan alternative places to live and work. We have had an experience of the most superb workers coming and becoming enmeshed in our communities under this 457 visa scheme. 


I have to restate that in meddling with this scheme it appears to me to be nothing more than the dead hand of the unions trying to take control of a workforce with no regard to the needs of the employer, with no regard to the needs of the actual industry itself. There seems to be no perception or conception of the difficulties in rural Australia in attracting a skilled and qualified workforce. I think that is a huge shame. The fact that half of these amendments to the bill are to do with inspectors, enforceable undertakings with the minister, looking at special civil penalty provisions for those who have committed an offence against the relevant provisions—the whole thing sounds like the earlier era of some fascist regime. I think it is a shame. I with the coalition oppose this business. I hope that common sense will prevail or it will be just another piece of legislation we have to make sure does work when, if the Australian public sees fit, we return to office after 14 September. 


Finally, let me stress that this is an excellent government run skilled migration program which uses temporary sponsored visas. We have provisions in the regulations to ensure that people who come have an adequate English-language facility. We have within this set of migration regulations already adequate safeguards should there be a rare moment of someone trying to exploit the system. There are rules about wages that have to be paid. This was a well-managed system but, sadly, it has been destroyed under this government. If there is an abuse of the system now, let me say that it is by this government trying to insert into the workforce of Australia a whole lot of additional regulations which will simply make it harder for our manufacturing sector and our service sector, our health services sector, and will make them even more despairing of how they going to sustain and retain an adequate workforce. I have to hope for the sake of my piggeries, my abattoirs, my dairy operations, my hospitals, all the allied health professionals who come out here on a 457 visa; I have to say to them, 'Just hang on and we will do our best to make sure that the system is not destroyed as we wait for the next election.'

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2013-06-24,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:05):  I am quite staggered at the previous speaker. What an extraordinary contribution. I have heard her in this place on a number of occasions say she has 200 empty shops in Shepparton. If we allocate two jobs per shop, which is pretty moderate, that is 400 jobs gone in Shepparton. SPC said there would be a 500 jobs gone as a result of the cutbacks there. So that is 900 people in your town who have lost their jobs, yet you say we should be bringing people in from overseas to man the jobs in your electorate. That is what you said. You also made reference to a brain drain from your areas. Everyone left behind is brainless, are they? What an extraordinary contribution. We are desperately short of jobs in country Australia and this member is advocating that we bring people in from overseas to take what jobs we have got left there. Extraordinary. It never ceases to amaze me.



Dr Stone interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  The member in her Murray electorate has 7.1 per cent unemployment. I would think that means thousands of people without any employment in the electorate, and she is advocating that we bring people in from overseas to take what few jobs are there. What an extraordinary contribution. People come in here and they do not think at all or have absolutely no communion with ordinary people. Another extraordinary part of the member for Murray's contribution was that she was condemning the ALP. They brought in 125,000 people, whereas her mob brought in only 38,000 people. She should have been congratulating them. I am condemning the ALP for bringing in 125,000 people; she should be praising them.


The implication of the Liberal speakers in this debate is that Australians are lazy and useless. The member for Murray also added that we had a brain drain, so we need these people to come in. So we are also stupid. That was a most extraordinary contribution.


Why in the year of our Lord2013 do we suddenly need to bring in 100,000 migrant workers—section 457 workers—a year? About 200,000 migrants are actually coming in as well. So there are 300,000 people coming into Australia each year. I do not know how many jobs we have in Australia, but I know that we have lost 1,500 in my hometown of Charters Towers. When we were desperately waiting for the jobs to come down from the opening up of the giant coalfields called the Galilee Basin, which will double Australia's coal reserves, we suddenly found out that all of the big developers involved in it were announcing that they were going to bring their workers in from overseas. Who was facilitating it? Not the Liberals, but the Labor Party. Then the Labor Party wonders why they are on 29 per cent of the vote. Do you think all the people out there are stupid, do you? You bring 125,000 workers in here for one reason: to undermine our pay and conditions. 


When I walk out that door there I look with great pride at the picture of Charlie McDonald, the first member for Kennedy. I have copies of six of his first seven speeches to this place. Men literally died. Three were shot dead at the picket line at Dagworth Station and Waltzing Matilda was written two weeks later. The entire executive of the AWU was thrown in jail for three years with hard labour because they went on strike. When we fought and won our pay and conditions, one in 31 were going down the mine and dying. What did they do? They brought people from supercheap countries overseas to come in and take our jobs in the mines. Then they brought people in from supercheap countries to cut the cane in our canefields. We fought and died for the pay and conditions and then we got nothing out of it. Is it any surprise that about 100 years ago, the member for Kennedy—God bless him, his picture is out there—in six of his first seven speeches tried to protect the pay and conditions which they had fought and died for? But they have been sold out by the Labor Party. God help this country if the Liberals get in. They will bring in 400,000 workers a year. If they are praising the Labor Party for bringing in 125,000 workers, clearly they will bring in a hell of a lot more than that.


They say these workers are going to go back overseas. I have not noticed any in my electorate going back overseas. They are put in pretty permanent digs here. I think we are all human in this place and we do not like to throw people out of the country—



An honourable member interjecting—  




Mr KATTER:
  I would have to go along with the interjection—it is probably a bit of an exaggeration with respect to some people in this place. I do not notice these workers going home, but I do notice them bringing in their families. Even if you are bringing in only 300,000 a year, 200,000 migrants are now coming into the country every year. If you add those figures up over 10 years and the fact they are bringing in their families, what will be left for existing Australians? Where are we going to get jobs?


When a 457 worker is brought in, the employer holds the deportation order. He can send them back any time he likes. So he has much more than a master-servant relationship. If anyone says, 'They're not being brought in on account of pay and conditions; they are all paying award wages,' why are they bringing them in? Out of 1.3 million people seeking full-time employment in Australia we cannot find anyone to man the mines in the electorate of a member for Western Australia, who allowed 1,700 workers in because poor Gina could not find any workers for her mine in Western Australia. It is funny: Andrew Forrest could find them. I am told that he found almost 2,000. He trained up our First Australians. A lot of them do not speak English really well and a lot of them cannot read or write but, over a long period, he trained them and made them into very worthwhile employees. He still has 400 or 500 working in his mines today over in Western Australia. He can find them. But the member representing Fremantle and Rockingham has 25 per cent unemployment in his electorate, yet he is saying that we have to fly 1,700 people in from overseas to man the mines in his area. 


I am a person who believes in the power of the streets, the power of the ordinary people whom you run into when you walk down the street in your town. In my first speech in this place I said, with some anger and rage, 'Ask yourself the question: how many times have you walked down the street in your town and just listened to people—not talked to them but listened?' That day, after this big mining magnate in Western Australia made the statement: 'We have 1,700 workers to be flown in,' so they could work for, I would suspect, a lot less than she would get Australians working for—and my parliamentary Chief of Staff was with me—I said, 'We're going to record everyone we run into today who can't get a job.' That afternoon, in a little country town, we ran into nine people and the next morning we ran into nine people who had been seeking work for over a year. One of them came over to me and was almost in tears. He was selling his motorbike. He had been trying for over a year to get a start in the mines. He was a qualified tradesman and, as far as I was concerned, a decent bloke.


A week later, I was in the RSL in Townsville and nine young blokes—very decent style young blokes—all soldiers, all of them qualified tradesmen, had been applying for over six months to get a start in the mines, and they could not get a start in the mines.


The last speaker was crying about her farmers—probably a quarter of the farms in Queensland would be foreclosed on now if it was not for the jobs that we got in the mines. There would hardly be a family that did not have someone working in the mines in Queensland. Those properties are only allowed to survive because we have our sons and daughters working in the mines and, in many cases, the farmers themselves working in the mines. One of my very good friends, one of the Fish family, had to go away from his property for two years, working in very courageous circumstances in the mines to try and keep body and soul together. He came out and survived the crash at the time in the market and a drought that he was having. It was only those jobs in the mines that enabled us to survive.


As the last speaker said, some of her farmers have people working for them. I do not condemn them. Heaven only knows how they are making ends meet, but it would be worthwhile if the people in the opposition and the people in the government spent their time trying to give the farmers a fair go instead of forcing them to get people from overseas to work on their farms.


I am not going to go over today. We are not talking about the value of the dollar, which the Liberal Party doubled from 52c to over 90c. That drove all of our farmers in Australia into penury and closed stacks of mines in Australia, including mines in my own electorate.


The other thing that intrigues me is why we came to this conclusion in the year 2010. We never had to bring any section 457 workers in before that date. Why did we suddenly have to bring in 100,000 year? What went on? I suspect it is a very interesting story. I suspect that some people got in the ears of the government and I can tell you they were not trade union leaders as the last member of parliament asserted. I can assure you they are not. But some people got in the ears of the ALP government. They already control the mob on this side—they are all puppets on a string.


This mob over here who profess to look after the workers of Australia—shame upon them! That great party was founded on the principle that we do not fly in workers from overseas to take our jobs off us as Australians. There are a few people who need a bit of a kick in the backside and a bit of a cattle prod to go and do some work. That might be true and that was the fault of the free marketeers in this place who separated the function of writing the dole cheques from the function of allocating the jobs. They were separated under the free market policies—I cannot remember whether it was Keating or Costello, but one of them. Once those jobs were separated, there was no way you could compel anyone to work because they could continue on the dole indefinitely. The mechanisms for stopping the dole were completely destroyed.


The people involved in the job allocations have made an awful lot of money. I do not begrudge it to them. Good luck to them if they see the opportunity to make money. I do not begrudge it to the people who are getting 457 workers, particularly people like farmers. Who can begrudge it to them? What else are they expected to do?


We have a parliament that sits aside, and we are on a policy now of bringing in 20 million people over the next 10 or 15 years. Twenty million people are being brought into this country. Have we got enough expansion in jobs? Have we got enough money to pay our welfare? Have we got all these things so that we can afford to bring people in from overseas? Can we do that as a nation? Have you spoken to a person on the pension in the last few weeks? I have, and they are doing it damn tough. Yet you are bringing these 457 workers in to take those jobs worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.


Remember that all of our mining companies were flogged off to foreigners. The six mining companies that account for 85 per cent of our production were all Australian owned 16 years ago. Thanks to the Liberal Party, the National Party and the ALP, all of the six of them are gone. They all foreign owned. If we are not getting the wages—they go into the pockets of fly-in foreign workers—and if the profits are going into the pockets of foreign owners of the mines, what the hell do we Australians get out of the mining industry? A big hole in the ground: that is what we get! (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2013-06-24,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (17:20):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. This is another piece of legislation which must be condemned by this parliament. This bill has all the hallmarks of policy failings that this government is renowned for. It is a bill which is essentially seeking a headline rather than delivering good public policy for our nation. It is a bill which has been drafted without any facts to support its intent. It is a bill that seeks to distract Australians from the government's failed border protection policies.


Before I address some of the specifics of the bill, I think we need to reflect for a moment on the context in which this immigration bill is being presented to the parliament. When federal Labor was elected to government in 2007, there were just four people in detention. Under John Howard's leadership, the federal coalition government had successfully implemented a border protection policy which had essentially stopped the boats—a policy based on temporary protection visas, the Pacific solution and turning boats around, where safe to do so.


It was so successful that federal Labor endorsed the coalition's border protection policy in the lead-up to the 2007 federal election. But, as we now know, this election commitment would become just another broken promise.


It started in 2008 when the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, changed the rules and relaxed the processing procedures for those who arrived illegally by boat. The abolition of the Howard government's border protection policy sent a very clear message to people smugglers, and the message was that Australia was once again open for business to people smuggling or, at the very least, to those who could afford to pay the people smugglers for their passage to Australia.


Just over five years later, all Australians are paying a very big price for a policy which Mr Rudd created and Prime Minister Gillard has exacerbated. Since 2008 we have seen more than 700 boats arrive illegally on our shores. They have transported more than 44,200 illegal arrivals and the cost to the taxpayer has now topped $10 billion. These facts are very relevant to the bill we are debating today because all members would be very well aware how angry hardworking ordinary Australians are about this policy failing. It is this anger which the government is attempting to appease. It is the attention to this issue which the government hopes to distract with this legislation.


But the reality is the government cannot hide behind the facts. They failed with the East Timor solution, when Prime Minister Gillard did not even consult the East Timorese government. No-one was therefore surprised when it fell over. The Prime Minister then proposed the Malaysia solution, but Malaysia was not a signatory to the UNHCR refugee convention. Hence, another ill-conceived thought bubble never saw the light of day and was never brought before this parliament for a vote. And as the government struggled through a botched policy process the boats kept coming, the number of illegal arrivals exploded—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member might like to refer his remarks to the bill before the House.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  I am. This is very relevant to the bill.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member is not referring to the bill.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  It is very relevant to the bill before the House, Deputy Speaker. I am putting the bill in context; it is very relevant. We had the number of arrivals exploding, which brings us to where we are today: a desperate attempt to create a distraction. The government has confected an issue alleging systematic abuse of 457 visas. That is despite the government's own advisers saying there is no evidence of the widespread rorting of the 457 migration program. 


While it is true that under this Labor government the number of 457 skilled migration visas issued has grown to their highest level, the government has failed to demonstrate that this has occurred because Australian employers are employing skilled workers from overseas in preference to Australian workers. Indeed, it is clear that the majority of Australian businesses prefer employing Australians who have the skills rather than employing skilled people from overseas, but the reality is that many businesses cannot find someone with the skills and experience they are seeking. Given such a circumstance, one would have thought the government would have welcomed a situation where businesses which cannot find Australians with the skills to fill a vacant position would employ an overseas worker through the 457 visa program. The 457 visa recipient would earn wages, pay their bills, pay taxes, cover the cost of things such as health care—they would be contributing to our nation's productivity and delivering a skill which would otherwise not be available. In most other progressive democracies this would be viewed as a good thing, but not in Australia under this government. This government would prefer to support illegal boat arrivals.


It is ludicrous that this situation would exist in Australia, but we should not be surprised by this government's approach to those who wish to contribute to our nation's wealth and we should not be surprised by this government's attempt to demonise Australian businesses. What is happening here is that uncertainty for business is being created, business confidence is being undermined and we are putting a brake on growth. It is of great concern. The 457 migration program plays an important role in securing short- and long-term skilled migrants that Australia has always needed and will need into the future, and we need certainty.


In my electorate there is a dependence on 457 visas. Over the past decade we have seen an explosion in the blueberry industry on the Coffs Coast. We have seen double-digit growth in blueberry production and this has been delivered through two major business models. Costa Berries, or Blueberry Farms of Australia, as many know them, is a massive operation which employs more than 2,000 people over a 12-month period. They produce premium blueberry product which generates tens of millions of dollars in wages and the cost of production, but their work is very labour intensive. Peter McPherson of Blueberry Farms has advised me of the difficulties of recruiting highly skilled labour in the field of horticulture. The business is reliant on the use of 457 visas and it brings workers in from countries such as Mexico and Chile. Why does the government want to impose more red tape on this business? Why is the government so keen to drive up the cost for this important industry?


Also on the Coffs Coast is a group of around 70 farmers who independently grow blueberries. Many of these farmers are members of the Indian community, which is heavily involved in the local community, particularly in the area of Woolgoolga. These farmers have got together and built a processing facility and they call their venture Oz Berries. The ongoing expansion of Oz Berries is one of the true industry success stories on the Coffs Coast. The processing facility was established in 2006 with the support of a $233,000 grant from the Howard government. From day one it has been a challenge to cope with the growth within this industry. Stage 1 was complete, then they leased a neighbouring building, and only last year installed a new packing machine to improve the service provided to local farmers. The exponential growth of the blueberry industry has been great for farmers and a real boost to the local economy. Today Oz Berries employs more than 60 people and turns over more than $27 million each year. The 70 farmers employ hundreds of additional people on their properties. Both Oz Berries and Costa Berries are vital to our local economy and they both need to use 457 visas in order to get the skills and the labour that they need.


I would like to address some of the specifics of the legislation in the time I have left. The bill will do a number of things. It will be amending the Migration Act to reinforce the obligations of sponsors of 457 visas. It will require prescribed classes of sponsors to undertake labour market testing for Australian workers prior to recruiting from overseas using the 457 visa program. It will require evidence of that labour market testing and provide for exemptions from labour market testing in some circumstances. It will enshrine the kinds of sponsorship obligations that the minister must ensure are prescribed in regulations. It will empower Fair Work inspectors under the Migration Act, including their access to employer premises for the purpose of the act. It will provide for inspectors to determine whether an employer has contravened a civil penalty provision or other employment sanctioned provision. And it will extend the period that an employee can seek new sponsored employment from 28 days to 90 days. So here we go again: the heavy hand of a federal government is effectively going to make the 457 application process not worth the effort of applying. The whole intention of the 457 visa system is to provide a quick solution—and I stress 'quick solution'—to the fluctuations in demand for skilled and semiskilled workers where such demand cannot be met by the Australian workforce. But this government wants to make it so difficult that business will throw its arms up in the air and say it is all just too hard.


Not only is this legislation wrong; it also represents another broken promise from this government. I remind members opposite of some of the comments made by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and other members of the Labor government. I will start with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said in a doorstop interview in Beijing on 27 April 2011:


So I’ve got a very clear focus on lifting labour force participation by Australians and lifting skills—so a young kid sitting at home in Kwinana without a job and without any hope can get the skills he or she needs to get that opportunity in the northwest of our country. Now even with increased labour force participation and increased skills we will need skilled migration. I believe we’ve got the visa settings right particularly with short term 457 visas. 


'I believe we've got the visa settings right' were the Prime Minister's words. It cannot get any clearer than that. The Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, Wayne Swan, had an interview with Chris Uhlmann on 7.30 on 20 April 2007. Uhlmann asked:


You've been talking a lot about workforce participation recently, but do you still need to lift the skilled migration intake? 


The Treasurer said:


Well certainly what we do need to do is to respond to the needs of our economy, and we have done a lot domestically in terms of training skilled labour. We will have to do more and we'll also have to do as much as we possibly can to lift domestic labour force participation. And the Prime Minister has made that very clear.


I think you would be aware that in terms of temporary skilled labour, the 457 program is not capped, so business does have the opportunity to bring in more skilled migrants, should they require them, for particular projects. 


So both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have been spruiking their support for the 457 visa program, but now, because of the asylum seeker debacle, they have decided to target skilled migration.


The coalition believe there should be a crackdown on any rorting of the 457 visa system but it is incumbent on the government in the first instance to produce the evidence that demonstrates that there is a problem. As we debate this legislation today this government has been unable—and I stress 'unable'—to table any evidence. As a result, the coalition will not support this bill and we will seek to refer it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. We will oppose this legislation and call on members opposite not to let this government further undermine the productive capacity of our nation.


This is government by the unions for the unions. You would imagine that the government would have learnt by now that bad policy is bad politics. This is another example of bad government policy foisted upon this country because the government needs a political distraction. We will oppose this legislation. It is bad legislation: it is bad for business and it is bad for our nation.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:33):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013. On what is now possibly the fourth last day of this 43rd Parliament the government is attempting to ram through this migration legislation, a contrived solution from this Labor government to a nonexistent problem. The coalition has serious concerns with this bill because it adds to the burden of regulation, obligations, compliance and enforcement on employer sponsors using the 457 visa program. This bill is the culmination of a union and government campaign to discredit the program and demonise foreign workers for political gain.


The 457 visa was introduced in 1996 and is the dominant component of Australia's temporary skilled migration program. In general, this visa allows a business to sponsor and employ someone from outside Australia in a skilled job. People holding this visa can work in Australia for up to four years, bring their family with them and travel in and out of Australia as often as they want. They pay their own way, including health care, and they do not access welfare.


People holding this visa can work in Australia for up to four years, bring their family with them, and travel in and out of Australia as often as they want. They pay their own way, including healthcare, and they do not access welfare. Fundamentally, the program is designed to provide a quick response to fluctuations in demand for skilled and semi-skilled workers where such demand cannot be met by the Australian workforce. Therefore, temporary skilled migration is vital to the efficient operation of the labour market, delivering significant benefits to the Australian economy.


Since its introduction the 457 visa program has grown in use and proven to be highly effective in meeting skill gaps in a number of industries for large resource or infrastructure projects. Approximately 70 per cent of 457 visa holders are in professional or managerial occupations, while 30 per cent are in trade, technical and clerical positions. According to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's Subclass 457: summary reportfor 2012-13, as at 13 April 2013 there were 108,810 primary 457 visa holders in Australia. This figure is up by 20 per cent on April 2012. This represents less than one per cent of Australia's workforce.


I strongly welcome the contribution of migrants to this country. On this point I note that the 457 program is not about what country people happen to come from but rather about what skills they can offer and what they can contribute to Australia. In 2012-13 some 21.1 per cent of applications granted were for citizens of India, 19.6 per cent from the United Kingdom and 8.3 per cent from the Republic of Ireland, while many countries from Asia, including the Philippines, China, South Korea, Japan, Nepal and Malaysia make up a significant component of 457 workers. These figures reflect the fact that Australia is a very attractive place to come to work and that people from all across the world want to contribute to the Australian economy and to Australian society.


The bill amends conditions in four areas: first, it introduces new labour-market testing; second, it amends rules relating to sponsor obligations and undertakings; third, it establishes powers of authorised inspectors; and, last, it extends the period during which a 457 worker can find new sponsored employment.


The most concerning aspect of this bill relates to the reintroduction of labour-market testing. At present, skills shortages are based on inclusion of an occupation on the Consolidated Skilled Occupation List, CSOL, which is updated annually by DIAC, drawing on advice from Skills Australia. These changes will require employers to provide evidence of labour-market testing, including information about their efforts to recruit Australian workers, relevant labour-market research trends, expressions of support from relevant Commonwealth or state authorities and any other evidence determined to be relevant. The actual period of labour-market testing required is not clear in this bill but will likely be variable, depending on the occupation.


These changes represent a significant regulatory impost on employer-sponsors. However, the Labor government has neglected to provide a regulatory impact statement, because the Prime Minister's office granted an exemption based on unspecified exceptional circumstances. This is despite the fact that labour-market testing requirements will undermine the very purpose of the 457 program to rapidly fill temporary skills shortages. Adding draconian measures such as labour-market testing to visa approval processes will add significantly to 457 recruitment lead-times and costs. At the very least, a full analysis  of such potential impacts of this bill must be clarified in a regulatory impact statement, let alone in a full  Senate inquiry as proposed by the coalition.


The Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and the Migration Council of Australia have together called this, 'unwarranted legislation which risks penalising all employers, their employees and skilled migrants, as well as undermining investment, skills transfer and development, and broader job creation. In fact, in the DIAC document on the 457 program produced earlier this year, obtained by the shadow minister for immigration under freedom of information, labour-market testing is not suggested or even mentioned. Clearly, the department does not believe that this is a worthy proposal—and neither does the coalition.


The strongest disincentive against abusing this program is that the costs involved in recruiting an overseas worker are significantly higher then when recruiting an Australian worker. It simply does not make rational economic sense for an employer to spend considerably more money to bring in someone from overseas, when the labour supply already exists in Australia to do that same job at the same level.


That does not mean that the system is perfect. I have heard from constituents who are concerned that their employer might be discriminating against Australians in favour of workers on 457 visas. It is absolutely critical that those concerns are reported and that DIAC identifies if an employer is abusing the 457 program. However, while individual cases have been identified, the Labor government has not in any way demonstrated why they cannot be handled within current safeguards. For months this Labor government has claimed that there has been widespread rorting of 457 visas, yet it has failed to produce any real evidence that it exists. This bill is therefore based on a false premise. In May this year, the minister publicly claimed that there were in excess of 10,000 cases of illegitimate use of 457 visas. He later admitted that he was merely 'making a forecast' and admitted that he did not have an exact or precise figure. 


In fact, we need only look at what the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and previous ministers for immigration have been saying on 457 visas. In 2011, the Prime Minister claimed


I believe we've got the visa settings right particularly with short-term 457 visas.


The then minister, the member for McMahon, publicly declared:


… demand-driven migration is delivering migrants effectively to the regions where they are needed—exactly how the 457 visa program is supposed to work. And anyone who tries to tell you the 457 visa program is not working, needs to take another look at the facts.


As recently as 20 January 2013, only five months ago, the then minister said:


The 457 visa program is designed to address genuine labour shortages that cannot be met from the Australian labour market and we believe we have this balance right.


What we see with the measures in today's bill, however, is this government inventing a problem. This Labor government has concocted a cynical, political ploy to demonise 457 workers to the detriment of the Australian labour market and the Australian economy. Those who know what is actually happening on the ground have pointed out to this government that there is absolutely no evidence of problems or rorting. The minister cannot produce an inquiry from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, because such an inquiry does not exist and there has been no reason to hold one.


Business groups, including representatives from the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and Migration Council Australia, have all disputed Labor's claims and have condemned the Prime Minister for demonising 457 skilled migration visa holders. They have called on parliament to reject this bill unless, as they said, 'the government provides hard evidence to back up its claims of widespread problems with the 457 program'. In fact, this government's own advisers have said that such evidence does not exist. This includes Michael Easson, chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, who said:


I do not believe that there is any credible evidence that the management of the 457 visa program is out of control …


Demographer Professor Peter McDonald, a member of the government's advisory council, has labelled the rhetoric coming from this government as 'nasty'. 


Since 2007-08, as a result of Labor's mismanagement of the budget—now approaching $300 billion of gross debt—the government has cut resources for compliance work in DIAC, including 457 monitoring, by over $20 million, or 30 per cent. This government has reduced monitoring visits to employers by two-thirds, and the number of employer-sponsored formal warnings has also dropped by two-thirds. The track record of this Labor government demonstrates that it has not been serious about supporting the safeguards already in place, and we must treat the measures in today's bill in that context. 


The shadow minister for immigration has therefore proposed an amendment which proposes that consideration of this bill not be concluded until we know all the facts about why we should consider this bill in the first place and what ramifications it will have should it be passed. This means that three processes must take place: firstly, that DIAC completes a full research report on the true incidence and nature of abuses and non-compliance within the 457 visa program, in comparison to other programs, to substantiate the requirement for the measures; secondly, that consultation by DIAC take place with industry and other stakeholders on the impacts of the measures contained in the bill; and, thirdly, that the government produce a regulatory impact statement related to the proposed labour market testing regime, as required by the Office of Best Practice Regulation. Only when these actions take place can this parliament truly assess the merit of this bill.


The coalition's position on 457 skilled migration visas is simple, clear and consistent. We recognise the critical importance of skilled temporary migration to the Australian economy and the well-being and living standards of all Australians. The 457 skilled migration visa program must be well-managed, providing rapid access to skilled workers not available in the Australian labour market and with strong compliance action to ensure high standards of program integrity. The coalition would never support the use of 457 skilled migration visas at the expense of Australian workers, and would not tolerate any employers who try to abuse the system. We must recognise, however, that skilled migrants have made a vital contribution to the building of our nation.


The coalition will not support this bill and is seeking referral to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The coalition has always been consistent on 457 visas and will be strong on policing our immigration laws on our borders, in the community and in the workplace.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (17:46):  The Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 must rank as one of the most disgraceful bills ever to come before this parliament. The bill adds to the burden of regulation obligations and compliance enforcement on employer sponsors using the 457 visa program. If one is to subscribe to the view that bills should only be presented in this place if they address a real and known mischief or for a bona fide purpose, then this bill fails on all accounts.


Ostensibly, the government claims that this bill is necessary to stop the rorts of the 457 visa scheme, but, when asked to produce evidence of these great rorts, Minister O'Connor first claimed that there were 10,000 cases of abuse. Only later, he incredulously said that the figure had been made up and he tried to back out of it. There is no evidence in the department, there are no reports, showing this alleged 10,000 cases of abuse in the program. Make no mistake, this bill has nothing to do with what is good for Australia—absolutely nothing to do with what is good for our country. 


This bill is about a desperate and dysfunctional government doing anything, saying anything, and attacking anybody in a last-ditch attempt to stay in power. It is all about the Prime Minister pitching to divide immigrants, seeking to create a stir in Western Sydney and scaremongering about foreigners taking the jobs of Australians. This bill declares a false war on skilled migrants to this country, and it is doing that because it is trying to support the unions and it is trying to stir up some perverse attempt to pit the political welfare of the unions against the good of this nation.


There is no crisis in the 457 visa program. There is no evidence of systematic rorting. What there is, though, is an overwhelming evidence of systemic policy failure by this government, and, in case anyone has any doubt about that, let us consider these not-so-impressive facts. After six years of the Rudd-Gillard government, Labor has delivered runaway cost of living increases. Labor has broken its promise on the carbon tax, and there is its administration of private health insurance, along with Grocery Watch and FuelWatch. We have seen a complete loss of control of the federal budget, with five consecutive budget deficits—with even more deficits forecast for the coming years. There is record government debt now approaching $300 billion and a yearly interest bill of $8 billion, and we have had a complete failure of border protection policies with almost 45,000 arrivals on 733 illegal boats resulting in a $10 billion budget blow-out. There was the gross incompetence and mismanagement of major projects like the overpriced school halls. There were the dangerous roof batts and now there are the blow-outs and delays with the National Broadband Network. And, of course, who can forget the ongoing saga that we are subjected to day and night of disunity, chaos and dysfunction with the Julia and Kevin soap opera of 'Who wants to be Prime Minister?' What is evident is that these proposed changes are being driven by not only an increasingly irrelevant union movement to improve union coverage and control of workplaces with 457 visas but also a desperate government and a desperate Prime Minister who are prepared to trash Australia's history of a migrant success story as part of their deeply flawed political strategy of class, gender and now ethnic warfare. 


Immigration has made Australia the nation we are today. Many of Australia's most significant nation-building infrastructure projects are built on the back of migrant labour. The most famous of these is the Snowy Mountains Scheme. In my own electorate of Brisbane, migrants helped to build the iconic Story Bridge. This theme of contribution and achievement throughout the nation is one that existed in the past and continues today. Another example from my electorate of Brisbane can be seen with the researchers employed under the 457 scheme at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, where world-leading research is being undertaken at the moment into AIDS and HIV, as well as dengue fever and malaria. Doctors on 457 visas provide health care to the people of Brisbane at the Royal Brisbane Hospital and at other hospitals in my electorate, but under this bill those doctors are 457 visa holders; they are second-class citizens. 


Immigration has made us a stronger Australia. Community confidence in the immigration program provides a foundation for social harmony and the continued success of our immigration program. As Judge Rauf Soulio said in his welcoming address at the inaugural Australian Multicultural Council lecture last year, 'multicultural Australia transcends the usual division of politics' and 'diversity is a defining strength of Australia'. Well, not any more. If this desperate and divisive government has its way with this bill, what we will have here is a divided country—a country made up of first- and second-class citizens; a country of those who are Australian and who were born here and those who are second class who were not born here. 


As a daughter of Italian migrant parents, I find this bill deeply offensive. My parents, like so many migrants from all over the world, came to this country seeking a better life. They were not born here, but they made Australia home for themselves and their children. They worked hard. They went to where the jobs were. They cut cane in North Queensland, and later they owned and operated the local corner store. I see the member for Indi is sitting at the table. Her parents, who are of Greek origin, also operated a local corner store. They worked hard, as did my parents. My parents then went on to run supermarkets. They were successful in developing a seafood export and wholesale business, which expanded to include one of Brisbane's finest dining restaurants. Since World War II, immigrants like my parents transformed Australia from a nation of some seven million to more than 22 million people from 260 different cultural backgrounds. In that time, immigration has seen more than seven million people settle here, including 750,000 refugees. Australia is arguably and without question one of the most successful immigration nations in the world, but the bill before us in the chamber today puts all of that at risk. 


In the event that there is any ambiguity, it is worth looking at exactly what the 457 visa actually does as opposed to what the government falsely claims it does. The 457 visa class was introduced in 1996 and has been highly effective in meeting skills gaps. That is why it was brought in: to meet skills gaps in a number of industries and for large resourcing and infrastructure projects. The majority of 457 visa holders are professional and managerial occupations and, as at 30 April 2012, there were 108,810 primary 457 visa holders in Australia. That is less than one per cent of Australia's workforce. So much for Labor's and the unions' scaremongering about stealing the jobs of other Australians!


The 457 skilled migration visa program plays an important role in securing the short-term and long-term skilled migrants whom Australia has always needed and will always need into the future. More than half of all permanent skilled visas sponsored by employers are granted to skilled migration visa holders who are already legally in Australia, and 457 skilled migration visas account for more than 30 per cent of all permanent migration to Australia.


The 457 visa is the dominant component of Australia's temporary skilled migration program. It is designed to provide a quick response to fluctuations in demand for skilled and semiskilled workers where such demand cannot be met by the Australian workforce. Temporary skilled migration is vital to the efficient operation of the Australian labour market. It delivers significant economic benefits; 457 visa holders pay their own way. They pay for their own health and they do not access welfare. Once again, I point out that they are totally legal. They have come to this country in a totally legal way.


But it is not just the coalition that is saying that this is a bad bill—and it is; it is a bad, bad bill. On 17 June this year, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and Migration Council Australia released an open letter that raised concerns at a lack of evidence and proper process associated with proposed changes to the 457 visa scheme in the bill, along with the considerable risks posed for investment, job creation and economic growth. The AIG, BCA and MCA all identify the proposed return of labour market testing as one of the most damaging initiatives in the bill. That was abandoned after a major departmental review in 2001, because it was not found to be effective. It was costly, ineffective and inferior to the system that we have in place today. The AIG, BCA and MCA specifically state:


Unwarranted regulation risks penalising all employers, their employees and skilled migrants, as well as undermining investment, skills transfer and development, and broader job creation to address a relatively small number of instances that may be dealt with through other means.


But all these groups do not just stop there in their criticism of the bill. They call on all parliamentarians to reject this bill unless:


the government provides hard evidence to back up its claims of widespread problems with the 457 program, and furthermore, shows why the few individual cases that have been identified …


Why can't they be managed within the scheme's existing frameworks? It has only been a few cases and they need to be examined under the existing structures. The groups continue:


the government subjects any proposed changes to the 457 visa scheme to a rigorous and transparent Regulatory Impact Statement before putting forward a legislative response.


As we have seen, the government has no hard evidence to back up its claims of widespread rorting of the 457 program, nor is it able to show how the few individual cases that have been identified cannot be managed within this particular program.


What we do know, though, is that this government, in conjunction with the unions, have started their scaremongering campaign and their false war—and it is a false war—on 457 visa holders. We know that employer confidence in the program has been significantly undermined. Most disturbingly, in the government's own report—theSubclass457 state/territory summary report: 2012-13 to 30 April 2013, from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship—there have been disturbing results. In my own home state of Queensland, there have been huge decreases in the number of primary applications granted in key areas that will have dramatic impacts on the economy and the community: in construction, we have them down by 10.2 per cent; in health care and social assistance, they are down by 11.8 per cent; in education and training, they are down by 6.4 per cent; in information, media and telecommunications, they are down by 14.6 per cent; in manufacturing, they are down by 12.8 per cent; in mining, they are down by a massive 32.3 per cent; and in professional, scientific and technical occupations, they are down by 12.8 per cent. What these figures show is the extent to which the government and unions have undermined the confidence of employers working in the engine room of the economy, an impact that will be felt by many constituents in my electorate and by the people of Queensland and Australia.


It is appropriate that I am speaking on this bill today, because this is an enormously significant bill for immigration in our country—and the government has lost its way. Not much has changed in the three years since the government lost its way, on this third anniversary, except for the fact that it is more lost than ever. Labor has definitely lost its way on this bill. The demonising of 457 visa holders who come to this country and contribute to our nation's wellbeing is a new low in divisive politics, even for this government and even for this Prime Minister. The role of government is to bring people together, not to set them against each other. Any government that seeks to pit Australians against other Australians for its own political gain is not fit for this office. The coalition remain consistent on our policy with 457 visas, a policy that all employers and all Australians can have faith in.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (18:01):  I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 today. Skilled migrants play a very valuable role in my electorate of Leichhardt. Whether it is as the chef at the local restaurant, a sugarcane worker, bed-and-breakfast operators or an engineer at one of our mines, these new migrants are employed, paying taxes and making a positive contribution to our society.


Unfortunately, the changes with this bill simply add to the burden of regulation and compliance on sponsors who use the 457 visa program. It represents a culmination of union and government campaigns to discredit the program and demonise foreign workers. It also highlights the absolute hypocrisy of the Gillard government, which clearly would prefer to see illegal boat arrivals put into the community on welfare rather than skilled migrants paying their own way and helping our economy to grow.


To state facts plainly, the measures contained in the bill require a thorough parliamentary inquiry. Skilled migration has been a key driver of Australia's economic performance, and the 457 program plays a very important role in securing the short- and long-term skilled migrants that Australia has always needed and will certainly go on needing in the future. More than half of all our permanent skilled visas sponsored by employers are granted to 457 skilled migration visa holders already in Australia, and 457 skilled migration visas account for more than 30 per cent of all permanent skilled migration in Australia.


What confuses me is that the Prime Minister and the previous minister for immigration spent years telling Australians and the international audience that they had the balance right on 457 skilled migration visas. Yet now, according to Labor scaremongering, there are 10,000 people rorting the system and it is out of control, so—guess what—let's have another knee-jerk reaction and again push something through the parliament and leave it for somebody else to mop up in the future. We now find that these proposed changes to the 457 scheme have not been based on any real rorting or widespread abuse, as the government claims. Labor has failed to produce any credible information from the department or anywhere else to suggest that widespread abuse exists.


Unlike Labor, we recognise the critical importance of skilled temporary migration to the Australian economy and to the wellbeing and living standards of all Australians. The coalition would never support the use of 457 skilled migration visas at the expense of Australian workers and would not tolerate any employer who tries to abuse the system.


As I have mentioned, in Leichhardt there are a wide range of businesses and organisations that benefit very much from this program. Among the hundreds of roles on the skilled occupation list, those relevant to my region include livestock and aquaculture roles, artists, professionals, tradespeople, park rangers, school teachers, university lecturers, childcare centre managers and fishery officers. However, it is hospitality and accommodation that are the keystones in our regional economy, and there are a number of roles that would not be filled if it were not for this program. From cafe and restaurant managers to chefs and cooks, to caravan, hotel and motel managers: these skilled migrants are vital and appreciated.


The Cairns Chamber of Commerce is a strong supporter of the 457 system, and it sees these visas as playing an important role in filling skill shortages, providing that the position cannot be filled locally. It recognises that our region has a small market in certain fields due to our location, particularly in higher skill positions. People holding these visas can work in Australia for up to four years, bring their families with them, and travel in and out of Australia as often as they want. This visa program exists to fill the temporary gaps and fluctuations in the market, and is very important in the tourism industry. These visas allow businesses to respond to any sudden need to fill positions. The chamber also works hard to ensure that the system has integrity and that our employers are actually doing the right thing.


I am not saying that the system is perfect by any means, but unfortunately the changes proposed by this bill fail to address any of the current flaws that I see in the system. I would like to highlight two case studies from Cairns. The first is a local Indian restaurant, Marinades, owned by Dev Rao. Dev is incredibly hard working and produces amazing food, but he has been driven to the wall because of the 457 visa situation for three reasons.


Firstly, as a result of new rules brought in, his chefs are not able to renew their 457s unless they pass an International English Language Testing System. While Dev appreciates that people living in a new country should learn the local language, the extent to which these chefs are exposed to English gives them a workable standard, but not enough to pass this very rigorous test. And understand this: these are not people coming here on full-time migration visas; they are coming here on 457 visas for up to four years. The skills that they have, particularly in the case of Dev, are skills that are picked up on the streets of places like Calcutta; they are not necessarily skills that come out of your normal trade schools and what have you.


Unfortunately, if a chef fails the test, Dev has two options: the chef can pack their bags and head back to India, or—this is really blew me away when I learnt about this—Dev must pay the chef an annual salary of $92,000, plus nine per cent super before the IELTS requirement is waived. This essentially says to the department of immigration that the chef is so important to the business that you cannot live without him. Dev did take the second option, and pays his chef what must be one of the best wages in the region. But again he is penalised because, as he says: 'I'm suffering financially. Restaurants don't make huge profit margins generally, but if I do find a candidate who has acceptable English, the department says that I'm not making enough profit, so how can I afford to be able to employ him?' They must realise that chefs in India who do speak good English are able to work in the Sheratons and other international chains. If they are that good, they do not need to leave their families and come to Australia to make the same money. Dev said that this must be addressed as the English language requirements are killing multicultural employers.


Secondly, Dev is required to ensure that his Australian employees receive industry training. Unfortunately, there is no accredited facility in Australia that teaches Indian cooking. Therefore, Dev has to create his own training modules, teach them, gain signatures from the staff to show that they have undergone the training, document all of this and then submit it to immigration. What a waste of time for a small business owner already battling staffing costs and compliance costs.


Thirdly, Dev tells me that the government-sponsored employment agencies will provide $6,000 to an employer if they give a new migrant on Centrelink benefits a job for 25 hours a week for 13 weeks. It does not matter if they do not speak a word of English; if they speak Hindi they can work in the kitchen. This is despite the fact that the chef on a 457 visa has worked for four years, understands all the health and safety laws, and yet is considered to be a risk to the community. It just does not make sense.


The second case I would like to highlight is that of the JCU dental school. This is a fantastic facility and one that I helped to establish. It trains young dentists and provides low-cost dental treatment to local residents. The dental school has five Irish dentists who, because they are not receiving enough hours at the dental clinic that brought them in on 457 visas, are volunteering their time to train students JCU students in Cairns. JCU wrote to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, to see if they could legally employ them part time and pay them to continue training their students. As they said, 'We would of course prefer to pay these dentists, as it is unreasonable to expect them to volunteer their time continually.' Unfortunately, they were refused. Why, you ask, Madam Deputy Speaker? Because, even though medical doctors are able to work for other practices in addition to the one that sponsored them on their 457, dentists are not allowed to do so. JCU wanted the guidelines changed to allow the dentists to do likewise, which surely would have been a win-win situation on all fronts. The fact that this could not happen demonstrates yet another key flaw in the 457 process.


The bill that we are debating here today seeks to amend the Migration Act with a range of new requirements. It is important to note, from the feedback from Migration Council Australia, that a number of industry groups have been universally negative towards the new labour market testing regulatory requirements. I was in this place in 1996 when the 457 visas were first introduced and labour market testing applied. We remember that it proved to be cumbersome to implement and difficult to monitor, and it was dropped by the Howard government in 2001. Now Labor wants to reintroduce it by requiring certain classes of sponsors to undertake labour market testing for Australian workers, and show evidence of it, prior to recruiting from overseas using the 457 program. Employers are concerned that it will add to costs and delay for recruiting, for no effective purpose, if reintroduced. They also note that the costs to them for recruiting 457 workers from overseas are much higher than for recruiting a local worker, and overseas recruitment therefore only occurs when there are no local workers available. This is common sense to me. No employer is going to go to the effort and expense of recruiting and assisting a worker from overseas if somebody local down the road is suitable to fill that position.


Another key element of the bill is that it establishes the powers of authorised inspectors. There are two types of inspectors: compliance staff in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the workplace inspectors from Fair Work Australia. I recognise that feedback from industry groups has been less concerned with this aspect of the bill, in that they believe that the vast majority of employers will not be impacted and that any employer abusing the program should be identified. However, it should be noted that the bill also gives inspectors coverage of workers on student and working holiday visas in low-skill occupations with employers who do not have a sponsor obligation or role as such. In my electorate, many, many young people arrive on working holiday visas and seek to earn a bit of extra cash on their travels by picking fruit or working in one of the local bars or restaurants. Of course I do not condone any employer taking advantage of young people in this situation, but we need to be very, very careful that increased compliance costs are not seen to outweigh the benefits of employing these young people.


Lastly, the bill looks to extend the period that people can seek new sponsored employment. At the moment, if a 457 worker stops working for their sponsor, they have 28 days to find new sponsored employment or they must leave Australia. The bill proposes the extension of this time period to 90 days. This is consistent with one of the recommendations of the recent Migration Council Australia survey report and it has the support of industry groups. It provides some sensible flexibility to provide workers with a more realistic opportunity to find new sponsored employment. This particular element of the bill will certainly be supported.


As a whole, it is plain to see that this attack by Labor on skilled migration is a desperate distraction from their failed border protection policies. These policies have seen almost 700 boats arrive with more than 44,200 people on board, resulting in chaos and tragedy on our borders and more than $10 billion in budget blow-outs, not to mention the opening in my electorate near Weipa of the facility at the Scherger base, which has been converted from an Air Force base to a prison colony, which I think is absolutely appalling and certainly not the purpose for which it was built. 


The hypocrisy is quite blatant. The Gillard government would rather focus on discouraging skilled migrants who make a contribution from day one in favour of supporting illegal boat arrivals, who are put into the community on welfare. It just does not add up and that is why the coalition will not support this bill. We stand consistent in our policies on 457 visas and will be strong in policing our migration laws on our borders, in the community and in the workplace.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (18:15):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 and to support the outstanding contribution of the shadow minister, the member for Cook, and the subsequent statements by my coalition colleagues. What is abundantly clear to all on this side of the chamber is that the measures contained in this bill require parliamentary inquiry. As a result, I do not support the government's bill and I strongly support the amendment moved by the member for Cook.


Our nation has largely been built on skilled migration. We often hark back to the great engineering projects like the Snowy Mountains Scheme that have defined our nation's character. Skilled migration has been absolutely vital to these projects. Yet the Labor government are now attempting to ram through legislation that is nothing less than an attack on skilled migrants purely for short-term political purposes. This is also a hypocritical gesture as this government are determined to belittle and demonise overseas workers at the same time that they have 457 visa holders on their own staff in the highest office in the land. If the government's rhetoric is to be believed, their own staff members are stealing Australian jobs. As they well know, this is nonsense.


The government's bill has some serious problems, not least the fact that it has no regulatory impact statement and there has not been proper consultation. Just like in so many policy areas, this government seems determined to ignore the long-term consequences of its actions in the interests of its own short-term survival. This bill contains a bizarre back-to-the-future attempt to reintroduce labour market testing, which operated from 1996 to 2001 and was found at the time to be ineffective and costly, and produced a significant delay to employer recruitment action. The whole point of 457 visas was to enable the rapid assignment of skilled workers into vacant temporary positions, not to increase red tape and stifle the economy. As stated in a press release last year, the member for McMahon, the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, said:


Skilled migrants deliver major benefits to the Australian economy in terms of contributing to economic growth and offsetting the impacts of an ageing population.


Yet here is the Prime Minister attacking 457 visas to hide the inadequacies and incompetence of their failed border protection policies, which have enabled the arrival of 44,200 people on boats and contributed more than $10 billion to the current budget deficit. We must see Labor's attack on skilled migration for what it is: a desperate distraction designed to divert attention away from the chaos and tragedy that have occurred on our borders and their failed border protection policies.


The 457 visas are a well-established class of visa in Australia. They were introduced in 1996 and since then have grown in use and proven to be highly effective in meeting skill gaps in a number of industries for large resourcing or infrastructure projects. They are the dominant component of Australia's temporary skilled migration program and were hailed by this government as international best practice in facilitating access to skilled labour in 2011. The 457 visas are designed to provide a quick response to fluctuations in demand for skilled and semiskilled workers where such demand cannot be met by the Australian workforce. They allow a business to sponsor and employ someone from outside Australia in a skilled job. People holding this visa can work in Australia for up to four years, bringing their family with them, and travel in and out of Australia as often as they want.


The 457 visa program plays an important role in securing the short- and long-term skilled migrants that Australia always needed and will need well into the future. Around 70 per cent of 457 visa holders are in professional and managerial occupations, and the remainder contribute to trade, technical and clerical positions as part of the program. As at 30 April 2013, there were 810 primary 457 visa holders in Australia, up by 20 per cent on April 2012. 


Perhaps most concerning about this bill is that it is based on a false premise. The government have completely made up numbers to suggest the widespread abuse of the 457 visa scheme. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has publicly stated that there have been 10,000 cases of abuse in the program. However, he has subsequently admitted that he made this number up. He had no evidence to support it. The government have provided this House with no evidence of rorting, no inquiry from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship or from anywhere else to suggest that widespread abuse exists.


The government's own advisers say that there is no evidence of widespread rorting of the 457 skilled migration program. Demographer, Professor Peter McDonald, a member of the government's Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, has called the Prime Minister's rhetoric 'nasty'. Business, including representatives from the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia, as well as the Migration Council of Australia, have further disputed Labor's claims and condemned the Prime Minister for demonising 457 skilled migration visa holders.


Temporary skilled migration is vital to the efficient operation of the labour market. It delivers significant benefits to the Australian economy. The 457 visa holders pay their own way. They pay for health care; they do not access welfare. Yet this Labor government is effectively saying they prefer illegal boat arrivals who are put into the community on welfare, but skilled migrants who make a contribution from day one pay their own way and help foster growth in our economy and in our community.


The Prime Minister and the previous minister for immigration spent years telling Australians and international audiences that they have the balance right on 457 skilled migration visas, yet now the Prime Minister campaigns in Western Sydney, telling people that the system is out of control. Interestingly, the previous minister for immigration said in 2011 that anyone who tried to tell you the 457 visa program was not working needed to take another look at the facts. The Labor Party has failed to produce any evidence that the 457 visa program is failing or is being widely abused or rorted as it currently stands. I invite the Prime Minister and all members supporting this bill to take another look at the facts.


Under Labor, 457 skilled migration visa grants have grown to their highest level ever, with 125,070 visa applications granted between 2011 and 2012. If any rorts occurred, they happened on Labor's watch. Despite the Prime Minister's numerical fabrication, 457 visa holders represent less than one per cent of the Australian workforce. Yet despite this, skilled migration has been a key driver of Australia's economic performance. Labor's eagerness to trash-talk our skilled migration program by demonising skilled migration visas has two effects: it damages our international reputation and makes a mockery of the Asian century white paper, which barely lasted the Australian summer. It demonstrates that the Prime Minister has truly lost her way and has lost touch with the community she is elected to represent and to lead.


Since 2007-08 Labor has cut resourcing for compliance work in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, including 457 monitoring, by over $20 million or 30 per cent. Monitoring visits to employers are down by 67 per cent. The number of employer sponsors formally warned has also dropped by two-thirds. Just as Labor cannot protect our borders, they cannot police the immigration system here in Australia. Unlike Labor, the coalition's position on 457 skilled migration visas is simple, clear and consistent. We recognise the critical importance of skilled temporary migration to the Australian economy and the wellbeing and living standards of all Australians.


The 457 skilled migration visa program must be well managed. It must provide rapid access to skilled workers not available in the Australian labour market. It must have strong compliance action to assure high standards of program integrity. Skilled migrants have been vital to the building of our nation. Talking down skilled migration for political gain is a desperate distraction from the disastrous border protection policies and is a Labor tactic that just will not work with the Australian public. The coalition will be strong in policing our immigration laws and our borders—in the community and in the workplace. The coalition would never support the use of 457 skilled migration visas at the expense of Australian workers and would not tolerate any employer who tried to abuse the system.


Another effect of this bill is the immense burden of regulation, obligations, compliance and enforcement that it proposes to place on employer sponsors using 457 visa programs. It represents the culmination of a union and government campaign to discredit the program and demonise foreign workers. Early this year, Minister O'Connor's Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration put forward a number of sensible housekeeping measures to improve program integrity. Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest that these sensible departmental suggestions are being advanced by the government through this bill. Rather, the minister is plainly doing the bidding of the unions through labour market testing and Fair Work inspectors which position unions to play a more active role in workplaces with 457 visa holders and constrain the use of the program.


The coalition supports robust integrity in the 457 program and would support measures such as these to strengthen the program. Feedback on this program from the Migration Council of Australia and the responses of a number of industry groups to these changes have been universally negative towards the new labour market testing regulation requirements. Overall, the general view is that these changes are being driven by the union movement to improve union coverage and control of workplaces with 457 visa holders rather than being supported by any genuine evidence of widespread abuse in the program.


As mentioned, this bill re-introduces labour market testing requirements across all skilled level occupations. Under the bill, nominations from sponsors must demonstrate that they satisfy these new labour market testing requirements before a 457 visa is approved. These same labour market testing requirements applied when 457 visas were first introduced in 1996, however, they were dropped by the Howard government in 2001 after it became clear to us then that they were overly cumbersome to implement and difficult to monitor. 


Employers are concerned that the proposed re-introduction of this cumbersome obligation will add to costs and delay recruitment for no effective purpose. Employers note that the costs to them of recruiting 457 workers from overseas are much higher than a local worker. Overseas recruitment therefore only occurs when there is no local worker available. The bill does not make clear the actual period of labour market testing required but it is to be set based on the nominated occupation. Clearly, the requirements for labour market testing represent a significant regulatory impost on employer sponsors, yet the bill has been granted an exemption from a regulatory impact statement by the Prime Minister on the basis of unspecified exceptional circumstances. The bill therefore excludes any assessment of the real significant employer regulatory impacts.


The new labour market testing requirement undermines the very purpose of the 457 visa program which requires rapid filling of temporary skill shortages. The ability to quickly fill the vacancy by a skilled overseas worker is a paramount feature of the program. 


Indeed, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities was quoted in the Australian Financial Review as saying that when there are genuine skills shortages employers are able to quickly recruit temporary overseas workers through the 457 visa to fill skill gaps and keep the economy growing. However, the cumbersome process requirements proposed in this bill will add significantly to 457 recruitment lead times and costs. The extent of additional time and cost burdens for employers will be subject to decisions taken outside the legislation at ministerial and departmental levels on detailed aspects of the testing regime. Ultimately the time and cost burdens on employers as a result of these changes undermine the integrity of the 457 visa program and represent a desperate, ill-conceived move by a government focused too much on its short-term survival than the long-term wellbeing of the Australian economy supported by skilled migrants.


The coalition will not support this bill and is seeking referral to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislative Committee. The amendments moved by the coalition prove our consistent position on this policy issue. (Time expired)

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (20:11):  In the few minutes available to me, let me reiterate how this issues arises. A motion was moved by my colleague the member for Fowler, I believe, on Vietnam and political prisoners in Vietnam. It detailed many cases. The issue was broadly discussed by members on both sides raising concerns about a wide range of human rights abuses that are believed to occur in Vietnam. The debate occurred on the very day that the Australia-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue occurred. The debate progressed up until the lunch break and some divisions were imminent, and I thought there would be five minutes for me to report on the dialogue. These dialogues occur quite regularly in relation to China and in relation to Vietnam. Members do not always have the opportunity to participate, but on this occasion I, with the member for Werriwa, was able to participate in the Australia-Vietnam dialogue, representing the Australian parliament.


I believed it was desirable to report to the House on the way in which that dialogue was conducted. I was particularly impressed with the way in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the 10th Australia-Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue raised a number of issues that were of substance, were real. I was particularly impressed with the way in which Vietnam responded to those matters. I would like to brief colleagues who are interested in what is happening in Vietnam on those matters.


The objectives for the 10th round of the dialogue were to streamline the discussions and affirm Australia's view that human rights issues continue to be an integral part of the broader Australia-Vietnam bilateral relationship. There was a concern about freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of information in Vietnam. We wanted to discuss a list of cases and to encourage Vietnam to release those in detention and to lift restrictions on others, and to express concern at the sharp rise in the number of cases on our lists over recent years as well as the severity of sentencing that had occurred, and to welcome what we believed were some areas of improvement in relation to legal reforms, women's issues and religious freedom.


I was present when Australia took up particularly the cases of Father Ly, bloggers Diev Cay, Ta Phong Tan Phan Hai as well as the 14 bloggers convicted in January,  and a number of musicians, and also took up cases of some of the Buddhists, particularly the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, whose case I have been particularly interested in.


It was quite interesting during the discussions to see the way in which Vietnam was responding. I am fairly open in relation to these matters. I examine fairly critically what I believe are the facts, but it was of interest to me that Vietnam reported that, in relation to some of the more significant sentences that have been imposed, they were more frequently using the system that we understand to be parole. They spoke of that and, to the extent that we receive reports that people are being released earlier than might have been expected, it was a very positive development.


There were also issues raised in relation to the death penalty. The death penalty is a human rights issue, which is of concern to members of this House. The interesting aspect of the report from Vietnam was that, while they had not abandoned the use of the death penalty, they were narrowing it in relation to the types of offences for which it might be used particularly focusing on those relating to drugs and those relating to injuries to individuals and the like, these sorts of offences that we would regard as being fairly serious in the Australian context. I wanted members to know that these issues were being progressed. The discussions were very positive and it all demonstrated to me the desirability of members of parliament participating in these dialogues in the way in which the member for Werriwa and I were able to on this occasion.


Debate adjourned.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2013-06-24,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (20:28):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important motion, because it allows me the chance to discuss a range of natural resource management issues that are important to my community; in fact, more broadly, throughout regional Australia. 


I am always fascinated when we have city based Labor members and city based Greens members lecturing regional Australians about environmental issues. It must be the view from those leafy suburbs that apparently brings brilliant insight into the management of distant national parks and conservation reserves. 


This motion amounts to an attempt to take over national parks management by the federal government from the states. This is one that the environment minister tried himself in about 2011, I think, and he failed miserably, just as he has failed in relation to EPBC reform and his planned takeover of the states' national parks was a stunt in 2011. He has dusted off an old idea in the lead-up to this new election in 2013 . It is a stunt again today. 


Back then, Mr Burke was challenged to come up with clear and comprehensive evidence to justify a federal takeover of the states' national parks. He failed to do so then. He has failed to do so today. It has only reinforced my view that this is purely a political stunt from a desperate minister.


We are talking about the same minister who, when he was the minister for agriculture, actually stripped money out of Landcare. He actually stripped money out of the practical environmentalists in our community. I think it was in 2010. He simply cannot be taken seriously when it comes to issues of practical environmental management. He is big on hyperbole and grand gestures but, when it comes to actually rolling your sleeves up, getting your hands dirty and doing that practical environmental work, this minister has been missing in action.


'Lock it up and leave it' is not an environmental policy; it is a recipe for disaster. But it is the preferred policy of the Greens and, increasingly, it has become the preferred policy of the inner-city Laborites who never have to work or live in the environment or make a living off the land they pretend to protect. The classic example of this is prescribed burning, which has long been opposed by the inner-city Greens—but, when it comes to prescribed burning, those same individuals have been strangely silent on the issue since the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. I strongly believe in multi-use, with people accessing our parks—actually getting out there and enjoying the facilities that are on offer and enjoying everything that there is to be enjoyed in the national park environment—because they have more respect for it as a result.


In the time I have available to me, there are three issues that I want to discuss that are directly linked to this motion. They are this government's failure to get serious about the control of pest plants and animals in our nation. I also want to discuss the Commonwealth's interference on the issue of alpine grazing, which the member for Makin quite helpfully raised on my behalf. Another issue I also want to discuss is the Commonwealth's abject failure to meet its international commitments when it comes to Ramsar listed wetlands, such as the Gippsland lakes in my electorate.


I want to begin with the reference in the motion to biodiversity and environmental risks. One of the biggest risks to the native species in our nation is the impact of feral species. I am not going to talk about weeds so much tonight; I will talk about the feral animals in our nation. We are talking about cats, pigs, goats, camels and foxes. But in my electorate probably the biggest threat to biodiversity is the impact of feral dogs. They are of enormous economic concern and also take a very heavy environmental and social toll in my community.


The state government, to its credit, is doing its part. The current coalition state government has come to the party and has increased funding for trapping and shooting. It has introduced a bounty to encourage hunters to go out, but it also wanted to do aerial baiting. You would think that aerial baiting would be well received. After all, it has been successful in New South Wales. The research has been done and the impact on the spotted quoll was found to be minimal. But this federal government, the minister, actually blocked aerial baiting in Victoria. Even though it has been successful in Victoria and even though the research has been done, he actually got his department to call for more research.


So the Victorian state government had a choice: they could do research on the quolls in Victoria—even though we know they are the same as the quolls in New South Wales—or they could spend the money killing wild dogs. Funnily enough, the Victorian state government made the choice to put more money into their baiting program and their shooting and trapping program and decided not to go ahead with the aerial baiting of wild dogs, as long as this minister is in his position. So it confuses and concerns me when members opposite come here and talk about biodiversity and environmental risks, when their own minister refuses to support a proven technique for killing wild dogs, for controlling them in a way that is actually beneficial to native species—let alone the enormous benefits that flow through to the primary agricultural sector in my community. If this minister wants to interfere in the management of these environmental reserves, as referred to in the motion, at least he could interfere and do something positive for the people in my electorate who are concerned about feral species.


Another issue that was raised by the member for Makin which concerns me was his reference to alpine grazing. This is an issue that was specifically referred to in a motion and was the subject of a disallowance motion in March 2012. So my thoughts on that issue are well known. They are on the Hansard and they have been put on the public record many times since. The Victorian state government won a clear mandate at the 2010 state election. The coalition government campaigned for the return of alpine grazing as a bushfire mitigation measure. The coalition won the election. So what did they do? They introduced a trial of grazing in the alpine country to try to reduce the impact of bushfires. So what did the Labor Party do at the federal level? Well, the minister just had to intervene. In a scurrilous attempt to enforce a federal takeover—which is what it amounts to—in relation to the EPBC Act upon the Victorians. That was the subject of the disallowance motion which was defeated by one vote—when some of the Independents teamed with the Greens and the Labor Party to defeat the motion.


The member for Makin talked about cattle and about the enormous damage that they had supposedly done to the Alpine National Park, but he did not make any reference to any other hard-hooved species in the Alpine National Park. In fact, the Saturday Age of this very weekend had a story about brumbies—10,000 brumbies in the Alpine National Park. But there is never a mention from those opposite about that feral species. There is never a mention—'There's The Man from Snowy River. We'd better look after the brumbies. We won't talk about the real environmental issues; we will use the mountain cattlemen to try to score some very tawdry political points.' They never talk about the real risks to the environment of the alpine region.


All of this gives me pause for thought. Why do Labor MPs feel so compelled to support the Greens? It is a reasonable question. When you look opposite and you look at their primary vote, you understand that there are about 40 Labor members of parliament who actually need the preferences of the Greens to win their seats.



Mr Katter interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  The member for Kennedy will have his turn. They need Greens preferences to try to get across the line; hence they have been prepared to decimate the mountain cattlemen's 150 years of tradition—all in a desperate bid for Green votes.


If the member for Makin was sincere in his belief that the cattle in the Alpine National Park and alpine country Victoria had done so much damage, how is it possible that they were able to go to the Alpine National Park—go to that high country—for more than 150 years and that region was so badly damaged and yet we made it into a national park? They had been going there for 150 years and yet we made it into a national park. It cannot have been that bad. And they do not talk about skiing and putting ski lodges in there, as that would really offend the inner-city Lefties and the Greens.


So I say to those opposite: I will give you some free advice. When it comes to the Greens, let me promise you: they are never satisfied. Just because you do one deal, do not believe they will not be back tomorrow knocking on your door for another deal. They will shaft you at the first chance they can get. They are a party of protest. They need to fight for something to exist. They are not a party of government. In order to exist, they have to campaign against something. When you do deals with the Greens, you are doing deals with the devil. I just urge those opposite to stop telling regional Victorians how to live their lives and stop doing deals with the Australian Greens.


Finally, in the short amount of time I have left—and I agree with the member for Makin that there are many other issues we would like to discuss tonight—I would like to mention this government's miserable record when it comes to natural resource management as it relates to the Gippsland Lakes and their catchment area. The state government has just announced $10 million over three years to support practical environmental works in the catchment. Even though these are Ramsar-listed wetlands and the federal government recognised in 2007 that it had some obligations and gave $3 million to the Gippsland Lakes catchment, there has not been a cent since. This government has not given a cent since to water quality, to nutrient reduction or to control pest species that would impact on these Ramsar-listed wetlands. It is vital that the Commonwealth recognise its responsibilities in relation to the Gippsland Lakes and their catchment areas for the economic, social, environmental and cultural benefit they bring to the broader Gippsland region. I thank the House. (Time expired)

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (20:38):  This is indeed a timely and very welcome resolution put forward by the member for Makin, because we are starting to see precisely what happens to our environment and to our biodiversity when people elect a conservative government. It was enlightening to hear the words of the member for Gippsland. When the Baillieu-Napthine government came to office, what was amongst the first things that it chose to do? It was not about fostering industry. It was not about providing extra assistance to schools or to health. It was all about shoring up support amongst its own supporter base and taking 'decisive action' in relation to the 'critical issue' of alpine grazing—really decisive action! So, if we are talking about whose supporter base is being spoken to with the actions of government, we know very clearly, Member for Gippsland, where the Baillieu government and now the Napthine government lined up on these issues.


But it is not just in Victoria that these sorts of issues persist in coming up; it is in Queensland and New South Wales. In Queensland, for instance, we have seen the Newman government moving to allow cattle grazing in drought times in some five national parks, I believe, and eight state parks. In addition to that, I understand the Queensland government has also commenced a review of all protected areas created after 2002 to consider the potential for logging of those areas. So it is yet another conservative government pushing ahead with its retrograde moves on the environment. In New South Wales we have seen a cattle grazing trial launched in the Millewa National Park at the determination of the O'Farrell government. We have also seen the New South Wales conservatives agreeing to allow recreational shooters into national parks.


As I said, we have seen the Baillieu-Napthine government in Victoria launching a cattle grazing trial in the Alpine National Park, although of course that has now been prevented by ministerial intervention, and rightly so. However, notwithstanding that, the Napthine government has gone back for another bite and is in fact considering letting weekend gold and gemstone hunters prospect in some Victorian national parks. It is interesting to have a look at the report that has been prepared in relation to this by the Victorian Environmental Assessment Council, which had as its chair Mr Phil Honeywood, a former Liberal Party minister. He has made some interesting comments in relation to the prospect of damage that may be occasioned by prospecting in national parks, but I will come to that a little bit later if time allows.


Removing cattle from the Alpine National Park, as has been touched on by the last two speakers, was a move that was originally pursued by a Labor minister for environment in Victoria, John Thwaites. It was a step taken by Labor, and it is something that this side can rightly be proud of, because national parks are places which provide a protected habitat for local wildlife. They are a means by which we can preserve our biodiversity and provide support for what can be fragile ecosystems and threatened native wildlife. National parks should not simply stand for the benefit of commercial operations, graziers or business owners; they are for the benefit of this generation and the next. Particularly at a time when we are talking about the damaging effects of dangerous climate change on our national biodiversity, they are more important than ever.


The seemingly scientific arguments presented by the Victorian government in support of the benefits of alpine grazing as a means of reducing the risk of bushfire have been shown to be rubbish. Scientists did not even have the opportunity to assess the environment within the Alpine National Park that was likely to be affected before the Victorian government rushed in cattle.


In the time remaining to me, I might refer again to the use of national parks for gold and gemstone prospecting. I said that the relevant decision-making body advising in relation to this, chaired by Phil Honeywood, had already talked about the evidence of the damage from prospecting. It noted evidence from Melbourne Water, which raised concerns that prospecting could undermine other efforts to improve the health of the river system. Indeed, Phil Honeywood suggested that prospecting did not 'sit well with the purposes of national and state parks'. Indeed that is correct. Ultimately, what is the point of designated conservation parks if not to protect our biodiversity and our vulnerable or ecologically important species? We are here to serve the national interest, and this side of the House will continue to act to preserve those natural assets.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (20:43):  In rising to speak on this motion put forward by the member for Makin, I would like to put some level of balance and common sense into this argument. Clearly those that are contributing on the other side are city-centric and probably understand only what they read in the papers, the magazines and what have you in relation to national parks. Certainly, when I listen to some of the arguments put forward, it is more about ideology than practicality and reality.


I am very much a strong proponent of national parks and protecting our biodiversity and our amazing fauna and flora. Make no questions about it: in Leichhardt we have some truly spectacular natural areas within the Daintree, Lakefield, Black Mountain and Jardine River national parks, and they attract many visitors to our region, and of course tourism is the backbone of our economy. However, in considering this motion today in particular in regards to Queensland, the member for Makin clearly has no understanding regarding some of the relevant information. 


The Queensland government's decision to allow graziers to agist drought-stricken cattle in five national parks and eight reserves was an emergency response to an emergency situation. We have tens of thousands of head of cattle that are slowly starving to death. It could take months but eventually they will die. This tragic situation has arisen from a perfect storm of events, the first and most significant being the Gillard government's knee-jerk decision to ban live exports to Indonesia in mid-2011. This decision has resulted in an oversupply of cattle in our properties. The irony is that for a long period after the ban the cattle would not be exported because they were above the weight limits permitted for live export. Now, however, graziers are struggling to find enough grass to feed these cattle thanks to bushfires and emerging drought. We also have the oncoming calf drop in October-November which will further exacerbate the problem. 


As for the assertion by the environment minister, Tony Burke, that the Queensland government just wants to trample national parks, can I say that, like the member for Makin, Mr Burke has no idea what he is talking about. As a grazier myself I can testify that we have to be practical about the fact that you are breeding and raising cattle for slaughter but this does not mean that any grazier wants to see their cattle suffering, slowly starving to death on land that can no longer support them. The decision to open up some of these conservation areas and national parks is purely a commonsense approach and certainly a very humane one in relation to treatment of these animals. It seems that many people, including green groups, have conveniently forgotten that the national parks in question have predominantly been former cattle stations. Given that they were considered suitable for inclusion in the national parks after more than 100 years of cattle grazing, where is the risk to their suitability after temporary usage by graziers in their time of need? There is absolutely no reason why these parks cannot be managed in an appropriate way viewed as a valid management process rather than as the environmental disaster that the green groups are promoting. Grazing will help manage invasive species like buffel grass and other weeds and counter pests including pigs and dingoes. 


In addition, I do not believe that the animal welfare groups comprehend the consequences of their actions. Given the key role they played in this situation, they need to come forward and offer their support. I would like to see Animals Australia and other highly vocal welfare groups and maybe the member for Makin take a trip to these areas in regional Queensland, walk through the paddocks and see these starving cattle. I would even go so far as to say that if they really wanted to help they should bring along a gun, bring the ammunition and save the farmer the anguish of having to shoot their own animals. This would certainly effectively drive home to them the true impact of rushed and poorly conceived policy. This whole situation came about because of an absolute stuff-up by the Gillard government, and there has been very little done to try and improve the situation. The nonsense about offering $60 million in low-interest loans does not feed the cattle and pushes farmers into further debt. It is time to strike a balance between conservation and development. Rural communities can thrive if they are given opportunities for economic development and are not burdened by unnecessary red tape. In the meantime I will continue to work with the Cairns Chamber of Commerce and the Papua New Guinean government on a proposal that will see Queensland cattle exported to Papua New Guinea to help with their national herd shortage. This is a project which has gained incredible momentum and I am proud to be part of this practical solution— (Time expired)

Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh—Second Deputy Speaker) (20:48):  I rise today to support this motion and to oppose any moves that seek to remove protections that were put in place to protect biodiversity and the environment in Australia. In my home state of South Australia we are fortunate to have a state government that is committed to protecting South Australia's beautiful natural environment. For those of you who have had the pleasure of going to Kangaroo Island, the Flinders Ranges, Mount Lofty or anywhere in between, you will know why all South Australians have a special interest in protecting our biodiversity and especially our natural flora and fauna. In fact, the state government, in order to protect Wilpena Pound in the Flinders Ranges, recently blocked a mining project at Arkaroola because it saw the benefit in this wonderful environmentally beautiful place. 


Too often we have seen other state governments treat the environment as an afterthought and only care about exploiting our natural environment. Liberal-National state governments have introduced cattle grazing in conservation parks. They think that logging is acceptable in our endangered rainforests and believe there should be almost no restrictions on where a mine can be placed. Only three days ago I got an email from Mr Elliott, a constituent in my electorate of Hindmarsh, who said:


I have never written to the local member of parliament before. Do press the issue of protecting our national parks in whatever way you can. It is not looking flash after developments in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland and this is decidedly worrying. 


You know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the community is right to be concerned that the precious places that we all enjoy and take for granted are under threat.


At a federal government level there are two possible futures for Australia's national parks. The LNP plan to disregard our national parks and wreck them for future generations of Australians, just as their state colleagues are doing. The Labor plan is to continue to protect these places for the future. The CSIRO in a recent report titled Queensland's biodiversity under climate change: impacts and adoption made it absolutely clear that there are big threats to Queensland's biodiversity under the current state government directions and possibly the biggest threat to biodiversity and endangered species is that of climate change. That is why this government made the very tough and courageous decision to put a price on carbon, because we do not want to leave future generations of Australia with a barren wasteland 


That is what will happen if we do not take action on climate change. I want our children and our grandchildren to enjoy the natural beauty that I have been able to enjoy here in Australia and every corner that this great land—and it is a great land, a wonderful land—has to offer us.


On a very positive note, only recently the World Heritage Committee recognised the Australian government's progress in protecting the Great Barrier Reef. They made particular mention of the $200 million injected into the next stage of the Reef Rescue Program. This is on top of the Australian government acting to protect our oceans by delivering the world's largest network of marine reserves. We need to protect our natural environment and make the tough decisions to keep our biodiversity strong.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-24,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (20:52):  On the eighth day God looked down on his planned paradise and said, 'I need a caretaker.' So God made a farmer. This motion, moved by the member for Makin, is about caretakers, conservation and ensuring our beautiful and productive landscape is preserved for future generations. There is no argument about that.


In reflecting upon the intent of this motion, I was reminded of a speech given by the conservative American radio announcer Paul Harvey at the Future Farmers of America Convention in 1978 entitled 'So God made a farmer.' Members might remember this speech because, though decades old, it was the theme of a Dodge car commercial during this year's Superbowl in the United States. The theme of this speech is remarkable and that is why I am quoting it during the debate tonight. Paul Harvey is right: farmers are the original environmentalists; farming is an exercise in conservation. No-one understands more than a farmer how imperative it is to treat the land in a manner which ensures a harvest be sought the following year. Yet this motion fails to recognise the significant contribution farmers make to conservation efforts every year—a further sign that there is just not the level of understanding necessary of how much farmers value their land. It is their biggest asset. Ensuring it is cared for and tended to will help a farmer with the following year's harvest. Yet debate in this place paints farmers as land-destroying environmental vandals. You will hear those opposite put down farmers and make the continued assumption that farming is a non-environmentally-friendly exercise.


Tonight during debate on this particular motion we heard from inner city suburban Labor members. I do not know where the regional Labor members are on this particular motion. It really is a typical stunt by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities—he represents a southern Sydney suburban area—the same minister who has stripped money away from Landcare funding. Labor can argue all they like but, whilst he is taking money away from them in the forward estimates, the Landcare volunteers are out there, helping to protect the environment and our land. We just heard from the member for Hindmarsh talking about every corner of Australia. If Labor had their way, being pulled by the nose by the member for Melbourne, every corner of Australia would indeed be locked up so that parts of my region—



Mr Wilkie interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  I hear 'Hear, hear' from the member for Denison. He also thinks that every corner should be locked up. Maybe I am doing him a disservice there, but certainly in parts of my area national parks have been locked up so that pests and weeds, and feral animals can just take over. That is what is happening and, unfortunately, for people who were working on cattle stations and farming properties, their areas have been locked up, supposedly, for future generations. Unfortunately, as I say, these areas are now no-go zones. We heard the member for La Trobe talking about prospecting. Fair dinkum! If it were up to that side, we would never have discovered any of the resources that have blessed our nation with wonderful wealth.


We heard from the member for Leichhardt, talking about the live cattle export fiasco and how some of the national parks in Queensland were former cattle stations. Surely, it just makes common sense to allow those cattle, which are too heavy and too old to be now sent for export, to graze on those areas which were once cattle stations and which are now locked up. It just makes sense and it is the humane thing to do.


I heard the member for Kennedy say 'Hear, hear' when the member for Leichhardt suggested that. He knows, as well as anybody on this side and as anybody with any common sense, that that would be a good policy so that we can help those cattle farmers and the cattle.


We heard the previous speaker, the member for Hindmarsh, talking about logging. If it were up to that side of politics, they would probably stop all logging. Most of the logging is done very conservatively. I note that, in the Tumut shire, 70 per cent of that shire's income comes from logging. If it were up to that side of parliament, that would all stop. That valuable industry, which provides so much wealth and prosperity for a regional community such as Tumut, would indeed be stopped.


This motion is ridiculous. All the speakers from inner city areas are too citycentric and are not focused at all on regional Australia. This is a ridiculous debate and should not even be happening. (Time expired)

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2013-06-24,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland) (20:57):  For the record of the House, this motion, moved by the member for Makin, came from the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts. It is based on the unanimous recommendations of the committee.


To describe it as an antifarming motion, a motion that is denigrating farmers, is an absolute falsehood. Nowhere in this motion does it refer to farmers or does it seek to denigrate farmers. If members would like to have a look at this report, there is mention of best practice that many farmers undertake.


This motion is about highlighting the importance of preserving our biodiversity. Farmers can do that just as well as any person in this House who is involved in farming. To say that this motion is about denigrating farmers is just ludicrous.


During the inquiry the committee learnt just how important it is that our biodiversity and our environment be protected. One member of the committee is actually a farmer—and very proud of the fact that she is a farmer—and has a long farming history. For that matter, I grew up in the country and my husband was born on a farm. We have discussed this report, and he is very supportive of it.


During the inquiry, we learnt about the grazing of cattle on the alps and we heard from Dr Graeme Worboys. He is the vice chair of the International Union for Conservation of nature's mountains and connective conservation and also an executive member of the World Commission on Protected Areas. He told us how important it was to have corridors and to protect our national parks. Grazing is very important, but not in national parks. There are places where certain activities take place and should take place, but there are other places that should be protected. That is what this motion seeks to do.


In my state of New South Wales, I have been very disturbed by some of the things that have happened since there has been a change of government. On the Central Coast of New South Wales, prior to the election of Barry O'Farrell, all the members went out and stated that they opposed a coalmine in the Wyong Valley. The reason that there is a lot of debate about this mine is the suitability of that area for a mine. It is an area where there has been a history of water shortage. The aquifers will take 500 years to recover, 245 houses will be affected by subsidence each day and it will lead to a major reduction in water. People will be really affected by this, and it is inappropriate as far as the geology of the area is concerned. Before the election, Barry O'Farrell and his men and women promised that there would be no mine. After the election, they are sponsoring this activity. I am so supportive of mines. I think we need mines, but I do not support mines that are inappropriate. This one is inappropriate, and you have a state government that argues one thing before an election and another thing after the election.


Similarly, we have shooting in national parks in New South Wales—totally unacceptable. Now there is talk about logging in national parks. That is not saying that to you should not log anywhere; it is saying that you do not log in national parks. You do not shoot in national parks, and you make sure that mining that takes place is appropriate. (Time expired)

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (21:03):  It never ceases to amaze me in this place that the member for Hindmarsh is an expert in grazing in North Queensland along with the member for Makin and the member for the La Trobe. If my geography serves me correctly, they are all in inner-city suburbs, yet they are great experts in national parks in North Queensland! I will give you a little lesson because, obviously, you have not done any homework at all.


They were all grazing cattle for nearly 150 years. Jardine and Ernest Henry took cattle up there in the 1860s and 1870s. There have been cattle and cattle stations up there for 150 years. If you are so naive as to believe that a three-strand barbed fence will stop cattle when they are hungry and have no grass, then you believe in the tooth fairy. So, that is a little lesson for you so you can understand things.


Whilst that might be humorous, what is not humorous are the national parks in North Queensland. God bless the ABC for doing a series on six people looking after an area the size of Germany and half of France—six people looking after it! Of course, no-one is looking after it—that is the actual fact of the matter.


Out in the national parks, in one area alone between Tully and Innisfail we were getting 800 pigs a year. We started off getting 1,000. Then we got 800, and for two years we just kept getting 800. In other words, the pig numbers were huge in that national park area. If there is ever a destructive animal for which something needs to be done, it is the pigs.


But what they refer to as national parks in North Queensland are pig farms, fire starters and weed nurseries. That is exactly what they are. We had the giant fires because there are no control mechanisms. On a cattle station, you get miles of control mechanisms and you burn regularly. That has been the blackfella way, and then the whitefella got it off the blackfella, so we have been burning for all of our history. All that you see on the Australian landscape was put there by fire-stick farming. I strongly recommend that you read the history books of Geoffrey Blainey to get the dimensions of fire-stick farming in this country.


I went into the Queensland Museum and was absolutely horrified to see the six most endangered species. The first was the Julia Creek dunnart, which is right in the heart of my homeland. They said it was endangered because of pugging, which is fine except that it lives in cracking clay country which is covered by cracks in the earth about three inches wide, yet they said that pugging is going to destroy the Julia Creek dunnart. Pigs and prickly acacia trees are destroying the Julia Creek dunnart, the most endangered species in Australia.


In the Magna Carta, our forebears in 1215—Bishop Langston: what a great man. He said that the land does not belong to the Crown; the land belongs to the people and they have a right to sustenance from that land. That is a great principle. It is a principle for which our forebears died.


The greenies have managed to tie up Shelburne Bay, which is a dune blowing into the ocean worth $4,000 million a year to the Australian economy and it will all be gone within 100 years—absolutely provable, verifiable. They put a national park straight over the top of the Laura coal basin, so we will not be able to use any of the coal in that basin. The First Australians are the people who lived there. They are the ones who would be getting the jobs. With the Constance Range iron ore, again, the people who would be getting the jobs in almost all of that area are First Australians. They are the people deprived of a living.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2013-06-24,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (21:07):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


If you come into inner-city Melbourne on any given weekday morning you are almost certainly going to see a line of cars down the Eastern Freeway trying to get into the city. As you look at any picture taken from Hoddle Street out towards the east and down the Eastern Freeway you will see three or four lanes of cars side by side, chockers; you will see a bus lane that has a couple of buses moving in it; and you will see a great swathe of green down the middle of the freeway—land that was set aside more than 30 years ago for a rail line out to Doncaster. You will also find on any given morning people who are trying to come from the west into the city struggling on overcrowded trains and quite often being left at the platform.


As a result, anyone with any sense of rationality looking at Melbourne's transport system has said over the last few decades that there are two critical projects we need to build. One is to finalise that rail line out to Doncaster that we have been promised for so long. The other is to build the Melbourne Metro rail, coming in from the west and then looping in towards the city stations. That will provide another river crossing and greater opportunities for people from the west to come in to work, but also to get into the city without having to use their cars.


Despite the fact that those projects have been on the table for a while and despite the fact that the Melbourne Metro project is ranked by Infrastructure Australia in its highest category, as being ready to proceed, what we have in Victoria is a state government that is ignoring both those projects and is instead pushing for tunnel, a tollway, coming from the east through the middle of inner-city Melbourne into the city. This tunnel will not just wreck inner-city Melbourne and turn it into a rat's nest of on and off ramps; it will not only wreck some of the greatest suburbs that are drawcards for people to come and live, work and play in the city; but it is also completely unfeasible because the people coming in from the east in the morning do not want to get over to the west, as the tunnel proponents tell us, they want to get into the city or to the south. As a result, all that this proposed tunnel will do is extend the massive traffic jam that is the Eastern Freeway in the morning right through the city; it will do nothing to shift people. That is why it is not on Infrastructure Australia's priority list.


Despite the fact that it is not rated highly on Infrastructure Australia's priority list, we have governments intent on progressing it. Currently it is the Victorian Liberal government and the federal opposition who want to progress it. Labor at the state level started the idea of the east-west tunnel, and when there was a debate in this place a little while ago several members of the Labor Party spoke in favour of it. To its credit, though, the Labor Party has announced a significant investment in the Melbourne Metro rail project. That is very good, but it will all amount to nothing if there is a change of government in September. So this bill provides us with an opportunity to Abbott-proof inner-city Melbourne. I urge the government to take up this bill, because it will ensure that that investment that is promised into the Melbourne Metro will be prioritised over the road projects that at the moment are not even on Infrastructure Australia's ready to proceed list.


What this bill will do is introduce an element of rationality into transport planning in our cities—something that has been missing for a very long time. It will say that if there is a rail project listed high up on Infrastructure Australia's list, that should get priority over a lower down road project. Exempted from that, of course, are important safety projects and upgrades that are already underway, and there will be areas where there is no competing public transport project—in regional and rural areas, for example—so it is not intended to address those and it would not. But what it would say is that in our inner cities, where we have been crying out for safe, clean and efficient way of moving people, of getting them to and from work and to and from the city, if such a project is a goer it should be prioritised and we can Abbott-proof inner-city Melbourne before the election.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-06-24,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (21:12):  I grew up in Western Sydney. Before I got my drivers licence I always knew it would take at least an hour to get from the west to the east of Sydney, and that I would need to leave more time than that to get to the train station to get the train into town. Then I got my licence and the only thing that changed was that I saved half an hour. It would still take an hour of travelling and the only time you could get around the city was late at night in the off-peak time. These days, in the morning and the evening, despite all the investment that has occurred in the city, there will still be days where it would be quicker to get to Goulburn than it would to get into the city from Western Sydney. It is a fact of life that the most pressing priority for governments—federal, state and local—is to free up the movement of people in the biggest city in the country. 


I have worries from time to time that Sydney is becoming the Southern Hemisphere's version of LA, where we are a lot more reliant on cars to get around and that we will be stuck in gridlock. But then I actually visited LA and found that their traffic moves quite well—and there are a number of reasons for that that I want to reflect on later. But certainly that issue of congestion is, according to the Planning Institute of Australia, costing our economy this year $13 billion. So, when it comes to infrastructure, Western Sydney is all ears, all eyes, all mind on this issue because we know what it means for us.


You can guess on infrastructure and you can either rely on some of the impressions that I talked about earlier to guide you or rely on public sentiment, and certainly that is an important factor. But what you want to do is make sure that when it comes to infrastructure, you have this degree of independence, that someone is reviewing the plans, that the people in the know are able to bring their expertise to these issues, particularly on something as vexed as infrastructure. That is what this government has sought to do. 


When we established the Infrastructure Australia Act and set up Infrastructure Australia, we put in place an independent body to advise the government on infrastructure matters—a good move. It developed the national priority project list and updates it annually. Funding decisions do remain with the government, but under federal Labor all 15 of the 15 projects identified on Infrastructure Australia's priority list as ready to proceed are ticked off and ready to go. They have all been funded. It is worth noting that they include major rail projects such as the regional rail link, Gold Coast light rail, the Seaford rail extension, Brisbane's Cross River Rail and Melbourne Metro. 


Under the Nation Building Program, I am proud that the government have already increased investment in rail tenfold—not a small investment; it is significant. In Sydney, we are investing $840 million in the northern Sydney freight corridor upgrade, which is currently underway. That will help reduce travel times and make Sydney's rail network more efficient. We are also investing nearly $1 billion in the southern Sydney freight line. That actually opened in January this year, clearing the largest single bottleneck on the interstate rail network and building a dedicated freight line. We committed $2 billion for the Parramatta to Epping light rail link, which will benefit Western Sydney, but the New South Wales government has failed to support the project. 


I do have concerns about the bill. Firstly, it proposes an amendment to the Infrastructure Australia Act to direct a federal minister in decision making. Infrastructure Australia determines priority projects by identifying the most appropriate solution to the nation's transport issues—that is, assessments are deliberately mode neutral. This amendment could result in a situation where some of the highest priority projects in the nation are not funded simply because they are road projects. 


Many places in Australia are not served by rail transport, including many rural communities, suburbs in our cities and some of our most important commercial and industrial places. So it is important to take this balanced approach to nation building with investment in both road and rail. No-one is denying the importance of rail investment and this is why we have made it. The biggest threat, frankly, to rail investment comes from the opposition:


We have no history of funding urban rail and I think it's important we stick to our knitting and the Commonwealth's knitting when it comes to funding infrastructure is roads.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2013-06-24,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (21:17):  Even by Greens standards, the Infrastructure (Priority Funding) Amendment Bill 2013 is a crazy piece of legislation. It will effectively stop road construction around the nation until every rail project conceived and approved by Infrastructure Australia is funded first. Rail does play a very important role in delivering transport services and moving freight around our country, and it is appropriate that we should spend money on rail. But this legislation introduces a draconian new law that would prevent any road projects from proceeding unless they were underway or there were significant safety issues involved, otherwise all of the money that the Commonwealth allocates to road and rail has to be spent on rail.


It is quite clear under this arrangement that there would be no money available for the important road projects. In Queensland, for instance, Cross River Rail is on the list of projects that have been considered by Infrastructure Australia as ready to proceed. The Melbourne Metro stage 1 project is also on that list. These two projects together, according to Infrastructure Australia's, estimates will cost about $6 billion. However, most observers believe the real cost to build those projects will be $10 billion to $15 million. That means that every single cent that this government has allocated under its Nation Building Program will have to be spent on these two city rail projects before a single dollar is available for a road either in the city or in the country. 


I have already had the Greens candidate in my electorate of Wide Bay write to the local newspaper calling for all funds to be taken from the Bruce Highway upgrade in Queensland and spent on passenger rail. The Bruce Highway is responsible for one in six of all fatalities on the National Highway. The Greens view is that no money at all can be spent on upgrading this road until the cross-river tunnel is completed in Brisbane and the metro rail is completed in Melbourne. Of course, there may well be other rail projects over a period of time that will get on this particular list.


It is no comfort to the flood-stranded people in Rockhampton to know that the Greens believe they should stay cut off until the tunnel is built in Brisbane and in Melbourne because that is the priority that should be adopted. It is quite extraordinary that this Greens agenda should deliver a message to all people who live outside the areas that have the privilege of passenger rail services that they are not allowed to have any money spent on their roads. This is, quite frankly, a ridiculous piece of legislation. I am looking forward to telling the people of Australia, particularly those who live in regional communities, the sort of people the Greens like to pretend they actually support and represent from time to time, that as far as the Greens are concerned no money at all can be provided to roads in regional communities and in cities unless every single rail project is completed first. 


This is not the kind of legislation that I would hope the government would support. It is certainly not the sort of legislation that the coalition will support. We recognise that it is important to invest in rail and to make sure that our transport systems work effectively.


There is a need to build major new railway lines and, given a chance in government, the coalition will certainly give those priority. But the intention of the Infrastructure Australia arrangements are that choices be mode neutral, that we pick the best projects. In some cases that would be rail; in other cases it would be road. We should not have legislation that restricts the government of the day or the minister of the day to giving absolute priority to passenger rail services over any other project there might be in the country, no matter how worthy those projects might be.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (21:22):  I rise to speak in opposition to the member for Melbourne's private member's bill—the Infrastructure (Priority Funding) Amendment Bill 2013—but in doing so acknowledge on his part that there is a desire to see a significant interest from the federal government placed on rail infrastructure. Indeed, that interest exists. But I do oppose this private member's bill that he puts before the House, essentially for the reasons that you have just heard from the member for Wide Bay. It does make no sense that you would have in place a piece of legislation that would require that only spending occur in relation to rail, with some very small exceptions, without reference to the need to invest in road infrastructure. 


This government has had an unprecedented commitment to infrastructure in Australia. We have set up Infrastructure Australia, a body to examine the key pieces of infrastructure which need to be developed in this country. Then we have put our money where our mouth is and we have committed to that. In rail alone, we have seen a 10-fold increase in expenditure in relation to rail in this country under this Labor government.


But there is a process in play here which the member for Wide Bay described. There is an independent process of assessing the key infrastructure needs of this country and that is an assessment which is done in a mode neutral way because there are some very important road projects which need to be funded as well. Particularly in regional areas, there are often circumstances where rail alone will not solve the infrastructure issue and where rural communities are necessarily required to use roads. For example, between Geelong and Colac we have seen the duplication of the Princes Highway, which is a very important piece of road infrastructure for what had been a very dangerous piece of road for my constituents.


That said, we as a government have done more for rail than any federal government since Federation, particularly in developing our urban rail networks and our connections to those. The best example of this in my neck of the woods is the Regional Rail Link, which is a $3.2 billion project that will provide for better rail connections for Victoria's regional cities, such as Ballarat and Geelong, into Melbourne. It does this by having a dedicated line for those regional trains into Southern Cross station. When trains are currently entering the Melbourne metropolitan network, they experience what people in cars experience, which is in effect a traffic jam. So, by having a dedicated rail line into Southern Cross station, this will provide for a much faster commute—not because the trains are able to go faster but because they are free of traffic—and that in turn should see a better frequency of trains going into Southern Cross station and provide a much better rail link for people from Geelong into Melbourne.


That is a critical piece of infrastructure for a city like Geelong. Increasingly, Geelong is becoming a lifestyle city where people who want to work in the Greater Melbourne area are choosing to live their life in Geelong. But that only works if there is a good commuter connection between Geelong and Melbourne, and the Regional Rail Link is going to provide that. It will provide that in a way which sees the commute time reduced and which sees a greater frequency of trains so that there is an ability for people to get on those trains, get a seat and to be able to travel in comfort.


The one point I would make in relation to rail is that, whilst there is an intent on the part of the member for Melbourne in putting forward this private member's bill to promote rail, the biggest danger for the development of our rail infrastructure in this country would be the election of an Abbott government in September this year. The Leader of the Opposition could not have made it more plain that an Abbott government stands opposed to the Commonwealth playing any significant role in the development of urban rail. He says it is simply not the Commonwealth's knitting. Well, we are the rail government. (Time expired)

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (21:28):  I am pleased to rise to speak briefly on the Infrastructure (Priority Funding) Amendment Bill 2013, a private member's bill moved by the member for Melbourne, which, if it were passed, would fundamentally defeat the purpose and intention of Infrastructure Australia. The job of Infrastructure Australia is to set and implement national priorities for infrastructure. On this side of the House, we believe that that is a sensible thing to do. We have some questions about the effectiveness with which Infrastructure Australia has worked under the present government but the basic concept, we think, is a very sensible one.


There are limited funds available for infrastructure—many other good things compete—and there is a need to prioritise among the many competing priorities. That is a very tough concept for the Greens to understand because they are in favour of a lot more spending on everything, even at the same time as they want to bring an end to the resources sector, which generates much of the wealth which goes into the government's tax coffers. The notion that there is a limited amount of money to be spent is a fundamental one and therefore we need to set national priorities, including priorities between different projects of the same kind of infrastructure and between projects of different kinds of infrastructure—the choice between roads or rail or ports or water.


The approach proposed in the bill before the House this evening would mandate that rail would automatically get priority over road. It would take away the capacity of Infrastructure Australia to rank the projects based upon an assessment of their merits and would substitute for that a politically motivated preference for one kind of infrastructure project over another 


On this side of the House, we say that is not a sensible approach and for that reason we do not support the approach which is contained in the bill before the House this evening. We do see merit in Infrastructure Australia. We think it needs to work better but we do not think the fetters and the constraints that are proposed in the bill before the House this evening should be supported. We think they are driven by politics rather than facts.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (21:07):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


If you come into inner-city Melbourne on any given weekday morning you are almost certainly going to see a line of cars down the Eastern Freeway trying to get into the city. As you look at any picture taken from Hoddle Street out towards the east and down the Eastern Freeway you will see three or four lanes of cars side by side, chockers; you will see a bus lane that has a couple of buses moving in it; and you will see a great swathe of green down the middle of the freeway—land that was set aside more than 30 years ago for a rail line out to Doncaster. You will also find on any given morning people who are trying to come from the west into the city struggling on overcrowded trains and quite often being left at the platform.


As a result, anyone with any sense of rationality looking at Melbourne's transport system has said over the last few decades that there are two critical projects we need to build. One is to finalise that rail line out to Doncaster that we have been promised for so long. The other is to build the Melbourne Metro rail, coming in from the west and then looping in towards the city stations. That will provide another river crossing and greater opportunities for people from the west to come in to work, but also to get into the city without having to use their cars.


Despite the fact that those projects have been on the table for a while and despite the fact that the Melbourne Metro project is ranked by Infrastructure Australia in its highest category, as being ready to proceed, what we have in Victoria is a state government that is ignoring both those projects and is instead pushing for tunnel, a tollway, coming from the east through the middle of inner-city Melbourne into the city. This tunnel will not just wreck inner-city Melbourne and turn it into a rat's nest of on and off ramps; it will not only wreck some of the greatest suburbs that are drawcards for people to come and live, work and play in the city; but it is also completely unfeasible because the people coming in from the east in the morning do not want to get over to the west, as the tunnel proponents tell us, they want to get into the city or to the south. As a result, all that this proposed tunnel will do is extend the massive traffic jam that is the Eastern Freeway in the morning right through the city; it will do nothing to shift people. That is why it is not on Infrastructure Australia's priority list.


Despite the fact that it is not rated highly on Infrastructure Australia's priority list, we have governments intent on progressing it. Currently it is the Victorian Liberal government and the federal opposition who want to progress it. Labor at the state level started the idea of the east-west tunnel, and when there was a debate in this place a little while ago several members of the Labor Party spoke in favour of it. To its credit, though, the Labor Party has announced a significant investment in the Melbourne Metro rail project. That is very good, but it will all amount to nothing if there is a change of government in September. So this bill provides us with an opportunity to Abbott-proof inner-city Melbourne. I urge the government to take up this bill, because it will ensure that that investment that is promised into the Melbourne Metro will be prioritised over the road projects that at the moment are not even on Infrastructure Australia's ready to proceed list.


What this bill will do is introduce an element of rationality into transport planning in our cities—something that has been missing for a very long time. It will say that if there is a rail project listed high up on Infrastructure Australia's list, that should get priority over a lower down road project. Exempted from that, of course, are important safety projects and upgrades that are already underway, and there will be areas where there is no competing public transport project—in regional and rural areas, for example—so it is not intended to address those and it would not. But what it would say is that in our inner cities, where we have been crying out for safe, clean and efficient way of moving people, of getting them to and from work and to and from the city, if such a project is a goer it should be prioritised and we can Abbott-proof inner-city Melbourne before the election.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (21:12):  I grew up in Western Sydney. Before I got my drivers licence I always knew it would take at least an hour to get from the west to the east of Sydney, and that I would need to leave more time than that to get to the train station to get the train into town. Then I got my licence and the only thing that changed was that I saved half an hour. It would still take an hour of travelling and the only time you could get around the city was late at night in the off-peak time. These days, in the morning and the evening, despite all the investment that has occurred in the city, there will still be days where it would be quicker to get to Goulburn than it would to get into the city from Western Sydney. It is a fact of life that the most pressing priority for governments—federal, state and local—is to free up the movement of people in the biggest city in the country. 


I have worries from time to time that Sydney is becoming the Southern Hemisphere's version of LA, where we are a lot more reliant on cars to get around and that we will be stuck in gridlock. But then I actually visited LA and found that their traffic moves quite well—and there are a number of reasons for that that I want to reflect on later. But certainly that issue of congestion is, according to the Planning Institute of Australia, costing our economy this year $13 billion. So, when it comes to infrastructure, Western Sydney is all ears, all eyes, all mind on this issue because we know what it means for us.


You can guess on infrastructure and you can either rely on some of the impressions that I talked about earlier to guide you or rely on public sentiment, and certainly that is an important factor. But what you want to do is make sure that when it comes to infrastructure, you have this degree of independence, that someone is reviewing the plans, that the people in the know are able to bring their expertise to these issues, particularly on something as vexed as infrastructure. That is what this government has sought to do. 


When we established the Infrastructure Australia Act and set up Infrastructure Australia, we put in place an independent body to advise the government on infrastructure matters—a good move. It developed the national priority project list and updates it annually. Funding decisions do remain with the government, but under federal Labor all 15 of the 15 projects identified on Infrastructure Australia's priority list as ready to proceed are ticked off and ready to go. They have all been funded. It is worth noting that they include major rail projects such as the regional rail link, Gold Coast light rail, the Seaford rail extension, Brisbane's Cross River Rail and Melbourne Metro. 


Under the Nation Building Program, I am proud that the government have already increased investment in rail tenfold—not a small investment; it is significant. In Sydney, we are investing $840 million in the northern Sydney freight corridor upgrade, which is currently underway. That will help reduce travel times and make Sydney's rail network more efficient. We are also investing nearly $1 billion in the southern Sydney freight line. That actually opened in January this year, clearing the largest single bottleneck on the interstate rail network and building a dedicated freight line. We committed $2 billion for the Parramatta to Epping light rail link, which will benefit Western Sydney, but the New South Wales government has failed to support the project. 


I do have concerns about the bill. Firstly, it proposes an amendment to the Infrastructure Australia Act to direct a federal minister in decision making. Infrastructure Australia determines priority projects by identifying the most appropriate solution to the nation's transport issues—that is, assessments are deliberately mode neutral. This amendment could result in a situation where some of the highest priority projects in the nation are not funded simply because they are road projects. 


Many places in Australia are not served by rail transport, including many rural communities, suburbs in our cities and some of our most important commercial and industrial places. So it is important to take this balanced approach to nation building with investment in both road and rail. No-one is denying the importance of rail investment and this is why we have made it. The biggest threat, frankly, to rail investment comes from the opposition:


We have no history of funding urban rail and I think it's important we stick to our knitting and the Commonwealth's knitting when it comes to funding infrastructure is roads.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2013-06-24,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (21:17):  Even by Greens standards, the Infrastructure (Priority Funding) Amendment Bill 2013 is a crazy piece of legislation. It will effectively stop road construction around the nation until every rail project conceived and approved by Infrastructure Australia is funded first. Rail does play a very important role in delivering transport services and moving freight around our country, and it is appropriate that we should spend money on rail. But this legislation introduces a draconian new law that would prevent any road projects from proceeding unless they were underway or there were significant safety issues involved, otherwise all of the money that the Commonwealth allocates to road and rail has to be spent on rail.


It is quite clear under this arrangement that there would be no money available for the important road projects. In Queensland, for instance, Cross River Rail is on the list of projects that have been considered by Infrastructure Australia as ready to proceed. The Melbourne Metro stage 1 project is also on that list. These two projects together, according to Infrastructure Australia's, estimates will cost about $6 billion. However, most observers believe the real cost to build those projects will be $10 billion to $15 million. That means that every single cent that this government has allocated under its Nation Building Program will have to be spent on these two city rail projects before a single dollar is available for a road either in the city or in the country. 


I have already had the Greens candidate in my electorate of Wide Bay write to the local newspaper calling for all funds to be taken from the Bruce Highway upgrade in Queensland and spent on passenger rail. The Bruce Highway is responsible for one in six of all fatalities on the National Highway. The Greens view is that no money at all can be spent on upgrading this road until the cross-river tunnel is completed in Brisbane and the metro rail is completed in Melbourne. Of course, there may well be other rail projects over a period of time that will get on this particular list.


It is no comfort to the flood-stranded people in Rockhampton to know that the Greens believe they should stay cut off until the tunnel is built in Brisbane and in Melbourne because that is the priority that should be adopted. It is quite extraordinary that this Greens agenda should deliver a message to all people who live outside the areas that have the privilege of passenger rail services that they are not allowed to have any money spent on their roads. This is, quite frankly, a ridiculous piece of legislation. I am looking forward to telling the people of Australia, particularly those who live in regional communities, the sort of people the Greens like to pretend they actually support and represent from time to time, that as far as the Greens are concerned no money at all can be provided to roads in regional communities and in cities unless every single rail project is completed first. 


This is not the kind of legislation that I would hope the government would support. It is certainly not the sort of legislation that the coalition will support. We recognise that it is important to invest in rail and to make sure that our transport systems work effectively.


There is a need to build major new railway lines and, given a chance in government, the coalition will certainly give those priority. But the intention of the Infrastructure Australia arrangements are that choices be mode neutral, that we pick the best projects. In some cases that would be rail; in other cases it would be road. We should not have legislation that restricts the government of the day or the minister of the day to giving absolute priority to passenger rail services over any other project there might be in the country, no matter how worthy those projects might be.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (21:22):  I rise to speak in opposition to the member for Melbourne's private member's bill—the Infrastructure (Priority Funding) Amendment Bill 2013—but in doing so acknowledge on his part that there is a desire to see a significant interest from the federal government placed on rail infrastructure. Indeed, that interest exists. But I do oppose this private member's bill that he puts before the House, essentially for the reasons that you have just heard from the member for Wide Bay. It does make no sense that you would have in place a piece of legislation that would require that only spending occur in relation to rail, with some very small exceptions, without reference to the need to invest in road infrastructure. 


This government has had an unprecedented commitment to infrastructure in Australia. We have set up Infrastructure Australia, a body to examine the key pieces of infrastructure which need to be developed in this country. Then we have put our money where our mouth is and we have committed to that. In rail alone, we have seen a 10-fold increase in expenditure in relation to rail in this country under this Labor government.


But there is a process in play here which the member for Wide Bay described. There is an independent process of assessing the key infrastructure needs of this country and that is an assessment which is done in a mode neutral way because there are some very important road projects which need to be funded as well. Particularly in regional areas, there are often circumstances where rail alone will not solve the infrastructure issue and where rural communities are necessarily required to use roads. For example, between Geelong and Colac we have seen the duplication of the Princes Highway, which is a very important piece of road infrastructure for what had been a very dangerous piece of road for my constituents.


That said, we as a government have done more for rail than any federal government since Federation, particularly in developing our urban rail networks and our connections to those. The best example of this in my neck of the woods is the Regional Rail Link, which is a $3.2 billion project that will provide for better rail connections for Victoria's regional cities, such as Ballarat and Geelong, into Melbourne. It does this by having a dedicated line for those regional trains into Southern Cross station. When trains are currently entering the Melbourne metropolitan network, they experience what people in cars experience, which is in effect a traffic jam. So, by having a dedicated rail line into Southern Cross station, this will provide for a much faster commute—not because the trains are able to go faster but because they are free of traffic—and that in turn should see a better frequency of trains going into Southern Cross station and provide a much better rail link for people from Geelong into Melbourne.


That is a critical piece of infrastructure for a city like Geelong. Increasingly, Geelong is becoming a lifestyle city where people who want to work in the Greater Melbourne area are choosing to live their life in Geelong. But that only works if there is a good commuter connection between Geelong and Melbourne, and the Regional Rail Link is going to provide that. It will provide that in a way which sees the commute time reduced and which sees a greater frequency of trains so that there is an ability for people to get on those trains, get a seat and to be able to travel in comfort.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (21:30):  Wests Leagues Club recently celebrated 15 years of supporting local sport at the annual Wests Sports Council presentation night. The presentation acknowledged sporting achievements of junior, youth and senior athletes, teams and clubs across Macarthur.


The junior sportsperson of the year was Liam Marshall from the Magpies Cricket Club. Liam was part of the under-12 division 1 winning premiership team this year. He scored 161 runs at 53.57 runs per innings and 19 wickets at 5.11 runs per wicket. His best bowling figures were four overs, one maiden, five for six, with a highest score of 51 not out. Liam also played in the under-12 Cawsey Representative Shield. He represented New South Wales PSSA in cricket and went on to win the title in South Australia. He has been selected in the under-13 New South Wales Cricket Academy for next season.


The youth club sportsperson of the year was Cormac Clissold from the Southern Districts Tennis Association. This year Cormac represented the district at the state and national levels. At the 2013 annual championships, he won the under-16 boys singles, open mixed doubles and open men's singles. His current Australian National Ranking is 267. His current men's International Tennis Federation ranking is 1,487.


The spirit of sport club person of the year was awarded to group 6 referee Kim-Maree Teale. She certainly has a story to tell. Kim has been a referee since 2003 and helps junior referees with their training, advising, videoing and paperwork. She is a mentor to four female referees and has been on the committee as secretary, assistant secretary, vice-president and president. Kim is the first female president of the referees association. To achieve recognition as president in a male-dominated sport shows the great respect, leadership and knowledge Kim brings to group 6 Football. Kim has introduced a charity for the young referees to participate in called Save our Sons, committed to finding a cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. She also received the Wollondilly Australia Day Award 2013 for Sportsperson of the Year.


The club team of the year went to Gunners Soccer Club under-18 division 1. Team members include Joshua Allen, Jimjay Aloese, Ryan Capps, Nabil Daoud, Craig Jackson, Dylan Karan, Luke Matthews, Jordan Ormrod, Nick Pedreira, Liam Piggott, Jarrod Risby, Luke Shirley, Aiden Shortland, Cameron Wallace, Matthew Wallace, coach, John Rawes, and manager, Tony Piggott. This team is the only team in the Macarthur Association since 2005 to reach the grand final of the mid-season New South Wales State Cup knock-out competition. They won the 2012 Macarthur under-18 division 1 league, scoring a massive 77 goals for, with 20 against. They won the under-18 grand final at Campbelltown Stadium and the under-18 NSW Champion of Champions State Title for the second successive year.


The senior sports club person of the year went to Nicole King from Raby Hockey Club. Nicole was part of the winning Raby Hockey Club 1st division premiership team. She was awarded representative player of the year in 2012 by the Campbelltown City Hockey Association. In 2012, the Australian Olympic Committee presented her with the Pierre de Coubertin Award for fair play and sportsmanship to celebrate the Olympic sport. She represented the Campbelltown City Hockey Association under-18 team and was the New South Wales under-18 indoor team vice-captain.


The elite sports team of the year award went to the Macarthur Baseball League Macarthur Colts under-12 representative team. Team members include Hayden Blackborrow, Ryan Boyce, Harrison Bolton, Blake Cavill, Lachlan Dean, Madison Heath, Jayden King, Jack Lee, Jackson Mannix, Connor Marsh, Josh Pearl, Ray Redman, Michael Sherry, head coach, Matt Cavill, assistant coach, Nick Bolton, pitching coach, Scott Pearl, bench coach, Brian Marsh, executive officer, Rebecca Cavill, and scorer, Kay Cooper. The players were undefeated in 12 rounds and won the minor premiership. The team won the New South Wales Baseball under-12 competition for the first time in Macarthur's history. Seven of its players were selected in Macarthur's little league team as first year players. They finished second in the New South Wales division and attended the national championships on the Gold Coast.


Elite sports person of the year went to Damien Mortimer from Campbelltown Camden District Cricket Club. Damien played first and second grade in the Sydney Grade Cricket Competition. He scored 650 runs this season. He was selected in the New South Wales under-19 team as a top-order batsman with his highest score of 122. He was selected to attend the Cricket Australia Centre of Excellence in Brisbane in a squad of elite under-18 players and the Australian under-19 side to tour New Zealand in March and April. Damien was also selected in the Australian under-19 side to tour Darwin and India and was the recipient of the prestigious Alan McGilvray Scholarship. He has now been identified as an elite cricketer in Australia and I will be very excited to follow his progress over the next few years as he continues to achieve great things.


Finally, I would like to thank the Western Suburbs Leagues Club and the Wests Sports Council for supporting our local athletes and sporting clubs. I congratulate all of this year's award winners for their hard work and great achievements on the sports field. The Macarthur community is certainly very, very proud of you all.

 (Longman) (10:30):  I rise today to inform the House of a great project I launched last week to benefit volunteerism in my local community. It is called Do Something Near You! We all know what a huge contribution volunteers make. They are the backbone of our community welfare organisations and sporting clubs, pouring boundless energy into caring, preparing and serving food, fundraising, logistics, coaching, educating and administrating. In Australia our volunteer rates compare favourably against other nations, with more than a third of the adult population involved. But, obviously, that still leaves a lot of room for improvement.


While most people will tell you that they have thought about volunteering, busy lives mean they never quite get around to it—and that is the beauty of this simple and inspiring idea. With Do Something Near You! helpers are now only a click away from putting their skills and experience to good use. Put simply, Do Something Near You! is an online roll of community groups in 565 regions around Australia with an emphasis on links that invite participants or volunteers. Just typing in a postcode reveals the latest range of organisations, events and activities in that area. Volunteers can sign up for their local SES or Rural Fire Service, donate blood to the Red Cross, assist the RSPCA, join their local Rotary or Lions club or help out with a myriad of other programs and projects. The concept is the brainchild of not-for-profit social and environmental change group Do Something!, whose creators include Planet Ark founders Jon Dee and Pat Cash.


As a pivotal way of showing my support and getting this breakthrough in online volunteering to speak directly to community groups and potential volunteers in my electorate of Longman, I have launched a Do Something Near You! portal on my website through which locals can gain even quicker and easier access to the listings they need. I am privileged to be the first Queensland MP to take up a personalised version of Do Something Near You! Research shows that volunteers enjoy an increased sense of community belonging and, often, a lift in their physical and mental health. The economic impact of Australia's volunteer workforce is not inconsiderable, being estimated at $18 billion a year. While many national organisations are already part of Do Something Near You!, the ultimate goal is to have every local community group, including those in the electorate of Longman, list themselves for free on the site. I am very excited to be involved in Do Something Near You!

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Dr WASHER
 (Moore) (11:01):  I understand the Labor Party would like to amend paragraph (6) of the motion I have moved. I have discussed this with the staff of the Minister for Health and I will be happy to accept that amendment if it is put up.


Needle-stick, scalpel cuts and other sharps injuries are among the most common causes of physical, pathological and psychological hazards for many healthcare workers. A sharps injury can be described as any percutaneous injury that results in piercing of the skin by a needle, scalpel or other sharp object or device, typically occurring during use of the device and before disposal. Importantly, up to 10 per cent of all sharps injuries occur to downstream healthcare workers. The most common occurrence of needle-stick, scalpel cut and other sharps injury is among doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers. At least one in nine nurses suffered one needle-stick injury in the past twelve months.


Healthcare workers are at risk of occupational exposure to the three major blood-borne viruses—hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. A further almost 20 pathogens, for example malaria, infectious mononucleosis, diphtheria, herpes, TB and syphilis, may be transmitted. Viruses such as HIV and HCV have transmission risks that decrease in a couple of hours. However transmission risk is high in HBV, as it can remain stable and infectious for more than one week. We have a vaccination against HBV but no vaccine against HIV or HCV. The healthcare worker needs to receive anti-viral post-exposure treatment after injury. Without this treatment the risk of HIV transmission can be up to 15 times higher. Unfortunately treatment is not always 100 per cent effective. The costs of needle-stick injuries include not only physical risk of serious disease but also substantial psychological trauma, laboratory testing, vaccinations, health visits, counselling, follow-up tests and possible long-term treatment.


The first line of prevention of this type of injury is adherence to standard infection control and safe sharps policies and procedures. In 2005, healthcare workers in Australian hospitals sustained over 18,500 blood and body substance exposures. The true rate of sharps injury in Australia is likely to be higher due to the high rate of under-reporting of sharps injuries. Numerous studies have shown rates for not reporting sharps injuries to range between 30 and 80 per cent. Therefore, there are likely to be over 30,000 needle-stick, scalpel cuts and other sharps injuries occurring in Australia every year. Research shows that using safety-engineered medical devices reduces the incidence of sharps injuries and the related blood-borne virus infection risk. Post implementation of SEMDs can reduce rates of needle-stick injuries by over 80 per cent and, in conjunction with training and guidelines, can reduce injuries by over 90 per cent. 


In 2008, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth had the highest rate of total occupational exposure in WA tertiary hospitals at 0.15 per occupied bed days. The industry standard benchmark is 0.06 per occupied bed days. In 2009, a pilot program introduced into six clinical areas for a three month trial removed and substituted non-safety-engineered medical devices with safety-engineered medical devices. This resulted in an overall 46.4 per cent reduction in blood and body substance exposures across the participating pilot wards. The pilot was extended for a further nine months and showed a sustained reduction in blood and body substance exposures of 54 per cent. At the end of the 12-month pilot in 2010, results demonstrated that the total occupational exposure rate recorded had been reduced from 0.15 to 0.08 per occupied bed days—a remarkable reduction. 


A review of studies investigating the efficiencies of safety-engineered medical devices found that the reduction in sharps injury rates was between 22 and 100 per cent. Further research demonstrated that passive, or automatic, safety devices confer much greater protection than active, or manual, safety devices. Furthermore, the training and education the healthcare workers received on the use of the devices were also found to be important in reducing the incidence of sharps injuries.


With the exception of Victoria and Western Australia, all states and territories have implemented new work health and safety laws, as per the intergovernmental agreement signed by the Council of Australian Governments in 2008. The Work Health and Safety Act and regulations require persons who have a duty to ensure health and safety to manage risks by eliminating health and safety risks, so long as it is reasonably practicable. However, if it is not reasonably practicable and the hazard cannot be eliminated, then substituting the hazard with something safe or reducing the risks through engineered controls is appropriate. In healthcare, the safety-engineered medical devices are considered as suitable engineering controls. 


Australia has yet to adopt a nationally consistent approach to the use of safety-engineered medical devices in healthcare settings, through either prescriptive legislation or policy, despite the high rates of needle-stick, scalpel cuts and other sharps injuries continuing to occur in all Australian facilities and the substantial costs associated with the management of occupation exposures to blood-borne pathogens.


Extensive evidence has shown the effectiveness of safety-engineered medical devices in reducing rates of needle-stick injuries in healthcare facilities and has concluded that guidelines and non-legislative measures alone have not been effective in preventing or reducing needle-stick injuries. My concern here is that, when looking at a safety device, the best determinant of efficacy is whether the device is passive—that is, automatic—or active—that is, manual. The term 'safety-engineered' has been misinterpreted as suggesting that the safety feature being part of the device confers safety in its own right, and there is no proof of this. Evidence-based medicine has also shown repeatedly that changing a doctor or nurse's behaviour is best achieved by audit. Most important is that the development of a staff safety culture is a prerequisite for developing a strong patient safety culture. The most direct route to preventing percutaneous injuries is to make injurious devices safer to handle.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (11:09):  I am happy to speak on the motion of Dr Mal Washer, the member for Moore, on the significant hazards to healthcare and other workers of needle-stick, scalpel and other sharps injuries. I thank the member for Moore, as he will not be here in the 44th Parliament, for his great service to the parliament as a GP and to me personally as a GP. I remember going to see him when I had another rugby union injury, which was a hand injury. I think he gave me some great medical treatment and also some great common sense advice, which was to give up playing rugby union—unfortunately I ignored that advice and got a black eye last weekend. 


I acknowledge the large number of incidents occurring in Australia encountered by people handling needles in a medical setting, or scalpels or other medical equipment. The member for Moore indicated in his motion that there are around 18,000 injuries per year, and that many of these injuries are endured by some of the lowest paid workers in Australia as well as some of the best paid workers—from doctors down to cleaners. It does not discriminate, obviously, and it is not a case, necessarily, where education will prevent these occurrences. I do look forward to finding out more about the SEMDs and some of the structures that can be put in place that will prevent people from doing something accidental—and that is, as anyone who knows workplace health and safety will tell you, the best response. 


Rather than just educating, it is also a matter of setting structures in place so that people cannot be injured. I particularly note that some of the lowest paid workers in Australia, particularly cleaners, who have to deal with medical waste, are often the people suffering the injuries. They do not receive a lot of money, but they are covered by unions like United Voice. I have spoken to them about this issue, and the fact that these workers are not paid much and many of them are women working casual hours becomes particularly worrisome when they also have to endure these needle-stick injuries. 


Sadly these injuries in the past have been neglected and I believe, and as suggested by the member for Moore, many of these injuries go unreported because it is a lapse in a system—people do not want to indicate that their system has broken down, that maybe they were rushed and did something that they should not have done. So prevention is highly necessary in an effort to reduce, and let us hope eliminate, these injuries. A healthcare facility is a workplace, just as much as it is a place for receiving and giving care. Healthcare facilities around the world employ over 59 million workers and throughout the world they are exposed to a complex variety of health and safety hazards every day, including biological hazards such as TB, hepatitis, HIV-AIDS, SARS and chemical hazards. If we cannot get it right in Australia, which is a fairly safe environment, there are obviously greater complications around the world. 


Our healthcare workers need protection from these workplace hazards, and with more than five per cent of Australia's working population experiencing work-related injuries within in a year—one in 20—it is important to protect our workers from injury. We want all of our workers to come home safe—that makes good moral sense and it also makes good economic sense. Because their job is to care for the sick and the injured, healthcare workers are often viewed as being immune to injury or illness. I cannot imagine how many parliamentarians have gone through the member for Moore's door over the last 20 years or so, bringing in their flus and the like, but somehow the member for Moore has to be immune to those flus when he treats parliamentarians and their staff. The patients of healthcare workers usually come first, and these workers are often expected to sacrifice their own wellbeing for the sake of their patients. 


This motion will potentially result in a reduction of sharps injuries and associated risk of infection to healthcare workers. I think the member for Shortland will be dealing with the amendment that has been flagged by the member for Moore. Protecting healthcare workers has an added benefit, in that it contributes to quality patient care and also makes our healthcare system much stronger. Some of the measures to protect patients from infection include making sure that we have an adequate number of staff and making sure that people are not rushing and are not forced to treat too many patients at a time or clean up after too many patients at a time. It is when people are rushed and fatigued that injuries occur. The major hazards to healthcare workers through needle-stick, scalpel and other sharps injuries present serious health and safety risks.


More than 200 people die in Australia each year from a work related injury, with a further 170,000 people injured badly enough to need at least five days off work. Sadly, like the healthcare injuries flagged by the member for Moore, many of these injuries are preventable and we should be doing more about it, because 200 people dying in one year and 170,000 people needing time off work is simply not good enough. The Gillard Labor government is focused on keeping all workers safe, be they the lowest paid or the highest paid. Families should not have to suffer the loss of a loved one, or have them suffer an injury that could change their life completely, because of substandard work health and safety practices,. 


The amendments proposed by the government—which, as I have flagged, will be supported by the opposition—will make sure that state and territory representatives are actively involved in the process of reviewing the existing code of practice for needle-stick injuries so that we address all of the health and safety risks of biohazards broadly. Healthcare workers and their relevant unions, who often have a great role to play in terms of advocating on behalf of the individual—whether it be the doctors union, the nurses union, the cleaners union or the healthcare workers union; whoever they are—play a great role in terms of making sure workplace health and safety issues are brought to the fore. The healthcare workers and unions are very supportive of making sure that there are safety-engineered medical devices that reduce the risk of needle-stick injuries in Australia.


We know that this is everywhere. One of the benefits of being a member of parliament is that you are able to access the Qantas Club—I think it is even a more specialised part of the Qantas Club—and I note that even in those toilets there is the capacity for there to be sharps. Even though people are flying business class around the world, there is still the reality that all sorts of people for all sorts of reasons might be bringing sharps into their workplaces or other people's workplaces. According to the World Health Organization, the causes of needle-stick injuries include: the overuse of injections and unnecessary sharps; a lack of supplies of disposable syringes, safer needle devices and sharps disposal containers; a lack of access to and failure to use sharps containers immediately after injection, perhaps when people are in emergency situations or when they are rushed; inadequate or short staffing; the recapping of needles after use, although one would hope that would not happen as much in Australia; the lack of engineering controls, such as safer needle devices; passing instruments from hand to hand in the operating suite; and just that general lack of awareness of the hazards associated with sharps.


The primary global prevention of needle-stick injuries is achieved through the elimination of unnecessary needles. I say this on a day where we are asking all politicians particularly, and their staff, to donate blood—and earlier today I was with the representatives of the Parliamentary Friends of the Australian Red Cross, where we launched the campaign asking people to give blood—but that is a different process. It is a much bigger needle, but we do need people to give blood. Sadly, one in three Australians at some time in their life will need blood, and we do not have enough people giving blood at the moment, particularly coming into winter. 


We need education about the universal precautions: the elimination of needle recapping and also the use of sharps containers for safe disposal, whether it be in the health workplace or in the other workplaces. The most effective control measures include: the elimination of the hazard, so substituting for injections by administering medications through another route, or removing sharps and needles altogether if possible, so that we eliminate all unnecessary injections; engineering controls, touched on by the member for Moore, such as needles that retract, sheath or blunt immediately after use—they may cost more, but economies of scale mean that the more they are the norm or are legislated, the more the price will come down; and administrative controls, workplace controls and personal protective equipment. All of these combine to make everything safer. (Time expired)

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (11:19):  Can I thank the member for Moore for bringing this motion before the House. It is a particularly important issue and I am very grateful to have the opportunity to second the motion and to contribute to this debate. Whilst needles are synonymous with healthcare workers, it is a little-known fact that needles and other sharps are responsible for nearly 18,000 injuries to healthcare workers every year in Australia. Needle-stick injuries are no respecters of people, because they affect people from the cleaning staff in hospitals and other health providers right through to doctors, surgeons and dentists, in fact. The figure of 18,000 injuries is a minimum, as numerous studies have shown that under-reporting of sharps injuries is in the range of between 30 and 80 per cent. The Medical Technology Association of Australia estimates that the actual number is over 30,000 injuries per year.


Worryingly, over 80 per cent of reported needle-stick injuries involve a contaminated needle. That means that, of the potential 30,000 injuries per year, 24,000 will involve a contaminated needle, presenting a serious health and safety risk and potentially exposing healthcare workers to dangerous blood-borne pathogens including hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. The costs of such injuries are difficult to truly quantify, as injured workers suffer emotionally whilst waiting for the results of testing and must take time off work, which has flow-on effects to the efficiency of our healthcare system. But the costs we can quantify show that more must be done to prevent the number of sharps injuries in our healthcare system. Estimated lifetime treatment costs for a newly HIV-infected person in Australia are over $173,000 per annum. The annual treatment cost of HCV to the Australian government has been estimated at about $252 million per year and $1.5 billion in the next five years. These are huge amounts of money for something that could be prevented with proper protocols and the right equipment. Chronic hepatitis B infection and chronic hepatitis C infection are the underlying causes of liver disease, being respectively the causes of 4.8 per cent and 28.1 per cent of the need for liver transplants. Approximately 200 people receive liver transplants every year, with transplants costing on average up to $177,000 per procedure and long-term follow up costs ranging between $10,000 and $20,000 per year. It is all very well to talk about the cost of treating, but we do not often talk about the human cost to the people that are left to manage their lives with these terrible, debilitating diseases.


In looking at ways to minimise the number of needle-stick injuries in Australia, a study by Whitby and McLaws concluded that the introduction of self-retracting style syringes and elimination of butterfly needles should reduce the current hollow-bore NSIs by more than 70 per cent and almost halve the total incidence of needle-stick injuries. Self-retracting and safety syringes are safety -engineered medical devices; we know them as SEMDs for short. They are defined as a non-needle-sharp or needle device used for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a vein or artery, or administering medications or other fluids, with a built-in safety feature or mechanism that effectively reduces the risk of an exposure incident. An SEMD can be used for the collection of bodily fluids or withdrawal of body fluids after initial venous or arterial access is established, for the administration of medicational fluids and for any procedures involving the potential for occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens due to injuries from contaminated sharps.


The usefulness of SEMDs is well established and healthcare organisations are already encouraged to consider using them, including by the New South Wales Health policy directive to prevent sharps injuries. With the exception of Victoria and Western Australia, all states and territories have implemented new work health and safety laws as per the intergovernmental agreement signed by the Council of Australian Governments in 2008, but the scope of those laws is unclear regarding the use of SEMDs, and current laws require that employers manage risk by eliminating health and safety risks so long as it is reasonably practicable. However, if it is not reasonably practicable to do so then these risks need to be minimised as far as possible.


Needle-stick injuries will never be completely eliminated, but what constitutes a reasonably practical minimisation of risks is debateable. Unfortunately, that often leads to an examination of costs with arguments that training on how to handle needles is more effective than moving towards the use of SEMDs. The number of injuries across Australia, however, shows that training alone is simply not enough. 


A number of years ago BD commissioned a third party to develop a cost-benefit model for estimating the cost of needle-stick injuries in the acute care setting in Australia versus the acquisition cost of safety-engineered medical devices. The model estimated that the cost—based on an uncomplicated, low-risk needle-stick injury where the source patient is known, is low risk, is tested and is found to be negative for HIV, hepatitis C or hepatitis B—was approximately $520. The calculations were based on 100 needle-stick injuries per year, with 42 per cent injuries to nurses, 40 per cent to doctors and 18 per cent to others. 


Briefly, the breakdown of the estimated cost is made up of the following but does not include any cost for workers compensation, premiums, medications if required et cetera. Laboratory testing was $52, based on the Medicare fee for relevant blood tests for HPV, HCV, HIV and LFT. Labour was $289, based on an average of three hours at an hourly rate for staff health nurses, an infectious disease physician and other administrative staff. This took into account the time taken to contact the injured healthcare worker, arrange appointment times, do the paperwork required for initial and follow-up visits, the professional hours involved in consultation and counselling time if required, the time to log the injury on relevant hospital databases and the time to follow up pathology results. Source patient testing was $25, based on the Medicare fee for the relevant blood tests for the diseases I mentioned before. Injured healthcare worker down time was $155, based on two hours of downtime at standard hourly rates for nurses and doctors—for the time taken in reporting the injury, doing blood collection for baseline tests, initial counselling, follow-up counselling and any additional paperwork. 


It is generally accepted that 80 per cent to 90 per cent of all needle-stick and sharps injuries are uncomplicated, low-risk injuries. The remaining 10 per cent to 20 per cent, though, are complicated, high-risk injuries with considerably higher associated costs. The model estimated that the cost of each complicated high-risk injury ranged from $2,000 to $5,900—depending on the post-exposure management protocol employed for the injured healthcare worker. This cost includes prophylaxis or workers compensation payments. In the event that a healthcare worker acquires HIV from a needle-stick injury, the cost soars to $24,000 per year for life. 


This is an important motion. It calls on the House to recognise the significant hazard to healthcare workers. It notes that these injuries present exposure to very dangerous diseases and it acknowledges that preventative measures can be taken to reduce injury, including the use of safety-engineered medical devices which, in the long term, seems to be the most effective—and cost-effective—option to stop people having need-stick injuries.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:29):  I move:


That paragraph (6) be amended to read:


(6) calls on the Government to request SafeWork Australia members, including State and Territory representatives, to consider a review of existing work, health and safety guidance material on preventing sharps injuries and the review should consider mandatory measures in place in the abovementioned countries.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Is the motion seconded?




Dr Washer:
  I second the motion.




Mr ZAPPIA:
  I thank the member for Moore for seconding that amendment, which I understand was discussed with him. The amendment relates to part (6) of the motion, which calls on the government to consider a review of the existing work health and safety guidelines and materials on the prevention of sharps and needle-stick injuries. 


I commend the member for Moore for this motion. This is a very serious matter and I appreciate the fact that the member for Moore has brought it to the attention of the House. It is a matter which, for too long, has gone undebated in and ignored by the wider community. Yet the consequences for the lives of individuals affected by needle-stick and sharps injuries can be profound—not to mention the economic cost to society, which other speakers have already spoken about.


This is a matter I have some understanding of. I will come to that a little bit later. As other members have said, and as the member for Moore quite rightly points out in his motion, needle-stick and sharps injuries do more than just physical damage. More threateningly, they carry the risk of contamination with an infectious disease, such as hepatitis or HIV. Those diseases, as well all know, can be life changing—if not life threatening. It would be extremely traumatic to contract such a disease in the course of just going about your everyday work. 


I appreciate the member for Moore highlighting the statistics for these types of injuries. Some 18,000 healthcare workers are affected each year. That brings home the importance of this issue. These 18,000 healthcare workers not only face the immediate trauma but very likely have to undergo treatment and may end up having to live with the knowledge that they have become carriers of the disease they have been exposed to—a very real concern they would have to live with forever and a day. Also of concern is, as the member for Moore pointed out, that some 15 per cent of these injuries go unreported. That raises the possibility that people may have contracted a disease and are now carriers without even knowing it—since they have not reported it and have not been medically assessed. This is a very serious issue indeed.


There are economic costs as well. These include the time off work and the cost of medical treatment. These costs need to be considered when we consider possible action to minimise these kinds of injuries. There are things which could be done. The member for Moore quite rightly refers to how other countries are dealing with this matter much better than Australia. I know, for example, that in my own community the issue of using retractable needles became a major issue of debate only two or three years ago. 


Whilst I am speaking on this motion, I want to talk about the efforts of Maurice Riddle, the 2010 South Australian Citizen of the Year. Maurice, who is from my local community, was made citizen of the year because for six days a week for many years he has, on his own initiative, gone out on his bicycle to all the playgrounds and community parks of the area to pick up disused needles. He does that because he recognises the dangers those needles represent to children and others who use the playgrounds and the public areas. As a result of his efforts over the years, he has taken thousands of needles out of circulation and made the community a much safer place. He was recognised for that by being nominated South Australian Citizen of the Year in 2010. (Time expired)

Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (11:34):  This is a very important motion and I am glad to see such bipartisan support for it. In a previous life, as I think everyone in this House knows, I was the National Secretary of the Health Services Union. This is one of the issues for the people that we used to represent. I remember spending a lot of time in places like Parramatta Linen Service and Pacific Linen Service just out of Newcastle, and often the people who work in linen services are characterised by a number of things: (1) they are relatively lowly paid—probably some of the lowest-paid health workers in the system; (2), they are very often from non-English-speaking backgrounds; but (3) what is most important in relation to this particular motion is that they are often the people who end up with the sharps injuries or the needle-stick injuries. And those first two points are not unrelated in terms of the way in which the health system operates. What I found most often was that you would have people who did not speak English well, who had relatively low levels of educational standards and who were not well paid who were being injured at the work, causing enormous stress both mentally and, potentially, physically from what could actually happen. There was a real feeling of powerlessness too, because of the position that they held within the health industry. They saw themselves, and many others saw them, as being at the bottom of the pile. They were certainly at the end of the chain in terms of where sharps ended up. And they expressed to me, and to anyone who would listen, their frustration at a system that they felt powerless to actually have a voice about.


Over the last 20 years, undoubtedly there has been great improvement in the way in which sharps are handled, and I do not think anyone in this debate is not conceding that is the case. But, when I was a union official visiting these places, quite often linen would come in where other health workers, in changing the beds, had also chucked sharps in the linen because it was easier to bundle the whole thing up and shoot it down the chute. It ends up at, for example, Parramatta Linen Service, with these poor workers being subject to multiple sharps injuries.


So the issue then became, and still is now: how do you deal with this? Education has played a great role. I do not think you see the levels that you did in the past of nurses and other health professionals simply disposing of sharps within the linen. Nowadays, I suspect, where there are needle-sticks and scalpels that get caught up in there, it is by mistake or by accident rather than by deliberate design, which it used to be. But have we gone far enough? The simple answer, in relation to what happens overseas as the best form of comparison, is: no, we have not. Education is important—it takes us so far. But we do need to look at other measures to make sure that this particular category of health workers, who I think are the most vulnerable in terms of the chain in which this happens, have better protections.


For that reason I was particularly pleased to see in this motion that there was the reference there to looking at safety-engineered medical devices and maximising their use. There are hospitals where they are used already. The argument—and many other speakers have already spoken about that in this debate—is always put about the cost. But what they are arguing in terms of the cost is always a very short-term cost, as opposed to the long-term cost over time: the cost to the worker and their family through these sorts of injuries. When one argues this just on the economic basis and looks in the longer term, these are devices that should be being used. We have made great advances in terms of education—the types of injuries that we see now are not nearly as frequent as they were—but it is not going to get us all the way there, and it is very important that governments look at these sorts of devices to further reduce needle-stick injuries. So I congratulate the member on bringing this important— (Time expired)

Ms HALL
 (Shortland) (11:39):  Before I start the substance of my contribution to this debate, I would like to put on record my thanks to the member for Moore for bringing this motion before the House and for his almost 15-year contribution to debates on this and other issues in the parliament. He has provided support and assistance to many members in this parliament, he has used his medical skills to keep this House operating and he has tendered his healing hand to members on both sides of the parliament. I thank him for what he has done in that area. I also mention—and I think it relates a little bit to the motion we are debating today—his contributions to drug law reform, in particular his contribution to providing a health perspective on that issue. I strongly thank him for his contribution and I thank him for his friendship.


This motion raises health issues relating to needle-stick and other types of sharps injuries. Needle-stick injuries can be experienced by any healthcare professional who uses needles or any other sharp object. That includes individuals from a wide range of occupations who work in hospitals, aged care, mental health or other healthcare services, such as social and community services. My daughter-in-law is a nurse and works in accident and emergency services. She has told me that many nurses worry about the impact that sharps injuries can have on health professionals. We read regularly about such incidents in the newspapers and we know, as legislators, that this is an important issue that needs to be addressed—and we know that we have been a little bit slow in running with it.


Data from the EPINetTM system suggests that in United States' hospitals, on average, incur approximately 30 needle-stick injuries per 100 beds per year. In Australia, at least 18,000 healthcare professionals suffer from a needle-stick injury every year. The true rate is not known in Australia. The numbers are likely to be a lot higher than are reported under the NSI reporting scheme. Numerous studies have estimated the percentage of needle-stick injuries not reported with results ranging between 30 per cent and 80 per cent. Reporting of needle-stick injuries decreases as the number of injuries increases—which is really quite scary. The more injuries there are, the less they are reported. That shows a general attitude to needle-stick injuries within the workplace. The attitude should be one of great care and the culture should be one of reporting incidents immediately, seeking treatment and having tests. Rather than that, the issue is pushed aside. I find that extremely disturbing. For cases where the person is experiencing their first injury, 84 per cent of incidents are reported. But that number drops to 63 per cent where a person has had three to four injuries and to only 24 per cent where a person has had more than five injuries. So there is this very complacent attitude. Therefore, there are likely to be over 30,000 needle-stick injuries occurring in Australia every year.


One in nine nurses in Australia has had at least one needle-stick injury in the past 12 months. Nurses incur the highest proportion of the total needle-stick injuries in comparison to other health professionals. Data reported from New South Wales public hospitals indicates that needle-stick injuries pose a significant risk to healthcare workers in New South Wales. Preliminary results indicate that 40 per cent of healthcare workers who have experienced a needle-stick injury in New South Wales are registered nurses, and I made the point a moment ago that the highest percentage of needle-stick injuries are incurred by nurses, followed by medical officers.


Most of the needle-stick injuries involved hollow-bore needles, and figures are consistent with previous reports by the International Healthcare Worker Safety Centre of the University of Virginia. The greatest hazard associated with needle-stick injury is the transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV—which is the virus that causes immune deficiency syndrome. A further 20 per cent of other pathogens—such as malaria, infectious mononucleosis, diphtheria, herpes, tuberculosis and syphilis—can also be transmitted in that way. Transmission of pathogens may occur not only with freshly contaminated needles and sharp objects but also with needles or sharp objects that have carried dry blood. Once again, there have been some very high profile cases that relate to dry blood. Transmission rates vary by type and severity of exposure. However, the transmission risk is high for viruses such as HBV as it can remain stable and infectious for more than a week. 


I think that the argument in relation to this motion —the words, the results and the effect of the argument—speaks for itself. There are so many reasons why governments need to act to deal with this. The cost of needle-stick injuries is substantial for the Australian healthcare system, due to the costs associated with the management of the exposure to blood and body fluids and the prevention and treatment of blood-borne pathogens. Additionally, needle-stick injuries can result in great stress for the injured health professionals and their families, and I do not think that we can underestimate the impact that that has. The simple fact that so many of these incidents are not reported shows that there can be a complacency, but it can also show that the worker may fear having it investigated. Making it an issue that needs to be dealt with and that health systems and governments require proper reporting of really will lead to an amelioration of a number of these problems.


I think that the amendment that is being made is very sound. We do need to have this issue looked at, and Safe Work Australia is a very good body to undertake such a review. I believe that the state and territory governments definitely have a very important role to play in this. I finish by saying this is an issue that we need to address. This is an issue that I know the member for Moore is totally committed to seeing an improvement in, and I thank him for bringing it to the House and for all the fine work that he has performed within this parliament. Thank you, Member for Moore.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:50):  I rise to speak on the member for Moore's motion regarding the impact of needle-stick, scalpel and other sharps injuries. As the motion highlights, needle-stick and sharps injuries, NSIs, posed a significant hazard to healthcare workers. In Australia at least 18,000 health professionals suffer from NSIs each year. Nurses make up approximately 75 per cent of those affected, with one in nine nurses reporting at least one NSI in the 12 months to April 2013. According to research published in journals such as Clinical Infectious Diseases and the Journal of Advanced Nursing, the actual rate of NSIs is likely to be significantly higher, as under-reporting of NSIs ranges between 30 to 80 per cent. There are therefore likely to be more than 30,000 NSIs each year in Australia.


These injuries present a serious health and safety risk, exposing healthcare workers to dangerous blood-borne pathogens including the Hepatitis B virus, the Hepatitis C virus and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV. Globally, NSIs are the most common source of occupational exposures to blood and the primary cause of blood-borne infections in healthcare workers. Significant costs are associated with NSIs, including in post-exposure prophylaxis, in medical testing and in long-term treatment as well as in time loss due to anxiety and stress. Even when NSI does not involve a contaminated needle and where there is no chance of infection, we can all appreciate the significant psychological strain placed on someone who is waiting to hear whether they have been infected. If a healthcare worker does acquire a blood-borne infection, treatment can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars—such as in the treatment of HIV which, in a newly infected person in Australia, results in a lifetime treatment cost of $173,000.


The best way to reduce these costs, therefore, is by implementing effective prevention techniques. Fortunately there are preventative measures that can be taken to reduce injury, including the use of safety-engineered medical devices, SEMDs. When combined with relevant education and training, the use of SEMDs reduces the incidence of sharps injuries. One of the most effective advances in reducing the incidence of NSIs is a self-retracting safety syringe, with an Australian study by Whitby and McLaws which concludes that their introduction would almost halve the total incidence of NSIs. Researchers at the University of Queensland are doing very important work in this area, with the development of a completely dissolvable nanopatch for vaccine delivery. Smaller than a postage stamp, the nanopatch means we may no longer require needles at all for vaccination programs, because in application to the skin its thousands of projections immediately become wet and dissolve within minutes. As Professor Kendall has said, the dissolvable nanopatch means:


… zero needles, zero sharps, zero opportunity for contamination and zero chance of needle-stick injury.


The nanopatch not only makes it easier and safer for a patient receiving a vaccine, but by its design it significantly cuts the risk of NSIs for healthcare workers.


The potential of this kind of vaccine administration is also highlighted by the enormous cost of needle-stick and sharps injuries in developing countries. The World Health Organisation estimates that approximately 30 per cent of vaccinations in Africa are unsafe due to cross-contamination caused by needle-stick injury—a healthcare burden of about $25 per administration. Similarly, because a nanopatch is very stable across a wide range of temperatures, the costs associated with maintaining the vaccine virus in cold storage are significantly reduced. Particularly in the searing temperatures of Africa, this is another very welcome benefit.


Although technological advances have occurred in this area, Australia currently lags behind other Western countries that have mandated measures to reduce sharps injuries. Other major jurisdictions, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union, have made significant steps in health and safety in preventing NSIs. I understand that Australia does not have a nationally consistent approach to reduce the number of NSIs through the use of safety-engineered medical devices. Given the evidence that does exist about the impact advances in technology, and in education and training, can have on mitigation, a national approach could do more to reduce the exposure of blood-borne pathogens.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank the member for Moore for his contribution across so many areas but particularly for bringing further awareness about medical issues to the wider community and for his work during his time as a member of this House. I commend this motion.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:55):  I too commend the motion moved by the member for Moore, Dr Mal Washer, regarding the prevalence and danger of needle-stick injuries to healthcare workers. In doing so, I would also like to commend Dr Washer on his sterling contribution to this place, since his election in 1998. He would recall that he came into this place with one Kay Hull, who is my predecessor as the member for Riverina. I spoke to Kay just a few moments ago, and she wanted me to pass on her very good wishes to you, Dr Washer, on your retirement and to your family. Dr Washer, as you would be aware, Kay served this place very well on this matter in a combined effort at the United Nations and International Parliamentary Union Committee on HIV/AIDS, and she was very pleased that I was speaking on this motion. 


This is a good motion. It seeks to bring the parliament's attention to the prevalence and danger of needle-stick injuries. Needle-stick and sharps injuries are some of the most common causes of physical, pathological and, indeed, psychological hazards for healthcare workers in Australia. We all know what a sterling job, what a marvellous job, the healthcare workers of Australia do for the betterment of our nation. There are some 18,000 people who suffer from a needle-stick injury every year. This is a very alarming and worrying statistic. Further, there are estimations that one in every nine nurses will suffer from a needle-stick injury during their career. Worryingly, 30 to 80 per cent of people—up to 80 per cent of people!—who are affected by needle-stick injuries are unlikely to report them, according to the data. 


This is a very important issue, particularly for nurses, for doctors and for other medical professionals in regional areas, where facilities to treat needle-stick injuries are unfortunately not up to the same standards that we see in metropolitan areas. Needle-stick injuries pose a significant risk to healthcare workers in this country, and this motion seeks to call upon the government to immediately improve healthcare worker safety by bringing Australia into line with the countries named in this motion. As I said, up to 18,000 healthcare professionals suffer from an NSI every year, and the true rate, in Australia, is likely to be higher due to the unfortunate underreporting of needle-stick injuries. Several studies have shown that it could be up to 80 per cent. 


Reporting of needle-stick injuries decreases as the number of injuries increases: 84 per cent for a single injury; 63 per cent for three to four injuries; and 24 per cent for more than five injuries. Therefore, there could be more than 30,000 needle-stick injuries occurring in Australia each year. One in nine nurses, according to the Office of Australian Safety and Compensation Council, have had at least one needle-stick injury in the past 12 months. Nurses incur the highest proportion of total needle-stick injuries compared with other healthcare professionals, with an incidence rate of up to 75 per cent of total injuries. Data reported from New South Wales public hospitals indicate that needle-stick injuries pose a significant risk to healthcare workers in that state. Preliminary results indicate that 40 per cent of healthcare workers who experience a needle-stick injury in New South Wales are registered nurses, followed by medical officers. Most of the needle-stick injuries involved hollow bore needles. These figures are consistent with those previously reported by the International Healthcare Worker Safety Center at the University of Virginia. We know that other countries are playing their part to ensure that their healthcare workers, those wonderful people of mercy, are very much aware of what their rights are, very much aware of the need to report these injuries and very much taken care of after an injury occurs and has been reported, and we need to do the same here in Australia. 


We need to follow this wonderful motion of Dr Washer's, the member for Moore, so that we are brought into line with the United Kingdom, where the Health and Safety Executive has introduced the Health and Safety (Sharp Instruments in Healthcare) Regulations 2013. We need to be brought in line with the United States of America, which signed into law more than a decade ago the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act 2000. We know that preventative measures can be taken to reduce injury, including the use of safety engineered medical devices, which, when combined with relevant education and training, reduces the incidence of sharps injuries. This is a very important motion. I am very pleased that, in his final few days in this parliament, Dr Washer has brought it to the attention of the House. I commend the motion to the House. I commend Dr Washer once again on his sterling advocacy for all things related to health. Thank you.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (12:00):  I commend the member for Moore, who is showing yet again his longstanding concern for the health of Australians. I wish him every success and happiness in his retirement with his family and friends, with his duty to his constituents well fulfilled. I thank him very much for his personal care of me and other members on this side of the chamber over many years as well. It is one of those things that people do not often notice.


I was really struck when I saw reports about how Australia was falling behind the United States and Europe, and certainly when Dr Karen Daly attended a nursing conference. She has a PhD and has been a campaigner for safety in the United States for a long time. The president of the American Nurses Association indicated that Australia needed to get on board with the United States and Europe in this regard. I have also had discussions in the past with people from the Queensland Nurses Union. I know Beth Mohle, the Secretary of the Queensland Nurses Union, has been a strong advocate in this area for a very long time back in my home state of Queensland. But I also noticed the comments of Lee Thomas, the federal secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation, saying the health sector should align its safety protocols with legislation that requires use of engineering controls to eliminate foreseeable workplace hazards. Lee was quoted as saying:


Hospitals and the health sector need to take up the challenge to be proactive in protecting their staff.


She called for safety-engineered devices to be made available sooner rather than later. It is not just nurses but also people who work in medical administration who may be exposed to this problem. I commend also the Alliance for Sharps Safety and Needlestick Prevention in Healthcare. It is an alliance of a lot of organisations, including the Australian Nursing Federation, the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases, the Australian Society for Microbiology, the Royal College of Nursing Australia, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, and a number of other organisations who have been pushing this issue for quite a long time.


There are some terrible stories which I have read in relation to this particular issue. I think there is a need to incorporate international occupational health and safety regulations and codes of practice and mandatory use of safety-engineered medical devices in our healthcare system. Its time has come. We do not want to minimise the impact that this could have in terms of the transfer of HIV and hep C and other blood-related challenges that we have. These do occur and they are devastating. Healthcare workers face the risk of needle-stick injury every single day. The workplace safety of our healthcare workers is the domain of hospitals and institutions. This needs to be a national approach.


We on this side of the chamber remain strongly committed, with our brother and sister organisations in the labour movement, to safety and quality in healthcare services. We recognise the importance of making sure that workplaces, whether hospitals or medical practices, are safe, consumer centred and well equipped to make sure that healthcare is of a standard not just delivered to patients but also in the workplace. We are committed, and we have harmonised the workplace health and safety laws across Australia, improving consistency and certainty and reducing red tape. I think on balance you have to say that we have had a good record in reforming workplace health and safety. But it does not mean to say there is perfection. There is always more work to be done, and I think the member for Moore has highlighted particularly an area that our brothers and sisters in the nurses federations and unions around the country have been pricking our conscience in relation to.


I am concerned with what we have seen, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, in our home state of Queensland with cutbacks, outsourcing, contestability and privatisation. These all the words that are being used back in my home state of Queensland in relation to delivery of healthcare services. I know there are members opposite who are concerned with what is happening in places like Victoria and Queensland. I am concerned that, if these things happen in Queensland, we may lose the focus on workplace health and safety. In my home area, in community healthcare, we have healthcare providers doing security at the Ipswich Community Health Centre in Bell Street. They should not be worried about that. There is an ATODS clinic there. Why should they be doing that? This is the challenge we have. We need to focus on issues like this, not go down the road of contestability, privatisation and outsourcing. This should be a bipartisan approach. I thank the member for Moore for bringing this issue to the attention of government. I hope everyone listens. I wish him well and thank him for his sterling contribution to the people of Australia.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (12:05):  I would like to commend the member for Moore and this motion of his about the significant hazard to healthcare workers through sharps injuries. Australia's healthcare system is in turmoil thanks to Labor, with shortages in staff and beds. Healthcare workers are stretched to their limits due to staff shortages and are required to work long and extra shifts. Without these people in our society, we just could not function. Therefore we need to look after them and look out for them. One of the most common causes of physical, pathological and psychological injuries for many healthcare workers is needle-stick and sharps injuries. 


In 2012 the ECRI Institute reported needle-stick injuries as one of the top 10 hazards for doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers. Australia lags behind places such as the United States, Canada and the European Union, who have all mandated measures to reduce sharps injuries. We can do better. Our healthcare workers are at higher risk of blood borne viruses like hepatitis B and C and HIV. The first line of defence is rigorous infection control and safe sharps policies and procedures. Safety engineered medical devices, when combined with relevant education and training, have been found to significantly reduce sharps injuries. 


This has been highlighted by the introduction of safety engineered medical devices into six clinical areas at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth. Before the trial started in 2008, it was noted that WA tertiary hospital Sir Charles Gairdner had the highest rate of total occupational exposure, at 0.15 per occupied bed day. The industry standard is 0.06 per occupied bed day. Within nine months of implementing the safety engineered medical devices, there was an overall 54 per cent reduction in needle-stick injuries. At the end of 2012, Sir Charles Gairdner had reduced the total occupational exposure rate to 0.05 per occupied bed day, and it is now the leading hospital in WA in reducing body substance exposure to staff. 


An economic evaluation carried out by the Medical Technology Association of Australia to estimate the annual costs savings of implementing safety engineered medical devices in all Australian hospitals found an average cost saving of $18.6 million per year. This estimate did not include costs of post-exposure, prophylaxis or treatment costs for hepatitis C or HIV. Therefore, needle-stick and sharps injuries are a huge expense to our healthcare system and for this reason alone deserve action. 


Thanks to the Labor government we have no money, just debt. Our hospitals are crying out for funding, but there is no more to give. We need to focus our spending efficiently. Investment in the welfare of our healthcare workers is sound and prudent investment. In Canada alone, six out of 10 provinces have occupational health and safety regulations mandating the use of safety engineered medical devices. They can see the importance of these devices in protecting their workers. We need to do the same. I call on the government to immediately improve the safety of our healthcare workers and bring Australia up to the standards of other Western countries. We can do better. Benchmarking against international best practice is what is required. Nothing short of the best is good enough for our front-line heroes. 


The standards that other nations have put in place contain safeguards to protect workers against health hazards caused by blood borne pathogens. Sixty-two to 88 per cent of sharps injuries can potentially be prevented by the use of safer medical devices. While the exposure to blood borne pathogens is one of the most deadly hazards that nurses face on a daily basis, it is also one of the most preventable. With the rapid development of technology and engineering controls, prevention is becoming easier and easier.


By using safer devices, institutions will not only protect workers but will also save money. Safer needle devices can cost from cents to dollars more than standard devices, but prices continue to decrease with increased market competition and technology. Prevention is cost-effective. We can do better. We owe it to our doctors and nurses—and simple steps make big differences.


Finally, I would like to once again commend Dr Washer for this motion and for a host of other work that he has done in this place.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2013-06-24,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (12:10):  It is a great honour to speak on this motion by the member for Moore, Dr Mal Washer. Let me begin by saying that he is truly a great Australian, a great doctor and a great benefit to this House. He always reminded me, in his bedside manner, of my old doctor in my youth, Dr Hicks—a great old doctor; they don't make them like that anymore!


Inherit in this motion is a care for healthcare workers and for them at work. I would certainly like to reiterate the wording of this motion and commend it. I think it is a particularly important issue. I have never worked in the healthcare sector, but from time to time I do go to the Lyell McEwin Hospital—where I was born—in the heart of my electorate and talk to workers and volunteers, doctors and nurses, cleaners of wards and the like, about their day-to-day work. I know they deal with a range of situations where, sadly, they might have to contemplate needle-stick injuries and the transmission of HIV, hepatitis and the like.


The workers at that hospital deserve to be safe. I am very pleased to see in this motion that the unions are included, Safe Work Australia is included and the relevant state and territory OH&S bodies are included, because it is only through detailed policies, which are observed and enforced at the workplace level, that these sorts of injuries are prevented. Believe it or not, when I was in the retail union, I saw quite a bit of evidence that would commend this motion. You would not think that retail workers would have to deal with needle-stick injuries, but in actual fact retail workers often have to deal with a variety of situations and incidences where biohazards are encountered. I often came across shop assistants who had been placed in the most extreme environments—having to clean up vomit or urine and faeces in a store. I remember one worker, a cleaner who worked at a large furniture shop in Adelaide. This furniture shop had a large room of balls, where children would play. Of course, occasionally, children being children, they would mess themselves, and he had to clean faeces off those balls, so it was a pretty unpleasant job. In a great trade union way, I got him a bit of an allowance for dealing with that! But it is not uncommon for retail workers to have to deal with that—and, unfortunately, it is not uncommon for them to have to deal with the results of violence, where knives have been used, blood has been left on the floor et cetera. I have had situations where shop assistants have had to clean up after suicide attempts. We had one department store in Adelaide where, very sadly, a female worker was murdered by her estranged partner, which was very distressing for the staff. And, unfortunately, because people do not anticipate that this would happen in shops—you think that shops and pubs and clubs would be relatively clean environments—there was often no biohazard material to clean this stuff up and people were just simply sent out with mops and buckets. Obviously, in the case of the department store, it was a little bit more serious and it was a crime scene, but there are situations where workers, in all fields, particularly those open to the public, have to deal with needle-stick injuries, have to deal with biohazards and have to deal with very serious situations.


The member for Moore, Dr Washer, has brought this, in his usual bipartisan, pragmatic and good sense style, to the parliament for our consideration. I think it is worthy of our bipartisan consideration and worthy of our bipartisan support. We will miss you, Mal, and your way of rising above the trivialities of this place and making sure we deal with the serious issues that workers not just in the healthcare sector but right across the board deal with every day. Thanks so much.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2013-06-24,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (12:15):  I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion moved by the member for Moore dealing with needle-stick, scalpel and sharps injuries. Just like the member for Wakefield, and other speakers, I would like to commend the member for Moore—not simply for this thoughtful and well-considered motion but also for his outstanding service to this place and to the people of his electorate. For 15 years the member for Moore has made that gruelling commute as one of the original fly-in fly-out workers in our community. He has been a real champion for Western Australia. I know, as the House has heard today, how highly regarded he has been by members on both sides. I think it is a credit to the member for Moore that his inherent decency has won him many friends in this place, which is sometimes quite friendless. He is a person of great personal integrity and has the respect of members on both sides who have served with him.


The member for Moore has been prepared to swim against the tide and stand up for his own, very strong values, when it would perhaps have been easier to go with the flow of the direction his party or the coalition was taking—but I think that bravery is something that he will be well remembered for. It has been a very memorable political career, and I wish him well in the next stage of his life.


The motion before the house today is very much typical of the member for Moore. It does not surprise me that there is a great deal of compassion for others in the substance of the motion, because it highlights the very real risk to our healthcare employees through such injuries. There are estimates that up to $18,000 people per year are  injured through needle-stick, scalpel or sharps injuries. The information provided to me by the member for Moore himself indicates that perhaps that figure underestimates the real impact in the healthcare workers sector—and that is despite the availability of preventative measures that can be taken to reduce injury, including the use of safety-engineered medical devices, which many people today have spoken about. When combined with relevant training and education, that has the proven capacity to reduce the incidence of sharps injuries. I fear that, as the motion indicates, Australia may have slipped behind similar nations in our efforts in this regard, and perhaps we can do better in the future.


There is also, as other members have mentioned, a less common but equally alarming incidence of sharps injuries in our communities, when discarded equipment, which may have been associated with illicit drug use, results in a needle-stick injury. The media perhaps catches onto those issues with more energy than it does the risks facing healthcare workers, but I suppose that is because of the uncertainty, the emotional anguish, the potential health implications that are all considerations in such circumstances. But, when you think about it, the healthcare workers are faced with this risk every day of the week; not just in isolated cases, as may be the case when a member of the public is injured in a recreational area or a beach. The fact that our healthcare workers are facing that potential anguish on a daily basis is something that the motion reflects and that we should consider in the chamber today.


Needle-stick and sharps injuries are one of the most common causes of physical, pathological or psychological hazards for many who work in the healthcare industry. It alarms me that it is the workers right at the frontline, particularly our nursing staff, who face the greatest risk of all. It is alarming that one in nine Australian nurses had at least one needle-stick or a sharp injury in the past 12 months—they do actually incur the highest proportion of those injuries in our community. Needle-stick and sharps injuries are associated with a substantial amount of cost beyond the emotional toll I have referred to. There is also the financial cost to the Australian healthcare system. They can also increase the morbidly and mortality risk for the injured healthcare worker due to exposure to blood-borne pathogens.


The safety of workers is something that all members are concerned about. It is not just whether you have had a background working with the unions. I think all members in this place are concerned about the safety of workers, and it is critical that this issue gets the exposure it deserves here today. As the motion indicates, it is an area of genuine concern for the parliament and one where I believe we can do better, in particular in relation to the use of the safety-engineered medical devices, given the proof we have today of them being successful in preventing such injuries in other nations. 


I congratulate the member for Moore for bringing this motion to the House and I also congratulate members on both sides for speaking in favour of this important motion.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (12:20):  I am delighted to speak on this motion. I suggest to the member for Moore that this will be his last private member's motion in this place and I want to add my comments to those who have gone before me on the distinguished nature of his time here. 


Much has been said about you, member for Moore. We all certainly enjoyed your valedictory speech, but nothing exemplifies the qualities you have as a person, as a compassionate man who took his oath as a doctor particularly seriously and to heart, more than this motion before the House. I commend you for that. Even at this time, when you are considering your retirement from this place, it is indicative of you as a person that you are thinking of others before yourself. The Hippocratic oath you took is very much a part of the motion that you have before the House. Like other members I will miss you greatly in this place, not just for the nature of your compassion and your caring but also for your significant intellect, which this whole parliament and, I suggest, the Australian people, will miss greatly. I hope that when you see an issue in this place that needs addressing, like the issues in this motion, you will still seek to pass it on to members so that this caring can continue.


I imagine I am repeating some things that have gone before, but this is a really important issue for healthcare workers. I know all of the statistics have been repeated already: 18,000 healthcare employees suffer injuries each year. But I want to go to the important issue, which I know the member for Moore would feel—the stress around what comes next for a healthcare worker who receives this type of injury. What do they go through? I know this would exercise the member for Moore's mind. I had a look at the process on a US website. They were encouraging their injured people firstly, No. 1, to seek immediate medical help to assess the risk of developing infection. Number 2 was to determine whether the patient on whom the needle was used has HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. The third thing was to wait for the results of their blood tests and for information on the patient—wait and worry, I would suggest, member for Moore—then to determine whether they will need medication to prevent an infection. Following that exposure, follow-up may include drugs with significant side effects on the healthcare worker. The website says:


Blood tests and further evaluation may be needed for six months to a year following the injury.


It also says:


As you wait for more information, the anxiety of the unknown can be a serious distraction for you and is stressful for your family.


These are the very real personal impacts of this injury which healthcare workers and their families face. Knowing the member for Moore as I do, I know that these would very much be the reasons why the member for Moore feels we need to, and should, do better. At least one in nine nurses and their families go through this every year. When you look at the list of things they have to go through, we do need to do better. According to research on this US site regarding when injuries occur:


For example, 40 percent of injuries occur during use, another 40 percent occur after use and before disposal …


When you look at the process, the need for preventive measures is critical. The member for Moore has alluded to those as well. Measures to particularly prevent and reduce those injuries in both of those 40 per cent instances are very critical, using safety engineered medical devices.


In completing my comments, I do not have enough words to actually record the value of the member for Moore's contribution in this place over an extended period and I can only say the parliament and the people of Australia will be worse off with him leaving this place.

Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (13:18):  I have had the opportunity to speak previously on the recognition of same-sex marriages. It is an issue that has been on the agenda in our country for many years. It is a part of what I think is a changing public appreciation that the commitment that those who wish to have a same-sex relationship make is a commitment that ought to be duly and formally recognised in marriage as well. In fact, I spoke on the Jones bill in the parliament. At that time I made my views very clear, and I would like to briefly repeat what I said—that I do not believe we should be discriminating against people on the basis of race or religion, and nor should we be enabling discrimination on the basis of choice. This parliament should not deny our brothers and sisters, our nieces and nephews, our children, those we work with and those we represent the right to be considered equally in the eyes of the law as fellow human beings who are entitled to have their commitment to a permanent relationship duly recognised by the state. 


Additionally, I wanted to make clear, as the minister for school education, how important this issue is for young Australians who may determine that their relationships are to be same-sex relationships and who may be giving indications of that even through high school years and as they start to mature and go on into adult life. The fact is that, regrettably, we still have high levels of bullying taking place not only in our schools but also through cyberbullying, which is of increasing prevalence in our community. In a number of cases it is both sexual orientation itself and the differences that people might express by their sexual orientation that can be the subject of bullying in the classroom, outside the classroom or online via the variety of hand-held devices and communication technologies that are available to young people today. 


The parliament has looked at this matter on a couple of occasions now. The last time that we came onto the floor of the parliament—Labor members in this parliament are able to take a conscience vote—I voted to support the recognition of same-sex relationships by the state. I note that, as of last reading, that same opportunity for a conscience vote was not permitted by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott. I think it is now time that Mr Abbott reconsidered his position on this matter. I say that not only because I believe that we as an Australian community have reached the point of being able to maturely recognise the level of commitment that same-sex couples bring to their relationship but also because, until we have taken that final step, we do not have in place either the symbolic or the real recognition of both the status and the intention that adheres to those relationships. In that absence, there is still fertile ground for people to believe that there ought to be a form of discrimination that might manifest itself by way of bullying, unkind behaviours and comments in school or online. 


As the Minister for School Education I wanted to again place my commitment on the record but also highlight how important I think it is for the parliament to take this necessary step. I do that recognising that, for any young person, the period of adolescence going into adulthood is an absolutely crucial transition period in their lives. The impact of bullying on a young person at that particular point can be far-reaching. It can have consequences that, regrettably, can in some instances be absolutely tragic. We in Australia, as a community and as a society, need to finally recognise that these sorts of instances would be much less likely to happen if we were to take the steps that I think we ought to as a nation and as a parliament to recognise same-sex commitments by the state in this place.

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (16:00):  I rise to speak on the Homelessness Bill 2013 and the Homelessness (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. The bill's explanatory memorandum states that this bill is aimed at increasing recognition and awareness of people who are homeless or who are at risk of homelessness. The consequential amendments bill repeals the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994 to make way for the new legislation and replaces the definition of 'homeless person' which applies in the provisions about including itinerant electors in the electoral rolls to ensure that people who are homelessness can still effectively participate in electoral activities. The bills make some definitional changes and remove references to the superseded Homelessness Funding Mechanism referred to in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994. The bills are otherwise little more than broad statements of principle and aspiration. This is something we are used to seeing from this Labor government—all politics, no policy. These bills do not impact on funding for service provision for homelessness.


The coalition will not oppose the bills, but is concerned that, through this legislation, the Labor government has produced yet another statement of aspiration without any ongoing tangible commitment to reducing homelessness on the ground. Indeed, the bills are a missed opportunity and will not make any difference to the plight of homeless Australians. These bills stem from a recommendation in Labor's white paper on homelessness to enact new legislation to ensure that people who are homeless receive quality support services and adequate support. The introduced bills are the product of the white paper recommendation and inquiry into homelessness legislation in 2009 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community and Youth and a public consultation process in mid-2012.


I will turn specifically to the Homelessness Bill which, as I mentioned, is an aspirational document only. It is not a funding instrument and, contrary to the objective of the white paper, has no impact on the services and support provided to homeless people. The Homelessness Bill draws attention to the experience of homelessness and voices the goal that all Australians have access to appropriate affordable, safe and sustainable housing. The bill sets out a range of service delivery principles to which the Commonwealth is committed and the strategies seen as necessary to reduce homelessness. In response to stakeholder feedback, the bill widens the definition of homelessness so that people staying in crisis accommodation cannot be ruled out of the definition through any concept of choice. The definition also now includes a reference to safety as a vital element in a person's living circumstances.


Let me turn to the consequential amendments bill. The consequential amendments bill repeals the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Act was primarily a vehicle for providing funding to states and territories to administer the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, which provided crisis and transitional support and accommodation services to the homeless. New funding arrangements—the National Partnership on Homelessness and the National Affordable Housing Specific Purpose Payment—were introduced in 2009 under the Federal Financial Relations Framework, superseding the funding mechanism in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act. The new bills retain the statements of principle about homelessness contained in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act.


The consequential amendments bill also makes a change to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, replacing the definition of 'homeless person' which applies in the provisions about including itinerant electors on the electoral rolls and which currently partly relies on concepts drawn from the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act. The new definition of 'homeless person' will ensure that the itinerant elector provisions will continue to apply despite the repeal of the 1994 act so that people who are homeless can continue to participate in electoral activities in the Australian community.


Aside from making some definitional changes and removing references to the superseded funding mechanism in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act, the bill is little more than a broad statement of principle. The definitional changes are important, ensuring that people staying in crisis accommodation are not excluded from the definition of 'homeless' because they have chosen to leave their homes. Indeed, young people escaping violent home life or mothers and their children who have had to leave home for their own safety can hardly be said to have chosen the state of homelessness. But the bill is otherwise simply a statement of high-minded aspiration. For more than 105,000 homeless Australians, and the thousands of dedicated men and women who work tirelessly to support them, these bills will raise the hope and expectation that a Labor government might finally do something tangible to stem the tide of homelessness in Australia, but without actually doing anything. It is disappointing that these bills will make no difference to funding or service provision for homelessness. Homeless Australians do not need any more high-minded aspiration. They need support and they need funding. Labor is offering them neither through these bills. Like the coalition, homeless Australians and stakeholders in the sector will be deeply disappointed by the bills. The coalition will not oppose the bills, but we believe that they are a missed opportunity and will not make any difference to the plight of homeless Australians. Most disappointingly, the bills go no way to addressing Labor's multiple failures on homelessness.


I turn then to this government's record of failure on homelessness. The Rudd-Gillard government has mismanaged homelessness policy right from the start and has made it difficult for the states and territories on the front line to do their job and deliver services to some of our most vulnerable citizens. In 2008, the then Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, Mr Rudd, said that homelessness was a national obscenity and promised to halve the rate of homelessness in Australia by 2020. Sadly, Labor's record has not matched their rhetoric. In fact, under Labor's watch, homelessness has increased. Between 2006 and 2011, ABS census figures show a 17 per cent increase in the number of homeless people in Australia, or an increase of over 15,500 people, from 89,728 in 2006 to 105,237 in 2011. Under Labor, over 17 per cent of Australia's homeless are now under the age of 12, and homeless families represent almost one-third of those receiving support in 2011-12. In most cases, these are single adults with children.


Compounding this failure, on 2 May 2013 the Australian National Audit Office released a report which revealed major failings in the government's key homelessness funding deal with the states and the territories, the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. According to the audit report, the government is unlikely to achieve its own target of a seven per cent reduction in homelessness by 1 July 2013—weeks away. The government's likely failure to reach its seven per cent target has only been confirmed by a recent COAG Reform Council Report, Homelessness 2011-12: comparing performance across Australia, and by officials from the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs at Senate estimates hearings this month. The ANAO report uncovered multiple other problems with the program. Firstly, state and territory governments are not required to report financial information to the Commonwealth under the scheme or the program, meaning the Commonwealth has no way to know if jurisdictions are meeting their financial commitments under the agreement. Secondly, payments to the state and territories are not linked to outcomes, milestones or performance benchmarks. Thirdly, the absence of outcomes based reporting means the government is unable to make meaningful assessments of overall progress within each jurisdiction or nationally and receives very little information on whether the reforms are even working at all. Fourthly, problems with homelessness data used under the program mean the government cannot even measure changes in homelessness levels in Australia over the life of the agreement.


Once you move passed the overblown rhetoric, Labor's commitment to reducing homelessness is not founded on the facts. In 2013-14 federal budget, Labor has not committed any funding beyond next year to homelessness. Instead, this government has allocated $159 million in 2013-14 for a one-year so-called Transitional National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness with the states and territories. The torturous process of renegotiating the program resulted in continued instability for homelessness service providers and Labor's last-minute, one-year deal to extend funding beyond 1 July 2013 is a bandaid solution that does not provide certainty for those services or the thousands of homeless people who rely upon them. In addition, Labor has negotiated funding arrangements for homelessness so badly that it has made it all but impossible to know if the reforms are working at all. Under Labor, the future of homelessness funding in Australia will remain uncertain beyond mid-2014. This government has allocated nothing in the forward estimates to fund vital homelessness services across the country.


The coalition, as I said, will not oppose this bill, but we do not believe the wordy sentiments it expresses will make any difference to thousands of homeless Australians out in the streets in the towns, the cities and rural areas of Australia. The coalition is committed to supporting the homeless in more than words. We are committed to combatting the many and complex causes of homelessness, supporting homeless Australians with real, practical assistance and preventing even more Australians from falling into homelessness. Unfortunately we cannot wave a magic wand and make homelessness go away. Setting arbitrary targets and making big promises to solve the plight of our under-privileged is not the best approach, because we simply cannot comprehend the complex nature of the issues which they face. These can include domestic violence, substance abuse, mental illness and economic circumstances such as the sudden loss of a job. A coalition government, if elected, would streamline homelessness services and cut red tape for providers, along with providing a $1.5 billion package for mental health problems.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2013-06-24,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:13):  It is a real privilege to talk on these homelessness bills this afternoon, and I know, Deputy Speaker Saffin, from the work that we have done on the Status of Women caucus committee on this issue that it is an area of great interest to you, as it is to me. It is an area I have become particularly concerned about since my election in 2010 and I am proud of the progress that Labor is making in this area. In January 2008 Labor committed to tackling homelessness in Australia as a matter of national priority. This has been re-affirmed with our commitment to halve homelessness by 2020. 


The problem of homelessness is being addressed within Labor's broader Housing Affordability and Social Inclusion agendas and with a particular focus on the prevention of homelessness, improved crisis services and the creation of exit points to secure long-term housing and stop the cycle of homelessness. This bill we are debating today outlines Labor's genuine commitment to tackling homelessness. One of the key initiatives Labor has taken over the past six years has been the development of a white paper on homelessness, The Road Home: A National Approach to Reducing Homelessness. This paper, which was released in December 2008, seeks to provide a national plan of action on homelessness for the years leading up to 2020. One of the commitments made by Labor in the white paper is to implement new legislation to ensure that people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness receive quality services and adequate support to meet their needs. This is the legislation that we are discussing this afternoon. 


Evidence from the 2008 white paper says that, to break the cycle of homelessness, we need to have stable housing options and the maintenance of support services. I have witnessed the transformative qualities that housing can provide and the positive change it makes in people without supported accommodation. The bill we are debating today is about social acceptance. It is about providing an opportunity for people without an acceptable living standard to be considered and acknowledge so that everyone in this nation has a fair go. Furthermore, this bill explores the definition of homelessness, which is particularly important because, as we know, there is no one characterisation of homelessness in Australia. Homelessness in Australia might mean sleeping rough, living in a shelter, sleeping in a car or couch surfing at a friend's place. Homelessness in Australia might be temporary or long term, the result of economic difficulties such as a job loss, the result of mental illness or a means of escaping domestic violence. All of these things are homelessness in one form or another. This bill acknowledges that diversity, and it will enable better and more targeted strategies to create effective outcomes for Australia's homeless.


In Maslow's hierarchy of needs shelter and safety are the essential underpinnings of healthy and productive individuals and, through them, societies. The transformative qualities of a home were beautifully summarised by a constituent of mine whom I met last year when I was shopping at Fyshwick markets. She was behind the counter. She looked at me and said, 'Are you Gai Brodtmann?' I said, 'Yes, I am.' She said, 'I want to thank you.' I said, 'How did I assist?' She said, 'Your office was fantastic in helping me get a home and, as a result, I have been able to get a job and my whole life has turned around.' She was incredibly grateful not just for the fact that she had a home but also because, as a result of that home, she had got a job which she really loved. She had also got a new bloke in her life. I think she was a victim of domestic violence and some pretty unhappy circumstances at home. She had a happy child and her life had been transformed as a result of us helping her to get a social house.


Since being elected, I have had many, many women come to me looking for housing. I remember the first phone call I took when I had just got the keys to my electorate office. I was the only person in the office. There I was, newly sworn in as an MP, with the keys to the office but no-one around, and there was a woman on the phone whose circumstances were particularly tragic. She had been the victim of domestic violence. She had two teenage kids, one of them a boy, and there were some women's refuge issues as a result of that. She was working, and had been sleeping in her car. Her kids, who were going to school, had also been sleeping in the car. To top all of that tragedy off, she was also undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. That was the very first call I received in my electorate office as a new MP, and we did everything in our power to get that woman a home. She now has a home. We see her quite regularly because she works just around the corner. The cancer is in remission and the kids are going really well at school. So, as I said, this housing transforms people's lives.


Since Labor has been in government, we have made a significant investment in homelessness and housing. We have invested almost $5 billion in new funding for support services and programs to assist people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. We have put in place a $1.5 billion National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, and I understand that this agreement has delivered well over 180 new or expanded homelessness services across the country and supported around 240,000 people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Most importantly, we have invested $5.6 billion in social housing, the single largest investment in social housing in Australia's history. This massive investment is providing 31,000 affordable homes to vulnerable Australians, and hundreds are here in my electorate in Canberra.


As a result of this significant investment that we have made in social housing in Canberra, we have managed to move older Canberrans out of large family homes—they are empty-nesters now and they no longer need a huge family home—and into brand spanking new townhouses which are really close to all the services and infrastructure that they need to support them to shop, to see their friends and to have access to public transport. For many of these Canberrans it is the first time they have moved into a new home. I have been with them at the opening these beautiful new housing developments and seen the joy on their faces at these beautiful new townhouses that are so close to facilities. They are just overwhelmed and overjoyed. This is probably one of my favourite investments of the most significant investments that we have made since we have been in government.


Some states and territories have also used this funding to deliver housing projects specifically for women. Building social housing and, in particular, creating safe and reliable shelters and homes for women can only be done in partnerships with the states and territories. This is an area that I am particularly interested in. Now that we have managed to get these older Canberrans into these fabulous new townhouses as a result of the historic investment in social housing, I am keen for us to focus on looking after social housing for older women. The reason that I am is that I met with the Equality Rights Alliance last year and they showed me a report that they were putting together for their pre-budget submission. The report highlighted what they have dubbed a potential 'tsunami of homelessness' for older women in Australia. And here I want to quote from the ERA's submission:


Housing affordability is an issue that affects ageing women in greater numbers than ageing men. According to the 2011 Census there are 600,828 women in Australia who are single, over 45 years old, have less than median income and do not own their home. By comparison there are 373,794 men in the same situation.


The 2011 ABS Census also shows that among single people over 45 years old, women are much more likely to have less than median income: 62% of women compared to 38% of men. Even when older men are on a low income, they are more likely to be home owners: 38% of single men over 45 years old on less than median income do not own their home compared with 62% of women.


After their mid-60s, few women have incomes that are substantially above the Age Pension rate. Most people over 65 years do not live in care-based accommodation. In fact, 95% live at home. For a growing number of ageing women, this leaves the private rental market as their only option.


I have seen the faces of these women in my mobile offices, particularly when I do mobile offices during lunch breaks on weekdays. I have had women coming up to me and explaining to me that they are on an average income, they are still in the rental market, they are about 60 years of age, they only have a basic amount of super and they are absolutely petrified about what their future holds.


In March this year I talked about this ERA submission—as well as my concerns and my own experiences of women coming to my electorate office and my mobile office and meeting them out in the community—in an International Women's Day speech. I raised this issue, and I had women coming up to me afterwards in tears, saying, 'You have just described my situation. I am frightened for my future. What can I do about it?' I have had a number of women coming, again, in tears to the electorate office since that International Women's Day speech, highlighting these ERA figures and absolutely devastated and fearful for their futures.


According to Homelessness Australia, just over 40 per cent of the estimated homeless population are women. The census figures from 2006 reveal that women make up 40 per cent of the primary homeless people, or those people sleeping rough, and 48 per cent of the secondary homeless—that is, people staying with family or friends. These figures highlight the enormity of the problem and the challenge for us as policy makers to find solutions that enhance society and reduce the rate of homelessness within Australia and give people those fundamental building blocks to be able to succeed.


Having lived abroad, I appreciate the gift of living in a nation where the freedom to seek quality of life and the freedom to vote is valued. I think a particularly notable element of this bill is on the importance of preserving the freedom to vote. I welcome that initiative in this bill.


I am very passionately of the view that community is about helping underprivileged Australians stay off the streets. I was honoured to be the ambassador for Youth Homelessness Matters Day 2013.1am very concerned about the welfare and wellbeing of young people, women and anyone experiencing homelessness. This day was focused on young people, especially in my electorate. Forty-four thousand Australians under the age of 26 are homeless. The majority of them are just entering adulthood, a crucial time for anyone looking to build a career, gain stability and get on their own two feet.


I was reading through the St Vincent de Paul Society report on housing stress in Canberra and Goulburn, which was released late last year. It is a very stark assessment of the problem. There are some very moving stories of people's experiences here in the national capital. The St Vincent De Paul's report reveals cases of families of six or more living in two-bedroom units. There are cases of whole families living in cars, like the woman I described earlier. The sad fact is that a planned city like Canberra still has homelessness but unfortunately it goes unnoticed. We know that demand for access to government housing exceeds supply and the waiting times for priority and high needs housing is lengthy. On average, Canberrans are among the healthiest, best educated and most prosperous in Australia—but not those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless. What makes homelessness such a critical issue here in Canberra is our climate. Those who are not in stable housing or do not have access to affordable heating suffer seriously in winter. Being homeless anywhere in Australia is tough, but being homeless in a place that gets so cold in winter is particularly tough.


Reconnect Services is helping some of Canberra's most vulnerable young people to not only get their lives back on track but avoid or move out of homelessness. The ACT government is continuing to fund Reconnect ACT. I applaud them for doing that. Their activities include counselling, group work, mediation and practical support for young people and their families, 


In closing, I would like to commend the work that has been done by COAG on this issue. In March this year, the multimillion dollar agreement with the states and territories ensured the continued provision of vital homelessness services. The National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness enables service providers to have the certainty they need to continue to offer critical support to some of the most vulnerable Australians. I would like to thank Corporal Coomara Munro from the Australian Air Force who wrote this speech while interning in my office under the Defence program. This bill gives voice to the homeless. It puts us on track to providing long-term certainty and hope for underprivileged Australians. I commend it to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2013-06-24,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:28):  It is undeniable that homelessness is a growing problem in this country. On any given night, more than 105,000 Australians are homeless. That is one in every 200 people. According to the last census, 6,813 of these people were sleeping on the streets. Many thousands more were forced to couch surf, live in severely overcrowded housing or live in places like caravan parks or boarding houses that lack personal space and security. More than a quarter of our homeless population are children under the age of 18. On census night, almost 18,000 children under 12 were counted as homeless and 402 were sleeping rough.


The statistics belie some very horrific personal stories. Recently I was at a forum put on by the North Melbourne housing and homelessness action group where I met Spike, who had been living and sleeping rough through very long period of time and who is now spending his time advocating on the causes of homelessness. He explained that the health effects, just to take one aspect of it, are very significant. If you find yourself without a regular address, you find yourself less likely to come into regular contact with health services. If you do that, you are more likely to have problems such as dental problems. Spike explained that that in turn becomes a self-fulfilling circle: if you do not have teeth or you have bad teeth, you are less likely to get a job; if you are less likely to get a job, you are more likely to remain homeless. 


There are other services in my electorate such as HomeGround. When I visited HomeGround, I came to understand the pressures that they were under. I met someone there who had been made redundant, who had been living on Newstart and who had then been homeless for a while. They found a home as a result of the work of HomeGround. That home, in the electorate of Melbourne, was one room in a rooming house in the suburb of Fitzroy and near to where this person had connections, and it set him back $180. When your Newstart payment is in the order of $240 and you are in a rooming house which you are sharing with others, you do not have the capacity to buy up in advance the right food and then cook it, because you are sharing fridges and sharing space with other people. So you end up eating bad food on the $60 a week that you have got left, or you skip it and eat nothing at all. 


The need for affordable and appropriate accommodation is incredibly clear—and it has been clear for many years. Back in 2008, we had a very worthy pledge to halve homelessness. We had a white paper on homelessness. We were promised, amongst other things, a legislative response, for which we have been waiting some years. In that time, the pressure, certainly on services for people who deal with homelessness, has been increasing massively. We are at the point now where, on an average day in this country, 59 per cent of the people who are seeking to be newly accommodated by these services are turned away; the figure for couples with children is 74 per cent. The overwhelming reason for this situation is the lack of appropriate accommodation. 


Let us think about that: on any given day, three quarters of the couples with children who find themselves homeless or who are at risk of homelessness and who front up to a service and ask for accommodation are turned away. In my office, we deal with a number of the consequences of that every day. In the electorate of Melbourne, there is more public housing than in any other electorate in the country, and the public housing waiting lists are huge. Even in public housing, there are people who are couch-surfing, who have been homeless for seven or eight years and who still have not been provided with appropriate accommodation. Not a day goes by when one of my staff members or I do not approach a housing service or a state government minister to seek appropriate accommodation for someone. 


In the face of all those statistics and compelling stories, we have 250,000 Australian households on social housing waiting lists around the country, which is around half a million people. We have only 4,500 homeless people given priority access to public housing. There was a great deal of hope that finally the legislation, which was an overdue response to the white paper, might take us forward. Instead, we have a bill that expresses what are worthy sentiments but that is essentially a press release with a parliament of Australia bill cover on the front of it. The worthy sentiments do not bring with them one extra dollar for homeless services. This bill does not bring with it one new house or flat for someone who is seeking support. It will not relieve the pressure one jot on those who are homeless, who are at risk of homelessness or who are looking after those people who are at risk of homelessness. As one reads through the bill, yes, you find yourself nodding your head and agreeing with the very important and worthy sentiments in it. You keep waiting for the punchline where the bill will say that it is going to do something, and you turn to the last page and find that the bill says that not only is it not going to do something but something even more than that. It says in section 14:


(1) This Act does not, by its terms or operation, create or give rise to 4 any rights (whether substantive or procedural), or obligations, thatare legally enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.


It is a bill that is not legally binding. Why? What is the point of that if it is not backed up with a comprehensive response to the massive and growing problem of homelessness and housing affordability in this country? If you wanted a definition of Clayton's legislation, it is this—it is the bill you have when you are not having a bill—because it confers absolutely no legal rights or protections for this country's most vulnerable people and the ones who are most at risk. 


Perhaps the reason we are seeing this bill brought on now at five minutes to midnight in this parliament is that last week was Homelessness Week and the Greens responded to that not with a bill that does nothing, but with a plan of action. The Greens have been concerned about homelessness and housing affordability for some time, and so last week we announced a homelessness action plan that would provide an emergency package to build 7,000 new homes by 2020—enough to house every person currently sleeping without adequate shelter. It is something that the government promised to do many years ago. We would include a 50 per cent target of fast-build, modular or pre-fabricated housing which will be significantly faster and more affordable to build. There are some great Australian factories that would be able to manufacture that modular and pre-fabricated housing. We would double the current funding for specialist homelessness services in Australia. In an environment where we know that, as I said before, 59 per cent of people are turned away on an average day when they turn up for help and three quarters of couples with children, we need that doubling in homelessness services. 


We have had it costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office and it is eminently affordable, especially if we were to have the courage to raise the money this country needs to fund the services Australians expect. That would involve having a proper mining tax, and we hear today that Australia's banks are the most profitable in the world—and under Labor they have become the most profitable in the world—and the return to the community is nowhere near what it is in other countries. In other countries in Europe and the United States, they are saying, 'Well, look, we as governments stand behind you big banks and allow you to make these massive profits, we want a fair return.' A similar levy here in Australia would bring in $11 billion over four years. If we had the courage to stand up to the big miners or to the big banks or if we had the courage to just raise revenue in this country to the same proportion of GDP as it was under former Prime Minister John Howard, we would have an extra $20 billion to spend. That would mean that instead of having legislation that creates no legal rights or obligations and does not have one dollar attached to it, we could instead afford to fund initiatives like the Greens' proposal to solve Australia's homelessness by 2020. It would actually put some meat on the bones and put some money into building some housing and providing support for homelessness services. 


If we are serious about addressing homelessness, I will tell you about two other things that would help. One is to raise NewStart above the poverty line. It has now been almost five years under this government where there has been a strong campaign from the sector and from people who say that we need to life NewStart above the poverty line, because it is far too low. We have had nothing but small increases that amount to only a couple of dollars a day. We need a minimum increase of $50 a week in NewStart—again it is something that is fully affordable if we had the courage to raise the revenue we need to fund the services Australians expect to create a more caring society. The second thing that I would do to address homelessness I would not kick single parents off their payments and put them on NewStart, because one of the most distressing things we have learnt is that since the start of this year is that housing services and welfare agencies are reporting a spike in the number of single parents with children who are seeking their services. 


We told the parliament at the time the bill was going through—and people did not listen but it has been borne out to be the fact—that the people who were hit hardest by the government's decision to save a bit of money to help get back to surplus, a goal which they have now abandoned, were the ones who were already working. Kicking single parents off their welfare payments and onto the dole was apparently meant to help get them back into work but we learnt that the ones who were hit hardest were the ones who were already working the most because under the single parent payment you could earn and keep more of your income than you can under Newstart. Not only was it a drop in the actual payment but it was a drop in how much you could remain in the workforce. This was in face of the fact that single parents were already the group that had the highest proportion of people in work.


If you have met and spoken to single parents, you understand why. It is because they are predominantly women, many of whom have had experience of family violence and what they are trying to do is to provide the best life for their kids and for themselves as they possibly can. They are the group of people amongst all other welfare recipients who want to work and who are trying the hardest to juggle. They do not have spare cash to afford child care. They cannot necessarily have someone else at the end of a phone or in their house who can look after the kids and so they are juggling these things. Yet the decision that was made by the government has meant $140 a week in lost income for some of them. That is a lot of money when you are the only income earner in your family. As a result, more and more of them are presenting to services saying, 'We are now at risk of losing our house and we need the support of charity.' 


If you were serious about addressing that, you would not be putting more people into a situation where they are at risk of homelessness by attacking those who are already doing it hardest. Let us get single parents back on the benefits and allow them to earn more and keep more of it as they used to be able to. Let us lift Newstart and the poverty line and let us have a debate in this country about how much we are prepared to raise the money to then fund these kinds of services because it is not that expensive—$233 million per annum to build prefabricated homes to house every rough sleeper by 2020. That is $500 million for the specialist homelessness services and signing a new national partnership on homelessness is $275 million. These are all eminently affordable and all costed. Let us do more than pass legislation that is not even legally binding. Let us make a real difference to Australia's homeless.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (16:43):  I rise to speak on the Homelessness Bill 2013 and Homelessness (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. The bills are aimed at increasing recognition and awareness of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. These bills are a missed opportunity because they are simply aspirational bills without any concurrent funding or reforms to improve homelessness in Australia. In their current form these bills will not make any difference to the plight of homeless Australians. As the member for Melbourne said, they are bills you have when you are not really having bills. 


The coalition will not oppose the bills, but I am concerned that through this legislation the Labor government has produced yet another statement of principles without any ongoing tangible commitment to preventing or reducing homelessness on the ground. These two bills make minor amendments which are primarily administrative in nature. As the explanatory memorandum states, the bill draws national attention to the experience of homelessness and voices the aspiration that all Australians have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing. It sets out a range of service delivery principles to which the Commonwealth is committed and the strategies seen as necessary to reduce homelessness. 


The Homelessness (Consequential Amendments) Bill repeals the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994, makes some definitional changes and removes references to the superseded homelessness funding mechanism referred to in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994. This program was primarily a vehicle for providing funding to states and territories to administer the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, which gave crisis and transitional support and accommodation services to the homeless. New funding arrangements were introduced in 2009, namely the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness and the national affordable housing specific purpose payment. It also replaces a definition of 'homeless person', which applies in the provisions regarding the inclusion of itinerant electors on the electoral roll, to ensure that people who are homeless can still effectively participate in electoral activities.


The bills stem from a recommendation in Labor's white paper on homelessness to enact new legislation to ensure that people who are homeless receive quality services and adequate support. Their introduction follows a very lengthy journey through this parliament, including the white paper; an inquiry into homelessness legislation in 2009 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family Community, Housing and Youth; and a public consultation process in mid-2012. These bills respond to some of the concerns raised throughout the committee and public consultation process.


The definition of 'homelessness' has been widened so that people staying in crisis accommodation cannot be ruled out of the definition through any concept of choice. The definition also now includes a reference to safety as a vital element in a person's living circumstances. Stakeholders believe that these definitional changes are important, ensuring as they do that people staying in crisis accommodation are not excluded from the definition of 'homeless' because they have chosen to leave their homes. Young people escaping a violent home life and mothers and their children who have had to leave home for their own safety can hardly be said to have chosen a life of homelessness. Otherwise, the bills are simply a statement of high-level aspiration for the more than 105,000 homeless Australians and the thousands of dedicated men and women who work tirelessly to support them. These bills will raise the hope and expectation that this Labor government might finally do something tangible to stem the tide of homelessness in Australia.


As we approach the final days of the 43rd Parliament, it is clear that this government wants to pass these bills to seem to be doing something without making any difference to funding or service provision for homelessness. Homeless Australians do not need more esoteric aspiration. They need support and they need funding. Labor is offering neither through these bills. If we look at the track record of the Rudd-Gillard governments, it is clear that they have mismanaged their homelessness policy. In 2008, Kevin Rudd said that homelessness was a 'national obscenity' and promised to halve the rate of homelessness in Australia by 2020. In fact, under Labor's watch, homelessness has only increased. 


Between 2006 and 2011, ABS census figures show a 17 per cent increase in the number of homeless people in Australia, or an increase of over 15,500 people, from 89,728 in 2006 to 105,237 in 2011. Under Labor, more than 17 per cent of Australia's homeless are now under the age of 12, and homeless families represent almost one-third of those receiving support in 2011-12. In most cases, these are single adults with children.


On 2 May 2013, the Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, released a report which revealed major failings in the government's key homelessness funding deal with the states and territories, the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, or NPAH. According to the report, the government is unlikely to achieve its own target of a seven per cent reduction in homelessness by 1 July 2013. The government's likely failure to reach its seven per cent target has also been confirmed by a recent COAG Reform Council report, Homelessness 2011–2012: comparing performance across Australia, and by officials from the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs at Senate estimates hearings this month.


The Labor government has simply increased reporting compliance without knowing whether federal funding has resulted in a commensurate increase in the ability of states and territories to deliver front-line services to some of our most vulnerable citizens. This was revealed by the ANAO, which detailed multiple problems with the NPAH. Firstly, state and territory governments are not required to report financial information to the Commonwealth under the NPAH, meaning the Commonwealth has no way to know if jurisdictions are meeting their financial commitments under the agreement. Secondly, payments to the states and territories are not linked to outcomes, milestones or performance benchmarks. Thirdly, the absence of outcomes based reporting means the government is unable to make meaningful assessments of overall progress within each jurisdiction, or nationally, and receives very little information on whether the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness reforms are even working at all. Lastly, problems with homelessness data used under the NPAH mean the government cannot even measure changes in homelessness levels in Australia over the life of the agreement.


Once you move past the overblown rhetoric, Labor's lack of commitment to reducing homelessness in real terms is revealed by the facts. In the 2013-14 federal budget, Labor has not committed any funding beyond next year to homelessness. Instead, this government has allocated $159 million in 2013-14 for a one-year so-called Transitional National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness with the states and territories. The process of re-negotiating the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness resulted in continued instability for homelessness service providers and Labor's last-minute one-year deal to extend funding beyond 1 July 2013 is a short-term band-aid solution that does not provide certainty for these services and the thousands of homeless people who rely on them. Under Labor, the future of homelessness funding in Australia will remain uncertain. Beyond 2014, this government has allocated nothing in the forward estimates to fund vital homelessness services across the country. Even if this Labor government had provided meaningful funds for homelessness, the way they negotiated the funding arrangements for homelessness means it is all but impossible to know whether the NPAH reforms are working at all.


The coalition will not oppose this legislation but we do not believe the worthy sentiments it expresses will make any difference to homeless Australians on the ground. The coalition is committed to supporting the homeless with more than fine words. We are committed to combating the many and complex causes of homelessness, supporting homeless Australians with real practical assistance and preventing even more Australians from falling into homelessness. Unfortunately, we cannot wave a magic wand and house all the homeless. Setting arbitrary targets and making promises to solve the plight of our underprivileged is not the best approach, because we simply cannot comprehend the complex nature of the issues they face. These can include domestic violence, substance abuse, mental illness and adverse economic circumstances such as sudden job loss.


A coalition government, if elected, would streamline homelessness services and cut red tape for providers, along with a $1.5 billion package for mental health. Providing real support for mental health services will be an important preventive step to support at-risk Australians. The coalition will not oppose the bills. However, setting out aspirational goals in the last days of this parliament is simply too little, too late for a government which has not been serious about making any difference to the plight of homeless Australians.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide—Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (16:52):  This package of bills is aimed at increasing recognition and awareness of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. This government has made homelessness a national priority. Our white paper The road home outlines how we intend to reduce homelessness through a program that will require sustained effort by governments, business and the broader community. We have set clear targets to halve the rate of homelessness by 2020 and to provide supported accommodation for all rough sleepers who need it. We are progressing these targets through a significant boost in spending, new agreements with the states and territories and an overhaul of the existing legislative framework. Already we have seen progress, including through early intervention to prevent homelessness.


The homelessness legislative framework was the subject of a comprehensive inquiry during 2009 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth. The committee's report Housing the homelesshas been vital in shaping this legislation being debated today. With the exception of the legislative right to housing, which is outside current government policy—and, in practice, would be significantly dependent on the actions of states and territory governments, which are responsible for housing—the committee's recommendations have been incorporated into the Homelessness Bill 2013 to the best extent possible. The bill complements a broader reform process to reduce homelessness, incorporating substantial co-investment with states and territories to expand and implement a range of practical measures to support and improve outcomes for Australians facing homelessness. The bill underpins the need to sustain this effort into the future.


The Homelessness Bill 2013 draws national attention to the experience of homelessness and voices the aspiration that all Australians have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing. This ensures consistency with the objective of the National Affordable Housing Agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and territories and local government. This ensures consistency with the objective of the National Affordable Housing Agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories and local government. The bill acknowledges the direct relationship between addressing homelessness and social inclusion. It sets out a range of service delivery principles to which the Commonwealth is committed and the strategies we see as necessary to reduce homelessness. The bill also confirms the Commonwealth's commitment to cooperation and consultation in reducing homelessness and promotes the human rights of people facing homelessness. This legislation has been strengthened through a two-month public exposure period in mid-2012. We express our gratitude to those many people who lodged written submissions on the exposure draft of the bill. 


The new legislation will replace the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act of 1994 which set out important principles and guided the Commonwealth's response to homelessness in Australia for many years. The 1994 act was primarily a vehicle for providing funding to states and territories to implement the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. However, new arrangements were introduced in 2009 under the Federal Financial Relations Framework, superseding the funding mechanism under the 1994 act. This current funding framework for Commonwealth, state and territory efforts to reduce homelessness with funding provided through Commonwealth-state mechanisms such as the National Partnership on Homelessness and the National Affordable Housing specific purpose payment will continue. 


The Homelessness Bill 2013 is therefore complementary to the comprehensive funding arrangements already in place and is not a funding instrument in itself. Accordingly, the Homelessness (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013 repeals the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994 to make way for the new legislation. It also makes a consequential amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918 to make sure existing provisions that encourage civic participation and voting by people experiencing homelessness will continue to apply. The Homelessness Bill 2013 is just one part of a bigger policy program of support to people who are homeless or at risk of it. The issue of service quality is also being pursued by working with states and territories to develop a non-legislative Homelessness National Quality Framework. The framework will be the primary strategy for the white paper's goal of ensuring quality services. 


The welfare and safety of our fellow Australians matter a great deal. There can be no more worthy cause than doing all that we can to help reduce homelessness. This new legislation is a clear statement of our commitment and our values in this vital policy agenda and underlines and complements the substantial practical measures already in place. 


Question agreed to.

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (16:00):  I rise to speak on the Homelessness Bill 2013 and the Homelessness (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. The bill's explanatory memorandum states that this bill is aimed at increasing recognition and awareness of people who are homeless or who are at risk of homelessness. The consequential amendments bill repeals the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994 to make way for the new legislation and replaces the definition of 'homeless person' which applies in the provisions about including itinerant electors in the electoral rolls to ensure that people who are homelessness can still effectively participate in electoral activities. The bills make some definitional changes and remove references to the superseded Homelessness Funding Mechanism referred to in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994. The bills are otherwise little more than broad statements of principle and aspiration. This is something we are used to seeing from this Labor government—all politics, no policy. These bills do not impact on funding for service provision for homelessness.


The coalition will not oppose the bills, but is concerned that, through this legislation, the Labor government has produced yet another statement of aspiration without any ongoing tangible commitment to reducing homelessness on the ground. Indeed, the bills are a missed opportunity and will not make any difference to the plight of homeless Australians. These bills stem from a recommendation in Labor's white paper on homelessness to enact new legislation to ensure that people who are homeless receive quality support services and adequate support. The introduced bills are the product of the white paper recommendation and inquiry into homelessness legislation in 2009 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community and Youth and a public consultation process in mid-2012.


I will turn specifically to the Homelessness Bill which, as I mentioned, is an aspirational document only. It is not a funding instrument and, contrary to the objective of the white paper, has no impact on the services and support provided to homeless people. The Homelessness Bill draws attention to the experience of homelessness and voices the goal that all Australians have access to appropriate affordable, safe and sustainable housing. The bill sets out a range of service delivery principles to which the Commonwealth is committed and the strategies seen as necessary to reduce homelessness. In response to stakeholder feedback, the bill widens the definition of homelessness so that people staying in crisis accommodation cannot be ruled out of the definition through any concept of choice. The definition also now includes a reference to safety as a vital element in a person's living circumstances.


Let me turn to the consequential amendments bill. The consequential amendments bill repeals the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Act was primarily a vehicle for providing funding to states and territories to administer the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, which provided crisis and transitional support and accommodation services to the homeless. New funding arrangements—the National Partnership on Homelessness and the National Affordable Housing Specific Purpose Payment—were introduced in 2009 under the Federal Financial Relations Framework, superseding the funding mechanism in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act. The new bills retain the statements of principle about homelessness contained in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act.


The consequential amendments bill also makes a change to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, replacing the definition of 'homeless person' which applies in the provisions about including itinerant electors on the electoral rolls and which currently partly relies on concepts drawn from the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act. The new definition of 'homeless person' will ensure that the itinerant elector provisions will continue to apply despite the repeal of the 1994 act so that people who are homeless can continue to participate in electoral activities in the Australian community.


Aside from making some definitional changes and removing references to the superseded funding mechanism in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act, the bill is little more than a broad statement of principle. The definitional changes are important, ensuring that people staying in crisis accommodation are not excluded from the definition of 'homeless' because they have chosen to leave their homes. Indeed, young people escaping violent home life or mothers and their children who have had to leave home for their own safety can hardly be said to have chosen the state of homelessness. But the bill is otherwise simply a statement of high-minded aspiration. For more than 105,000 homeless Australians, and the thousands of dedicated men and women who work tirelessly to support them, these bills will raise the hope and expectation that a Labor government might finally do something tangible to stem the tide of homelessness in Australia, but without actually doing anything. It is disappointing that these bills will make no difference to funding or service provision for homelessness. Homeless Australians do not need any more high-minded aspiration. They need support and they need funding. Labor is offering them neither through these bills. Like the coalition, homeless Australians and stakeholders in the sector will be deeply disappointed by the bills. The coalition will not oppose the bills, but we believe that they are a missed opportunity and will not make any difference to the plight of homeless Australians. Most disappointingly, the bills go no way to addressing Labor's multiple failures on homelessness.


I turn then to this government's record of failure on homelessness. The Rudd-Gillard government has mismanaged homelessness policy right from the start and has made it difficult for the states and territories on the front line to do their job and deliver services to some of our most vulnerable citizens. In 2008, the then Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, Mr Rudd, said that homelessness was a national obscenity and promised to halve the rate of homelessness in Australia by 2020. Sadly, Labor's record has not matched their rhetoric. In fact, under Labor's watch, homelessness has increased. Between 2006 and 2011, ABS census figures show a 17 per cent increase in the number of homeless people in Australia, or an increase of over 15,500 people, from 89,728 in 2006 to 105,237 in 2011. Under Labor, over 17 per cent of Australia's homeless are now under the age of 12, and homeless families represent almost one-third of those receiving support in 2011-12. In most cases, these are single adults with children.


Compounding this failure, on 2 May 2013 the Australian National Audit Office released a report which revealed major failings in the government's key homelessness funding deal with the states and the territories, the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness. According to the audit report, the government is unlikely to achieve its own target of a seven per cent reduction in homelessness by 1 July 2013—weeks away. The government's likely failure to reach its seven per cent target has only been confirmed by a recent COAG Reform Council Report, Homelessness 2011-12: comparing performance across Australia, and by officials from the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs at Senate estimates hearings this month. The ANAO report uncovered multiple other problems with the program. Firstly, state and territory governments are not required to report financial information to the Commonwealth under the scheme or the program, meaning the Commonwealth has no way to know if jurisdictions are meeting their financial commitments under the agreement. Secondly, payments to the state and territories are not linked to outcomes, milestones or performance benchmarks. Thirdly, the absence of outcomes based reporting means the government is unable to make meaningful assessments of overall progress within each jurisdiction or nationally and receives very little information on whether the reforms are even working at all. Fourthly, problems with homelessness data used under the program mean the government cannot even measure changes in homelessness levels in Australia over the life of the agreement.


Once you move passed the overblown rhetoric, Labor's commitment to reducing homelessness is not founded on the facts. In 2013-14 federal budget, Labor has not committed any funding beyond next year to homelessness. Instead, this government has allocated $159 million in 2013-14 for a one-year so-called Transitional National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness with the states and territories. The torturous process of renegotiating the program resulted in continued instability for homelessness service providers and Labor's last-minute, one-year deal to extend funding beyond 1 July 2013 is a bandaid solution that does not provide certainty for those services or the thousands of homeless people who rely upon them. In addition, Labor has negotiated funding arrangements for homelessness so badly that it has made it all but impossible to know if the reforms are working at all. Under Labor, the future of homelessness funding in Australia will remain uncertain beyond mid-2014. This government has allocated nothing in the forward estimates to fund vital homelessness services across the country.


The coalition, as I said, will not oppose this bill, but we do not believe the wordy sentiments it expresses will make any difference to thousands of homeless Australians out in the streets in the towns, the cities and rural areas of Australia. The coalition is committed to supporting the homeless in more than words. We are committed to combatting the many and complex causes of homelessness, supporting homeless Australians with real, practical assistance and preventing even more Australians from falling into homelessness. Unfortunately we cannot wave a magic wand and make homelessness go away. Setting arbitrary targets and making big promises to solve the plight of our under-privileged is not the best approach, because we simply cannot comprehend the complex nature of the issues which they face. These can include domestic violence, substance abuse, mental illness and economic circumstances such as the sudden loss of a job. A coalition government, if elected, would streamline homelessness services and cut red tape for providers, along with providing a $1.5 billion package for mental health problems.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2013-06-24,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:13):  It is a real privilege to talk on these homelessness bills this afternoon, and I know, Deputy Speaker Saffin, from the work that we have done on the Status of Women caucus committee on this issue that it is an area of great interest to you, as it is to me. It is an area I have become particularly concerned about since my election in 2010 and I am proud of the progress that Labor is making in this area. In January 2008 Labor committed to tackling homelessness in Australia as a matter of national priority. This has been re-affirmed with our commitment to halve homelessness by 2020. 


The problem of homelessness is being addressed within Labor's broader Housing Affordability and Social Inclusion agendas and with a particular focus on the prevention of homelessness, improved crisis services and the creation of exit points to secure long-term housing and stop the cycle of homelessness. This bill we are debating today outlines Labor's genuine commitment to tackling homelessness. One of the key initiatives Labor has taken over the past six years has been the development of a white paper on homelessness, The Road Home: A National Approach to Reducing Homelessness. This paper, which was released in December 2008, seeks to provide a national plan of action on homelessness for the years leading up to 2020. One of the commitments made by Labor in the white paper is to implement new legislation to ensure that people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness receive quality services and adequate support to meet their needs. This is the legislation that we are discussing this afternoon. 


Evidence from the 2008 white paper says that, to break the cycle of homelessness, we need to have stable housing options and the maintenance of support services. I have witnessed the transformative qualities that housing can provide and the positive change it makes in people without supported accommodation. The bill we are debating today is about social acceptance. It is about providing an opportunity for people without an acceptable living standard to be considered and acknowledge so that everyone in this nation has a fair go. Furthermore, this bill explores the definition of homelessness, which is particularly important because, as we know, there is no one characterisation of homelessness in Australia. Homelessness in Australia might mean sleeping rough, living in a shelter, sleeping in a car or couch surfing at a friend's place. Homelessness in Australia might be temporary or long term, the result of economic difficulties such as a job loss, the result of mental illness or a means of escaping domestic violence. All of these things are homelessness in one form or another. This bill acknowledges that diversity, and it will enable better and more targeted strategies to create effective outcomes for Australia's homeless.


In Maslow's hierarchy of needs shelter and safety are the essential underpinnings of healthy and productive individuals and, through them, societies. The transformative qualities of a home were beautifully summarised by a constituent of mine whom I met last year when I was shopping at Fyshwick markets. She was behind the counter. She looked at me and said, 'Are you Gai Brodtmann?' I said, 'Yes, I am.' She said, 'I want to thank you.' I said, 'How did I assist?' She said, 'Your office was fantastic in helping me get a home and, as a result, I have been able to get a job and my whole life has turned around.' She was incredibly grateful not just for the fact that she had a home but also because, as a result of that home, she had got a job which she really loved. She had also got a new bloke in her life. I think she was a victim of domestic violence and some pretty unhappy circumstances at home. She had a happy child and her life had been transformed as a result of us helping her to get a social house.


Since being elected, I have had many, many women come to me looking for housing. I remember the first phone call I took when I had just got the keys to my electorate office. I was the only person in the office. There I was, newly sworn in as an MP, with the keys to the office but no-one around, and there was a woman on the phone whose circumstances were particularly tragic. She had been the victim of domestic violence. She had two teenage kids, one of them a boy, and there were some women's refuge issues as a result of that. She was working, and had been sleeping in her car. Her kids, who were going to school, had also been sleeping in the car. To top all of that tragedy off, she was also undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. That was the very first call I received in my electorate office as a new MP, and we did everything in our power to get that woman a home. She now has a home. We see her quite regularly because she works just around the corner. The cancer is in remission and the kids are going really well at school. So, as I said, this housing transforms people's lives.


Since Labor has been in government, we have made a significant investment in homelessness and housing. We have invested almost $5 billion in new funding for support services and programs to assist people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. We have put in place a $1.5 billion National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, and I understand that this agreement has delivered well over 180 new or expanded homelessness services across the country and supported around 240,000 people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Most importantly, we have invested $5.6 billion in social housing, the single largest investment in social housing in Australia's history. This massive investment is providing 31,000 affordable homes to vulnerable Australians, and hundreds are here in my electorate in Canberra.


As a result of this significant investment that we have made in social housing in Canberra, we have managed to move older Canberrans out of large family homes—they are empty-nesters now and they no longer need a huge family home—and into brand spanking new townhouses which are really close to all the services and infrastructure that they need to support them to shop, to see their friends and to have access to public transport. For many of these Canberrans it is the first time they have moved into a new home. I have been with them at the opening these beautiful new housing developments and seen the joy on their faces at these beautiful new townhouses that are so close to facilities. They are just overwhelmed and overjoyed. This is probably one of my favourite investments of the most significant investments that we have made since we have been in government.


Some states and territories have also used this funding to deliver housing projects specifically for women. Building social housing and, in particular, creating safe and reliable shelters and homes for women can only be done in partnerships with the states and territories. This is an area that I am particularly interested in. Now that we have managed to get these older Canberrans into these fabulous new townhouses as a result of the historic investment in social housing, I am keen for us to focus on looking after social housing for older women. The reason that I am is that I met with the Equality Rights Alliance last year and they showed me a report that they were putting together for their pre-budget submission. The report highlighted what they have dubbed a potential 'tsunami of homelessness' for older women in Australia. And here I want to quote from the ERA's submission:


Housing affordability is an issue that affects ageing women in greater numbers than ageing men. According to the 2011 Census there are 600,828 women in Australia who are single, over 45 years old, have less than median income and do not own their home. By comparison there are 373,794 men in the same situation.


The 2011 ABS Census also shows that among single people over 45 years old, women are much more likely to have less than median income: 62% of women compared to 38% of men. Even when older men are on a low income, they are more likely to be home owners: 38% of single men over 45 years old on less than median income do not own their home compared with 62% of women.


After their mid-60s, few women have incomes that are substantially above the Age Pension rate. Most people over 65 years do not live in care-based accommodation. In fact, 95% live at home. For a growing number of ageing women, this leaves the private rental market as their only option.


I have seen the faces of these women in my mobile offices, particularly when I do mobile offices during lunch breaks on weekdays. I have had women coming up to me and explaining to me that they are on an average income, they are still in the rental market, they are about 60 years of age, they only have a basic amount of super and they are absolutely petrified about what their future holds.


In March this year I talked about this ERA submission—as well as my concerns and my own experiences of women coming to my electorate office and my mobile office and meeting them out in the community—in an International Women's Day speech. I raised this issue, and I had women coming up to me afterwards in tears, saying, 'You have just described my situation. I am frightened for my future. What can I do about it?' I have had a number of women coming, again, in tears to the electorate office since that International Women's Day speech, highlighting these ERA figures and absolutely devastated and fearful for their futures.


According to Homelessness Australia, just over 40 per cent of the estimated homeless population are women. The census figures from 2006 reveal that women make up 40 per cent of the primary homeless people, or those people sleeping rough, and 48 per cent of the secondary homeless—that is, people staying with family or friends. These figures highlight the enormity of the problem and the challenge for us as policy makers to find solutions that enhance society and reduce the rate of homelessness within Australia and give people those fundamental building blocks to be able to succeed.


Having lived abroad, I appreciate the gift of living in a nation where the freedom to seek quality of life and the freedom to vote is valued. I think a particularly notable element of this bill is on the importance of preserving the freedom to vote. I welcome that initiative in this bill.


I am very passionately of the view that community is about helping underprivileged Australians stay off the streets. I was honoured to be the ambassador for Youth Homelessness Matters Day 2013.1am very concerned about the welfare and wellbeing of young people, women and anyone experiencing homelessness. This day was focused on young people, especially in my electorate. Forty-four thousand Australians under the age of 26 are homeless. The majority of them are just entering adulthood, a crucial time for anyone looking to build a career, gain stability and get on their own two feet.


I was reading through the St Vincent de Paul Society report on housing stress in Canberra and Goulburn, which was released late last year. It is a very stark assessment of the problem. There are some very moving stories of people's experiences here in the national capital. The St Vincent De Paul's report reveals cases of families of six or more living in two-bedroom units. There are cases of whole families living in cars, like the woman I described earlier. The sad fact is that a planned city like Canberra still has homelessness but unfortunately it goes unnoticed. We know that demand for access to government housing exceeds supply and the waiting times for priority and high needs housing is lengthy. On average, Canberrans are among the healthiest, best educated and most prosperous in Australia—but not those who are experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless. What makes homelessness such a critical issue here in Canberra is our climate. Those who are not in stable housing or do not have access to affordable heating suffer seriously in winter. Being homeless anywhere in Australia is tough, but being homeless in a place that gets so cold in winter is particularly tough.


Reconnect Services is helping some of Canberra's most vulnerable young people to not only get their lives back on track but avoid or move out of homelessness. The ACT government is continuing to fund Reconnect ACT. I applaud them for doing that. Their activities include counselling, group work, mediation and practical support for young people and their families, 


In closing, I would like to commend the work that has been done by COAG on this issue. In March this year, the multimillion dollar agreement with the states and territories ensured the continued provision of vital homelessness services. The National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness enables service providers to have the certainty they need to continue to offer critical support to some of the most vulnerable Australians. I would like to thank Corporal Coomara Munro from the Australian Air Force who wrote this speech while interning in my office under the Defence program. This bill gives voice to the homeless. It puts us on track to providing long-term certainty and hope for underprivileged Australians. I commend it to the House.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:28):  It is undeniable that homelessness is a growing problem in this country. On any given night, more than 105,000 Australians are homeless. That is one in every 200 people. According to the last census, 6,813 of these people were sleeping on the streets. Many thousands more were forced to couch surf, live in severely overcrowded housing or live in places like caravan parks or boarding houses that lack personal space and security. More than a quarter of our homeless population are children under the age of 18. On census night, almost 18,000 children under 12 were counted as homeless and 402 were sleeping rough.


The statistics belie some very horrific personal stories. Recently I was at a forum put on by the North Melbourne housing and homelessness action group where I met Spike, who had been living and sleeping rough through very long period of time and who is now spending his time advocating on the causes of homelessness. He explained that the health effects, just to take one aspect of it, are very significant. If you find yourself without a regular address, you find yourself less likely to come into regular contact with health services. If you do that, you are more likely to have problems such as dental problems. Spike explained that that in turn becomes a self-fulfilling circle: if you do not have teeth or you have bad teeth, you are less likely to get a job; if you are less likely to get a job, you are more likely to remain homeless. 


There are other services in my electorate such as HomeGround. When I visited HomeGround, I came to understand the pressures that they were under. I met someone there who had been made redundant, who had been living on Newstart and who had then been homeless for a while. They found a home as a result of the work of HomeGround. That home, in the electorate of Melbourne, was one room in a rooming house in the suburb of Fitzroy and near to where this person had connections, and it set him back $180. When your Newstart payment is in the order of $240 and you are in a rooming house which you are sharing with others, you do not have the capacity to buy up in advance the right food and then cook it, because you are sharing fridges and sharing space with other people. So you end up eating bad food on the $60 a week that you have got left, or you skip it and eat nothing at all. 


The need for affordable and appropriate accommodation is incredibly clear—and it has been clear for many years. Back in 2008, we had a very worthy pledge to halve homelessness. We had a white paper on homelessness. We were promised, amongst other things, a legislative response, for which we have been waiting some years. In that time, the pressure, certainly on services for people who deal with homelessness, has been increasing massively. We are at the point now where, on an average day in this country, 59 per cent of the people who are seeking to be newly accommodated by these services are turned away; the figure for couples with children is 74 per cent. The overwhelming reason for this situation is the lack of appropriate accommodation. 


Let us think about that: on any given day, three quarters of the couples with children who find themselves homeless or who are at risk of homelessness and who front up to a service and ask for accommodation are turned away. In my office, we deal with a number of the consequences of that every day. In the electorate of Melbourne, there is more public housing than in any other electorate in the country, and the public housing waiting lists are huge. Even in public housing, there are people who are couch-surfing, who have been homeless for seven or eight years and who still have not been provided with appropriate accommodation. Not a day goes by when one of my staff members or I do not approach a housing service or a state government minister to seek appropriate accommodation for someone. 


In the face of all those statistics and compelling stories, we have 250,000 Australian households on social housing waiting lists around the country, which is around half a million people. We have only 4,500 homeless people given priority access to public housing. There was a great deal of hope that finally the legislation, which was an overdue response to the white paper, might take us forward. Instead, we have a bill that expresses what are worthy sentiments but that is essentially a press release with a parliament of Australia bill cover on the front of it. The worthy sentiments do not bring with them one extra dollar for homeless services. This bill does not bring with it one new house or flat for someone who is seeking support. It will not relieve the pressure one jot on those who are homeless, who are at risk of homelessness or who are looking after those people who are at risk of homelessness. As one reads through the bill, yes, you find yourself nodding your head and agreeing with the very important and worthy sentiments in it. You keep waiting for the punchline where the bill will say that it is going to do something, and you turn to the last page and find that the bill says that not only is it not going to do something but something even more than that. It says in section 14:


(1) This Act does not, by its terms or operation, create or give rise to 4 any rights (whether substantive or procedural), or obligations, thatare legally enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.


It is a bill that is not legally binding. Why? What is the point of that if it is not backed up with a comprehensive response to the massive and growing problem of homelessness and housing affordability in this country? If you wanted a definition of Clayton's legislation, it is this—it is the bill you have when you are not having a bill—because it confers absolutely no legal rights or protections for this country's most vulnerable people and the ones who are most at risk. 


Perhaps the reason we are seeing this bill brought on now at five minutes to midnight in this parliament is that last week was Homelessness Week and the Greens responded to that not with a bill that does nothing, but with a plan of action. The Greens have been concerned about homelessness and housing affordability for some time, and so last week we announced a homelessness action plan that would provide an emergency package to build 7,000 new homes by 2020—enough to house every person currently sleeping without adequate shelter. It is something that the government promised to do many years ago. We would include a 50 per cent target of fast-build, modular or pre-fabricated housing which will be significantly faster and more affordable to build. There are some great Australian factories that would be able to manufacture that modular and pre-fabricated housing. We would double the current funding for specialist homelessness services in Australia. In an environment where we know that, as I said before, 59 per cent of people are turned away on an average day when they turn up for help and three quarters of couples with children, we need that doubling in homelessness services. 


We have had it costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office and it is eminently affordable, especially if we were to have the courage to raise the money this country needs to fund the services Australians expect. That would involve having a proper mining tax, and we hear today that Australia's banks are the most profitable in the world—and under Labor they have become the most profitable in the world—and the return to the community is nowhere near what it is in other countries. In other countries in Europe and the United States, they are saying, 'Well, look, we as governments stand behind you big banks and allow you to make these massive profits, we want a fair return.' A similar levy here in Australia would bring in $11 billion over four years. If we had the courage to stand up to the big miners or to the big banks or if we had the courage to just raise revenue in this country to the same proportion of GDP as it was under former Prime Minister John Howard, we would have an extra $20 billion to spend. That would mean that instead of having legislation that creates no legal rights or obligations and does not have one dollar attached to it, we could instead afford to fund initiatives like the Greens' proposal to solve Australia's homelessness by 2020. It would actually put some meat on the bones and put some money into building some housing and providing support for homelessness services. 


If we are serious about addressing homelessness, I will tell you about two other things that would help. One is to raise NewStart above the poverty line. It has now been almost five years under this government where there has been a strong campaign from the sector and from people who say that we need to life NewStart above the poverty line, because it is far too low. We have had nothing but small increases that amount to only a couple of dollars a day. We need a minimum increase of $50 a week in NewStart—again it is something that is fully affordable if we had the courage to raise the revenue we need to fund the services Australians expect to create a more caring society. The second thing that I would do to address homelessness I would not kick single parents off their payments and put them on NewStart, because one of the most distressing things we have learnt is that since the start of this year is that housing services and welfare agencies are reporting a spike in the number of single parents with children who are seeking their services. 


We told the parliament at the time the bill was going through—and people did not listen but it has been borne out to be the fact—that the people who were hit hardest by the government's decision to save a bit of money to help get back to surplus, a goal which they have now abandoned, were the ones who were already working. Kicking single parents off their welfare payments and onto the dole was apparently meant to help get them back into work but we learnt that the ones who were hit hardest were the ones who were already working the most because under the single parent payment you could earn and keep more of your income than you can under Newstart. Not only was it a drop in the actual payment but it was a drop in how much you could remain in the workforce. This was in face of the fact that single parents were already the group that had the highest proportion of people in work.


If you have met and spoken to single parents, you understand why. It is because they are predominantly women, many of whom have had experience of family violence and what they are trying to do is to provide the best life for their kids and for themselves as they possibly can. They are the group of people amongst all other welfare recipients who want to work and who are trying the hardest to juggle. They do not have spare cash to afford child care. They cannot necessarily have someone else at the end of a phone or in their house who can look after the kids and so they are juggling these things. Yet the decision that was made by the government has meant $140 a week in lost income for some of them. That is a lot of money when you are the only income earner in your family. As a result, more and more of them are presenting to services saying, 'We are now at risk of losing our house and we need the support of charity.' 


If you were serious about addressing that, you would not be putting more people into a situation where they are at risk of homelessness by attacking those who are already doing it hardest. Let us get single parents back on the benefits and allow them to earn more and keep more of it as they used to be able to. Let us lift Newstart and the poverty line and let us have a debate in this country about how much we are prepared to raise the money to then fund these kinds of services because it is not that expensive—$233 million per annum to build prefabricated homes to house every rough sleeper by 2020. That is $500 million for the specialist homelessness services and signing a new national partnership on homelessness is $275 million. These are all eminently affordable and all costed. Let us do more than pass legislation that is not even legally binding. Let us make a real difference to Australia's homeless.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (16:43):  I rise to speak on the Homelessness Bill 2013 and Homelessness (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013. The bills are aimed at increasing recognition and awareness of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. These bills are a missed opportunity because they are simply aspirational bills without any concurrent funding or reforms to improve homelessness in Australia. In their current form these bills will not make any difference to the plight of homeless Australians. As the member for Melbourne said, they are bills you have when you are not really having bills. 


The coalition will not oppose the bills, but I am concerned that through this legislation the Labor government has produced yet another statement of principles without any ongoing tangible commitment to preventing or reducing homelessness on the ground. These two bills make minor amendments which are primarily administrative in nature. As the explanatory memorandum states, the bill draws national attention to the experience of homelessness and voices the aspiration that all Australians have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing. It sets out a range of service delivery principles to which the Commonwealth is committed and the strategies seen as necessary to reduce homelessness. 


The Homelessness (Consequential Amendments) Bill repeals the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994, makes some definitional changes and removes references to the superseded homelessness funding mechanism referred to in the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994. This program was primarily a vehicle for providing funding to states and territories to administer the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, which gave crisis and transitional support and accommodation services to the homeless. New funding arrangements were introduced in 2009, namely the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness and the national affordable housing specific purpose payment. It also replaces a definition of 'homeless person', which applies in the provisions regarding the inclusion of itinerant electors on the electoral roll, to ensure that people who are homeless can still effectively participate in electoral activities.


The bills stem from a recommendation in Labor's white paper on homelessness to enact new legislation to ensure that people who are homeless receive quality services and adequate support. Their introduction follows a very lengthy journey through this parliament, including the white paper; an inquiry into homelessness legislation in 2009 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family Community, Housing and Youth; and a public consultation process in mid-2012. These bills respond to some of the concerns raised throughout the committee and public consultation process.


The definition of 'homelessness' has been widened so that people staying in crisis accommodation cannot be ruled out of the definition through any concept of choice. The definition also now includes a reference to safety as a vital element in a person's living circumstances. Stakeholders believe that these definitional changes are important, ensuring as they do that people staying in crisis accommodation are not excluded from the definition of 'homeless' because they have chosen to leave their homes. Young people escaping a violent home life and mothers and their children who have had to leave home for their own safety can hardly be said to have chosen a life of homelessness. Otherwise, the bills are simply a statement of high-level aspiration for the more than 105,000 homeless Australians and the thousands of dedicated men and women who work tirelessly to support them. These bills will raise the hope and expectation that this Labor government might finally do something tangible to stem the tide of homelessness in Australia.


As we approach the final days of the 43rd Parliament, it is clear that this government wants to pass these bills to seem to be doing something without making any difference to funding or service provision for homelessness. Homeless Australians do not need more esoteric aspiration. They need support and they need funding. Labor is offering neither through these bills. If we look at the track record of the Rudd-Gillard governments, it is clear that they have mismanaged their homelessness policy. In 2008, Kevin Rudd said that homelessness was a 'national obscenity' and promised to halve the rate of homelessness in Australia by 2020. In fact, under Labor's watch, homelessness has only increased. 


Between 2006 and 2011, ABS census figures show a 17 per cent increase in the number of homeless people in Australia, or an increase of over 15,500 people, from 89,728 in 2006 to 105,237 in 2011. Under Labor, more than 17 per cent of Australia's homeless are now under the age of 12, and homeless families represent almost one-third of those receiving support in 2011-12. In most cases, these are single adults with children.


On 2 May 2013, the Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO, released a report which revealed major failings in the government's key homelessness funding deal with the states and territories, the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, or NPAH. According to the report, the government is unlikely to achieve its own target of a seven per cent reduction in homelessness by 1 July 2013. The government's likely failure to reach its seven per cent target has also been confirmed by a recent COAG Reform Council report, Homelessness 2011–2012: comparing performance across Australia, and by officials from the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs at Senate estimates hearings this month.


The Labor government has simply increased reporting compliance without knowing whether federal funding has resulted in a commensurate increase in the ability of states and territories to deliver front-line services to some of our most vulnerable citizens. This was revealed by the ANAO, which detailed multiple problems with the NPAH. Firstly, state and territory governments are not required to report financial information to the Commonwealth under the NPAH, meaning the Commonwealth has no way to know if jurisdictions are meeting their financial commitments under the agreement. Secondly, payments to the states and territories are not linked to outcomes, milestones or performance benchmarks. Thirdly, the absence of outcomes based reporting means the government is unable to make meaningful assessments of overall progress within each jurisdiction, or nationally, and receives very little information on whether the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness reforms are even working at all. Lastly, problems with homelessness data used under the NPAH mean the government cannot even measure changes in homelessness levels in Australia over the life of the agreement.


Once you move past the overblown rhetoric, Labor's lack of commitment to reducing homelessness in real terms is revealed by the facts. In the 2013-14 federal budget, Labor has not committed any funding beyond next year to homelessness. Instead, this government has allocated $159 million in 2013-14 for a one-year so-called Transitional National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness with the states and territories. The process of re-negotiating the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness resulted in continued instability for homelessness service providers and Labor's last-minute one-year deal to extend funding beyond 1 July 2013 is a short-term band-aid solution that does not provide certainty for these services and the thousands of homeless people who rely on them. Under Labor, the future of homelessness funding in Australia will remain uncertain. Beyond 2014, this government has allocated nothing in the forward estimates to fund vital homelessness services across the country. Even if this Labor government had provided meaningful funds for homelessness, the way they negotiated the funding arrangements for homelessness means it is all but impossible to know whether the NPAH reforms are working at all.


The coalition will not oppose this legislation but we do not believe the worthy sentiments it expresses will make any difference to homeless Australians on the ground. The coalition is committed to supporting the homeless with more than fine words. We are committed to combating the many and complex causes of homelessness, supporting homeless Australians with real practical assistance and preventing even more Australians from falling into homelessness. Unfortunately, we cannot wave a magic wand and house all the homeless. Setting arbitrary targets and making promises to solve the plight of our underprivileged is not the best approach, because we simply cannot comprehend the complex nature of the issues they face. These can include domestic violence, substance abuse, mental illness and adverse economic circumstances such as sudden job loss.


A coalition government, if elected, would streamline homelessness services and cut red tape for providers, along with a $1.5 billion package for mental health. Providing real support for mental health services will be an important preventive step to support at-risk Australians. The coalition will not oppose the bills. However, setting out aspirational goals in the last days of this parliament is simply too little, too late for a government which has not been serious about making any difference to the plight of homeless Australians.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide—Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Mental Health Reform) (16:52):  This package of bills is aimed at increasing recognition and awareness of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. This government has made homelessness a national priority. Our white paper The road home outlines how we intend to reduce homelessness through a program that will require sustained effort by governments, business and the broader community. We have set clear targets to halve the rate of homelessness by 2020 and to provide supported accommodation for all rough sleepers who need it. We are progressing these targets through a significant boost in spending, new agreements with the states and territories and an overhaul of the existing legislative framework. Already we have seen progress, including through early intervention to prevent homelessness.


The homelessness legislative framework was the subject of a comprehensive inquiry during 2009 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth. The committee's report Housing the homelesshas been vital in shaping this legislation being debated today. With the exception of the legislative right to housing, which is outside current government policy—and, in practice, would be significantly dependent on the actions of states and territory governments, which are responsible for housing—the committee's recommendations have been incorporated into the Homelessness Bill 2013 to the best extent possible. The bill complements a broader reform process to reduce homelessness, incorporating substantial co-investment with states and territories to expand and implement a range of practical measures to support and improve outcomes for Australians facing homelessness. The bill underpins the need to sustain this effort into the future.


The Homelessness Bill 2013 draws national attention to the experience of homelessness and voices the aspiration that all Australians have access to appropriate, affordable, safe and sustainable housing. This ensures consistency with the objective of the National Affordable Housing Agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and territories and local government. This ensures consistency with the objective of the National Affordable Housing Agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories and local government. The bill acknowledges the direct relationship between addressing homelessness and social inclusion. It sets out a range of service delivery principles to which the Commonwealth is committed and the strategies we see as necessary to reduce homelessness. The bill also confirms the Commonwealth's commitment to cooperation and consultation in reducing homelessness and promotes the human rights of people facing homelessness. This legislation has been strengthened through a two-month public exposure period in mid-2012. We express our gratitude to those many people who lodged written submissions on the exposure draft of the bill. 


The new legislation will replace the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act of 1994 which set out important principles and guided the Commonwealth's response to homelessness in Australia for many years. The 1994 act was primarily a vehicle for providing funding to states and territories to implement the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. However, new arrangements were introduced in 2009 under the Federal Financial Relations Framework, superseding the funding mechanism under the 1994 act. This current funding framework for Commonwealth, state and territory efforts to reduce homelessness with funding provided through Commonwealth-state mechanisms such as the National Partnership on Homelessness and the National Affordable Housing specific purpose payment will continue. 


The Homelessness Bill 2013 is therefore complementary to the comprehensive funding arrangements already in place and is not a funding instrument in itself. Accordingly, the Homelessness (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013 repeals the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994 to make way for the new legislation. It also makes a consequential amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918 to make sure existing provisions that encourage civic participation and voting by people experiencing homelessness will continue to apply. The Homelessness Bill 2013 is just one part of a bigger policy program of support to people who are homeless or at risk of it. The issue of service quality is also being pursued by working with states and territories to develop a non-legislative Homelessness National Quality Framework. The framework will be the primary strategy for the white paper's goal of ensuring quality services. 


The welfare and safety of our fellow Australians matter a great deal. There can be no more worthy cause than doing all that we can to help reduce homelessness. This new legislation is a clear statement of our commitment and our values in this vital policy agenda and underlines and complements the substantial practical measures already in place. 


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (16:59):  If there were ever an Australian politician larger than life it was Michael Hodgman. A great Australian, colourful in every sense of the word, Michael was a dear friend for over 40 years. He was the exemplar of a grand entrance. I can still conjure up the image of Michael, arms held above his head, making a grand and triumphal entrance to a Young Liberal national convention in the 1970s. Michael was passionate about life—passionate about his beliefs and passionate about his support for the monarchy. 


Ever optimistic, Michael never took a backward step. He battled through adversity and, if knocked down, was immediately back on his feet. It is impossible to comprehend that Michael has left us. He was so full of life. It was great to see Paddy, Michael's brother, together with Louise and Elizabeth, in the gallery on Friday. What a family. Michael was the third of four generations of Hodgmans in politics, the fourth being his son Will who is doing an outstanding job in Tasmania. Michael was so proud of Will and probably his main regret would be not being alive to see Will become Premier of Tasmania.


As I thought about how best to capture the magic of Michael Hodgman, I came across a Hobart Mercury of last Thursday. What shone through from their coverage was the respect that Michael was accorded from political allies and opponents alike. The comments in recent days by Justice Kirby and those political friends and opponents alike highlight this remarkable, fiercely independent but universally respected and liked Australian. To achieve that position in politics is as genuine an honour as can be bestowed. I like Duncan Kerr's comment quoted in the Mercury:


Michael Hodgman, QC, will be remembered with a fondness rarely felt for a political warrior.


Suffice it to say, Michael was a politician of principle. He strongly opposed the flooding of Lake Pedder, supported East Timor independence but was passionate about retaining the monarchy. Michael would implore the politicians of today to bring back that quality in politics that allows one to disagree on philosophy, policy and actions but not to hate each other. 


The message, I am sure, that Michael would have for us all today is that it is time to get back to a public discourse without bitterness, to understand that as politicians we often lose sight of the fact that humour, goodwill, enjoying life and mutual respect are not anathema to public life. With a touch of Jim Killen about him, Michael stands tall in political history as a great achiever, a passionate man and a good friend. I say to the House today that if we as members can find ourselves regarded with a genuine warmth and respect that has been accorded to Michael, we too will have left this world a better place. 


William Michael Hodgman AM, QC, Her Majesty's Attorney-General, bon vivant, larrikin, man of honour and principle and good friend, rest in peace.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (17:02):  I had the great privilege of serving in this parliament from 1975 until 1987 with Michael Hodgman. In that context, I knew him. I have known his family. I have served not only with him in this parliament but with his brother Peter while he was in the Tasmanian parliament and his son Will whom I have known as a member of the parliament of Tasmania and also Leader of the Opposition. 


Michael served as the shadow immigration minister between 1983 and 1985. We worked closely together because of my interest in that area of public policy. When I was Attorney-General, I had the opportunity of again working with Michael. That was between 2003 and 2007. He was for a time shadow Attorney-General in Tasmania. 


I could regale, as others have, of his colour, his unique personality and his interest in a wide range of issues which people have talked about but I want to talk about the one area of public policy about which I have not heard any observations. That is his interest in human rights. Michael was a member of the parliamentary Amnesty group. I still wear its badge even though some people at one stage asked me to take it off. I am a financial member and I have refused. But it was the time that the parliamentary Amnesty group was first formed when something like two-thirds of the parliament wanted to be associated with Amnesty International. There were some members who were more anxious than most and one of them was Michael Hodgman. What I remember particularly was the group of people, which included the late Roger Shipton, myself and Michael amongst others, who turned up at the gate of the Soviet embassy to present petitions on behalf of Soviet Jewry—



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr RUDDOCK:
  I thought that might interest one of my colleagues. It was 'colourful'. We did not get a warm reception—in fact, we did not even get an invitation inside the gate—but we made the point.


Michael was interested in human rights. He was quite critical of Amnesty in one respect. Those who do not know Amnesty well are perhaps not aware of its unique role in adopting prisoners of conscience. It will only adopt as prisoners of conscience people who have eschewed the use of violence. It is perhaps fitting to note that a person that I have come to know and greatly admire, Nelson Mandela—at a time when he is possibly terminally ill—would not be adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty essentially because the ANC had not eschewed the use of violence in overturning the regime in South Africa. Michael Hodgman was passionate that we should adopt Nelson Mandela and pressed that issue—without success, but he certainly pressed it upon his colleagues who would have supported him. If you read through much of the material that has been written about him, he was a passionate opponent of capital punishment, another one of Amnesty's fundamental principles—the third being torture.


As you can probably gather, I could regale for hours on Michael Hodgman and recount many of the matters that have been raised by others. I simply lament that he was early widowed. I saw him frequently and I regarded him as a personal friend. I very much lament the circumstances of his passing because I saw the impact the emphysema had upon him—it was telling numbers of years ago. It was pleasing to read that his life was perhaps much longer than it might have otherwise been because of the management of it. It is appropriate that his family should know that he is fondly remembered in this place, particularly by me because of his interest in issues relating to human rights.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (17:08):  I listened to the member for Berowra's very generous and warm remarks in this condolence motion on the death of Michael Hodgman. I will not delay the House for as long as Michael Hodgman perhaps would normally warrant because so many others who knew him very well have spoken so warmly about him.


I got to know Michael Hodgman in two capacities initially: firstly, as the brother of a friend and constituent, John Hodgman, his elder brother who predeceased him—an equally colourful gentleman in the Hodgman mould; and, secondly, during the debate about the republic as Michael was an enthusiastic and ebullient champion of the monarchy. We disagreed thoroughly and debated each other frequently, but I have to record that, unlike many participants in public debate, including the republic debate, Michael was always good-humoured: most of the time he had his tongue in his cheek, he certainly never took himself seriously and he regarded the debate as something to be enjoyed.


I think this is what has caused so many people from across the political spectrum to love him over the years—or perhaps be frustrated by him and enraged by him too—and also recognise that he was essentially a man of enormous warmth, humanity and good humour. He had none of that sullen dourness, that tedious intensity, that you see so often in public debate. He never had any of that thin-lipped meanness or that gimlet glare that you get from people who become obsessed with causes to the point of starting to hate the people who are making the contrary case. In some respects Michael Hodgman had this approach not simply because he was in many respects an 18th century personality, who enjoyed drinking—




Mr Frydenberg:
  Not even 19th?




Mr TURNBULL:
 No, he was definitely 18th century. I correct the member for Kooyong—definitely 18th century; perhaps very early 19th century. The early 19th century was of course Tasmania's heyday, so that would have been appropriate. That was when Tasmania was the wealthiest part of the English-speaking world—in the early 1800s. I return to the 21st century, the late 20th century and Michael Hodgman. Hodgman enjoyed life to the full. He knew that he smoked too much, drank too much, ate too much and went to the races too much. He knew all of that, but he lived life to the full recognising the risks that he ran. 


Michael simply loved the thrill of an argument. He brought to the political sphere the good humour of the professional advocate in the sense that he recognised that every case—be it in the courts, in the public domain, in the parliament or out in the media—had to be argued. While he would describe his opponents sometimes in the most extravagant terms, he never did so, in my experience at least, with any malice and certainly without any tinge of personal animosity. He was, in that sense, a thoroughly good-humoured opponent.


Another gentleman who was a great stalwart of the monarchist cause in that time and very similar to Michael Hodgman in this respect was Lloyd Waddy, who was the chairman of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. Lloyd Waddy, like Michael, was always good company. We disagreed often. Waddy, who was a natural friend of Hodgman's, and I were once attending a dinner debate about the monarchy and, after surveying the audience, we concluded that they had all had an excess of refreshments and were not in a position to appreciate an argument about the fine niceties of constitutional law. So, I said to Lloyd, 'You give the speech for the republic and I'll give the one for the monarchy,' which we duly did. The good thing for both of our reputations is that nobody can remember precisely what was said, but they all seemed to enjoy it. Hodgman was that sort of advocate and public figure.


We all miss Michael dearly. We remember him as a big, larger-than-life colourful figure and somebody that is, in some respects, an example to us in that he was not filled with personal animosity—that meanness of which I spoke a little while ago. There is too much of that in public life; there is not enough good humour. He has, of course, a large family who mourn his passing—in particular his son Will, who was his great pride and joy. He even forgave Will his republicanism, which may have been the reason why Michael and I became such frequent correspondents whether in writing or on the telephone in subsequent years. He saw in Will, in a sense, somebody that could fulfil the ambition of being a head of government—a Premier in Will's case of course. Who knows what greatness awaits Will Hodgman in the years ahead—he is a young man of course. But he saw in Will the prospect for great achievement.


He was inordinately proud of his son. They sometimes argued. Of course, they were in the parliament together. At one point, Will had to drop him from the frontbench—which must have made for an interesting discussion! But Will will miss him perhaps more than anyone. The essentially civilised Hodgman gene, the good humour gene, is there in Michael's son Will. When Will becomes the Premier of Tasmania, as he deserves to be—and that state certainly needs a change of government—there will be a more measured version of Michael. Will is not quite as colourful as Michael. Nonetheless, he has that same big heart, that same enormous love for the state of Tasmania, and a good humour that should be the mark of all of our discourse in public life.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:16):  The Hon. William Michael Hodgman AM, QC was the voice of Tasmania—indeed, 'the mouth from the south'. Over four decades, in three separate houses of parliament, Michael Hodgman showed his passion for and dedication to the Apple Isle, which runs right through the Hodgman family—and we have just heard the member for Wentworth speak fondly of his son Will. Michael Hodgman was elected to the Tasmanian Legislative Council on 14 May 1966. He was just 27 and the youngest member ever elected in the history of the Tasmanian parliament until the election of Alison Ritchie in 2001. From 1966 onwards, the voice of Tasmania made a name for himself, building on the family legacy of public service. A real gentleman, Mr Hodgman's advocacy for the retention of the constitutional monarchy became a hallmark of his career in the Apple Isle, as well as in this place.


Michael Hodgman was part of the Hodgman dynasty, which is still very active in Tasmania today. He was the son of Bill Hodgman, who served in both houses of the Tasmanian parliament between 1955 and 1983, including as President of the Tasmanian Legislative Council between 1981 and 1983. Politics, it seems, is in the blood of the Hodgman family. The Prime Minister eloquently noted in her condolence speech on 20 June that Michael Hodgman was the father and son of Tasmanian parliamentarians. His love of the Liberal Party and his determination to serve his community earned him the nickname 'the mouth from the south'. There is, as the member for Denison highlighted, a sort of fondness with which he is remembered by his constituents, even now after his passing. Andrew Wilkie put it aptly when he said it seems as if Michael Hodgman knew each of his constituents by name. He knew who all the kids were and even what football team they supported. He was a style of politician who blended the local of children's names and football teams with ministerial offices in this place, as well as his vehement objection to the invasion of East Timor.


But Michael Hodgman was also a family man. Indeed, William Michael Hodgman is the father of Will Hodgman, the Leader of the Liberal Party in Tasmania, a man who my coalition colleagues and I hope will one day be the Premier of his father's beloved island state. We are all privileged to represent our communities in this place. It is a rare privilege bestowed on only 1,093 people here since Federation. Imagine the honour Michael Hodgman had in serving alongside his son. Indeed, imagine the privilege of Michael Hodgman sitting in a party room and a parliament in which his son was his leader. It is this intergenerational call to service which made his long political career so distinguished.


I spoke with John Sullivan, who was the Country Party member for Riverina between 1974 and 1977, about Mr Hodgman. He remembered a man who was a very engaging MP. Nothing was too much trouble for him, Mr Sullivan said. He could not speak highly enough of him. He said he was a principled man and a man of passion. He has very fond memories of his association with Mr Hodgman and he wishes to pass on his condolences not just to Mr Hodgman's family but to the entire Liberal Party family. He said Bruce Goodluck, the former Franklin Liberal MP from 1975 to 1993, and Mr Hodgman formed a formidable pair. John Sullivan recalled fondly his association with both of those men. He said the man we are honouring today was a fine parliamentarian, a fine gentleman and somebody who contributed greatly to this nation.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (17:19):  I rise to join my colleagues in this place in paying my respects following the passing of the Hon. William Michael Hodgman AM, QC. A former member of parliament, both state and federal, Mr Hodgman had a distinguished career spanning a remarkable 43 years in parliament—including 12 years in the federal parliament, three of which were spent as a minister. He came from a family that is synonymous with politics in his state of Tasmania. His great-uncle, his father, his brother and his son have all served in state or national parliaments. His son, Will, is the current Liberal Party leader in Tasmania and, we hope, soon to be premier of that state. His great-great-uncle, Thomas Christopher Hodgman, was elected to the House of Assembly in 1900, the last year that Tasmania was a colony before Federation.


Michael, who rose to be the Minister for the Capital Territory and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Fraser government, was, beyond politics, a man of varied and significant talents. As the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, told the House, at different times he was a sailor, a jockey, a boxer and a barrister. But it was his passion for the Liberal Party, for a constitutional monarchy and for the state of Tasmania for which he was a most loyal servant. It was those passions that drove him to his great achievements.


In the words of former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, who knew Mr Hodgman well:


He had courage, but more than anything he had conviction.


In the words of former Liberal Premier Robin Gray:


Every day he—


Mr Hodgman—


was fighting for Tasmania, he'd be knocking on the Prime Minister's door, asking for this and asking for that


Current Federal Court judge and former Labor minister Duncan Kerr, also a member from Tasmania, said of Michael Hodgman:


Michael Hodgman QC will be remembered with a fondness rarely felt for a political warrior.


Michael was blunt, outspoken, fair, funny, and, despite our two fiercely fought campaigns, my friend.


…   …   …


We rarely see his kind and I will miss him. He will be deeply mourned by Tasmanians of every political persuasion.


Those quotes, from both Liberal and Labor, from both state and federal, speak about the achievements, the contribution and the character of a significant figure in Australian politics.


Unfortunately, I never knew Michael Hodgman, but his cousin, his relative Susie Clennett is a good friend of mine and a very good friend of my sister. To her, and to the extended Hodgman family, I say that he leaves this earth knowing that he made a significant contribution to his state and to his country, and that he leaves with many, many admirers who will forever uphold and be proud of his legacy.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Symon

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (18:29):  I rise to commend the motion of the member for Forrest on cybersafety and to speak in support of it. As the motion states, cyberbullying and inadequate cybersafety pose a significant threat to the welfare and security of all Australians—especially young people. This threat will increase with new technology and greater connectivity.


Before I get into the body of the speech, I would just like to recognise and acknowledge the work of the member for Forrest and her continual forums that she holds in schools educating and telling our children, the children of Australia, about the threats of cyberbullying and the ways to protect themselves from that. She has brought this motion to the House and I would like to acknowledge the fine work she does in her electorate to prevent cyberbullying.


The best way to combat this threat and ensure that generations of young Australians can benefit safely from new technology and increased connectivity online is for the government to enhance cybersafety education in all Australian schools. The risks children may face on the internet are currently one of the most significant welfare concerns facing Australians and it is essential that this parliament acts decisively to ensure our young people are equipped with the knowledge to use online tools safely.


I addressed the House in 2011 on the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. I then spoke briefly about a visit I made to the Carlisle Primary School in my electorate of Swan to talk to the students about cybersecurity and the importance of protecting their online image. At the time I commended Carlisle Primary School's anti-cyberbullying stance and encouraged other schools to do the same. While I believe most schools have a non-tolerance policy for cyberbullying, it is essential that we assist our local schools to teach our students about online cybersafety and security. 


For example, there were students I spoke to who thought that the photos or personal information they shared on sites such as Facebook were secure and private. Clearly that is not the case, as with many other social media platforms children and adults use. Many also did not realise that what they posted would be recorded online forever even if they deleted it. What they post online today may affect their future when it comes to applying for a job or acceptance into university. This is why it is so essential that we continue to educate our young people on internet usage, acceptable online etiquette and behaviour.


I also spoke to the Sevenoaks Senior College at one stage, talking to them about online images. I asked them to imagine what it would be like for them now to see a picture of their mother or father online from 20 years ago. I said to them, 'If you now post these pictures of yourself in awkward positions, this is what your children will see in the future.' I think they go it then when they imagined trying to see their own parents.


The internet and the world we live in are constantly changing. New social platforms and ways to interact online are constantly emerging. People are becoming more knowledgeable about the online world and more people from are countries are using worldwide web services. With these advances come many great opportunities but the risks will always increase as well. This is why a one-off education and an occasional research paper on cybersafety are not enough to continue to protect and educate our young people. It has been suggested that cybersafety should be a part of the national curriculum, taught alongside information technology and computing classes. This is a possibility that could be explored to ensure that future generations will be equipped with the knowledge necessary to stay safe online.


Unfortunately, Australia is lagging in the cyber education front. Whilst many schools run programs such as cyber friendly schools project introduced by Edith Cowan University in my home state of Western Australia, these programs are often voluntary and are not consistently utilised in all schools. I must also acknowledge the Youth Advisory Group on Cybersafety, or YAG, which was first launched in 2009 with the purpose to provide feedback and advice in youth cyber issues to the Australian government. The program is a forum which allows representatives from schools across Australia to come together and discuss their experiences with online issues such as cybersecurity and cyberbullying. This is a good first step. However, to successfully reduce the incidence of cyber related issues—be they related to online bullies, scammers or predators—the Australian government must be prepared to support a focused nationwide cybersafety education program that is common to all schools across Australia. 


The United Kingdom has already adopted cybersafety education in their national curriculum which has been widely welcomed by education and cybersafety experts in the UK. Children need the advice and skillsets to recognise and avoid online dangers. 


Young people are particularly active on the internet, which makes them one of the groups most vulnerable to lapses in cybersecurity. This young generation are more tech-savvy than their parents—I know my son is—and they rely on technology on a day-to-day basis, be it for social interaction, learning or productivity. With many young people having close to unlimited access to the world wide web through a variety of devices such at internet-enabled smartphones, tablet computers, laptops and various family PCs, it is essential that they are equipped with the knowledge to protect themselves. According to a Telstra report released earlier this year, Australian children aged between 10 and 17 are online for an average of two hours per day, amongst the highest internet usage rates in the world.


The internet can be a confronting place for many parents. While their children are learning more and more skills online, such as reading and mathematics, they are also navigating a plethora of social networking sites, blogs and chat rooms, on which they can unwittingly divulge personal information, act anonymously with no accountability or even take on a whole completely new persona. Furthermore, online predators can potentially communicate with them 24/7 on any screen or internet-connected device inside the family home.


Although law enforcement agencies in Australia and around the world are getting better at apprehending and preventing cyberpredators, scammers and bullies, they will not disappear from the internet; instead, their ploys and schemes will become even more sophisticated and seemingly genuine. This, however, is no reason to abandon the benefits and opportunities the internet can provide. Rigorous education for both children and parents is the best means to ensure that our children are forewarned and equipped to recognise and protect themselves against the online bullies, scammers and predators.


I would like to take the opportunity to describe some of the issues our young people may face when interacting online, to illustrate why education for both children and parents is necessary in this cyber age. The first is known as cyberbullying. The Australian parliament report of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety defined cyberbullying as being over time and including, but not limited to, mean, nasty or threatening text messages, instant messengers, pictures, video clips and emails that are sent direct to a person or others via a mobile phone or the internet. Cyberbullying is different to traditional face-to-face schoolyard bullying, as the perpetrators are able to remain anonymous and the bullying can continue 24/7—out of the schoolyard and into the victims' homes.


Due to the ultra-invasive nature of cyberbullying, experts believe it can be even more damaging and hard to escape than face-to-face bullying. Cyberbullying can be incredibly hard for children to cope with, but studies have shown that when children are equipped with the appropriate coping mechanisms and knowledge, they are often able to prevent or block the bullying from occurring. Reports indicate that as many as one in 10 children will become victims of cyberbullying and up to one in four have experienced cyberbullying in some way, either as a victim, a witness or a perpetrator.


It is also incredibly easy for users of social networking sites to remain anonymous or even pretend to be someone they are not. Online predators are able to pose as friends or other young children in order to gain private information. Children may want to meet up with friends they have only ever communicated with online, potentially placing themselves in harm's way. Many social networking sites also allow for geo-tagging as a default setting, allowing followers or the public to see the young person's location or whereabouts. This can be a frightening world, where any person with access to the internet can pretend to be someone they are not in order to gain the trust of vulnerable young people.


A rigorous national cybersafety education program would ensure that children understand how to set privacy settings on social network sites, communicate with adults about their online activities and are able to recognise when situations may be dangerous or not quite right. Again, I congratulate the member for Forrest. It is essential that this government recognises that the detrimental effect of cyberbullying would be best combatted by a co-ordinated national response. Thank you.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2013-06-24,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:39):  Throughout my time as the member for Canberra, the issues of cybersafety, cybersecurity and cyberbullying have all been raised with me by members of my electorate again and again. I know that I have spoken in this chamber and in the House many times about the online scams that my own family members have been victims of—including my mother and my father-in-law. My father-in-law, immediately after my mother-in-law died, was racked with grief and was the victim of an online banking scam. So I am well and truly aware, both from my family's experience and the experience of people in my electorate, of cybersecurity issues and cyberbullying. I have been approached by parents who are concerned about their kids' actions; by young adults who are concerned about their own online presence; by older Canberrans who want to engage with the internet but are scared about the threats they might face; and by everyday men and women, boys and girls, young and old, who have been the victim of some form of attempted scam or phishing exercise. Cybersafety concerns us all and we can all very easily become victims. 


That is why over the past few months I have been running a series of cybersafety forums in my electorate. These free community forums are designed to engage and inform the community about how they can be smarter and safer online. I held two pilot forums about a month ago, and they were a great success. I am holding three more in July, one targeting older Canberrans, one targeting parents—through school, through the P&C—and another targeting small business. They are all different audiences but quite often they have things in common in terms of their concerns about the cyberenvironment. But they also have their own specific interests and concerns. That is why I was very keen to hold these forums for these three target areas. 


Contrary to what we have just heard—and I have the greatest respect for the former speaker for raising this issue of cybersecurity; I think it is really important that we talk about it often out in our communities—there has been a lot of work done in the school space, the space for young people. But I felt that there was a gap in the market for small business, for older Canberrans and for parents, which is why I am holding these forums. The presenter at these forums is Alastair MacGibbon, from the Centre for Internet Safety at the University of Canberra. Alastair is an internationally respected authority on cybercrime, including internet fraud, consumer victimisation and a range of internet safety issues. He has worked in Washington for the AFP and other security agencies. He has worked in the region. He is an incredibly well-respected authority. I am very lucky to have him help the people in my electorate to navigate the maze of online security. I thank him for his time in helping the people of Canberra to deal with these issues.


In the forums I have held to date, Alastair has given some pretty frightening examples of ordinary Australians who have been the victim of online scams. I was really saddened to hear that the most common type of scam is a romance scam. We have all heard the story: you meet someone online; you email for a couple of months and everything seems perfect, but unfortunately your new loved one lives overseas, so you send them some money for a plane ticket; however, on the day of their flight something goes wrong—a family member of theirs is in an accident and for some reason their insurance will not cover it—so you send them more money for medical costs. Then you never hear from them again. 


Alastair provided many examples of these romance scams that exist. There was an extraordinary one in The Australian a few weeks ago. A physics professor at a US university is in jail in South America for some extraordinary romance that he has been involved in. Things became very unstuck for him. You hear about these sorts of scams—of that proportion but also of a more general nature, where people are ripped off for money. It really does highlight how predators play on the vulnerabilities of people who are looking for love. It is just tragic. It is exceptionally cruel.


Alastair also told the incredibly sad story of a beautiful young Australian girl, Nona Belomesoff. Nona was an 18-year-old animal lover who thought she had been offered her dream job working with the New South Wales Wildlife Information and Rescue and Education Service via Facebook, but instead she was lured to her death. Nona's heart-wrenching story is the very worst kind of story, but we can all learn something from her cruel and unnecessary death, and that is that we need to be smarter online and we need to teach our kids to be smarter online.


Having run my own small business, I know that cybersafety for small business owners is a particular concern. Often, when you are running a small or micro business, you are the jack-of-all-trades. You are managing every aspect of your operation. Quite often, the IT security reminders are put to the bottom of the in-tray or the bottom of the jobs-to-do list because you are so busy marketing yourself or out meeting new clients or delivering jobs. However, if you are not equipped with the appropriate skills and knowledge to manage cyberthreats, it is a difficult task to face and that is why I have designed my forums for these small-business groups.


The internet has the capacity to transform this country. Through the internet, the vastness of our land will no longer be a barrier to education, to health, to community and to culture. That is why this government is investing in the National Broadband Network. However, with expanded opportunity comes expanded risk. Cybersafety is likely to be an issue that we must face well into the future. I am really pleased with what the government is doing on this front. We are taking this issue seriously.


We are delivering a $125.8 million cybersafety plan to combat online risk to children and to help parents and educators protect children from inappropriate material and content while online. This list is incredibly long in terms of what we are doing on that front as part of this plan, but I would just like to take the time to go through some of the measures. These include: funding for cybersafety support, education and awareness-raising initiatives and law enforcement. We have provided funding for the expansion of the AFP's Child Protection Operations team to detect and investigate online child sex exploitation. This includes funding for 91 additional AFP officers. This has resulted in a total of 316 offenders being arrested and summonsed for 840 child sex offence charges since mid-2009.


Funding has also been provided to increase the capacity of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure that prosecutions are handled quickly, and it has also been provided for education and awareness-raising resources through the ThinkUKnow program. I was involved in the launch of this program with Canberra Grammar a few years ago. This program assists parents and children to deal with the risks posed by online predators.


Funding has been provided to develop and maintain online tools, like the Cybersafety Help Button and the Easy Guide to Socialising Online websites, and we have provided funding for the Australian Communications and Media Authority's Cybersmart program. There is a whole website called www.cybersmart.gov.au. It is a national cybersafety and cybersecurity education program.


In addition, we have provided $3 million to The Alannah and Madeline Foundation for a national plan for its e-smart cybersafety initiative, and following the success of this pilot e-program—which has been delivered to 1,600 schools—the Victorian government has announced funding for its own program, and the Queensland government has too. The Alannah and Madeline Foundation are discussing similar rollouts of this program with other state education departments.


To support the take-up of the National Safe Schools Framework, we have also committed about $4 million towards the development of new resources for school communities. Part of this plan is also the funding of the National Cyber Security Awareness Week, which this year ran from 20 to 24 May. The awareness week is a partnership with industry, community organisations and all levels of government. For this year's awareness week, around 1,400 organisations, including 700 schools, partnered with the government to deliver cybersecurity and cybersafety messages around Australia.


I know that there are a number of programs rolling out in my electorate. There are pilot programs at Wanniassa School, programs at Canberra Grammar and programs right throughout the electorate specifically designed for students. I am focusing on small business, parents and older Canberrans. Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility and it is shared by all of us who use the internet. It is important that we all take measures to protect ourselves online.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:49):  I rise to speak on the motion from the member for Forrest, Nola Marino, regarding the ongoing concern about cyberbullying and cybersafety. Cyberbullying poses a particular threat to the welfare and security of young Australians. Children across Australia, no matter their age or what school they attend, continue to struggle with bullying in all its forms. We continue to hear reports in the media of students who suffer from bullying which goes unnoticed for years—or, worse, of students who feel so vulnerable after years of unrelenting harassment that they take their own lives. When we hear of such events, all parents take stock and ask themselves, 'What if that were my child and I did not even know that it was happening?' Unfortunately, today, with technology being increasingly woven into the lives of students and children, bullying occurs not only in the schoolyard; it can occur online at home in the child's bedroom—completely out of a parent's sight.


I therefore thank not just the member for Forrest but all those involved with school communities across my electorate who are trying to raise awareness and to increase education about the prevalence of cyberbullying and the serious consequences it can have. Every parent knows that severe or chronic bullying can lead to serious emotional consequences, leaving victims at greater risk of suffering from anxiety, depression and other stress related disorders. Cyberbullying can be extremely upsetting, especially as the scale and speed of the 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week digital world means it can take place anywhere and at any time.


Earlier this year, researchers presented their findings on the prevalence of cyberbullying in Australia. Some 3,000 students from grades six to 12 across three Australian states completed a questionnaire and shared their thoughts about bullying and cyberbullying. The research showed that 14 per cent of students reported being victims of cyberbullying in the last year, while seven per cent of students reported experiencing both cyberbullying and face-to-face bullying. Females were more likely to report being a victim of cyberbullying.


One of the most significant findings is that 83 per cent of victims knew the person who was bullying them in real life. For most victims, those who engaged in cyberbullying went to the same school, were the same gender and in fact described themselves as a friend, not an acquaintance. At the same time, 25 per cent of young people who engaged in cyberbullying targeted people they did not know. Often young people can feel that they and the information they post on the internet is anonymous, even to the point where what would otherwise be considered harassment on the playground is less evident online.


Many children and teenagers who are cyberbullied are reluctant to tell a teacher or parent, often because they feel ashamed of the social stigma or because they fear their computer privileges at home will be taken away. The issue of cybersafety also highlights the fundamental importance of education about the consequences of our online activity, particularly for privacy—as well as for other potential legal risks and liabilities.


As the member for Forrest has highlighted, some of the most significant issues relate to photo sharing, how to deal with cyberstalking, online grooming and exposure to illegal or inappropriate material, privacy, identity theft and online security. For young people who engage in sexting—the transmission of sexually explicit photos—such activity can quickly become a serious criminal matter. Other serious issues include possible defamation, privacy disclosure, confidentiality, anonymity, intellectual property rights, copyright infringement and criminal laws associated with harassment or posting offensive material. Australians are also faced with identity theft and other risks involved with posting personal identifying material, including names, addresses and birthdays.


Parents, their children and the school system are struggling to keep up. One of the primary reasons for that is that cyberbullying is an emerging and constantly evolving phenomenon—the rules are constantly changing. There are always new virtual interactions and other social media becoming available. Given that children now grow up with computers and the internet, they are much more adept at responding to these constant changes, meaning that children can often finds ways around potential barrier solutions such as parental control or monitoring software.


We do not want a situation where parents simply feel helpless to even comprehend the challenges, leading to them placing online safety in the too-hard basket. It is the difficulty of understanding what is going on or where to start that makes them feel helpless. It is easier to just take away their children's mobile phone or to ban the use of computers, even though the parents acknowledge that these are essential resources for today's children. For example, there are potential privacy dangers associated with geotagging—where a user's location is also posted online when an update is made on social media. On Facebook or Twitter, geotagging can be the default setting, meaning that the user's location is posted even without their active knowledge. If such information is posted online for anyone to see, it quickly opens up the opportunity for real-life stalking. Therefore, from a technical point of view, given the unimaginable scale of the internet, it would be impossible to devise a top-down approach that could be applicable to the varying circumstances that families encounter.


This highlights why education is the key to overcoming the risks of cyberbullying and meeting the challenges of cybersafety. Fortunately, there are resources available for parents, students and schools to devise appropriate techniques to manage cyberbullying and cybersafety. These include traditional resources such as Lifeline, which in 2013 is celebrating 50 years of providing crisis and mental health support services.


I want to highlight the work of Mr Brett Lee, an internet safety expert at INESS, Internet Education and Safety Services. Mr Lee, who worked for more than 20 years as a detective for the Queensland police in the field of child exploitation, now gives internet safety and cyberbullying presentations to schools, the community and other organisations. He continues to provide support to our families and to offer advice to church groups, schools and my electorate generally about how to develop tools for online safety. Fortunately, through the resources of organisations like INESS, parents have been helped to unravel the online world and what it means for their children, including at Fig Tree Pocket State School, Pullenvale State School, Nudgee Junior College and St Peter's Lutheran College. As an expert in the field, Mr Lee has remarked that the most important approach we can take is an individual and community based approach, and that education for parents and students is the key. It is at the home and school levels that the community can come together to devise appropriate solutions. Mr Lee encourages parents and their children to have an open dialogue about not only their interaction with other students but also what they see on the internet.


Earlier this year, staff at Holy Family School in my electorate attended a professional development day presented by Dr Michael Carr-Greg, who I know is very active in presenting such seminars in communities across Brisbane and indeed Australia. As a psychologist Dr Carr-Greg's message is that parents and teachers must be involved and take control, because students' brains are still developing and they are often impulsive and lack the good judgement required in some situations that occur online. Education can therefore lead to empowering students to take responsibility for their online activity and protect themselves. It is with this approach that the federal government and indeed the education departments in each state have an opportunity to ensure that adequate resources are provided.


To this end, I support the member for Forrest, who wants to see online safety education integrated into the curriculum of every school. The threat of cyberbullying and the threats to the cybersafety of our children will not subside; they will only become a more significant issue as we rely more and more on online technology. Appropriate education is the answer to cybersafety and managing the risks of cyberbullying, and the school classroom is the best place for us to provide that education to our children. In this regard, governments across the state and federal levels can provide assistance and a framework through which education programs can occur. However, what is required on this issue is a truly consultative approach between parents, schools, the community, the social media industry and government.


The threats to cybersafety are real and constant. Cyberbullying can occur 24 hours a day, seven days a week. From the classroom to the bedroom, education is absolutely vital to help our students, parents and schools navigate the digital world. I know that the member for Forrest has conducted over 100 seminars on this in her electorate, and I commend her for her ongoing campaign to highlight this evil blight on our society.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (18:59):  I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Forrest on cybersafety and cyberbullying. All of us in the chamber are very much aware of how our lives have been impacted by an increasingly digital world. It brings so many positive opportunities to aspects of modern life, but of course it also brings concerns that we have to address—concerns that relate to the safety of children and young people online. 


So much now depends on the usage of cyberspace. Everything from small business and banking to shopping and government departments can now be operated and accessed online, which are all fantastic and great advances. Already, our employment, healthcare and education depend strongly on very well functioning infrastructure and online access. Labor understand that these areas are vital to a smart and prosperous nation. That is why we are delivering the National Broadband Network. We understand that the vital interconnectivity between the nation's education, health service and economy needs a solid and reliable digital infrastructure network. 


We all benefit from the expansion of the internet. We have also seen some of the downsides of this medium and the sometimes negative impact it can have on the lives of our children. Mobile phones, the internet and in particular social networking have become the new playground of the cyberbully, which is a concern. We know that cyberbullying primarily affects young people because they are in fact the biggest users of digital media. According to a government bullying and cyberbullying website:


… young people aged 14-17 have the highest rate of internet usage as at June 2010, with 91 per cent going online weekly. 


Also not a surprise to anyone that is a parent, chatting to friends is the main reason 89% of 16-17 year olds use the internet.


The exploding use of online chat, social networking sites like Facebook and SMS technology for young people has really opened up a whole new avenue of concern. Of course, it is not just limited to young people, but that is what we are focusing on tonight. We need to remember too the great advances and assistance it provides to young people, but tonight we are talking about some of the concerns we need to be aware of. 


The statistics on cyberbullying are most disturbing. It is believed that up to 14 per cent of young people have experienced some form of cyberbullying in Australia. This shocking statistic was gained from a group of researchers who handed down the report entitled The prevalence of cyberbullying in Australia. The rate of bullying of girls is at a staggering 64 per cent, much higher than for their male counterparts.


The overwhelming use of social media and other digital technology has also added another really concerning element to bullying—that is, that it does not stop. Through social media, chat and texts a bully can have direct access to their victims 24 hours a day, which is a concern. So it is not just happening at school; it can happen at the shops, the movies and at home as well. As children become more connected to each other through digital media, their ability to bully others has also been magnified. That is what we have to be very wary of and express our concerns about.


Research has also shown that children are far more unlikely to report a case of cyberbullying than of face-to-face bullying. This new and unrelenting nature of bullying has led to many kids lives being turned into a real pain and real misery, with sometimes very devastating consequences. It is up to us as individuals, parents, communities and governments to be addressing all of these concerns and be taking action in relation to it. It is important we do it in a bipartisan way in working with industry as well. 


The government has introduced a number of measures to address cyberbullying and cybersafety. In 2008 the government committed $125.8 million towards a range of cybersafety programs to inform and educate young people as part of our cybersafety plan. We continue to invest in those cybersafety activities. The cybersafety plan was developed and funded to combat online risks involved in digital media and to help parents and educators protect children from inappropriate online material. This also included expanding the Australian Federal Police Child Protection Operations team. As a result, 91 additional officers were assigned to the AFP. These improved measures have resulted in the prosecution of 316 offenders since mid-2009. The government also increased funding to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to manage increased activity from the AFP to ensure speedier and more efficient prosecutions as a result of these investigations.


So improving cybersafety for our kids has been a priority for this government. That is why we also developed the Stay Smart Online website and provided for the Australian Communications and Media Authority's Cybersmart program, which is a national cybersafety and cybersecurity education program. Education and awareness raising have been the cornerstones of the government's cybersafety reforms. As part of these reforms, resources were provided to families and children through the ThinkUKnow program to assist parents and children to deal with the risks posed by online predators. 


Funding was also allocated to help develop and maintain online tools like the Cybersafety Help Button and the Easy Guide to Socialising Online websites. The Cybersafety Help Button helps young people have 24/7 access to cybersafety resources and advice. Through the button they can also report inappropriate behaviour directly to the AFP, which massively increases their ability to report it. The Cybersafety Help Button is free to download onto a personal computer, mobile or school network to get information where and when it is needed most.


In addition to these great programs, the government has also provided $3 million to the Alannah and Madeline Foundation for a national pilot of its eSmart cybersafety initiative. Following the great success of this pilot program, eSmart has now been delivered to 1,600 schools nationally. The Alannah and Madeline Foundation are discussing similar rollouts of the eSmart program with state education departments.


When it comes to combating cyberbullying directly the government has also set up the cooperative arrangements for complaints handling on social networking sites. This is primarily referred to as 'the protocol' and demonstrates that social networking sites understand that they need to work cooperatively with government to meet the expectations of the Australian community when it comes to combating inappropriate online conduct like cyberbullying.


Primarily the protocol ensures that social networking sites have clear and easy to follow processes so that complaints are handled promptly and in accordance with their user policies. At the present time, four of the major social media platforms have signed up to the protocol. These include Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!7. I certainly commend them for signing up and working with governments and the community. I also believe that Australian people are with us on these really important forms when it comes to cybersafety. In fact, the 2010 parents survey commissioned by the government found that almost one in two Australian parents felt they were well-informed about cybersafety issues. That is really important. I know parents are always looking for as much information as they can to assist their children as they are navigating the online world.


This survey also found the majority of parents had spoken to their children about the risks of being online. I certainly know not only from being a parent but also from my time as a police officer many years ago that it is really important to be constantly informing children about the risks and the dangers they face in a variety of situations. When we are talking about the online environment, it is important to be very clear with them about some of the risks that are out there. While of course we want to be discussing the benefits and the gains that can be achieved from navigating the online world—there are so many for all of us, and particularly for our kids—it is important we keep having those discussions with children about being aware of the dangers and also the help that is available. We know that by making the kids aware of what help is available and what action they can take, that can greatly reduce the harm or the risk that they may find themselves in, or the fact that they may need help depending on whatever the situation might be.


I want to point out again that it is a Labor government that continues to build the digital infrastructure that will carry this country and its children forward in the future. We are very proud of our investment and we are very proud of rolling out the National Broadband Network. But it is also essential for the government to move with the evolving nature of digital technology, and to respond in a meaningful and purposeful way to protect as best we can children from any online bullying or predatory behaviour or online violence. I think we all share a responsibility for that as individuals, parents, communities and governments and recognise that it is important that we are taking action now and into the future as we see a great expansion of our online world. We see a greater amount of children at younger ages who are accessing online environments as well, and we have to be very much aware of that and very much aware of our actions to protect them as much as we can.


From the government's perspective, while we have been delivering on the NBN, we have at the same time continued to work on protecting our kids through that whole range of measures that I mentioned, through programs like Cybersmart, the additional resources to the Australian Federal Police in fighting predators and also the protocols to ensure that websites and social media maintain a very high standard of protection that is expected of them by the Australian community. I am sure that we will keep working with them and with the community in general in ensuring programs are updated in the future to deal with other concerns that may be raised, whether it is in relation to cybersafety or cyberbullying. I think these are grave concerns for all of us across the country, and I think we have all had instances in our electorates of speaking with parents and children about the concerns that have been raised by them and the instances they found themselves in. It is important we keep talking about that, and that we keep saying to our kids that, at the end of the day, they need to be accessing help online and talking to people if they have any concerns. It is important we keep discussing it and making sure that, in working together, we are combating any increases in instances of either bullying or ensuring we are putting as much help in place as we can to ensure the cybersafety of our kids in particular as we see this great growth in the internet throughout the country.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (19:08):  I rise in support of this motion moved by my colleague the member for Forrest, who has just arrived in this chamber. It is testament to her hard work in this area of significant concern for the safety and welfare of Australian children.


As the internet expands its reach into every facet of our everyday lives, it crashes through the traditional physical and virtual barriers that previously provided some sort of protection. And regrettably, what we have seen with the advent of the internet is a new social cost associated with blind allegiance to this new technology. And as with any form of the technology, there are dangers that invariably flow from its misuse. A lack of available education for both children and parents as to the internet's proper use has seen the instances of cyberbullying skyrocket around the country, with newspapers in my electorate in Brisbane, like so many others, all too frequently reporting on circumstances of schoolchildren being sledged, belittled, vilified, stalked and bullied in the most horrendous fashions.


As the member for Forrest has so correctly identified, education is the key to addressing this problem. Too many young people see the internet, or cyberspace, as a lawless domain where they can do anything they want and say anything they want to anyone at any time anywhere. Gone are the days when bullying was a localised problem, limited to the classroom or the schoolyard, with a limited time of exposure confined just to school hours. Now there is no reprieve—and this is one of the greatest dangers of the internet's misuse. Cyberbullying of children can be 24 hours a day, seven days a week and an activity that transcends geographical boundaries and locations. Regrettably, children in the electorate of any member of this place can be the victim of cyberbullying, which can be a global campaign with the click of a mouse. The member for Forrest was quite right when she said on 11 February in this place:


There is probably no greater threat to the safety of our citizens—especially our young people—than the misuse of this great resource. The internet can be our greatest asset but also our greatest risk factor.


That is why cybersafety is such an important issue.


Never were truer words spoken in the name of protecting our children. 


That is why last year, in building on the member for Forrest's great work in this area, the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, established the coalition Online Safety Working Group to consult around the country in developing policies to assist parents, carers and teachers to better protect children and young people from the risks associated with the internet and social media. In the coalition's discussion paper, which was also released last year, we recommended some key measures which we believed could go a very long way towards addressing these issues. They include establishing a children's e-safety commissioner to take a national leadership role in this area; implementing rapid removal protocols for large social media outlets through a cooperative regulatory scheme for material that has been targeted at, and is likely to cause harm to, an Australian child; assisting parents and carers to make better informed decisions about devices such as smart phones and tablets by establishing recognised branding indicating their suitability for younger children and teenagers; providing greater support for schools through a stronger online safety component within the National Safe Schools Framework and assisting with online safety resources for schools; and undertaking a national public education campaign to highlight online safety issues. A key proposal in the coalition's discussion paper is to provide greater support for schools in their work to assist children in their care to be safe online. This would involve providing greater support for schools through a stronger online safety component within the existing National Safe Schools Framework.


After several years of no action from the government with regard to protecting children online, it was really good to see an announcement from the current government in January this year. The coalition welcomed the fact that the announcement followed the lead the coalition had established in key areas, announcing an education module for schoolchildren and voluntary protocols involving some social media outlets. While these arrangements are welcome, it is clear that this announcement by the government does not go far enough. The coalition have made it clear that we expect major social media outlets to step up and to show a greater degree of social responsibility than they have shown to date in working with the government and regulatory agencies to address the problem of providing rapid responses to cyberbullying experienced by children.


Cyberbullying is not a problem that anyone in society can wash their hands of. Children are our most precious resources, and this should not be a subject that is derailed by mindless political parochialism. This is a subject that could well be one of the defining actions of our time, as the new technology that is the internet, and its use, changes the way we live. If there was ever a subject that every member in this House should come together and speak with one voice on, it is this. The cybersafety of our children should be non-negotiable and something for which we should all act in unison. So I know from speaking with parents, not just in my electorate in Brisbane but all around the country, that they need every bit of help to be able to tackle this problem.


I recently spoke on behalf of the shadow minister for education at an independent school forum in Brisbane, where I was very pleased to see—and I am sure the member for Forrest, sitting beside me here, would have been very pleased to see—that one of the presentations was by an expert in cyberbullying. She gave a presentation to all the school principals who were assembled at that particular school conference. So it is great to see that there are people out there like the member for Forrest and other educators who go out to schools to help to alleviate this terrible problem.


Too many parents sometimes feel that this problem is way too complex, is beyond them and they need help. I know from my own experience. Although he is not a 'young' son anymore, I worry about my son's constant time on the internet at the age of 24. It is a very addictive medium in many ways and there needs to be balance in all of these things. We are fighting a battle here where children are digital natives—and many of them are, at best, digital nomads, who are quickly out of their depth and are unable to put in place adequate safeguards. It is very important that we protect our children from cyberbullying.


The coalition expects that our discussion paper, 'Enhancing online safety for children', will stimulate discussion. Indeed, we have received an extensive range of submissions which we are working through. Based upon our discussion paper, those submissions will be bringing forward a policy at the next election. We expect that, in response to that, social media outlets and other internet companies will be better placed to demonstrate their commitment to corporate social responsibility in protecting children from harm. It is vitally important that the corporate sector comes on board here and that they do realise they have a social responsibility.


We want to see enhanced cybersafety through providing greater support for schools through a stronger online safety component within a national safe school framework. I must admit that, when I was at that school conference recently, I could see that schools are crying out for this type of education. They do not know where to turn. They do not know how to implement such a program. And there is a great need to provide that guidance, that leadership and that direction. Many schools are in a position where they want to provide assistance and safety for their students in this new medium. We also want to see a national public education campaign to highlight online safety issues.


I wholeheartedly support this motion of my colleague, the member for Forrest. I want to pay tribute to the hard work that she has done. I know that she has transcended many electorates and spoken to many members and that she has conducted forums for many members in this House as well, and I thank her for the incredible work that she has done. But this parliament should acknowledge that cyberbullying and inadequate cybersafety pose a significant threat to the welfare and security of all Australians, especially young people. This threat will increase with new technology and greater connectivity, and the government should move to take decisive action to enhance cybersafety education in all Australian schools for the benefit of all Australian students.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-06-24,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (19:18):  Bullying has long posed a challenge for schools, parents, workplaces and, most significantly, its victims. It also poses a challenge for us legislators, and it is a challenge the Gillard government has sought to address through initiatives such as the National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence, through directing more than $20 million to the Fair Work Commission to provide victims of workplace bullying with a quick and effective way to resolve bullying at work and prevent it ever happening again.


But, as online communications become increasingly prevalent in our offices, our schools and our social lives, it is clear that combating bullying needs to adjust to take this new dimension into account. It is especially important we recognise the safety and security needs of young people, who are growing up in a world with greater digital use than any previous generation. As a parent, I recognise that the use of the internet my three little boys engage in is vastly different from my own. They have never known a world without ubiquitous internet. To them, being able to touch the screen of a device is just what you do. The ease with which my four-year-old comfortably navigates the internet sometimes sends a shiver down my spine.


That is going to present my three little boys with opportunities I cannot pretend to foresee, but it will also bring new threats. Between Facebook, Vine, Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat, there is a rapidly developing world of online communication. We have to embrace those technological developments while at the same time doing what we can to safeguard the security of users now and into the future.


Bullying may be an old problem, but cyberbullying is different in a number of important ways. Firstly, it provides a degree of anonymity to the perpetrators, meaning they can behave with more aggression and malice than they may dare to in person. A famous study by researchers at the University of Texas, Austin paired up young university students and just asked them to engage in conversations over email. By the end, the researchers were stunned at the extent to which these otherwise placid young university students had begun to engage in conversations that were either lewd or rude. We know that cyberbullying can occur 24/7. We also know that it is nearly impossible to escape. We know it can reach a far more public arena and that online activity can quickly be shared with a larger audience than was possible with bullying in the past.


The Labor government takes the issue of cyberbullying very seriously. In 2008, this government committed $126 million towards a range of cybersafety programs targeted at informing and educating young people as part of our broader cybersafety plan. The government's cybersafety plan is combatting online risks to children. It is helping parents and educators protect children from inappropriate material and inappropriate contacts while online.


The funding supports measures for cybersafety support, education, awareness-raising initiatives and law enforcement, such as funding for the expansion of the Australian Federal Police Child Protection Operations team to detect and investigate online child sex exploitation, funding to increase the capacity of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure prosecutions are handled efficiently and funding for education and awareness-raising through the ThinkUKnow program, which aims to assist parents and children to deal with the risks posed by online predators.


I particularly acknowledge the youth advisory group, some of whom met last year with Minister Stephen Conroy and me at Amaroo School to discuss their inputs into making sure that these cybersafety advances by the government are appropriate and useful to young people. That youth advisory group helped to develop online tools, such as the Cybersafety Help Button and the Easy Guide to Socialising Online website. The government has also provided funding for the Australian Communications and Media Authority's Cybersmart program, which is a national cybersafety and cybersecurity education program.


All this investment is based on some pretty concerning research. Studies undertaken by the ACMA and partly released on 19 March 2013 have found that 14- to 15-year-olds are the most vulnerable to cyberbullying. Thankfully, they are also the most likely to stand up and speak out about it. The research indicates that more than one in five 14- to 15-year-olds have experienced cyberbullying. It shows that levels of cyberbullying among Australian children remain generally steady, despite increases in online participation. That is a good thing.


That indicates that the cybersafety messages underpinning programs such ACMA's Cybersmart program are getting through to the people they are intended to help. The ACMA's research also indicates that eight to 11-year-olds use more than two devices to access the internet.    While computers are still the main point of access, a quarter have gone online using a mobile phone and half have accessed the internet using another kind of mobile device, such as a tablet or gaming device. Thirty five per cent of eight- to 11-year-olds have their own mobile phone, rising to 94 per cent of 16- to 17-year-olds. Recent research by Pew has indicated that young Americans are essentially now plugged in for every moment that they are not sleeping or in school. 


Industry and organisations are coming together to address issues of cyberbullying and cybersafety. Organisations like McAfee are engaging in research, education and awareness raising. McAfee's research which Minister Conroy launched on 21 May 2013 was released as part of the 2013 National Cybersecurity Awareness Week which was 20 to 24 May. The research tells us that education needs to start early. On average young people are using many more internet enabled devices. The McAfee research tells us that one in five tweens have chatted to a stranger online and six per cent of teens have met up with a stranger. That is a statistic that would cause great fear for many Australian parents.


Professor Donna Cross of Edith Cowan University has completed a landmark study on cyberbullying commissioned by the government. She reports that children who had been bullied are much more likely to suffer depression and anxiety. Professor Cross said:


We know that probably the most significant effects on children who've been bullied are effects in their mental health. They're much more likely to feel depressed, anxious, their self-esteem is affected. There are some students that report suicide ideation. It has very serious immediate effects and long-term effects.


Twenty thousand Australian school children were surveyed using a combination of anonymous questionnaires and interviews. According to that survey work, about 10 per cent of young people reported they were being cyberbullied. This government has done the research, we have recognised the problem, and we are acting on it. It is terrific to see the coalition now adopting similar policies in the fields of cybersafety and cyberbullying. 


To quote Dr Judith Slocombe, the chief executive of the Alannah and Madeline Foundation: 'There is no difference between someone who bullies online and one who bullies face-to-face. They are just using different methods. They both can cause enormous harm.' It is important we talk about those issues because online communications are developing rapidly. Rollout of Labor's National Broadband Network—fibre to the home for 93 per cent of Australians and ubiquitous broadband for the whole population—is happening fast. 


Last Friday I was in Gungahlin with Minister Conroy to see nearly 11,000 new Gungahlin homes switched on to the National Broadband Network. People in Amaroo, Ngunnawal, Palmerston and Mitchell now join the nearly 15,000 Canberrans in and around Gungahlin that are enjoying superfast broadband. By mid-2016, construction in the ACT will have commenced or be complete to 180,300 homes and businesses. Gungahlin is also leading the country with the sheer number of premises that are signing up to the National Broadband Network. In an area switched on only six months ago more than half the population has signed up for an NBN service. In another area that has only been switched on for three months take-up of the National Broadband Network is already 40 per cent. The myth that the opposition peddles that no-one wants the National Broadband Network is being disproved every single day in the ACT and all across Australia. 


Australians come up to me in my mobile office, my community forums and when I am doorknocking and they never ask me, 'Why are we getting fibre to the home?' The question they ask me is, 'When do I get fibre to the home?' Australians recognise the importance of fibre to the home and we recognise the importance of a cybersafety plan to make sure Australians are safe online.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2013-06-24,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (19:28):  I rise to speak this evening on the important private member's motion brought by the member for Forrest relating to cybersafety. Over the past seven years we have seen the emergence of the phenomenon of social networking. It is a progression in both technology and society that our culture is still grappling with. Technology has progressed too quickly for our laws and social customs to accommodate and much social interaction that occurs via these platforms continues to evolve in conjunction with social media. This technology has provided us with fantastic opportunities, both in terms of connecting with others socially and professionally as well as providing us with information. But as with any new technology, there will always be some challenges and drawback that need to be contended with. The challenge facing us is to do with safety online, particularly the safety of young people.


Last year the coalition established the Online Safety Working Group to investigate the extent of this challenge. The group spent many months meeting with parents, young people, internet service providers, social networking sites and other stakeholders to gain an accurate understanding of what the challenges for cybersafety are and how they may be overcome. Through these meetings, the coalition identified that a staggering 90 per cent of young people are utilising social networking sites, mostly without parental supervision and without an understanding of the risks involved. It was clear that public awareness of the nature of social media itself was low and the inherent dangers of social media were not being inoculated against for the protection of young people. It also became clear from the Online Safety Working Group's work that a coordinated community response would be the key to fuelling a better public awareness of the dangers involved for young people in the online environment. Sadly, instances of 'grooming' and other dangerous behaviours by online predators are becoming more and more frequent. Despite this frequency, young people remain generally oblivious to recognising threats and reporting them to either parents and carers or to teachers.


To make this matter more serious, many parents have a hands-off approach to supervision of their children on social media, which is brought about by a lack of information. Many parents report even being unaware of how many devices their children are actually connected to social media through. These days internet access is not confined to the PC. Mobile phones, iPods, iPads and gaming devices, to name but a few, are all devices that are used to connect to the internet and engage with social media. The number of social networking sites is proliferating exponentially. It is almost impossible for parents, carers and teachers to keep up with that. But, if parents are not aware of their children's engagement, they cannot educate them and protect them from threats online. This is why late last year the coalition released a discussion paper about how we can protect our young people while they are online. The coalition recommended first that there be better coordination between all authorities, particularly with companies providing products and services to young people. Aiding in this, the coalition has also proposed that a single point of contact exist to direct inquiries and complaints to relating to online safety. This single point of contact would effectively act as a children's e-safety commissioner.


Second, the coalition has proposed that methods and arrangements be developed and administered by an independent regulatory body to enable the more rapid removal of dangerous or nefarious content on social media. While we currently operate under a co-regulated scheme that is subject to take-down notices by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, it is suggested that this process be expanded to include social networking companies. This would address problems in a very timely way, particularly to do with cyberbullying behaviour, which can be paralysing for those young people who bear the brunt of this behaviour.


Third, the coalition is proposing to create national safety standard certification for online safety materials and to make certified materials readily available to parents and carers for education and support. Similar to recognisable certifications in other industries, this certification would be a highly recognisable icon that would be provided only to materials that meet guidelines.


It is important that parliamentarians and people who establish directions to ensure the safety of young people debate these measures, look for the solutions and work in concert with parents to ensure that 'grooming' and cyberbullying in subtle and, in some instances, cowardly ways do not affect those who innocently become engaged in a social media construct which brings much enjoyment but at the same time brings inherent risks. I thank the member for Forrest for bringing this motion forward.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-06-24,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (19:33):  While five minutes will not allow me to do the topic justice, I will make some brief comments on this motion on the very important issue of cybersafety. It is an issue that I have some understanding of, serving on the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety and having been involved with inquiries and reports over the last three years. The beauty of the inquiries was that they enabled me and the other members of the committee to hear from a wide cross-section of the community with respect to cybersafety and the risks associated with it. As the member for Hasluck quite properly pointed out, there are many benefits relating to the use of cybernetworks in today's modern age, and there is no question at all that they have changed our lives in many ways for the better.


But, having said that, there is also no question that the technology has become an aid for those who want to misuse the cybertechnology that is available to them. Over the years, and in particular in more recent years, we have seen a whole range of wrongdoers, from criminals who have now got to the point where they run sophisticated transnational operations across the world in order to carry out their criminal activities, to terrorist groups, to scammers and those who take the identity of someone, and then on to bullies and predators and the like. Bullies are an area which, if time permits, I want to come back to and talk about a little bit more in more detail.


I am aware also that there have been literally billions of dollars lost by people throughout the world, and perhaps even here in Australia, as a result of scammers and people who commit what is referred to as identity theft of people by being able to access their identity, their bank accounts and the like. In fact, from the evidence presented to the committee, it is clear that much of the money lost is never reported because those who lose the money feel too embarrassed to report it to the authorities. Not only am I aware from having spoken to and listened to experts giving evidence but also I am aware from my own personal discussions with the South Australian police department, and in particular the branch that handles the scamming that goes on, that this is indeed a serious problem which even our law enforcement agencies are grappling to come to terms with because much of it occurs from offshore, where they do not have the authority to act. Secondly, it comes from offshore from organisations which they find very, very difficult to track down in the first place.


I want to speak briefly to the issue of bullying, which I know is at the heart of this motion. Again, I have heard firsthand accounts from many, many young people not only in my own electorate but also across Australia who gave evidence to the committee in its previous inquiry which was related to the use of cybertechnology amongst young people. There is no doubt in my mind at all that it has become a major community social problem, because young people are being bullied, literally on a daily basis, through the use of the internet and those kinds of forums. Many of those young people do not ever talk about it to anybody, do not report it to their teachers or their parents and just live with it—sadly, to the point where we know of documented cases where it has driven those young people to commit suicide. That is the worst possible outcome that can occur. I might say in respect of all of this that it has also been my experience that our schools, our police departments and many other authorities are doing some very good work to try and educate people, in particular young people, into reporting any cyberbullying that takes place.


The one issue that I want to touch very briefly on is the issue of predators who use the internet not only to stalk people but also to develop potential friendships. There is the famous case in South Australia of Carly Ryan, who in 2007 was murdered. Carly's mum gave evidence to the committee, and I can well recall what she had to say about that. I congratulate Carly's mum for setting up the Carly Ryan Foundation in order to try and get the story out that there are risks associated with use of the internet. People need to take precautions. In particular, parents need to try and ensure that their kids well understand those risks so that they too do not end up being a victim of cyberbullying or crime.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (19:38):  Could I just say how much I agree with the previous speaker, the member for Makin, on how serious an issue this issue is. Five minutes does not really give you enough time to address it. It is a very important debate, and I congratulate the member for Forrest for having the initiative, the energy and the get up to put this on the Notice Paper and put it before us today, because it is a very important discussion. As we have heard from previous speakers, including my good friend and colleague the member for Hasluck, it is an issue that is well worth us debating because, especially when it comes to people who use very devious means through the cybernetwork to groom, it is a very dangerous thing. With more and more children today spending more and more time on their computers looking at social media sites, it is important that we do what we can to ensure that our children are as safe as possible. I think that goes to the heart of what the member for Forrest is trying to do in bringing this private member's bill forward. At any stage where our children are vulnerable to people who have extremely dangerous motives we need to be doing what we can to make sure that they are protected. That is what the member for Forrest is looking to do here. 


Whether we like it or not as a community social networking is here to stay. It is very much becoming part of our children's lives. One only has to look at our political life—we are seeing much more Facebook, Twitter, webpages. They are all being used to get across political messages and being used as campaigning tools. If we are doing it, then of course younger generations are going to do exactly the same thing and they are going to use these networks more and more. We have to be aware of that and we have to understand that this is new technology which presents new dangers. We are seeing instances where bullying is going on and where severe peer group pressure is being put on people, especially young children. Young students are feeling very isolated, very sensitive and are feeling they are being bullied in a similar way to the way bullying occurred in the school yard. All of us who went through school have seen bullying occur in one form or another. It is not nice; it is not pleasant. At least when it is being done physically there is the opportunity for people to see, be aware and step in and influence, whereas one of the real dangers of cyberbullying is that it can remain hidden and it is extremely difficult for people to see or understand what is going on and to be able to intervene. One of the really insidious things about cyberbullying is that it can occur over a long period of time and it is very hard to detect.


The member for Forrest has done us all a favour by putting this bill on private member's business. I commend previous speakers, including the member for Hasluck, who did such an excellent job with his five-minute speech. This is an issue that will continue to be discussed and to be dealt with in a careful way.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (19:44):  I thank the member for Wannon for showing support for his colleague the member for Forrest. The issues of cybersafety and cybercrime are very important issues. When we come to this issue there is a very broad range of behaviours that we are talking about online. The internet has opened up worlds that we never dreamt of. It helps business with the convenience of banking online and to do massive transactions and connect with the rest of the world. For households and for young people, as the member for Wannon illustrated, it is about keeping in touch. A lot of young people do not have the conventional mobile phone. Instead, they contact people through Twitter, Facebook and a whole lot of other apps that I am not even aware of. When it comes to households and families, there is education that is done online and there are health services that are now directly provided online. There are a whole range of important services and activities for people online. However, with this opening up of a world online, there are dangers, and those dangers are presented to businesses, families and children. 


I was very pleased that in the 42nd Parliament I had the privilege to serve on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications when the committee did the 'Hackers, fraudsters and botnets' inquiry. That, for me, was a huge eye-opener in terms of some of the crime that can be conducted on the internet. I know we all laugh sometimes about the emails, usually originating from Nigeria and a range of other places, that try and convince you to donate money, saying that you have either won or inherited money. For a lot of people that are familiar with the internet, these are able to be laughed off and deleted. But these are getting more sophisticated and people are falling for them, especially people that are not familiar with the internet. I have heard numerous stories in which people have been caught out by these scams and have put over large amounts of money, so it is important that we continue to work to educate the community on these scams. 


I am very pleased that information and advice through a free alert service that the government has provided can alert people, if they sign up to it through the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's SCAMwatch, to some of those scams. I want to send an important message out to people. I know people feel a bit embarrassed if they get caught in these scams, but please do report it, because this provides the Australian Federal Police with important information to detect and hunt down some of these people, which can be quite difficult. 


Of course, cybersafety also affects governments and countries, and we always have to be vigilant to ensure that our country and our government are up with the latest technology from other countries around the world. That is really important and we have to take that security very seriously. We also have to take the security of our individual computers very seriously. We need to recognise that it is a collective responsibility to keep our computers and ourselves safe. It is a responsibility of everyone that uses the internet, so I would encourage families and individuals to make sure that they keep up to date with their virus protection—that is very important. I am also pleased that many of the ISPs have come on board and are working with the government and the community to identify cyberthreats and to have a look at some of these important safety issues. 


That, I guess, is the more criminal aspect. There is also the other very serious aspect that affects our young people, which is cyberbullying. This is a really difficult thing, because young people who are bullied at a cyber level can never escape it. It is with you in your phone when you go to bed; it is on your computer; it is at school—you can never escape it. So cyberbullying is a really important issue. I am so glad that last month 700 schools participated in National Cyber Security Awareness Week. It is important to make sure that we are getting this into discussion. I commend this motion to the House.

Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (19:49):  This is a very important issue. The question of cybersafety and cyberbullying is something which confronts young people and older people in our society today in a way that it never has before.


I do not pretend to be particularly literate when it comes to the issue of computers or the nature of the new technologies that are being rolled out. What I can say, though, is that over the last few years this has produced for parents a whole range of issues with respect to ensuring that our children—and I have three daughters—are protected. It is a difficult issue because often you do not know what they are looking at on the internet. You can talk to them about what they should look at, and you can talk to them about how they should react and interact with their friends and others while using this technology but, frankly, you often just do not know. 


I am sure that I join with other members in saying that, when we hear stories about what has happened to particularly young people who have been involved in incidents of cyberbullying, the sorts of things that they have been confronted with are often from a school point of view but, in their view, they have been exposed to all the world, and this is a particularly daunting and intimidating experience for them. This is why governments of all persuasions need to consider this issue very seriously. This is why we as a parliament need to be vigilant in ensuring that these issues are at the very forefront of how we approach legislation and regulation with respect to new technologies into the future. 


I am proud to say that, in 2008, this government committed some $125.8 million towards a range of cybersafety programs to inform and educate young people as part of our Cybersafety plan and that, since then, we have continued to invest in cybersafety activities. It is something that needs to be rolled out on a continuing basis, and it is something that we need to make sure that we are aware of into the future. As the Chief Executive Officer of the Alannah and Madeline Foundation, Dr Judith Slocombe, has a repeatedly said: 


There is no difference between someone who bullies online and one who bullies face-to-face. They are just using different methods. They both can cause enormous harm.


I would go even further and say that, when you bully someone via the internet, you ensure that the person being bullied believes that you are exposing the bullying, the intimidation, to many more people than them. In this process, for the young person who is being bullied, their fear of what they are being exposed to, or what their reputation is being exposed to, can be made all the greater. 


I am also pleased that Dr Michael Carr-Gregg, one of Australia's highest profile psychologists, has supported our government's initiatives to tackle cyberbullying and promote cybersafety. As I mentioned, some $125.8 million was committed through the Cybersafety plan. It is a comprehensive plan to combat online risk to children and to help parents protect children from inappropriate material and contacts while they are online. The range of measures that are part of this plan deal with the many different problems relating to online activity. They include things such as the government's Cybersafety plan and the provision of funding for the expansion of the Australian Federal Police Child Protection Operations team to detect and investigate online child sex exploitation, including funding for 91 additional AFP officers. This measure has resulted in a total of 316 offenders being arrested and summonsed for 840 child sex offence charges since mid-2009. Funding has been provided to increase the capacity of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure that prosecutions are handled quickly. In addition, funding has also been provided for education and awareness raising resources through the ThinkUKnow program to assist parents and children in dealing with the risk posed by online predators. This, if you like, is the most serious end of what can occur in cyberspace. Obviously, it has particularly serious ramifications for the families and children involved. 


The point I would make in a broader context concerns the way in which particularly children relate to each other and react to each other on the internet. This can have far-reaching implications for the individuals involved, for their family and for their friends. I would urge all who think they might react in a poor manner, in a brutal manner or in an aggressive manner on the internet to think again. The fact is that the implications for actions such as these are serious and ongoing and for families they can be terrible.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (20:57):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I am conscious that I have all of 90 seconds so I will do my best to repeat what was said last week. I thank the seconder for supporting debate on this motion to progress and, hopefully, the two major parties can support the substance of these changes. Fundamentally, they are to provide the powers to the ACCC that the consumers, in my view, already think they have to look at the total effect of decisions of major retailers on supply chains and other markets. 


Under current legislation, the ACCC can only look at negotiations between large supermarkets and large processors and there is equity in the bargaining power between those two. Sure, the consumer wins in the long term but without knowing the full supply chain there is a question mark around the long-term impacts of the public benefit on consumers. 


The other changes are about transparency, firstly, to provide power to the ACCC to seek documents from their source, not from the end parties. The small farmers who rightly or wrongly tell stories of fear do not want to produce documents in case they are frozen out of the 80 per cent of the market and the very fact that section 46—abuse of market power—is not used by the courts as much as it should be is evidence that there is concern about abuse of market power by the very act of silence within the market. The second point is to try and have a positive influence on behaviour at the outset by creation of the supply chain impact statement. If retailers know they may be compelled to make public statements about what they thought their decision would do to a supply chain, they may place more weight on this as a factor in decision making and give more direction and education in the community if there are no problems over those supply chains.

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2013-06-24,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (21:00):  The unstable and dysfunctional nature of the current Labor government has driven many people to despair over the state of the Australian parliament. Many people in my electorate of Flynn have simply switched off and are disgusted with what has transpired since 2007. I stand before the chamber today to send a clear message to the communities of Central Queensland. We do not have to tolerate the divisions and failure of Labor. There is a better way. I am determined to bring about the restoration of trust and integrity of government, hope for a better and more secure future and reward for hard work and the risk that many of us take from our day-to-day business to provide for our families and loved ones.


I would like to talk about mobile communication in my vast electorate of Flynn, which is over 130,000 square kilometres. Two devastating floods in three years have shown us that our communication network in Flynn is simply not good enough. Prior to 2007, there was a policy which saw a partnership between industry, community and government working together to provide better mobile communications in our regional communities. Since then we have seen the program halted. Mobile communications are vital to small towns and regional communities, but often the size of the population is not sufficient to warrant investment from private enterprise alone. It is something like $850,000 to build one mobile tower. I therefore want to see these partnerships restored and will work to that end to see this important issue resolved.


The coalition, like the government, has an NBN plan. I believe the coalition's NBN policy is the key to seeing regional communities receive the affordable, faster, reliable internet connection they deserve. At the moment many of my towns are not even on the radar for getting NBN, whereas our policy states quite clearly that everyone in Australia will have our brand of NBN in place by 2016. It will consist of a combination of fibre to the premises, fibre to the node, wireless and satellite. They will have to be judged on their merits at the time of installation, whether the town has a thousand or a hundred connections. It will be done by 2016. We will ensure that businesses and households of Flynn get access to fast broadband at the speed of 25 megabits per second, which is five or six times faster than what we have at the moment. Regional areas with substandard internet services must be given priority in the rollout. Building the coalition's broadband network will cost about two-thirds of Labor's network. That means a less expensive NBN for regional consumers, who will save about $300 a year. We will ensure prices are kept affordable by requiring NBN Co. to set a wholesale price cap for NBN services across Australia. 


Mineral resources is a very lively topic at the moment, as we see coal companies in my area under enormous pressure partly due to the world commodity prices, especially those of China, but also Japan, Korea and to a lesser extent India. The carbon tax represents a huge impost on all Australians and it has hit our alumina and aluminium industries in Gladstone in a big way. It also has impacted on the cement industry. We will scrap the carbon tax and the MRRT and hopefully we can save these industries from extinction. The MRRT has generated next to no income for this government. It was badly designed and has only served as a disincentive for new investment in Australia. At the moment, we are seeing about $100 billion worth of projects put on hold or actually abandoned altogether. Our resources sector is vital to our local, regional and national economy. Investment has stalled in Australia, and in Flynn we are feeling the effects firsthand.


I support the streamlining of the EIS process to allow for more a efficient approval process while still ensuring that the protection of our environmental assets like the Great Barrier Reef is at the forefront. I state again that I do not believe that industrial development and the preservation of environmental assets in our region should be mutually exclusive goals. I do not believe we need to resign the towns of Emerald and Gladstone to the boom-and-bust cycle of the past. As a federal member, I am working hard to see sustainable growth for these communities.


We have to grow our agricultural sector to meet the needs of a world population expected to hit nine billion by the year 2030. Australia supplies food and fibre to over 60 million people, and that number is growing every year. Australia's agricultural future must be clearly planned if we are to double production in the next 10 years. So far the current government has presided over poor awareness. There is a lack of investment in R&D, poor incentives for private investment and ad hoc policy decisions on live cattle exports et cetera.


We must maintain Australia's biosecurity, reduce red tape, bring together state and federal regulations, ensure fair competition and trade agreements and develop better livestock management practices and science based animal welfare standards. We must improve labour solutions. We have uncompetitive wages in agriculture and we must upskill our workforce. We must encourage more people to join the agricultural workforce and there must be flexible working arrangements for those workers. Land and water agreements need to be put in place quickly. Better environmental, drought and flood management strategies need to be put in place, not the debacle we have seen in the Murray-Darling up to this stage, where no-one seems to be very happy.


There has been a lot of red tape created. Since 2007, Labor has introduced over 22,000 new rules and regulations for businesses and has repealed fewer than 200. This represents a broken election promise. Labor promised there would be a 'one in, one out' policy, but this has never happened. There are 22,000 extra regulations on small business. It is a very onerous task indeed for small business to have the time to decipher what the new policy is and to put it into action. Since February 2012, the coalition's deregulation task force has been travelling Australia, meeting with small businesses and taking submissions on how to reduce the impost of red tape and excessive regulation. To address this issue, we will cut $1 billion worth of red tape from small businesses year on year to allow them to grow and expand without excessive government regulation.


In conclusion, I highlight the fact that Flynn is one of the most diverse and influential electorates in Australia. Nowhere else do you have such a mix of industry and environmental treasures that are the envy of the nation. For nearly six years we have suffered the effects of a bad government. Enough is enough. I have a plan and a vision for Flynn, as does the coalition, and, if we are lucky enough to be given the opportunity to govern in September, I will relish the chance to restore hope, reward and opportunity in Central Queensland.

Mr Albanese:
  The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:


(a) NBN Co's website indicates it will require approximately 2300 sites to roll out the NBN fixed wireless network. NBN Co will aim to use existing towers where feasible. The number of new towers required for the rollout will be dependent on the number of existing towers NBN Co is able to utilise feasibly.


(b) It should be noted that the failed OPEL contract introduced by the Howard Government involved the construction of 1361 wireless broadband towers across Australia.


(c) NBN Co has indicated publicly that it plans to complete the rollout of the fixed wireless network by 2015. The timetable for the construction of new towers is dependent on the identification and acquisition of appropriate sites, and the receipt of any required planning approval from state, territory or local government authorities. Consequently, a detailed building program cannot be provided at this time.
