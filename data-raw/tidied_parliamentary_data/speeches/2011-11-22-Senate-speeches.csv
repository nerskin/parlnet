Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:01):  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Senator Wong. I refer to the minister's statement yesterday that it is 'wrong to assert that Treasury modelling of the government's plan depends on the United States putting a price on carbon by 2016'. I also refer to page 111 of the government's carbon tax modelling, which states:


The modelling assumes comparable carbon pricing in other major economies from 2015-16 …


How does the minister reconcile her statement yesterday with this statement from the government's own carbon tax modelling?

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:04):  Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given President Obama's statement that the US will not introduce a carbon tax, nor even take part in an emissions reduction treaty unless China and India are included, and given that the Canadians have rejected any form of carbon pricing and that Japan and Russia will not take part in the second round of the Kyoto protocol, isn't it a fact that the assumptions in the government's carbon tax modelling are now totally discredited?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:02):  I am pleased to take yet another question on modelling on a bill that has already passed the chamber. I would refer the senator to—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  When they have finished, Mr President, I am very happy to answer the question.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You're so precious, Penny!




Senator WONG:
  Yes. My mother always told me that—very precious.


I refer the senator to page 32, table 3.1, which sets out the assumptions in the international global action scenario. It refers to the fact that the assumption is:


… from 2013 to 2015 uncoordinated global action, no trade in permits, differentiated carbon prices. From 2016 onwards, countries trade, either bilaterally or through a central market.


That is a very different thing to the assertion that the opposition is making that the modelling assumes an explicit carbon price through an emissions trading scheme in place in the United States.


I also refer to the Prime Minister's answer yesterday which made it very clear—and I think my answer reflected this—that there are—



Opposition senators interjecting—




The PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Wong, continue.




Senator WONG:
  The Treasury modelling makes two key assumptions about international action. The first is that countries meet their low-end pollution reduction targets for 2020. That is, in the context of Australia, the same bipartisan commitment to which the opposition has already committed. The second is that countries have access to international abatement. Treasury officials have indicated to Senator Cormann and others that the assumption is low-end pledges— (Time expired)

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:05):  The answer to the second part of the question is no. On the answer to the first part of the question, I refer the senator to President Obama's press conference on 16 November, where he stated:


… we can meet the commitments we made in Copenhagen and Cancun.


The point is: we assumed in the modelling that countries would do precisely what the President has said the United States will do. We have assumed precisely what the President has said the United States will do. If the opposition are asserting that this is a question about explicit or implicit carbon prices, I would make this point: if you say direct action imposes a carbon price then you impose a carbon price. Your policy does too. What we are saying is that we assume the United States will do what they said. (Time expired)

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:06):  Yet again Senator Abetz asks me a question which makes a false assertion. Implicit in his question very clearly is that the United States will not meet the pledges it made. That is the implicit proposition in his question, because the assumption that the government is making in its modelling—as Treasury has explained to senators on the other side—is that the United States and other major economies will meet the commitments they made at Copenhagen and Cancun. Surprise, surprise! What did President Obama say on this issue when he visited Australia? He said that the United States would meet the pledges it made at Copenhagen and Cancun. So yet again we have those on the other side asking questions which assume nonfacts. What they cannot abide is not only that the legislation has already passed the Senate—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, on a point of order: my point of order does not go to direct relevance. It goes to standing order 73(4). Very frequently in the last year or so this minister has been in breach of the prohibition not to debate the question in answering it. The standing orders say:


(4)      In answering a question, a senator shall not debate it.




The PRESIDENT:
  Order! On my right, I need silence. Senator Brandis is entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator Brandis:
  We accept that, in challenging assumptions that a question makes, a minister may be relevant and within the prohibition of that standing order. But this minister has gone beyond challenging the assumptions and is explicitly debating the question, and I ask you to bring her to order.




Senator Conroy:
  Mr President, on the point of order: that is truly one of the most absurd claims that Senator Brandis has made. They constantly interject. Their questions are constantly broad and they try to define themselves when they take their points of order. They constantly change the goalposts because they just cannot get their act together on their taxes committee. This is a spurious point of order and I urge you to reject it, Mr President.




The PRESIDENT:
  There is no point of order. I am listening to the minister's answer and I draw the minister's attention to the question and the fact that there are seven seconds now remaining.




Senator WONG:
  As I said, the question contained an assumption which was incorrect. It is a pity that the coalition do not like that being pointed out to them. (Time expired)

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:32):  I thank the senator for his question and the opportunity to speak about the importance of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax, a policy which is all about ensuring all Australians share in the benefits of the mining boom, a policy to fund a reduction in tax for small business and a boost to superannuation for working Australians and investment in infrastructure. This, as I have previously said, demonstrates the difference between this side of the chamber and those opposite. We want less tax on small business and more superannuation for workers; they want less tax for mining companies and higher profits for the big mining companies. And what is really interesting is that as each day goes on, as each day passes, more and more opposition members are starting to understand the ridiculous position that Mr Abbott has put the opposition in. In fact, one MP has told the West Australian it was 'insane' to hand back free money that was willingly being paid by the biggest miners. So there is a growing number of opposition members who understand that it is insane for the opposition to be seriously suggesting that they want to go to the next election telling small business, 'We are the coalition and we stand for higher taxes. We are the coalition and we stand for lower superannuation. We are the coalition and we stand for less tax on miners.' That is the ludicrous position that the opposition have got themselves into. And now what we are seeing day by day are backgroundings for the papers—

This is an opposition led by a man who simply wants to make spending promises. He talks about being fiscally responsible, but all evidence points the other way—which is why we are increasingly seeing members of the opposition being prepared to speak to newspapers about the ridiculous and insane position that the coalition has got itself into.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  Pursuant to standing order 74(5) I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister Conroy, for an explanation as to why answers have not yet been provided to question on notice 1282. It has been just over 30 days since I asked this question. I recognise that it is only a couple of days overdue, so I am not critical because I realise some of these things sometimes come in a few days late. I want to put very firmly on the record that this question pertains to matters that are urgently relevant and time sensitive and will not wait until 2012. 


The consular and legal rights of an Australian citizen, the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, Mr Julian Assange, are the focus of my questions. It is the responsibility of this government to insist on fair and due process and the rule of law if he is extradited to Sweden to face charges there. But what is of very grave concern to me and what is of grave concern to many people around the world is the potential that he will then be rendered from Sweden to the United States, where he has broken no law. 




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senator Ludlam, you are entitled to ask a question, and it is a very detailed question. Would you like the minister to respond?

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer.


I do not intend to speak at great length, because I recognise that other senators are waiting their turn. Mr Assange was recognised as a journalist by the High Court of the UK. As a journalist and, through WikiLeaks, as a publisher, he has broken no law, just as the people who put his material on the front page of the Age and the New York Times have broken no law. My question, to which the answer is now just slightly overdue, seeks to clarify what our government has done and what our government is prepared to do to ensure that he is not subject to rendition to the United States, where, as we know, his life is under threat. There has been speculation that Mr Assange would be extradited to the United States from Sweden, but extradition requests, as we know, come with safeguards. We are much more concerned that, under a bilateral agreement between Sweden and the US, he could be transferred without any due process at all—a form of soft rendition known as temporary surrender. What happens once he gets there? 


US Republicans Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee have called for him to be executed. Palin has said he should be hunted down like al-Qaeda. Vice President Joe Biden has said that he is a high-tech terrorist and that, 'We should treat Mr Assange the same as other high-value terrorist targets.' 'Kill him,' writes conservative columnist Jeffrey T Kuhner in the Washington Times. William Kristol, former Chief of Staff to Vice President Dan Quayle, has asked:


Why can't we use our various assets to harass, snatch or neutralise Julian Assange and his collaborators, wherever they are?


'Why isn't Julian Assange dead?' writes prominent US pundit Jonah Goldberg. Last week, when the President addressed this place, he spoke beautifully of 'the rule of law, transparent institutions and the equal administration of justice', and we would like to see these values upheld. Mr Assange's life is in danger in the US but so too are the First Amendment principles upheld in the Pentagon Papers case. Unlike the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, who are both lawyers, Mr Rudd recognised the principle—




Senator Brandis:
  You don't seem so interested in Bradley Manning, Senator.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I am glad to raise that, Senator Brandis. Mr Rudd recognised the principle of 'innocent before proven guilty' when these matters arose. He stated quite clearly that he had a responsibility, as foreign minister, for Mr Assange's legal and consular rights. My questions have requested the foreign minister to make clear exactly what he has done, and I strongly believe it is in the interests of this parliament and the Australian people to know that our foreign minister is not only aware of the matter but taking direct action to prevent Mr Assange's rendition to the US.


My final message is to Australian newspaper editors, television and radio directors and online media editors in the press gallery and around the country, if you are listening. I congratulate you on the open letter from the Walkley Foundation that many of you and your colleagues signed last December. Now we need your voices again. The UK High Court has recognised Mr Assange is a journalist and Wikileaks is a publishing organisation. It is not, therefore, just the Wikileaks organisation that is under attack; it is all of us. At that time you said:


In essence, Wikileaks, an organisation that aims to expose official secrets, is doing what the media have always done: bringing to light material that governments would prefer to keep secret.


You also said:


...  as editors and news directors of major media organisations, we believe the reaction of the US and Australian governments to date has been deeply troubling.


It is with a sense of great urgency that I call on the foreign minister to make absolutely clear what he is doing to prevent the rendition of this Australian citizen to the United States. I thank the Senate for its time.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:09):  I have additional information to a response I provided yester­day to Senator Hanson-Young and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The 
answer
 read as follows—





Senator Hanson-Young's initial question



In the UK the practice of using X-rays to determine the ages of children for criminal proceedings is unlawful and indeed can lead to practitioners facing criminal charges of assault and professional misconduct. I refer to a letter available publicly that has been sent to the Minister for Immigration and the Minister for Home Affairs from peak medical bodies, including the Royal Australian College of Physicians, the Australian Paediatric Endocrine Group, the Australian and New Zealand Society for Paediatric Radiology and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists. It is dated 19 August. In this letter, which refers to the assessment of ages of asylum seekers and people facing people smuggling charges, the doctors refer to X-rays of teeth and wrists as unethical, unreliable and untrustworthy. When will the Minister take on notice these issues raised by these individuals and when will the Minister—(Time expired)




Response:



I am advised that such a letter was sent to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on 19 August 2011.


The letter was subsequently provided to the Attorney-General's Department and the Attorney-General responded on 18 October 2011.


The Attorney-General's response highlighted that:


Minors are only prosecuted with people smuggling offences on the basis of the significant involvement in people smuggling venture or multiple ventures 


There is considerable incentive for people smuggling crew to falsely claim to be minors as the mandatory minimum penalties these offence attract do not apply to minors.


At present there is no single procedure that can accurately assess chronological age with absolute certainty.


Wrist X-rays are a prescribed procedure for determining age under the Crimes Act 1914.


A representative of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists gave evidence in support of the use of wrist X-rays before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee when it considered the Crimes Amendment (Age Determination) Bill 2001.


The Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) rely on a number of sources of evidence to determine age, including wrist X-rays, voluntary dental X-rays and verified documentation.


The Government has received advice that there is consensus among a significant group of forensic anthropologists and odontologists, including the Australian Society of Forensic Odontology, that tooth development is a suitable measure for determining the age of people aged up to 20 years.


X-ray analysis is not treated as conclusive proof of age and is only used to assist the court in making age determinations.


The AFP and CDPP consider all available evidence when deciding whether to contest a defendant's claims to age, and give them the benefit of the doubt where there is uncertainty.




Senator Hanson-Young's supplementary questions



As the Government is defying the international scientific consensus on how dangerous it is to rely on these types of X-rays, the organisations listed in the previous question are refusing to participate in any type of X-rays for the Government. Is it the case that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is relying primarily on one expert advice provided by Dr Vincent Low, who is indeed not a bone radiologist at all?


As I outlined earlier, in the UK the practice of this method is unlawful. Here in Australia, medical practitioners are refusing to conduct these examinations for the Government. Indeed, who is conducting these examinations for the Government? If it is only Dr Low, please explain why he is not, in fact, a bone radiologist and an expert in that field.




Response:



I am advised that it would not be appropriate to comment on the evidence led or qualifications of experts used by the AFP and CDPP in specific  people prosecutions. The conduct of criminal cases is a matter for the AFP and CDPP.


However, the CDPP ensures that witnesses it calls to provide expert evidence are appropriately qualified. Expert evidence is open for scrutiny by the court and defence.


The UK Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has previously stated that it is appropriate to use wrist X-rays to determine age where requested by an asylum seeker.


The Therapeutic Goods Administration has certified that the use of wrist X-rays for age determination is an appropriate use of a therapeutic procedure.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:09):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and Senator Birmingham today relating to the carbon tax.


When President Obama left our shores last Thursday afternoon, not only did he leave behind him the legacy of an enhanced ANZUS relationship and the announcement of a military presence by American Marines in Darwin; he also left a legacy much more consequential to our immediate domestic politics. He blew the carbon tax out of the water. He did that by telling journalists at his press conference the previous afternoon that there was no way that the United States of America would have a carbon price or a carbon tax by 2016 or indeed in the foreseeable future. In making that announcement he destroyed the assumptions upon which the modelling for the Gillard government's carbon tax depends.


Both Senator Abetz and Senator Birmingham, in their questions to Senator Wong today, identified those aspects of the modelling which depend upon the assumption of there being a global carbon market in which the United States and other major Western economies—and, in the case of Senator Birmingham's question, the OPEC nations as well—will participate. That is a foundational assumption of the modelling upon which the carbon tax depends. It is therefore a foundational assumption for the projections of the cost to Australians of the carbon tax. It is a foundational assumption for the assessment of the compensation to households which the government says it is going to pay through the tax and transfer system.


We only have to look at the document which Senator Abetz read—that is, the incomplete, redacted but nevertheless extensive document which sets out part of the modelling upon which the carbon tax depends—to see that what Senator Abetz asserted in his question and what Senator Birmingham asserted in his question was absolutely true. If one reads from pages 31 and 32 of this lengthy Treasury document, one sees that the modelling is said to depend upon the assumption that, among other things, the signatories to the climate change framework convention at Cancun, now 89 of them, will reduce their emissions at the low end of their 2020 pledges. If you look at table 3.1, which underlies that text and sets out a summary of international global action scenario assumptions, the mechanism is described as follows:


… from 2013 to 2015 uncoordinated global action, no trade in permits, differentiated carbon prices. From 2016 onwards, countries trade, either bilaterally or through a central market.


So the existence of an international carbon market—which one also sees from the table that appears on that page of the document that the United States and China and India and Japan and Canada are participants in—is, as I said earlier, the foundational assumption of this analysis. But we know that it will not happen. President Obama has told us that it will not happen in the case of the United States. Mr Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada, has told us that it will not happen in Canada. There is no reason to believe that it will happen in China. In fact, the foreign minister, Mr Rudd, who at the time of the Copenhagen climate change convention was the Prime Minister, accused the Chinese of sabotaging that climate change convention.




Senator Cormann:
  He used some very colourful language.




Senator BRANDIS:
  He used a very colourful word, Senator Cormann, which I will not embarrass you by repeating. There is no reason to believe that Japan will participate. There is no reason to believe that Russia will participate—in fact President Putin has made it clear that they will not. But this is the first time that, on Australian soil, Mr Obama has said the United States will not participate. This lengthy study depends upon assumptions which have been falsified. (Time expired)

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (15:14):  I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the answer given by Minister Wong on the government's clean energy future package. During the debate in this place on the clean energy future package, which I am proud to say passed resoundingly a few weeks ago, we have heard from many government senators highlighting our plan to tackle climate change. Even today at lunch we heard from Crown Prince Frederik on how we need a framework to lower the world's dependence on fossil fuels. 


Labor has a plan and one part of that plan is significant assistance to the food processing, metal forging and foundry industries to help with the impact of the carbon price. As the world moves to reduce carbon pollution, improving energy efficiency and reducing pollution will help Australian businesses gain a competitive advantage. Many businesses have already started reducing their carbon pollution, but many have been waiting for greater certainty about the competitive landscape before taking more ambitious steps. The government's plan for a clean energy future will create that certainty. 


Under the government's Clean Energy Plan, the carbon pricing mechanism will establish a clear price path into the future for carbon pollution. Just as businesses currently take account of the likely future costs of labour, transport and materials when making their decisions, they will now factor in the cost of carbon pollution when weighing up alternative investment decisions. Greater certainty about carbon pricing will lower business and financial risk. This in turn will make it easier for the corporate sector to give the green light to key business decisions for a clean energy future such as whether to spend funds on cleaning up production facilities, improving energy efficiency or adopting new low-pollution technologies. 


Through the Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program, the government will provide grants worth up to $150 million over six years to the food processing industry and up to $50 million over six years to the metal forging and foundry industries. These grants will assist the industries to invest in energy efficient equipment and low-pollution technologies, processes and products. 


I would like to highlight a grant to a potato processing plant in Tasmania which will assist that company to upgrade its coal-powered boilers to natural gas. This 2010 election commitment which the Gillard Labor government has delivered upon is an example of what is possible under this food and foundries investment program. The funding from the federal and state Labor governments of $3 million and $1 million respectively, together with the investment from that company of $17 million, will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 39,000 tonnes a year—the equivalent of taking 8,000 cars off the road—and support hundreds of permanent and seasonal jobs across the north-west coast of Tasmania through cutting the energy bills of this large employer in my region. Farmers, farm contractors and service providers whose jobs and businesses depend on this company's operations will benefit from this upgrade at the plant through greater certainty and lower costs for the factory. The funding will assist this company to replace its high-energy-intensive coal boilers and install gas-fired co-generation capacity at the potato processing plant, thereby removing the need to burn coal in the production of potato chips. While this grant was announced in the 2010 election campaign and is therefore not part of the food and foundries investment program, it is an example of what is possible through the clean energy future package for all businesses in this area. It is a clear example of how the Gillard Labor govern­ment will work with the high-power-intensive businesses in the food, metal forging and foundry industries to assist them to remain competitive through switching to low-pollution options by providing grants for energy efficient improvements. 


This government is committed to working with industry, committed to working with communities and committed to working with other countries to achieve a clean energy future for our world and future generations. We are committed to working through the challenges and providing support to Australians. Under our plan, the 500 biggest emitters will pay a price on carbon and the money raised will go to support households, to support jobs and to invest in renewable energy. Under the plan of those opposite, households will be slugged, investment certainty will be cast aside and subsidies will be provided to the big emitters. That is their plan until 2020. We all know that they have not the slightest idea what they will do after 2020. It is vital for Australia's prosperity that there is a clear plan for the transition to a clean energy future.

Senator ADAMS
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:20):  I rise this afternoon to take note of answers given by Minister Wong. Obviously the government is now out of excuses. Overnight we have seen that lack of support has put back any likelihood of an international carbon treaty before 2020. Instead of an agreement this year, we are now looking at eight years down the track for a carbon tax agreement. What this means is that the government's carbon tax modelling is in tatters, as my colleague Senator Brandis has described before me, the compensation is in tatters and the government is simply going to have to redo the modelling, even though they will not accept that there is anything wrong. 


It appears there is no plan B in the government's modelling. They have assumed the best of all possible worlds and each day, every day, the reality hits home. The carbon tax is collapsing, the modelling is collapsing and therefore the compensation is collapsing. The government must redo this modelling before parliament rises. The coalition is very strong on the need for us to come back next week to make sure we get the real figures out on compensation. But of course, because of the Durban conference, there is no way the government would even contemplate coming back next week. They do not want to be found out about where they have gone wrong. 


Ahead of the critical talks starting next week, most of the world's leading economies now privately admit that no new global climate agreement will be reached before 2016 at the earliest—and, even if it were negotiated by then, they would stipulate that it could not come into force until 2020. So where does it all go?


The UK, the European Union, Japan, the United States and other rich nations are all now united in opting to put off an agreement and the United Nations also appears to be accepting this.


Flaws in the Treasury modelling have been confirmed in articles by Henry Ergas in the Australian, which note that the Treasury is now basing its figures on hope rather than reality. Senator Wong in her answers today really did not help us to say that it was reality, not hope. The purchase of foreign carbon credits, of course, is crucial to the operation of the carbon tax. Australia's domestic emissions will continue to rise and will only be offset by the purchase of $3.5 billion in foreign carbon credits every year by 2020. This figure will blow out to $57 billion by 2050.


President Obama on his visit here reconfirmed that the United States will not have a cap-and-trade or carbon tax style system. He said:


In the United States, although we haven’t passed as you know, what we call a cap and trade system, an exchange, what we have done is for example taken steps to double fuel efficiency standards on cars which will have an enormous impact on removing carbon from the atmosphere.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator ADAMS:
  That is exactly right. Thank you, Senator Brandis. And of course Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird during his recent visit to Australia reiterated that Canada would not have a carbon tax and that it had been explicitly rejected at an election. Does that sound familiar? I think it does—from a Prime Minister who said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government that I lead.' At least Foreign Minister Baird has stuck with their promise, but unfortunately our Prime Minister has not, so consequently we are going to suffer—and suffer very, very hard. Then you have to look at the fact that Japan, Canada and Russia have said that they will not be in a second commitment period for the Kyoto commit­ment. So I do not know what is going to come from the Durban climate change con­ference, but I would think that it will be just the same result as we had with Copenhagen.


I was quite amused to hear that Crown Prince Frederik was going down to open the new Macarthur wind farm. Denmark have closed down a number of their wind farms. When they run out of power, guess where their baseload power comes from? It comes from Germany and it is nuclear power.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:25):  We are asked this afternoon to take note of answers given by the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I find this highly ironic, given that those opposite refuse to take note of the advice of 90 per cent of credible economists in this country when it comes to this very important issue, that those opposite refuse to take note of the advice of the overwhelming majority of climate scientists in this country when it comes to the issue of climate change and that they refuse to take note of the 37-odd inquiries conducted in the parliament and by governments on this important issue, one of those being an inquiry conducted under the auspices of the Howard government by Professor Shergold under the impetus of the former Prime Minister John Howard. Indeed, those opposite refuse to take note of the advice of former Prime Minister John Howard, who, in the lead-up to the 2007 election, advocated a market based mechanism.


Well, we do take note of that advice and we understand that as an economy, as a society, we need to take action to reduce climate change and the human induced impacts of carbon emissions from a baseline scenario in our economy. Indeed, we take note of the advice of those experts that the best way to do that for our economy, for our circumstances and for our energy mix is through a market based mechanism because that is the cheapest option for our economy, the cheapest option for households and the cheapest option for businesses. It allows them to make their own decisions about the manner in which they reduce their individual carbon footprint. It comprehends quite well the unique energy mix that we have in this country and the way that we generate electricity, most notably through cheap coal. It recognises that over time there will be a cost put on carbon emissions and that other fuel sources, most notably gas, will act as transitional fuels until we get to a scenario where we are generating more of our electricity through renewable sources.


Those opposite seek to take issue with and take note of the minister's answers in respect of the assumptions that have been made by Treasury in determining and putting together the modelling associated with the carbon price. I do not know how many times we need to explain this in this place and in other places: those assumptions are sound and those assumptions result in robust modelling. That has been the advice and the recommendation of other economists who have looked at the modelling.


Those two assumptions are simple. The first is that the 90-odd countries which have made international pledges through those commitments made at Cancun and Copenhagen to reduce their carbon emissions within their economies compared to a baseline scenario by 2020 will achieve them. They will be achieved. That is not an unreasonable assumption for anyone to make. Indeed, the United States have indicated that they will reduce their carbon emissions by 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. How they do that is up to them. It is up to them as a nation of people to make a decision in their congress about how they achieve that, but we here have taken the approach, based on the advice of experts, considering our energy mix, that a market based mechanism is the appropriate way for our economy to deal with this issue because it is the least-cost option. It is the one that bears the least on Australian businesses and Australian households.


The second assumption that has been made—another reasonable assumption—is that there will be an international carbon market in 2016, by the time our economy moves from a fixed price mechanism to a floating based mechanism. This is a market that is already in operation. Indeed, compan­ies in the United States, in China, in India and in the European Union can, if they choose to, buy permits and buy these mech­anisms on an international market. They are free to trade in these permits as we speak.


These are not unreasonable assumptions to make. They are sound, they are robust and they have been credited by independent economic experts. That is why our system will work and why it is the best mechanism. (Time expired)

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2011-11-22,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (15:30):  The game is up for the Labor Party. Its polling today is 30 per cent, down about two or three per cent, despite the fact that the Prime Minister has been in every photo shoot with every leader of every country in the world. The question has to be asked: why are the polls moving backwards when she has had such a particularly good week? I will tell you why, Mr Deputy President. It is because the Labor Party has not convinced the Aust­ralian public that a carbon tax is a good thing. That is why its polls are moving backwards.


Let us get to the nitty-gritty of this. By 2050 there will be a $1 trillion loss to GDP. By 2020 it will be about $33 billion according to Treasury and $133 billion according to the Centre for International Economics. But where is the modelling? The modelling has not been released. Yes, thousands of pages have been released, but for the GTEM and the MMRF model, the assumptions, the variables and the underlying databases have not been released. The modelling has not been released. Warwick McKibbin, Henry Ergas, Brian Fisher—they have all asked to see the modelling and it has not been forthcoming, despite the fact that Treasury officials have said that it is okay and that the modelling is out there. It is not out there.


During Senate estimates on Monday, 17 October, Phillip Glyde, the straight-shooting Executive Director of ABARES, said: 'You can't run the modelling. There's not enough information out there.' Senator Cormann asked if a third party could do it and Mr Glyde said, 'No, third parties couldn't do it as there's not enough information out there.' That is from the horse's mouth; that is from Phillip Glyde. He said, 'You cannot model the carbon tax with the information that's out there.' Then Treasury official Ms Quinn let the cat out of the bag, too. She said the most recent public release of the model code by ABARES was the model documentation in 2007. That is the last time that model was out, well before the carbon tax.


I do not blame the Labor Party for trying to hide this, because once that modelling gets out there—and the assumptions are based on everyone being there in 2016—it will blow its argument to pieces. It will smash it to smithereens. The Centre for International Economics tried to make assumptions on a model they did not have, and this is what came up: the government estimates the carbon tax will reduce GDP by $32 billion by 2020, while the CIE model shows GDP will decrease by $180 billion. The government estimates the carbon tax will reduce real wages by one per cent; the CIE estimates that real wages will fall by 19 per cent. The government estimates that the carbon tax will increase electricity by 10 per cent; the CIE estimates that electricity prices will increase by 30 per cent. The CIE modelling predicts average household earnings will fall by $11,360 while the government's modelling is $5,110. If the government had nothing to be frightened of it would release that modelling, but it is terrified to release it because those are the figures that are going to come out.


Between us, Senator Cormann and I have asked Senator Wong 25 or 30 times, and she has said, 'Yes, I'll take it on notice,' or 'You aren't worried what the model is; you're not going to vote for it.' We have had obfuscation, we have had every wriggle, every dive and every backfoot movement but the modelling has not been released. The government has lied to the community. It has put this economic burden around the neck of the community and it has not been modelled. Ergas has not been able to get it, McKibbin has not been able to get it and Fisher has not been able to get it. What is the government trying to do? Why is it trying to mislead Australia? Why isn't it being honest? This is the greatest lie ever perpetrated on Australia. The government will not release the modelling because it knows all the other assumptions are going to be much higher than what it is telling the people. (Time expired)

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:05):  Labor's mining tax is a bad tax from a bad government which came out of a bad process. When bad governments like the Gillard government do bad things badly, as with the mining tax, they inevitably go for the cover-up. They try and keep stuff-ups that they have done along the way secret, they try and cover up their actions and they try and cover up the impact of their actions because they are embarrassed. The government's actions and the outcome of its actions are there for all to see—the dog's breakfast which is the MRRT negotiated exclusively and in secret between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the three biggest mining companies in Australia while all of their competitors were excluded. People across Australia well understand that there is a lot this government is trying to cover up because it would not withstand public scrutiny. We should just pause for a moment to remind ourselves how this whole process started. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd commissioned the Henry tax review. The Henry tax review was supposed to be this once in a generation opportunity for root and branch reform of our tax system, to make our tax system simpler and fairer. Of course, what we have ended up with in this mining tax is a new multibillion dollar tax on an important industry for Australia which is manifestly more complex and less fair than the status quo. With any new tax, the things the parliament is interested in scrutinising and the things that people across Australia are interested to know are how much revenue it will raise and whether the revenue assumptions that the government has based its revenue estimates on are credible, whether they withstand scrutiny. Similarly, with any promises to spend money and any promises that are attached to the revenue from a particular tax, people across Australia and in the parliament want to know how much it will cost, whether the costs are legitimate, whether they are properly founded and whether the government has done its homework properly.


If the government comes up with a new tax, you would like to think that the budget overall will be in a better position than when you started. In relation to both the revenue that is to be collected from the mining tax and the cost of all of the promises that the government has attached to the mining tax revenue, this government has been ducking and weaving and avoiding public scrutiny. The Senate, through various committees and through orders of the Senate passed by this chamber, has asked the government to release the mining tax revenue assumptions—commodity price assumptions, production volume assumptions—to enable proper scrutiny of whether the revenue the government tells us is to be raised from the mining tax will eventuate. There are very serious question marks in relation to this.


We have to remind ourselves that this government negotiated this tax, this dodgy deal, with the three biggest mining companies, who are quite relaxed about it. People argue that the reason they are so relaxed about it is that they will not actually end up paying the tax. This is a deal that the Prime Minister negotiated exclusively and in secret, behind closed doors, without any direct involvement from Treasury, without any direct involvement from any official. It was a negotiation directly between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Resources and Energy and the managing directors of these big multinational companies. Rumour has it that the mining tax deal was typed on the BHP computer and that it was signed there and then by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Resources and Energy.


The government claimed at the time of the deal that it would raise $10.5 billion, and people were surprised. How come it will still raise $10.5 billion when the original resource super profits tax was supposed to raise $12 billion and the government has made many concessions? People were surprised that there was going to be what was on the face of it such a small fiscal impact, such a small impact on the budget bottom line. What this secretive and non-transparent Treasurer failed to fess up to at the time was that the government, behind closed doors, on the quiet, had made some significant changes to the underlying assumptions. They had made some significant changes to the commodity price assumptions, to the production volume assumptions and to about 100 other assumptions.


Are we allowed to know what these assumptions are? No, we are not. But what we do know is that, if the changes in those assumptions had been applied to the original resource super profits tax, rather than $12 billion it would have raised about $24 billion over the first two years. Out of the $10.5 billion from the MRRT over the first two years, $6 billion was based on changes in assumptions. The government says, 'We can't possibly give you those assumptions because those revenue assumptions are based on commercial-in-confidence data provided to us by the big three mining companies with whom we negotiated this tax.'


So not only are those big three mining companies allowed to design the tax but they are also the only ones allowed to know what the government's assumptions are. Here we have a government that negotiated a tax which helps those big three mining companies to further concentrate their market power, a tax which gives those three big companies an unfair competitive advantage and makes it harder for smaller local miners—those aspiring to be the BHPs and the Rios of tomorrow—to compete with the big three. But we are also told that the big three are the only ones allowed to know what the government's assumptions are. The parliament is not allowed to know. The people of Australia are not allowed to know. All of the competitors of those big three who were sitting in the closed room with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are not allowed to know.


This mining tax package is a serious fiscal train wreck in the making. The cost of all of the promises that Labor has attached to the mining tax will be higher than the revenue the MRRT is expected to raise from 2013-14 onwards. That is a situation that will become worse and worse, year in, year out. That is because right now we have record terms of trade. We have the best terms of trade in 140 years. We have high commodity prices. As we have high commodity prices, there will be a supply response around the world. Other suppliers of iron ore and coal will come onto the market and increase the supply, which is why Treasury expects that over time the revenue from the mining tax will trend down—and Treasury information released under FOI earlier this year about the revenue expectations shows this. It is a highly volatile revenue because it changes with the commodity price. It changes with fluctua­tions in the exchange rate. It changes with a range of variables. But what we do know is that it is trending down over time. The cost of all of the promises that Labor has attached to the mining tax will continue to increase, increase, increase.


The Senate inquiry into the mining tax has conservatively estimated that over the next decade the cost of Labor's promises attached to the mining tax will be about $20 billion higher than the revenue it is going to raise. And that was before decisions were made in Western Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia to make changes to their royalty arrangements in relation to iron ore and coal. The changes to the royalty arrangements in New South Wales and Western Australia alone have blown a $3 billion black hole in Treasurer Swan's budget, because of the dodgy mining tax deal that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer signed up to with the big three miners. They have promised to credit all state and territory royalties against any MRRT liability. This incompetent government never even thought to talk to the states and territories about their intentions in relation to royalty arrangements into the future before signing on the dotted line. Here we have Prime Minister Gillard and Treasurer Swan promising the managing directors of BHP, Rio and Xstrata that they are going to credit all of the state and territory royalties, and the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were too incompetent to ask Premier Barnett, Premier Rann and the Premier of New South Wales at the time, Kristina Keneally, what their intentions were in relation to their royalties into the future. 


This is where this government just does not get it when it comes to tax reform. This government are so addicted to spending and so desperate for more cash that they are always looking for another ad hoc tax grab, but they have not got the time to go through the proper processes. They have not got the time to do the hard yards when it comes to tax reform. Genuine tax reform in this area—resource taxation and royalty arrange­ments—needs to be based on proper engagement between the Commonwealth and the states. This is a terrible government—and there is a lot of evidence on that—and they are pursuing a bad tax which came out of a bad process. Of course this parliament should not go ahead with it. The Greens in this chamber should join with the coalition to force this Labor government to release all of the secret information in relation to the revenue and the cost of the related measures. They can do it. (Time expired)

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2011-11-22,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:16):  The minerals resource rent tax is sound economic and social policy—a recommendation of the Henry tax review and a reform supported by the overwhelming majority of economists in our nation. It is a reform that will ensure that the benefits of the mining boom that are being enjoyed by a few multinational, large miners—the majority being overseas owned—are shared by all Australians and that the revenue is directed to occupational superannuation, to tax breaks for small businesses and to investments in regional infrastructure. 


I often wonder what Australian families think of the debates that occur in this place. The average Australian worker would be just getting home from work at the moment after a hard day's work, facing the prospect of paying the mortgage, school fees and bills, and getting by from week to week. What would they think about the approach that is being taken by the coalition to this major, important economic reform that will redirect some of the benefits of the mining boom and place it in the hands and the pockets of Australians through increased retirement incomes and tax breaks for small businesses?


The most profitable miners in this country are doing well. At its last AGM, Fortescue Metals announced a $1 billion profit—its largest so far. BHP, our largest miner, announced a $22.5 billion profit—and a majority of that was generated from the minerals boom that is occurring in Australia. Rio Tinto announced a 30 per cent increase in their first half figures for this year. This reform is aimed at ensuring that these big miners pay their fair share—and it is the big miners that will pay this tax—and at putting back into the Australian economy some of the benefits that they get from extracting a non-renewable resource, a resource that is owned by the Commonwealth, by the people of Australia, and selling it on the open market for a very big profit.


The opposition have sought to criticise the consultation process. I think Senator Cormann's words were that some of these people were 'in the back pocket of the government'. Well, the Policy Transition Group was established and they have undertaken a 12-month process, and there have been two rounds of public consultations. A Resource Tax Implementation Group has been established and it is made up of industry representatives—




Senator Cormann:

They include: Grant Cathro, partner at Allens Arthur Robinson, a tax law expert; Frank Drenth, executive director at Corporate Tax Association; Teresa Dyson, partner in tax law at Blake Dawson; Yasser El-Ansary, tax counsel at the Institute of Chartered Accountants—



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator Cormann:
  Chaired by whom? Chaired by whom?




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Cormann, that is an unusually extra interjection, so please resist. Senator Carol Brown, please resist shouting across the chamber. Senator Thistlethwaite, please direct your comments to the chair.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  Basil Mastilis, a partner at Ernst & Young; Noel Mullen, the deputy chief executive at the Australian Petrol Production and Exploration Association; Anthony Portas, head of tax at Asia Pacific Anglo American; and Gordon Thring, corporate and international tax partner at Deloitte. These are the people who, in the words of Senator Cormann, are 'in the back pocket of the government' when it comes to drafting this piece of legislation. They provided valuable input through the legislative drafting process and it reflects the view of the government that this is a necessary reform and one that we have consulted widely on. 


The revenue raised from this tax will go to funding superannuation increases in our economy. We will move the compulsory superannuation level from nine to 12 per cent over the course of the next eight years. With an ageing population and an increasing burden on our budget and on our social security system, this is a major economic reform and an important economic reform. Up until a couple of weeks ago, it was opposed by the opposition, in line with their historical opposition to occupational super­annuation in this country. When the Labor Party sought to introduce superannuation in the 1990s, it was opposed by those opposite. Now we have in our economy $1.3 trillion of funds under management and those funds are used for investment and growth by companies and to support jobs.




Senator Williams:
  What about the industry super funds?




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  In fact, Senator Williams, during the global financial crisis when debt markets were frozen, when access to liquidity was difficult to come by, it was Australian superannuation funds that were invested in businesses, many in the mining industry. CBus, the construction industry superannuation fund, is one big investor in BHP and Rio. They are putting back into the mining industry, ensuring that there are sufficient investment funds for growth. Those opposite always oppose superannuation and up until a few weeks ago, they were opposing the increases in the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent being funded by this important reform. These reforms are supported broadly by the funds management industry and by the superannuation industry. A recent report by the Allen Consulting Group—a very enlightening insight into the state of superannuation in this country—highlights the fact that the increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent over the course of the next eight years will increase our nation's gross domestic product, our income, by 0.33 per cent to 2025. That means in 2010 dollars there will be an extra $5.4 billion in our economy because of this reform. That $5.4 billion will fund the retirement incomes of working Australians and provide an important pool of investment sources for business growth.


The other aspect of the revenue generated from this reform will be to provide assistance to companies in the form of an instant asset write-off, increasing from $1,000 to $6,500 over the course of the coming year. That will benefit 2.7 million small businesses throughout the country. The company tax rate will fall from 30 per cent to 29 per cent, funded by the minerals resource rent tax revenue—again, opposed by those opposite, those who claim to be advocates and supporters of the growth of small businesses.


We have often heard of the infrastructure bottlenecks that exist in our economy. The revenue generated from this tax reform will ensure that we invest in rural and regional communities, most notably in freight lines and overcoming bottlenecks associated with port infrastructure. Overwhelmingly, the revenue used from this tax will ensure a more healthy, stable economy into the future. It will boost retirement incomes, which is important for our ageing population, and it will provide tax breaks for small businesses. What a great shame that the mighty Liberal Party, the party of the free market, of business enterprise, of government getting out of the way, is opposing these reforms that will provide a big boost to retirement incomes, secure our economic growth into the future and ensure assistance for small businesses in our economy.


Those opposite come into this place and seek to make points about modelling. Senator Cormann made some comments about the modelling associated with this. Indeed, he has been one of the principal opposition critics of the Treasury modelling on the carbon price. Let us have a look at the Liberal Party's record on modelling. At the last election they refused to submit their election costings to independent expert analysis. Why was that? When they did, the costings came up $11 billion short—an $11 billion black hole. They said that they had their costings independently audited by a group of auditors from the North Shore of Sydney who signed off on them. When we had a look at the costings, we saw that those auditors would not give an unqualified audit of the Liberal Party's election costings. Yet the Liberal Party comes in here and criticises the government's modelling, when all the facts associated with the carbon price and this important reform are on the table.


We have had leaks from the shadow cabinet which indicate that there will be cuts of $70 billion to services under a coalition government. Then we had the almighty backflip on occupational superannuation a couple of weeks ago when the shadow finance minister Andrew Robb was not told that the coalition would not repeal the increases in superannuation. This will add an extra $12 billion to their budget bottom line costings. Ours is a sensible reform, it is costed and the Australian public needs it. (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (16:26):  The dishonesty of Prime Minister Gillard's lie of not having a carbon tax has been extended to secrecy over the assumptions underlying this mining tax. This means the supposed benefits for superannuation, a reduction in company tax and the elimination of the deficit all have to be said to be in doubt. This version of the mining tax was conceived in secrecy as a result of a deal between the three big mining companies—BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata—and it excluded the smaller mining companies represented by AMEC. Those small companies are a very important sector of the mining industry. AMEC rightly complains that this proposal is anti­competitive and, as it stands, the tax will create an uneven playing field between the formative iron ore and coal miners—those trying to cut their teeth in the business—and the large conglomerates. It appears that the Labor Party is happy to be in bed with the big boys: BHP, Rio and Xstrata. So much for their rhetoric. Boy oh boy, what a revelation!


There are estimates, which have varied widely, of how much revenue this tax will raise. Last July, in 2010, we were told the tax would raise an estimated $10.5 billion over its first two years. Strangely, later in the MYEFO document, revenue was downgraded quite substantially by almost $3 billion to $7.4 billion, being the estimate of what this tax would raise. In the May budget this year, however, the revenue from total tax raised magically increased to $7.7 billion in the first two years and then $11.1 billion for the first three years. It seems to me that these figures are as much of a roller coaster as the Prime Minister's polling—up and down, all over the place—and give no real indication of what we can rely on.


The government claims taxes are variable because the prices of minerals vary so much, as do exchange rates. Well, there is some doubt in that. In many ways there are long-term projections made, with future markets and so on. The best that can be said as to the revenue value of the minerals tax is that it is very uncertain if it is based on such uncertain prices and so many uncertainties in the modelling. In the view of the miners who were not consulted, the smaller miners, the AMEC group in particular, this tax will not raise anything like the revenue projected. 


Andrew Forrest, the head of Fortescue Metals Group, claims the three big miners who did the secret deal with the government to set up this tax will pay far less tax than the new players and the smaller miners. In fact, it has been estimated that the smaller miners will pay at least four per cent more than the big miners, and that is quite a substantial amount of money. We have to ask whether that is fair. The big miners are well-established big operations, whereas a lot of smaller miners are trying to get their operations off the ground. The concept that they should have to pay more tax is quite unreasonable. It means this tax is actually a discouragement to the future development of the mining industry. 


We are told that the revenues generated from this tax will be allocated to improving superannuation, reducing company tax and, most importantly, eliminating the deficit. But, even though the government has these fine ideals, it seems very strange that it is denying the parliament the right to see the modelling underlying this tax. Surely it is reasonable for parliament to have the modelling, if for no other reason than the government's claim that the tax will help it return to surplus in 2014. Yet no information is being provided to the parliament. That has to be a matter of concern to us all. 


As I said, the AMEC group of companies and FMG say that this tax was conceived in a secret deal between the government and the big miners—BHP, Xstrata and Rio—and we are told that the modelling was done by BHP. That is another thing which must make us a little bit concerned. BHP is a very large company, having a different set of figures to those of the smaller miners; perhaps modelling done by such a very big company does not translate particularly well into the operations of the smaller miners. 


The Gillard government claims to be committed to openness and transparency, but in practice secrecy and opaqueness seem to be the order of the day for this government. Given the Prime Minister's acknowledged record of misleading the Australian people—to put it at its nicest, or lying, as some of my colleagues have said—over the carbon tax, parliament has every right to be rather dubious about the rationale for this tax and the underlying assumptions which have led to this tax being set at the rate that it has been. I think parliament has every right to demand access to the data underlying this tax to test the validity of the government's projections. The government claims that the information is supposed to be in confidence and that the Information Commissioner 'will arbitrate the release of documents to the parliament'. I must say I have never heard of the Information Commissioner before; it is a public office which I was totally unaware of. But here we are—we have got an information commissioner who is going to arbitrate what the representatives of the people of Australia are entitled to know about the underlying assumptions this government made in setting up this tax. In my view it is very important to remember that the parliament and the Senate are the representative bodies of the people of Australia. It is quite outrageous that this government is denying the parliament access to its modelling figures. 


The Prime Minister's office claims that the functions of the Information Commissioner do not include 'reporting on or arbitrating disputes between the executive and the parliament'. I come back again to the simple proposition that the parliament represents the people of Australia, and this is one place where the people of Australia have the right to expect answers to questions raised on their behalf. It would seem to flow as a logical conclusion from the government's position that this government does not believe that the parliament should have sufficient information to make an informed decision on this matter. 


It is a pretty outrageous and sad matter that we are contemplating, where a government is proposing to set up a super tax which other countries, our competitors, do not have and which will disadvantage our mining industry, making it less competitive. Part of the naivety of this government seems to be its failure to understand that the mining industry is truly international and that the big mining companies in this country can shift their projects and their money to other parts of the world, like West Africa, the gulf, Canada and Brazil, and it is an easy thing for them to do. That is something that this government simply does not understand. It is going to damage the industry which has made Australia's economy so strong. 


In conclusion, I return to the fact that the parliament represents the people of Australia and it is the people of Australia to whom the Gillard government is saying, 'We are not going to tell you what the underlying assumptions for this tax were.' That is outrageous.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (16:36):  Before I make my contribution—sadly, I have only five minutes—I want everyone to know that I have the greatest respect for my colleague from Western Australia Senator Eggleston. But, unfortunately, Senator Eggleston has been hijacked by the nonsense coming out of the billionaire brigade in Western Australia. It is an absolute disgrace. Let us get a real handle on what this tax is all about before I go any further. Senator Eggleston, you suggested that Labor is in bed with the big boys. I tried not to laugh too loud. I look at Clive Palmer—




Senator Eggleston:
  He's a big boy.




Senator STERLE:
  I am not talking about the size of the man. He is a major mining identity who is, I believe—and I will be corrected if I am wrong—a major donor to the National Party. For crying out loud!


Let us get back to what this mining tax is really all about. This is a tax on companies that mine iron ore and coal once the companies have made a $75 million profit. It does not kick in until they get to $75 million in profit. The language that is being used in this discussion by Senators Eggleston and Cormann is nothing short of misleading. We hear that this mining tax is going to kill the mining industry, kill the goose that laid the golden egg, absolutely jeopardise Australia's mining industry, send mining offshore. That is complete and utter nonsense. We are talking about putting a fair and just tax on these companies once they have got to $75 million in profit.


I only have five minutes but I could talk for an hour underwater with a gob full of marbles on this because I am so passionate about it, coming from WA. But I want to have an argument based on truths. I want to have an argument based on realities. I do not want to have an argument that is being misled by the rubbish coming out of the mouths of billionaires like Andrew Forrest. It is absolutely incredible to think that in evidence given to a parliamentary committee, I think as late as last week, one of Andrew Forrest's representatives actually told the committee that FMG had not paid any company tax, and that when Andrew Forrest addressed a meeting of his shareholders he said FMG expected to pay 'less than $20 million a year'. It was so small as to equate to a 'rounding error' for a company forecasting $4 billion in earnings. This is the same fella who prides himself on being on the front page of every newspaper saying, 'The Prime Minister won't return my call. It is going to send me broke.'


I am going to share a little secret with senators opposite, as long as they promise not to tell anyone else out there. I met with Mr Forrest. I met with him at his request last year, not long after he and that other small-business person Miss Gina Rinehart, with the big pearls, were waving signs saying 'Stop the tax'. Mr Forrest—promise you will not tell anyone—'hinted' to me in no uncertain terms that if the mining tax were to go ahead it could jeopardise his Solomon Hub project. What a load of absolute nonsense!


The truth is starting to come out now. I just hope that every Australian actually hears the truth about Mr Forrest, this Robin Hood of the iron ore industry and the small miners. What the hell is a small miner? I have spent a lot of time in the Pilbara and a lot of time in the Kimberley and the goldfields. Please tell me what a small miner is. Is their Mercedes-Benz any smaller than that of the miners from BHP or Rio Tinto?


And what nonsense from Senator Cormann—of all people to suggest that Labor is in the pockets of BHP and Rio Tinto. I think they are the words that were used. Senator Eggleston, you are nodding in agreement. That is what he did say? Okay. Senator Cormann, if you are listening out there, take 30 steps outside and say it out there on the steps tomorrow morning. Do a doorstop and accuse us of being in the pockets of the big miners.


Madam Acting Deputy President Adams, I say to you, as a good Western Australian and a colleague I have great respect for: I just want an argument based on truth—not on falsities, not on lies and not on complete deception from Western Australian billionaires who will absolutely not be impacted unless they earn $75 million in profit. Wouldn't you like to earn $75 million in profit before you had to pay tax? I know I would. (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (16:41):  Doesn't Senator Sterle have a nerve coming in here and talking about truth? You have to be kidding! Here is a member of a government whose Prime Minister went to the last election promising, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' He then comes in here talking about truth. Give us a break! 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—that would have to be one of the biggest lies that I have ever heard in my parliamentary career, and Senator Sterle comes in here trying to convince us that we ought to be talking about the truth.


So let's go to the truths around the mining tax. The mining tax: one of the mechanisms that Prime Minister Gillard used to knife Kevin Rudd and take the prime ministership off him—there is a truth. Another truth: a deal negotiated by Prime Minister Gillard with the big three and announced before the election as one of her fixes, to the exclusion of the rest of the mining industry regardless of size. This is a deal negotiated by Prime Minister Gillard with the big mining companies—just three of them—in the lead-up to the election, after it was used as one of the reasons to knife then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.


Another truth: the government will not release all the details of the spending measures in the out years. Senator Sterle wants to talk about truth; that is another truth. They will not release all of the information around the mining tax—another truth—which is the point of this motion here today. Senator Sterle wants to talk to us about the truth, yet they are the perpetrators of the greatest lie in recent political history: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' They had better get used to hearing that because it is going to come back and back and they are going to hear it over and over right up to the next election.


The government want us to trust them with the information and the facts around the mining tax, yet they cannot be trusted to tell the truth. It was the very thing that Senator Sterle wanted to talk about in his contribution—the truth around the mining tax—yet Senator Sterle neglected to let us know that this is a deal that Prime Minister Gillard did with three big mining companies before the election, after using it to assist her to knife her leader Kevin Rudd and then move on to the election.



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  Senator Carol Brown might like to tell us what she has done to assist the Savage River mine, where magnetite is mined on the west coast of Tasmania. They still do not know their status under the mining tax—whether they are in or whether they are out. Mr Wilkie came out yesterday quite flamboyantly saying that he had worked with the government to raise the threshold on the mining tax for Tasmania, but he has done absolutely nothing to assist this company mining magnetite on the north-west coast of Tasmania. They still do not know whether they are in or out. That is a truth of this particular piece of legislation. Here is a company which is in the iron ore game, but they are actually mining a product which, when it comes out of the ground, has very little value. They do not know at what point they are going to be taxed. 


Senator Carol Brown quite rightly sits quietly because she has done nothing to help that business. Mr Wilkie did nothing to assist that business—and he is one of the people who had the whip hand in the negotiations. He is one of the people who had the opportunity to decide whether this tax got passed. He came out triumphantly yesterday to tell the Tasmanian people that he had had the threshold raised from $50 million to $75 million. That might be an achievement, but one of the major mines in Tasmania still does not know its status. Had Mr Wilkie been aware of some of the issues going on around the state and had he not been focused just on Hobart, he might have been able to make a difference. That is one of the truths of this mining tax.


Another truth of the mining tax is that the government tried to give the impression to small businesses across the country that they are going to get a tax rebate. Small businesses which are companies will get a tax rebate under this legislation, but 65 per cent to 70 per cent of them are not companies and they miss out on the tax rebate. So there is nothing in it. That is another truth of this piece of legislation.




Senator Sterle:
  What do you mean? Two million companies will get a tax break. What companies aren't companies?




Senator Williams:
  Partnerships.




Senator COLBECK:
  Partnerships and sole traders—they do not get a tax break out of this. In fact, they potentially get a tax increase. The 65 per cent to 70 per cent of small businesses which are not company structures potentially get a tax increase because the 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax offset is gone under this piece of legislation. The 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax offset disappears under this piece of legislation—another truth. So rather than getting a tax cut as a small business, they get a tax increase as a small business—because they lose the tax offset which was part of the Howard government's 2004 election policy. That demonstrates the attitude of this government to small business—small businesses are the ones they get their union mates to go around and attack, trying to turn them around and change them into a different form of business. That is what happens to those small businesses, that 65 per cent to 70 per cent of small businesses which do not get any benefit out of this process.


The government also tried to tell small businesses and the employees who work in them that this process is going to fund an increase in the superannuation rate. But this process is not going to fund an increase in the superannuation rate; the employers are going to fund an increase in the super­annuation rate. That is the truth of this legislation. The employers will fund it or, in some cases, it will be the employees of the business who will suffer a reduction in salary increases as a result of the increase in the superannuation guarantee. That might be a small percentage, but it is going to happen. 


In fact that is what Henry said. That is what the Henry tax review, where this whole process started, said. The recommendation from the Henry tax review was to leave the superannuation rate at nine per cent. So the government cannot come in here and argue that Henry supports the mining tax on one hand because on the other hand he was making a very different recommendation when it came to superannuation. 


You might look back and say, 'How do you end up with a decent small business here in Australia?' The answer to how you end up with a decent small business in Australia is to start with a big business and put this lot in government. You only have to look at the steel industry to get a demonstration of that. The two biggest players in the steel industry were worth $8 billion back in February. Now they are worth $3 billion. They have had $5 billion wiped off the value of their shares since February.




Senator Sterle:
  How is that our fault? It is the Aussie dollar.




Senator COLBECK:
  No, it is not because of the Aussie dollar, Senator Sterle. The steel rescue package only commits them to the retention of a fraction of their existing business. One of them is already closing down a smelter. The other one told us yesterday that their Whyalla smelter is on watch—it has 12 months. That is what is happening under this government. They bring out a steel transformation plan, but it is a bit late—because they have already transformed the steel industry. They have turned it from an industry where the two major companies were worth $8 billion at the top to one where those two companies are worth only $3 billion. That is a transformation all right. 


They come in here and they want to talk to us about truth. The real truth is that you cannot trust this government. You cannot trust what this government says. It does not matter what arguments they try to put here in the chamber or what arguments they try to put outside. This is the government which promised the Australian people, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' All of them were elected on that promise. Every single one of them was elected on the promise, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' 


Then we come to the 'year of decision and delivery' and what are the deliverables? A carbon tax and a mining tax. They are the key deliverables for this government—new taxes. Then, when they start talking about the offsets to the mining tax, the reality is that they are going to spend more than they raise from the mining tax. What sort of fiscal responsibility is that? How can they come in here with any credibility? 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—we have just passed a carbon tax and now they want to pass a mining tax.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2011-11-22,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:52):  I think this debate demonstrates the clear difference between the Labor Party and the coalition, because the Labor Party is standing up for eight million Australians, standing up for small business, standing up for decent infrastructure in this country and standing up for the right of all Australians to get a fair go out of the mining boom. And what about the coalition? Over there, they are defending their mates in the mining industry, defending those who are funding the coalition, defending those who are flying coalition senators around the world, over to India, to attend Bollywood weddings. That is the difference between us. We care about the future of this country. We care about making sure that industry pays its fair share. And we care about delivering a decent society in this country. All you care about is trying to make sure that you get more and more funding from the businesspeople that you defend day in, day out. And why are you defending them? You are defending them to make sure that they do not pay a reasonable amount of tax. It is outrageous for you to come here and talk about the Gillard government's continued secrecy and lack of accountability on revenue assumptions and costs regarding its mining tax.


You had all day today to develop some questions for question time on this issue that you are making all the noise about today. What did you do? You did not ask a question of a minister on this issue—not one question. Then you come here with your fake outrage and say this is a huge issue, but there was not one question in question time. You come here and run all the arguments in support of some of the richest people in this country, some of the people who are making huge profits, huge personal fortunes, out of Australia's mineral resources—not their mineral resources but our mineral resources. You come here and you defend them. Why do the Liberal and National parties defend them? Because they are your election bankers. They are the people who are putting the money into the coalition to bankroll your election campaign, so you come here and put the Australian public second to your funding from your rich business mates.


You talk about accountability and assumptions regarding the mining tax. Let me tell you about accountability in the coalition. The coalition under Malcolm Turnbull called for the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office—remember that? Malcolm Turnbull as Leader of the Opposition said we should have a Parliamentary Budget Office because he wanted accountability. He wanted access to assumptions and costs. So what happened? A parliamentary inquiry into the Parliamentary Budget Office was established, and I was on that parliamentary inquiry. There was a joint position arising out of the parliamentary budget inquiry that we should establish a Parliamentary Budget Office to make sure that there was accountability on revenue and assumptions so that the public knew what the financial position was of promises that were made by the coalition, by the Labor Party, by the Greens and by the Independents during an election campaign. A unanimous position was adopted by that parliamentary inquiry. What happened? The recommendations went up and immediately the coalition said, 'Uh-oh, no way. We are not going to be accountable. It might have been a good idea from Malcolm Turnbull, but we don't want to be accountable during the election campaign.'


And why would the coalition want to be accountable during the election campaign? In the last election campaign, the Treasury found a $10.6 billion hole in the promises that they were making and then they blamed some leak in Treasury as to why they would not submit their promises for scrutiny by the Treasury. This is the same Treasury that served John Howard and Peter Costello; the same Treasury that serves this Labor government. They said, 'No, we're not putting our election promises to the Treasury or to the department of finance because we don't trust them'—the same people who for 11½ years provided advice to John Howard and Peter Costello. 


What did the coalition do? They were so upfront about accountability on revenue and assumptions that they got some accounting firm in Western Australia to cook the books to try and make it look as if they had a reasonable position on their election promises. But, as to the most experienced people in the country on analysing government funding, government programs and government promises—the two groups are the Treasury and the department of finance—they would not go near them.


So do not come here talking about accountability and do not come here talking about openness, because you have rejected the Parliamentary Budget Office. If you are truthful and you want to stand up with some credibility, when the bill comes to the Senate you stand up and make the same speeches about accountability, support the Parlia­mentary Budget Office and submit your shonky costings to the Parliamentary Budget Office at the next election. The reason you do not support the Parliamentary Budget Office is that you have no concern about accountability—absolutely no concern. You want to mislead the Australian public on your economic costs. You want to mislead the public on where you are going with your promises.


Why would you want to submit again to the Parliamentary Budget Office? You have admitted that you have a $70 billion black hole—$70 billion that you have to find before you can actually deliver reasonable policies to the Australian public at the next election. By the time you fund all the crazy promises that have been made, we know what is going to happen: you are going to have to slash 12,000 jobs in the Public Service and the services for ordinary Australians will disappear. You want to cut the health system, the education system and the welfare system, because that is what you will have to do to fund your $70 billion black hole. That is a reality. So do not come talking to us about assumptions in costs, accountability and secrecy. You are the ones who want to keep the secrets. You are the ones who do not want to be accountable. You are the ones who will not put your election promises to the Parliamentary Budget Office.


Let us go back to the issue of why the coalition would want to run away from that approach. Take Twiggy Forrest. I think Twiggy Forrest should be renamed—he should be Twiggy No Tax, because he is not paying any tax. He is a billionaire. Andrew Forrest's net worth privately, off the back of our mineral resources and for one individual, is $6.2 billion. He is a major supporter and a major bankroller of the coalition. Why would they argue for more tax for him when they put themselves before the national interest? That is the position that the coalition are taking. Then there is Gina Rinehart—net worth $9 billion. Gina Rinehart has been out there on the picket line, with her Armani gear on and pearls flying around, at the mass meeting of the millionaires. The Rolls-Royce revolutionaries are out there saying they do not want to pay more tax: 'I'm worth $9 billion but I don't want to pay more tax!' They had their mass meeting and the Rolls-Royces were queuing up for three kilometres down the main street of Perth. That is not like any mass meeting I have seen. The security guards were out there—it was all on!


Gina Rinehart has $9 billion. Clive Palmer, with $5.05 billion, is again a major Liberal supporter. Why would the coalition want to make him pay more tax? When he does not pay tax to help the Australian public he is shoving it into the coffers of the coalition for their election campaign. That is what this lot are all about. Do not get muddled up by any arguments about modelling or about secrecy—there is no secret to what this is about. It is not about modelling; it is about making sure that at the next election their election coffers are full of money donated by Twiggy 'No Tax' Forrest, Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer. That is what they want to do, so do not come here lecturing us about what should happen to tax.


The difference between the Labor Party and the coalition is that we want people to get a fair go out of our natural resources. This is an opportunity for Australians to get something out of the mining boom and stop lining the pockets of the billionaires. There is $80 billion worth of investment in the mining industry over the next few years. I heard Senator Eggleston talk about how the mining industry will desert us and go overseas. I know one area they want to go to, and that is Zambia. In Zambia the government had to plead with the mining companies to get them to pay any corporate tax. The only tax the mining companies were paying in Zambia was the tax on what the workers earned. The workers earned their wages and paid their tax and that was the only tax the mining industry paid in Zambia. That is what the coalition would like, because then they would have a really big bank balance to go to the next election on. They come here and support their corporate mates: the small miners like Twiggy No Tax. What a joke! Personally, he is worth more money than a lot of our industries in Australia, yet the coalition do not want his company to pay any more tax—although it is not more tax because he has not paid any tax.


We want a fair go for Australians. That is the difference between the coalition and the Labor Party. We want the richest people in this country who are exploiting our mineral resources to pay a fair share of tax. We want the billionaires to pay a bit of tax to help build the schools, the infrastructure, the hospitals and the education system of the future. We want workers in Australia to get a decent retirement, not just billionaires like No Tax Twiggy and Gina Rinehart. They should stop flying Senator Joyce and Julie Bishop overseas to India in a private jet. Put that money back into Australia and stop looking after the coalition. That is my message to the billionaires in the mining industry.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (17:07):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


In commencing my remarks on the Auditor-General's Report No. 13 of 2011-12: Performance audit: Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme, I note the history of this scheme. It was instigated by the Howard government and improved by the Howard government over a number of years. The Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme is of significant importance to the Tasmanian economy and contributes something like $100 million per annum to equalise the cost of transporting goods to and from Tasmania, particularly in the manufacturing sector.


There are a number of points in the Auditor-General's report that I want to note. One of those concerns the increased complexity of the scheme that has developed over a number of years. I recall the Productivity Commission review that was undertaken in 2006 and the government's response that it would retain the scheme in its current form but conduct a parameter review. The parameters are basically the rules under which the scheme operates. It was my view that there needed to be some modifications to the parameters under which the scheme operated at that time, but unfortunately the opportunity was not formally taken up by the current government. I do understand that the operation of the scheme is very sensitive in Tasmania. It is a sensitive issue because of the important role it plays, particularly in supporting a number of the food processors and also some of the key manufacturing industries in Tasmania. But there are some elements of the parameters that need to be reconsidered and I think that is an important part of the process.


One really concerning element that came out in the audit was the number of times that Centrelink actually met its 15- and 30-day processing targets. They were only met nine times between July 2009 and June 2011. That is a pretty concerning statistic because what we are talking about is providing assistance back to industry in Tasmania. For Centrelink to only meet the monthly targets of 15 and 30 days nine times in that period of time is a concern. I do note, however, that the government has since made a one-off contribution to the operations of Centrelink in managing the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. Those statistics on processing its claims in less than 15 days increased from 57 per cent to 79 per cent. I would have to say I think there is significant room for improvement there. I think that the government paying its bills within its target time only 79 per cent of the time is disappointing. I recall from the government's procurement guidelines that the target rate for those sorts of figures is somewhere in the early 90s—93 or 94 per cent. I think that would be a more ideal target. It is obvious that the management of this scheme needs to focus much more on meeting its obligations within the targeted time frames set by this government.


The concerning thing is that, rather than looking at the detail and working with industry on the parameters, what we effectively get out of this is yet another review of the scheme, which is due to commence in 2011-12. Far from looking at it and working closely with industry, we are just going to go through another review process. One of the things that concerned me about the way the scheme was operated in the past, even under our government, was that when the annual cost reviews were completed they were not necessarily put into place. You got into a situation where every five years or so the changes in costs around the freight task had moved by four or five per cent. So then trying to redesign and adjust the scheme and the rates that were being paid under the scheme became a major exercise. It seemed to me that dealing with the cost increments on an annual basis as they were calculated was a much better way for the scheme to operate, regardless of which way those cost increments moved. I think that there is a real opportunity for some very positive changes to the scheme, bearing in mind that some of the companies that are supported by the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme are major contributors to the Tasmanian economy.


About 20 companies are major claimants under this scheme. When you look at the number of businesses that actually do operate under and take advantage of the scheme, it is quite significant. There are some 1,500 or 1,600 companies that take advantage of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme in a range of scales, and 1,074 of those businesses only claim between $500 and $10,000 a year. Two hundred and twenty-four, or five per cent, claim from $10,000 to $50,000 a year; four per cent, or 51 companies, claim $50,000 to $100,000 a year; and 75 companies, or 22 per cent, claim $100,000 to $1 million a year. As I said, the majority of the funding goes to some of our major food processors, paper manufacturers and other companies that make a major contribution to the Tasmanian economy. About 20 of those claim more than $1 million, or 67 per cent of the funds claimed under the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme.


As I said, I am more than proud to have played a significant role with my Tasmanian Liberal Senate team colleagues in the initial implementation and certainly the improvement of this scheme over recent years. I note that it was at the 2007 election that both the coalition and the Labor Party included the Bass Strait islands in this scheme. It has made an important contribution to the trade of those particular businesses on both Flinders Island and King Island.


I recommend to the government that they look very closely at ensuring that Centrelink have the resources available to them to make sure that their targets for payment processing and paying the claims under the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme are actually met. I think that a success rate of only 57 per cent is pretty poor. I acknowledge that there has been some additional work and that has raised it to 79 per cent, but I think that we ought to be targeting a much higher processing compliance rate.


As I have said, this is an important scheme for the viability of a lot of business in Tasmania and so we want to make sure that that work continues. I commend the Auditor-General for the report. It is important that the way the government's money is used in supporting Australian business and, in this particular case, the taxpayers and businesses in Tasmania is properly scrutinised. It is good to see that many of the provisions that Centrelink have in place are actually meeting the requirements of good expenditure of Australian taxpayers' funds. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Aviation safety
—
Our most important priority





In December 2009 the Australian Government released the National Aviation White Paper, Flight Path to the Future, Australia
'
s first ever comprehensive national aviation policy.



The White Paper confirmed that aviation safety is the Government's first and foremost priority in aviation.


The Government is committed to enhancing aviation safety and maintaining Australia's internationally regarded high quality aviation safety standards and performance. 


This commitment was reiterated in the Ministerial Statement on Air Safety tabled by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport on 4 July 2011.


Many of the aviation safety initiatives outlined in the Aviation White Paper cover issues examined by the Senate Committee's report.


In particular, the Government has acted on the safety funding and regulatory reform issues outlined in the Committee's recommendations. 


In the May 2010 Budget the Government announced an additional $89.9 million in funding for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) over four years.


This additional funding is being used to fund almost 100 new and ongoing staff in key surveillance roles, and to invest in the development and maintenance of safety standards and regulatory development. 


The additional funding is also providing for expanded and ongoing training for CASA staff and to make sure there are sufficient resources to properly regulate Australian administered airspace, which covers almost eleven per cent of the earth's surface. 


This funding represented an unprecedented 30 per cent increase in CASA funding and provides some long term stability in the Authority's funding base. 


The CASA Board has recently confirmed that with the additional funding provided by the Government that CASA is now adequately funded to meet the challenges and performance expected of a world class aviation safety regulator.


In March 2010 the Government established a dedicated regulatory drafting taskforce involving specialists from CASA and the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing. The Taskforce was established to target the completion of the long outstanding maintenance, operations and flight crew licensing regulations.


The Taskforce has already made substantial progress in completing the maintenance regulations and is currently drafting several of the air transport operations and licensing regulations specifically referred to in the Committee's recommendations. 




Draft regulations will be made available for public comment before they are finalised. The regulations will provide improvements to areas such as regular public transport operations, flying training, flight crew licensing and training and checking operations.





Committee recommendations



The Committee examined a range of issues related to the aviation safety regulatory framework for pilot training, the regulatory reform program and CASA funding, incident reporting and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's (ATSB's) processes, as well as fatigue management and cabin crew training requirements.


The Government's responses to the Committee's twenty two recommendations are attached. These responses have been developed in close consultation with Australia's two key independent aviation safety agencies, CASA and the ATSB. 


The Government's response highlights that most of the recommendations are already being addressed through funding, regulatory reform and reporting initiatives of this Government.




Recommendation 1





The committee is of the view that an Air Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) should also be required for first officers in high capacity regular 
public transport (RPT) jet aircraft such as Boeing 737, A320 and other aircraft of similar or greater capacity, and that


consideration be given to implementing this as a standard.





Response





The Government notes the Committee
'
s view.





However the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has advised that the Committee
'
s view is not consistent with the International Civil Aviation Organization
'
s (ICAO) licence privileges for the Commercial Pilot Licence or Multi-crew Pilot Licence which are replicated in Australia under the 
Civil Aviation Regulations 1988
.





These regulations permit the holder to fly an aeroplane as co-pilot while the aeroplane is engaged in regular public transport (RPT) operations.





CASA is not aware of any ICAO Contracting State that requires a co-pilot to hold an ATPL and further notes that, in many countries, employment as a co-pilot is the only available pathway for a pilot to accumulate the aeronautical experience required for the granting of an ATPL.





However under the proposed new Part 61 of the 
Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1988 (CASR) 
CASA plans to introduce a requirement for captains and co-pilots to hold the same type of rating qualification and instrument rating and receive the same level of training (for example, stalling and some engine failure manoeuvres during take-off).





These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of November 2011.





Recommendation 2





The committee recommends that for non-jet operations which employ low-experience first officers, operators be required to provide enhanced supervision and mentoring schemes to offset such lack of experience.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.




CASA is reviewing existing criteria in relation to induction and line training requirements for flight crew deemed to have low experience levels.  This will be done in consultation with industry stakeholders and any changes to these criteria would be applicable for all pilots conducting regular public transport (RPT) operations.




The new draft Operations regulations currently being developed by CASA will also detail the responsibilities of aircraft operators before they assign new or low experienced crew members to a flight.





Recommendation 3





The committee recommends that Air Operators Certificate (AOC) holders be required to develop and implement 'green on green' policy positions relating to the use of low experience pilots in RPT operations, to maximise, wherever possible, the collective experience level of flight crew.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.



The proposed new CASR Part 121 covering 'Air Transport Operations by Large Aeroplanes' includes a provision that would require operators to establish procedures to ensure that inexperienced flight crew members are not crewed together.


CASA has also developed ""Acceptable Means of Compliance"" guidance material to assist operators address the regulatory requirements in the development of their crewing practices.




These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment early in 2012.





Recommendation 4





The committee recommends that Civil Aviation Safety Regulation (CASR) Part 61 ensure that all prospective regular public transport (RPT) pilots be required to complete substantial course-based training in multi-crew operations and resource management (non-technical skills) and human factors training prior to, or in reasonable proximity to, initial endorsement training; the committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) 
expedite, and assign the highest priority to, the implementation of CASR Part


61.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.



The proposed CASR Part 61 introduces a requirement into the flight crew licensing system for a pilot conducting multi-crew operations to have completed a course of multi-crew co-operation training that includes theoretical and practical application of human factors or non-technical skills competencies (including Crew Resource Management). 




These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of November 2011.





Recommendation 5





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) ensure that Part 61 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations currently being reviewed place sufficient weight on multi-engine aeroplane experience as opposed to the current recognition of glider and ultra-light experience.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.





CASA has confirmed that the proposed CASR Part 61 
'
Flight Crew Licensing
'
 prescribes minimum aeronautical experience requirements that meet or exceed the experience standards specified in 
Annex 1 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (i.e. the Chicago Convention) 
for each aircraft category rating on a flight crew licence. 





Furthermore, the new regulations would require that the total experience requirements specified for an integrated course of training be conducted in a recognised aeroplane, that is, an aeroplane that is registered by CASA, by another ICAO contracting state or is operated by the Defence Force of Australia or of another contracting state
. 




Aeronautical experience accumulated in gliders or ultra-light aircraft may be used to satisfy part of the requirements specified for a licence, although competency-based training ensures an applicant has been assessed as competent to perform a task to the standards specified for the licence in a recognised aeroplane
. 





These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of November 2011.





Recommendation 6





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) be required to undertake a risk assessment of current simulator training to assess whether the extent, aims and scope of such training is being utilised to achieve optimum safety outcomes rather than minimum compliance objectives.





Response




The Government does not support this recommendation as CASA has confirmed that the existing legislative and oversight regulatory framework already covers this type of training activity. The conduct of aircraft endorsement and recurrent training in an approved simulator is already subject to CASA oversight and CASA currently assesses and approves the relevant training programs used by RPT operators.


CASA is currently considering implementing regulatory changes that will increase the use of simulators for flight training and checking activities, including the conduct of certain emergency procedures, which can be more safely and effectively conducted in a simulator than in the actual aircraft. This work is being undertaken with regard to risk assessment requirements and cost benefit considerations.


It is expected that CASA will be putting out for public comment an updated proposal on simulator training by the end of November 2011.




Recommendation 7





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) expedite, and assign the highest priority to, the implementation of Civil Aviation Safety Regulations (CASR) Part 141 'Flight Training Operators' and Part 142 'Training and Checking Operators'.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.



The Government has already put in place a dedicated regulatory drafting task force involving specialists from CASA and the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing. 



CASA is expected to release draft regulations for CASR Parts 141 and 142 for public comment by the end of November 2011. 




Recommendation 8





The committee recommends that the Government require the Productivity Commission or another suitable body to undertake a review of the current and future supply of pilots in Australia, with particular reference to the general aviation and cadet training pathways, and HECS HELP and VET FEEHELP arrangements.





Response





The Government does not support this recommendation.





Skills Australia, an independent statutory authority, currently provides advice on Australia
'
s current, emerging and future workforce skills and development needs
. 
Skills Australia will be replaced in 2012 by the National Workforce and Productivity Agency, which will continue to have responsibility for providing workforce development and sector and regional skills planning advice to Government and industry.





Assisted by the expanded role of the Transport and Logistics Industry Skills Council, which has developed training packages for the aviation industry to improve planning and skills development for key occupations such as pilots, these agencies are well placed to examine future demand and supply issues in relation to pilots in Australia.





Recommendation 9





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and Australian aviation operators review the final findings of France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis into Air France 447, including 
consideration of how it may apply in the Australian context
. 
Subject to those findings, the committee may seek the approval of the Senate to conduct a further hearing in relation to the matter.





Response





The Government supports this recommendation as it confirms current agency practice.




Australia
'
s independent safety regulatory and investigatory agencies, CASA and the ATSB, and industry, routinely examine the outcomes of accident investigations and consider their implications for the safety of Australian aircraft operations.



Both agencies are monitoring the French investigation into the accident of Air France Flight 447 and when the findings of the final report have been issued, which is expected next year, CASA and the ATSB will review any implications for Australian aviation.




Recommendation 10





The committee recommends that the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport provide a report to Parliament every six months outlining the progress of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's (CASA) regulatory reforms and specifying reform priorities, consultative processes and implementation targets for the following 12-month period.





Response





The Government does not support this recommendation.




The Government notes that progress with the regulatory reform program is already reported to Parliament through various forums including CASA's annual report, briefing and information provided at Senate Estimates hearings and through CASA's regular meetings with industry stakeholders. 



Regulatory reform activities, including consultation undertaken, are detailed on the CASA website and in the Explanatory Statements and Instruments registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments.




Recommendation 11





The committee recommends that the Government undertake a review of the funding to 
the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) to ensure that there is sufficient specific funding to support an expedited regulatory reform process.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation.



The review of CASA's funding was completed by the Government as part of the Aviation White Paper process and an additional $89.9 million in funding for CASA over four years was announced in the 2010 Budget. Part of this funding is being used on the regulatory reform program.




Recommendation 12





The committee recommends that, as an ongoing measure, the Government provide the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) with specific funding to enable it to offer salaries that are competitive with industry; in addition, or as an alternative, the Government should consider implementing formal mechanisms for the sharing of expertise between industry and CASA.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which has already been implemented.



The Government provided an additional $89.9 million in funding for CASA over four years announced in the 2010 Budget.



The CASA Board has confirmed that with the additional funding provided by the Government that CASA is now adequately funded to meet the challenges and performance expected of a world-class aviation safety regulator.




Recommendation 13





The committee recommends that the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment (Incident Reports) Bill 2010 not be passed.





Response





The Government supports this recommendation.



The submissions made by the ATSB and CASA in relation to this matter are referred to by the committee in formulating this recommendation. The submissions continue to represent the position of both organisations.




Recommendation 14





The committee recommends that the current prescriptive approach needs to be supplemented with a general obligation to report whenever the 'responsible person' believes that there is an urgent safety risk that must be addressed.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which is already being progressed.



The Government notes that the consultation package on reforms to the mandatory incident reporting scheme in the Transport Safety Investigations Regulations 2003, which the ATSB took to industry last year, included proposed changes to the reporting regime to make reporting responsibilities clearer, including when there is an urgent safety risk. 


These revised regulations are currently being drafted.



To the extent the recommendation refers to reporting processes within Safety Management Systems, CASA is taking these considerations into account. CASA will be looking to the outcome of the work ICAO is currently undertaking in this regard, in which Australia is actively engaged.




Recommendation 15





The committee recommends that the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB) review its approach to the investigation and publication of human factors with a view to achieving a more robust and useful learning tool for the industry.





Response





The Government supports this recommendation in-principle.




The ATSB already has a robust approach to the investigation and publication of human factor issues which was recognised in 2009 when the ATSB received an award from the International Society of Air Safety Investigators for its world-leading work in human factors.


An example of the ATSB's continuing commitment and approach to investigations into human factors to help explain accidents and incidents is its research report: Evaluation of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System as a Predictive Model released in December 2010.




Recommendation 16





The committee recommends that the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB) review existing processes for the categorisation of aviation events to ensure that miscategorisation is minimised and opportunities for system improvement are not lost.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which is already being progressed.



The consultation package that the ATSB took to industry in 2010 included proposed changes to the reporting regime to make reporting responsibilities clearer, including the categorisation of events. 


These revised regulations are currently being drafted.




Recommendation 17





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), in concert with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), consider developing and publishing guidance on model reporting to minimise understatement of the actual or potential significance of aviation events.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation with revised reporting already being progressed.




Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention already provides guidance on, and establishes standards for, the content and style of incident reports. The requirement to report is specified in the Transport Safety Investigation Act2003 and Regulations. A notification form is published on the ATSB website.



Through the work the ATSB has been undertaking with the aviation industry since 2010 on revising reporting requirements, the ATSB has been seeking to provide more advice to industry on better reporting practices. The explanatory material that will exist in support of the new regulations will provide further guidance to industry.




Recommendation 18





The committee recommends that Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) require operators to observe the highest standards of incident reporting from their personnel and provide appropriate training as part of the safety promotion function of their Safety Management System (SMS).





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which is already covered in existing safety, regulatory, legislative and oversight provisions.





The Civil Aviation Orders (CAO) 82.3 and 82.5 set out the minimum requirements for a SMS. 





These orders both require safety promotion systems and specifically list safety communication as a requirement that is documented in an operator's SMS. CASA has also developed a Civil Aviation Advisory Publication on these matters.



An operator must be able to demonstrate to CASA that they have developed an effective hazard identification and risk management process as part of their SMS, and that this has been communicated to all operational personnel.


These personnel in turn must have received appropriate training in hazard identification so as to more effectively identify potential hazards in their workplace and report them into the SMS.


CASA's regular surveillance of operators also involves the monitoring of SMS performance within the operator's system, which includes consideration of the continuing capability of reporting and associated safety data processes.




Recommendation 19





The committee recommends that, in order to enhance 'just culture' and open reporting of incidents, aviation operators should ensure that their relevant managers are adequately trained in procedural fairness.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation.





The implementation of the recommendation is a matter for aviation operators
. 





However, it is noted that CASA
'
s Civil Aviation Advisory Publication (CAAP SMS-1(0) 
- Safety Management Systems for Regular Public Transport Operations) already refers to concepts of 
'
just culture
'
 in the context of an operator
'
s organisation.





Recommendation 20





The committee recommends that, following the release of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) fatigue guidelines, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) should expedite necessary changes and/or additions to the regulations governing flight and cabin crew fatigue risk management as a priority. 





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which is already being progressed.





Since the Senate Committee
'
s report was completed, there has been a major international development in consideration of fatigue matters with the release by ICAO of an amendment to Annex 6 of its Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) and the provision of guidance material in relation to managing fatigue for aviation personnel.





CASA is currently conducting a standards development project relating to fatigue management and has invited the participation of key stakeholders in a Working Group to progress the assessment of ICAO
'
s advice with a view to implementing the SARPs, where appropriate, into the Australian regulatory framework
. 





The Working Group commenced its consideration of these important issues in October 2011
. 
It is further expected that CASA will be providing a regulatory proposal for public comment early in 2012 for flight crew and by mid-2012 for cabin crew.





Recommendation 21





The committee recommends that, in the event that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) fatigue guidelines do not extend to cabin crew duty limits and fatigue risk management more broadly, the Government should amend the 
Civil Aviation Act 1988 
to include cabin crew fatigue risk management under the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's (CASA) regulatory oversight.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation.





However the recommendation is no longer required as the amended ICAO SARPs for fatigue risk management cover cabin crew.





Recommendation 22




The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) specify the type of training and amount of training required for cabin crew, including mandatory English language standards.





Response





The Government supports the recommendation in-principle.




The proposed new CASR Sub-part 121(O) covering 'Air Transport Operations by Large Aeroplanes'will introduce thorough, comprehensive requirements relating to cabin crew training and checking. 



These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of the year.





While English is the international language used by domestic and international cabin crews, ICAO does not specify English language proficiency standards for cabin crew as such
. 
However noting the Committee
'
s recommendation, CASA will assess the need for such an inclusion in its assessment of the relevant proposed new Operations regulations.

Aviation safety
—
Our most important priority





In December 2009 the Australian Government released the National Aviation White Paper, Flight Path to the Future, Australia
'
s first ever comprehensive national aviation policy.



The White Paper confirmed that aviation safety is the Government's first and foremost priority in aviation.


The Government is committed to enhancing aviation safety and maintaining Australia's internationally regarded high quality aviation safety standards and performance. 


This commitment was reiterated in the Ministerial Statement on Air Safety tabled by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport on 4 July 2011.


Many of the aviation safety initiatives outlined in the Aviation White Paper cover issues examined by the Senate Committee's report.


In particular, the Government has acted on the safety funding and regulatory reform issues outlined in the Committee's recommendations. 


In the May 2010 Budget the Government announced an additional $89.9 million in funding for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) over four years.


This additional funding is being used to fund almost 100 new and ongoing staff in key surveillance roles, and to invest in the development and maintenance of safety standards and regulatory development. 


The additional funding is also providing for expanded and ongoing training for CASA staff and to make sure there are sufficient resources to properly regulate Australian administered airspace, which covers almost eleven per cent of the earth's surface. 


This funding represented an unprecedented 30 per cent increase in CASA funding and provides some long term stability in the Authority's funding base.

The Committee examined a range of issues related to the aviation safety regulatory framework for pilot training, the regulatory reform program and CASA funding, incident reporting and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's (ATSB's) processes, as well as fatigue management and cabin crew training requirements.


The Government's responses to the Committee's twenty two recommendations are attached. These responses have been developed in close consultation with Australia's two key independent aviation safety agencies, CASA and the ATSB. 


The Government's response highlights that most of the recommendations are already being addressed through funding, regulatory reform and reporting initiatives of this Government.

CASA is not aware of any ICAO Contracting State that requires a co-pilot to hold an ATPL and further notes that, in many countries, employment as a co-pilot is the only available pathway for a pilot to accumulate the aeronautical experience required for the granting of an ATPL.





However under the proposed new Part 61 of the 
Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1988 (CASR) 
CASA plans to introduce a requirement for captains and co-pilots to hold the same type of rating qualification and instrument rating and receive the same level of training (for example, stalling and some engine failure manoeuvres during take-off).





These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of November 2011.





Recommendation 2





The committee recommends that for non-jet operations which employ low-experience first officers, operators be required to provide enhanced supervision and mentoring schemes to offset such lack of experience.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.




CASA is reviewing existing criteria in relation to induction and line training requirements for flight crew deemed to have low experience levels.  This will be done in consultation with industry stakeholders and any changes to these criteria would be applicable for all pilots conducting regular public transport (RPT) operations.




The new draft Operations regulations currently being developed by CASA will also detail the responsibilities of aircraft operators before they assign new or low experienced crew members to a flight.





Recommendation 3





The committee recommends that Air Operators Certificate (AOC) holders be required to develop and implement 'green on green' policy positions relating to the use of low experience pilots in RPT operations, to maximise, wherever possible, the collective experience level of flight crew.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.



The proposed new CASR Part 121 covering 'Air Transport Operations by Large Aeroplanes' includes a provision that would require operators to establish procedures to ensure that inexperienced flight crew members are not crewed together.


CASA has also developed ""Acceptable Means of Compliance"" guidance material to assist operators address the regulatory requirements in the development of their crewing practices.




These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment early in 2012.





Recommendation 4





The committee recommends that Civil Aviation Safety Regulation (CASR) Part 61 ensure that all prospective regular public transport (RPT) pilots be required to complete substantial course-based training in multi-crew operations and resource management (non-technical skills) and human factors training prior to, or in reasonable proximity to, initial endorsement training; the committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) 
expedite, and assign the highest priority to, the implementation of CASR Part


61.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.



The proposed CASR Part 61 introduces a requirement into the flight crew licensing system for a pilot conducting multi-crew operations to have completed a course of multi-crew co-operation training that includes theoretical and practical application of human factors or non-technical skills competencies (including Crew Resource Management). 




These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of November 2011.





Recommendation 5





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) ensure that Part 61 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations currently being reviewed place sufficient weight on multi-engine aeroplane experience as opposed to the current recognition of glider and ultra-light experience.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.





CASA has confirmed that the proposed CASR Part 61 
'
Flight Crew Licensing
'
 prescribes minimum aeronautical experience requirements that meet or exceed the experience standards specified in 
Annex 1 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (i.e. the Chicago Convention) 
for each aircraft category rating on a flight crew licence. 





Furthermore, the new regulations would require that the total experience requirements specified for an integrated course of training be conducted in a recognised aeroplane, that is, an aeroplane that is registered by CASA, by another ICAO contracting state or is operated by the Defence Force of Australia or of another contracting state
. 




Aeronautical experience accumulated in gliders or ultra-light aircraft may be used to satisfy part of the requirements specified for a licence, although competency-based training ensures an applicant has been assessed as competent to perform a task to the standards specified for the licence in a recognised aeroplane
. 





These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of November 2011.





Recommendation 6





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) be required to undertake a risk assessment of current simulator training to assess whether the extent, aims and scope of such training is being utilised to achieve optimum safety outcomes rather than minimum compliance objectives.





Response




The Government does not support this recommendation as CASA has confirmed that the existing legislative and oversight regulatory framework already covers this type of training activity. The conduct of aircraft endorsement and recurrent training in an approved simulator is already subject to CASA oversight and CASA currently assesses and approves the relevant training programs used by RPT operators.


CASA is currently considering implementing regulatory changes that will increase the use of simulators for flight training and checking activities, including the conduct of certain emergency procedures, which can be more safely and effectively conducted in a simulator than in the actual aircraft. This work is being undertaken with regard to risk assessment requirements and cost benefit considerations.


It is expected that CASA will be putting out for public comment an updated proposal on simulator training by the end of November 2011.




Recommendation 7





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) expedite, and assign the highest priority to, the implementation of Civil Aviation Safety Regulations (CASR) Part 141 'Flight Training Operators' and Part 142 'Training and Checking Operators'.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.



The Government has already put in place a dedicated regulatory drafting task force involving specialists from CASA and the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing. 



CASA is expected to release draft regulations for CASR Parts 141 and 142 for public comment by the end of November 2011. 




Recommendation 8





The committee recommends that the Government require the Productivity Commission or another suitable body to undertake a review of the current and future supply of pilots in Australia, with particular reference to the general aviation and cadet training pathways, and HECS HELP and VET FEEHELP arrangements.





Response





The Government does not support this recommendation.





Skills Australia, an independent statutory authority, currently provides advice on Australia
'
s current, emerging and future workforce skills and development needs
. 
Skills Australia will be replaced in 2012 by the National Workforce and Productivity Agency, which will continue to have responsibility for providing workforce development and sector and regional skills planning advice to Government and industry.





Assisted by the expanded role of the Transport and Logistics Industry Skills Council, which has developed training packages for the aviation industry to improve planning and skills development for key occupations such as pilots, these agencies are well placed to examine future demand and supply issues in relation to pilots in Australia.





Recommendation 9





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and Australian aviation operators review the final findings of France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis into Air France 447, including 
consideration of how it may apply in the Australian context
. 
Subject to those findings, the committee may seek the approval of the Senate to conduct a further hearing in relation to the matter.





Response





The Government supports this recommendation as it confirms current agency practice.




Australia
'
s independent safety regulatory and investigatory agencies, CASA and the ATSB, and industry, routinely examine the outcomes of accident investigations and consider their implications for the safety of Australian aircraft operations.



Both agencies are monitoring the French investigation into the accident of Air France Flight 447 and when the findings of the final report have been issued, which is expected next year, CASA and the ATSB will review any implications for Australian aviation.




Recommendation 10





The committee recommends that the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport provide a report to Parliament every six months outlining the progress of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's (CASA) regulatory reforms and specifying reform priorities, consultative processes and implementation targets for the following 12-month period.





Response





The Government does not support this recommendation.




The Government notes that progress with the regulatory reform program is already reported to Parliament through various forums including CASA's annual report, briefing and information provided at Senate Estimates hearings and through CASA's regular meetings with industry stakeholders. 



Regulatory reform activities, including consultation undertaken, are detailed on the CASA website and in the Explanatory Statements and Instruments registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments.




Recommendation 11





The committee recommends that the Government undertake a review of the funding to 
the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) to ensure that there is sufficient specific funding to support an expedited regulatory reform process.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation.



The review of CASA's funding was completed by the Government as part of the Aviation White Paper process and an additional $89.9 million in funding for CASA over four years was announced in the 2010 Budget. Part of this funding is being used on the regulatory reform program.




Recommendation 12





The committee recommends that, as an ongoing measure, the Government provide the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) with specific funding to enable it to offer salaries that are competitive with industry; in addition, or as an alternative, the Government should consider implementing formal mechanisms for the sharing of expertise between industry and CASA.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which has already been implemented.



The Government provided an additional $89.9 million in funding for CASA over four years announced in the 2010 Budget.



The CASA Board has confirmed that with the additional funding provided by the Government that CASA is now adequately funded to meet the challenges and performance expected of a world-class aviation safety regulator.




Recommendation 13





The committee recommends that the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment (Incident Reports) Bill 2010 not be passed.





Response





The Government supports this recommendation.



The submissions made by the ATSB and CASA in relation to this matter are referred to by the committee in formulating this recommendation. The submissions continue to represent the position of both organisations.




Recommendation 14





The committee recommends that the current prescriptive approach needs to be supplemented with a general obligation to report whenever the 'responsible person' believes that there is an urgent safety risk that must be addressed.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which is already being progressed.



The Government notes that the consultation package on reforms to the mandatory incident reporting scheme in the Transport Safety Investigations Regulations 2003, which the ATSB took to industry last year, included proposed changes to the reporting regime to make reporting responsibilities clearer, including when there is an urgent safety risk. 


These revised regulations are currently being drafted.



To the extent the recommendation refers to reporting processes within Safety Management Systems, CASA is taking these considerations into account. CASA will be looking to the outcome of the work ICAO is currently undertaking in this regard, in which Australia is actively engaged.




Recommendation 15





The committee recommends that the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB) review its approach to the investigation and publication of human factors with a view to achieving a more robust and useful learning tool for the industry.





Response





The Government supports this recommendation in-principle.




The ATSB already has a robust approach to the investigation and publication of human factor issues which was recognised in 2009 when the ATSB received an award from the International Society of Air Safety Investigators for its world-leading work in human factors.


An example of the ATSB's continuing commitment and approach to investigations into human factors to help explain accidents and incidents is its research report: Evaluation of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System as a Predictive Model released in December 2010.




Recommendation 16





The committee recommends that the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB) review existing processes for the categorisation of aviation events to ensure that miscategorisation is minimised and opportunities for system improvement are not lost.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which is already being progressed.



The consultation package that the ATSB took to industry in 2010 included proposed changes to the reporting regime to make reporting responsibilities clearer, including the categorisation of events. 


These revised regulations are currently being drafted.




Recommendation 17





The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), in concert with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), consider developing and publishing guidance on model reporting to minimise understatement of the actual or potential significance of aviation events.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation with revised reporting already being progressed.




Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention already provides guidance on, and establishes standards for, the content and style of incident reports. The requirement to report is specified in the Transport Safety Investigation Act2003 and Regulations. A notification form is published on the ATSB website.



Through the work the ATSB has been undertaking with the aviation industry since 2010 on revising reporting requirements, the ATSB has been seeking to provide more advice to industry on better reporting practices. The explanatory material that will exist in support of the new regulations will provide further guidance to industry.




Recommendation 18





The committee recommends that Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) require operators to observe the highest standards of incident reporting from their personnel and provide appropriate training as part of the safety promotion function of their Safety Management System (SMS).





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which is already covered in existing safety, regulatory, legislative and oversight provisions.





The Civil Aviation Orders (CAO) 82.3 and 82.5 set out the minimum requirements for a SMS. 





These orders both require safety promotion systems and specifically list safety communication as a requirement that is documented in an operator's SMS. CASA has also developed a Civil Aviation Advisory Publication on these matters.



An operator must be able to demonstrate to CASA that they have developed an effective hazard identification and risk management process as part of their SMS, and that this has been communicated to all operational personnel.


These personnel in turn must have received appropriate training in hazard identification so as to more effectively identify potential hazards in their workplace and report them into the SMS.


CASA's regular surveillance of operators also involves the monitoring of SMS performance within the operator's system, which includes consideration of the continuing capability of reporting and associated safety data processes.




Recommendation 19





The committee recommends that, in order to enhance 'just culture' and open reporting of incidents, aviation operators should ensure that their relevant managers are adequately trained in procedural fairness.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation.





The implementation of the recommendation is a matter for aviation operators
. 





However, it is noted that CASA
'
s Civil Aviation Advisory Publication (CAAP SMS-1(0) 
- Safety Management Systems for Regular Public Transport Operations) already refers to concepts of 
'
just culture
'
 in the context of an operator
'
s organisation.





Recommendation 20





The committee recommends that, following the release of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) fatigue guidelines, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) should expedite necessary changes and/or additions to the regulations governing flight and cabin crew fatigue risk management as a priority. 





Response





The Government notes this recommendation which is already being progressed.





Since the Senate Committee
'
s report was completed, there has been a major international development in consideration of fatigue matters with the release by ICAO of an amendment to Annex 6 of its Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) and the provision of guidance material in relation to managing fatigue for aviation personnel.





CASA is currently conducting a standards development project relating to fatigue management and has invited the participation of key stakeholders in a Working Group to progress the assessment of ICAO
'
s advice with a view to implementing the SARPs, where appropriate, into the Australian regulatory framework
. 





The Working Group commenced its consideration of these important issues in October 2011
. 
It is further expected that CASA will be providing a regulatory proposal for public comment early in 2012 for flight crew and by mid-2012 for cabin crew.





Recommendation 21





The committee recommends that, in the event that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) fatigue guidelines do not extend to cabin crew duty limits and fatigue risk management more broadly, the Government should amend the 
Civil Aviation Act 1988 
to include cabin crew fatigue risk management under the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's (CASA) regulatory oversight.





Response





The Government notes this recommendation.





However the recommendation is no longer required as the amended ICAO SARPs for fatigue risk management cover cabin crew.





Recommendation 22




The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) specify the type of training and amount of training required for cabin crew, including mandatory English language standards.





Response





The Government supports the recommendation in-principle.




The proposed new CASR Sub-part 121(O) covering 'Air Transport Operations by Large Aeroplanes'will introduce thorough, comprehensive requirements relating to cabin crew training and checking. 



These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of the year.





While English is the international language used by domestic and international cabin crews, ICAO does not specify English language proficiency standards for cabin crew as such
. 
However noting the Committee
'
s recommendation, CASA will assess the need for such an inclusion in its assessment of the relevant proposed new Operations regulations.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (17:19):  On behalf of the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the 122nd report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on treaties tabled on 23 August 2011, 13 and 20 September 2011 and 13 October 2011. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.


Leave granted.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I am pleased to present this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, report no. 122, which contains the committee's views on a series of treaties tabled in the parliament on 23 August, 13 and 20 September and 13 October 2011. This contains a range of agreements, as I indicated, and one of the more important agreements covered in this report is the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, of which the committee has approved.


This treaty will establish an international framework for criminalising certain conduct relating to nuclear material and other radioactive substances or devices. The convention lists a series of crimes specifically related to nuclear terrorism, including performing an act of terrorism with nuclear materials, planning or threatening such acts or acting in support of such acts. The convention encourages international cooperation to prevent such crimes, which I am sure all members of the Senate would agree come with enormous potential consequences, and encourages further international cooperation to ensure such crimes are investigated and prosecuted and ensure the extradition of persons who commit such crimes. Although Australian legislation largely covers the treaty's requirements, the treaty's provisions will strengthen our already existing legislation.


As all members of this place and indeed all Australians recognise, the issue of international terrorism has had a high profile over the last decade since the tragic terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September, 2001 and following attacks, particularly those in Bali, targeting many Australians. The idea that terrorists could get access to either nuclear weapons or nuclear material is of grave concern to the international community and, of course, to all Australians, hence Australia's strong support for all international efforts to ensure that this outcome does not occur and the welcoming of this treaty as a step to hopefully strengthening our resolve and actions in that regard.


On a related issue, the committee also examined and approved the agreement between the government of Australia and the European Atomic Energy Community, otherwise known as Euratom, for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The treaty governs cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and is consistent with Australia's other bilateral agreements. It is also Australia's first such agreement to include specific provisions on nuclear safety.


As I indicated, the treaty with Euratom for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is consistent with our other bilateral agreements. It is part of the very high benchmark that Australia sets—one of the highest in the world—for the export of uranium for peaceful purposes with the countries to which we export. It is a benchmark that one would expect to be applied equally in any agreement that might be struck with India.


I cannot help but note the difficulty the government has got itself into over the export of uranium to India. The Labor Party has long been tied up in knots when it comes to uranium mining and the export of uranium. I well remember the early debates in my home state about whether uranium should be mined, whether Olympic Dam should be established and whether uranium should be mined from a site such as Olympic Dam. I remember that former Premier Mike Rann when he was but a backbencher strongly opposed the establishment of the Olympic Dam mine.




Senator Feeney:
  He's the hero of Olympic Dam; it's his mine!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Yet at the end of his career he was proclaiming it, as Senator Feeney rightly says, as his mine. It was quite a conversion that Premier Rann underwent during his time in public office. It was a not dissimilar conversion to that which the new South Australian Premier has undergone. He also is someone from the Left of the Labor Party who would always have opposed the export of uranium to India, but he was very quick, as the new Premier, to spruik Olympic Dam and its economic benefits to South Australia.




Senator Feeney:
  The power of common sense.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I do welcome the conversions of former Premier Rann and new Premier Weatherill to positions recognising the economic common sense of pursuing uranium mining and exporting it for safe and peaceful purposes to relevant countries. On 18 September 2008, the Hansard reminds me, I spoke about a Treaties Committee report about a very similar agreement on the export of uranium and nuclear materials to Russia for peaceful purposes. At that time, the Labor members, the government members, of the Treaties Committee opposed the ratification of that agreement. So we had the perverse situation where Australia had set in place an agreement to export uranium to China but the government was saying, 'We're not sure about Russia'. The leadership was saying, 'We're all for the export to Russia,' yet the Labor members of the Treaties Committee said no to ratification of the Russian agreement. Of course, the government was saying no outright to India then.


I welcome the conversion of the Prime Minister which led to her saying yes to India, but I do question the motives behind the conversion. I do not believe for a moment that the Prime Minister sat in her office going over a thorough analysis of whether we should put to one side the longstanding provision of the Labor Party about the nuclear non-proliferation treaty being a prerequisite. I do not think for a moment that the Prime Minister sat there studying the implications of this change. I do not think for a moment that she sat there studying what it would mean for India and what it might mean for greenhouse gas emissions. I think quite simply that the Prime Minister decided that she wanted to pick a fight, at the national conference of the Labor Party next month, on her terms rather than having a fight on everybody else's terms, as she was being shoehorned into. It was a case of 'Let's look down the list'.




Senator Feeney:
  That sounds like a compliment!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Indeed, Senator Feeney would see it as a compliment to the Prime Minister. To a political tactician, as Senator Feeney is, I am sure it would be a compliment. I would like to think that public policy is made in a slightly wiser way. Indeed, on this side we are proud that we have shown a consistent approach to this issue—




Senator Feeney:
  Consistent! How much uranium have you sold to India over the last 10 years?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Our policy position since we were in government has been clear: we were happy to embark on this process and to work with the countries in this direction when we could see it was possible to set in place a sensible framework. The sensible framework is one that is very similar to the Euratom treaty that is being considered here. This will provide a model. I hope that we see further discussion at the international level, as the Treaties Committee has highlighted in other reports, on how we bring countries like India into a nuclear weapons convention framework, on how we actually ensure that we have responsible management of nuclear weapons in these non-NPT states. However, that does not mean that Australia should not provide uranium to a country like India, the world's largest democracy, for peaceful purposes under the same strict conditions that we impose for so many other countries.


This report covers a number of other treaties, including two providing for air services agreements between Australia and the Czech Republic and between Australia and Vietnam, as well as an exchange of notes between the government of the United States of America and the government of Australia concerning space vehicle tracking and communication facilities, which cover the centre located at Tidbinbilla here in the ACT. This agreement is a tangible expression of international cooperation in space exploration. Australia gets practical benefits from this arrangement, including overseas training for our personnel and investment in facilities in Australia. This exchange of notes will continue a productive and successful relationship that has lasted over 50 years. It is with pleasure for all of those, particularly in the ACT, who work in this facility or who have been to this facility that the committee recommends that binding treaty action be taken.


The exploration of space, while led by larger countries such as the United States, is an international endeavour. On occasion it can unite humanity in common purpose and achievement, as happened with the first moon landing. Australia has been very proud to play its role in assisting these endeavours, and such facilities are critical to them. The committee concludes that this and the other treaties covered in report No. 122 should all be supported with binding action. I thank the secretariat very much for their assistance throughout these inquiries. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Treaties Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,17,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-11-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:29):  I rise to add my comments to those of Senator Birmingham, to thank him for his work and, as ever, thank the secretariat and staff of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for their work. Unfortunately, in this instance, the committee has let us down and missed a very important opportunity to reassess the sale of uranium to countries in Europe where most Australians, I believe, think it is going to safe pairs of hands where nothing can possibly go wrong and where meaningful safeguards are in place. In the wake of the horrific disaster in Japan earlier this year, the tabling of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report No. 122 this afternoon gives us an opportunity to pause, take breath and look at what actually happens. We do not agree that this treaty should simply be uncritically renewed, as essentially the majority report indicates.


What is happening here demonstrates a fundamental denial of the risk of the uranium trade. It glosses over the steep decline in nuclear capacity in Europe. The industry there has been in decline literally for decades—since the early 1980s—and it perpetuates the delusion that the safeguards regime actually provides meaningful safeguards. It provides political safeguards. The safeguards regime that is spoken of at such length in this report is political safeguards. It allows the Prime Minister to wave her hand and say: 'We have accounted for Australian obligated uranium in nuclear material. Their safeguard system is in place.' I suspect that very few people who get up in this place and talk with such confidence about the safeguards regime have the foggiest idea of what is involved at both an accounting and an enforcement level. 


Key European players like Germany and Switzerland are pulling out of the nuclear industry, Austria and other European countries have formed an anti-nuclear block to push for a nuclear-free Europe, and nuclear energy has been in decline in the eurozone for many decades. This treaty says that it is the first agreement to include specific provisions on nuclear safety. So we thought that was interesting and that it was good that the treaties committee had dug into that a bit as the first agreement of its kind to include provisions on nuclear safety. We dug into it to work out exactly what it was invoking, and it turns out that it simply notes the existence of four pre-existing treaties. That is all it does—it invokes four pieces of paper that already existed. As demonstrated by the events at Windscale—now known as Sellafield, because after the fire there they had to change the name of the place—Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and now Fukushima, you cannot do nuclear safety by simply cross-referencing bits of paper. Senior officials have now admitted that Australian obligated nuclear material was at the Fukushima Daiichi site—probably in all of the destroyed reactors. That does not seem to have sunk in with this government. 


Renegotiating this treaty was an opportunity for Australia to demonstrate that it has learned something from the disaster in Japan, but after the glib and rather dismissive comments of Senator Birmingham just now we will wait and see if anything of sense is put on the record by the government. I find it difficult to imagine how bad a nuclear disaster has to get for Australian policy makers to wake up. Although many people think having a triple or quadruple full-scale meltdown on Japan's Pacific Coast is a worst-case scenario, it is not. These things can get worse, and Japanese authorities are now reporting what they believe may be continuing fission events inside the melted fuel at the base of one or more of the reactors in Japan, which are throwing out certain types of isotopes that occur only when fission is operating. In other words, these reactors, in some uncontrolled form, could start up again because the moderators that keep these plants from blowing themselves all across the landscape have melted along with the fuel and are now lying in a puddle at the base of the reactors, having gone right through the floor.


The Japanese authorities and the IAEA are now starting to report hints that occasional criticality or fission events may still be occurring. We may not yet have seen the worst of a disaster. Authorities there now freely admit they are not sure how they are going to bring those plants under control. How do you do that when you have got in the order of 1,000 tonnes of melted uranium fuel lying in a blazing heap that has gone part way through the floor of the reactor buildings on an earthquake-prone coast? What are they supposed to do, when human beings will never go inside those containment vessels or inside the core of those plants again? What exactly is the proposal? Yet the Australian government, with the full and uncritical support of the opposition, intends through instruments like this treaty to just keep shovelling the stuff out the door. 


Now there is the madness of India. If we thought the Japanese run a tight ship, and they do—I would say they probably run one of the safest nuclear industries in the world, yet they have lost control of a complex of six plants—how much do senators in this place know about the Indian civil nuclear industry? Obviously, they know very little; otherwise, the proposal of the Prime Minister on the weekend would have sent up, at least from the opposition, some whimpers of opposition. We are used to Tony Abbott saying no and this would have been one opportunity when it would have been handy—but no, Senator Birmingham has rubber stamped that as well. 


Learn a little bit about the history of civil nuclear energy in India before we race down this path of shovelling this material to plants all across the Indian subcontinent, because the long and honourable history of the anti-nuclear movement in India will tell you there are very good reasons why people are staging sit-ins and hunger strikes at the moment at the site of a plant that is under construction by, of all people, the Russian government. There is a reason that people are putting their bodies on the line and it is that they are sick of being showered in radioactive fallout from the normal operating practices of nuclear plants in India. The reason we do not have nuclear plants in Australia is that people do not want them in their backyard. I do not want them in other people's backyards either. It is long past the time that Australia took some responsibility for what happens to these concentrates when we put them on boats, wave them goodbye and count the meagre export revenues that, for some reason, MPs in both the major parties seem to think are so much more than they actually are. Less than a third of one per cent of our export revenue comes from this toxic, destructive and obsolete trade. Yet somehow it has been painted as some sort of economic saviour, even as the mining boom is warping and damaging other parts of our economy. Why do we not take a proper look at the lessons that could be learnt from the horrific suffering in Japan, right across eastern and western Europe in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster and in the various and numerous other parts of the world where near misses have almost depopulated huge areas and huge population centres? 


So this report on trade to Europe is a mistake. It is a brazen illustration that the government and the opposition are deter­mined not to learn the lessons of the industry. I have to ask: how bad does it have to get? How many areas need to become radiation sacrifice zones? How many Aboriginal elders do you need to hear from about the destructive impact on country, on culture and on water here in Australia? How bad does it need to get? All I am asking before we rubber-stamp this thing and push this treaty through the parliament is that people simply learn the lessons not just of history but of what is going on right around us right now in the countries to which we export this material.


Senator Birmingham was teasing Senator Feeney across the chamber before about Labor's inconsistent position. I say to the coalition: the ALP may be in the process of selling their principles out, but at least they had them to begin with. I wish Labor well for its conference in December because I think there is still a chance to rescue some sanity from the dangerous turn that this debate has taken.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2011-11-22,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (17:38):  It is important to have a look at the steps that Australia has taken to deal with the uranium that we trade with other nations. Yes, it has been pointed out we do not have a nuclear industry as such. In fact, there is only one place where we have anything to do with nuclear products in the context we are talking about today and we have to purchase those materials from other parts of the world as part of the non-proliferation treaty and return those rods. They leave the country. Of course, that place is our research facility at Lucas Heights.


As I have said often in this place, we need to remind ourselves what the consequences would be of not having such a place. We enjoy a wonderful health system in this country, and a fundamental part of that health system is access to radiopharma­ceuticals for detecting and ameliorating as much as we can within our technology the effects of cancer. Many lives are saved by its detection and removal. I do not believe that many Australians understand the full context of what we are asked to do by those people who say that we should not mine uranium, we should not use it, we should not store it and we should not be responsible for the material that we send away and return. But that has been the consistent approach of the Greens—very consistent, and at least for that I will commend them.


I will turn to the ex-Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, and his sudden embrace of the sale of uranium to India. I can recall very well what happened at the last minute, after Australia had spent so much time ensuring we had the very best possible science, after we had looked around our nation together as Australians in a project that invested millions of dollars in finding out the very best place to meet our international obligations relating to waste from the materials used in our health system. That was a very responsible approach, an approach that was not only agreed to by the Commonwealth at the time, under Labor, but also agreed to by all the states and territories. The place chosen was section 52a in South Australia. But Mike Rann at the time, with great hypocrisy, decided that he would then say, 'I agreed to all that, but now I'm changing my mind.'


Sadly, we have now wasted taxpayers' dollars. We could have invested them in other things like hospitals and schools, but instead we had to spend millions of dollars finding another place. That place is now Muckaty, in the Northern Territory. It appears that the waste will be going there. I agree that is a good place to put it—I have no problems with that—but as a Territorian I think we would all have preferred that it had gone to the best place available according to the science. We are always talking in this place about the best scientific evidence. Those are the sorts of things that we could look to.


I commend the committee on their comments on the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for Co-Operation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy. There are a lot of safety issues in Europe and I commend the sort of work that we are doing as a nation in that area. We have got to be in this game. If we want to ensure safety, we have to be a part of those negotiations. I think there has been reasonable bipartisanship in that aspect. As a Territorian I certainly think it is terrific to see that we are now going to be selling uranium to India—no doubt just for stark political reasons, but I am not necessarily here today to question motives. It is a terrific thing.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:42):  I support the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and also congratulate the acting chair, Senator Birmingham, on the role that he played in the committee. I agree that the treaties considered by the committee should be adopted, as recommended by the committee. I also want to make some comments on the treaty relating to uranium and the peaceful use and sale of uranium. It is important that Australia joins the international arrangements in relation to nuclear fuel.


I am delighted to see that the Prime Minister has adopted this position—although I am not sure whether this means the government or the Labor Party have adopted it. I read in the paper that many in the Labor Party are totally opposed, so who knows whether this is government policy or just the Prime Minister's policy or whose policy it is. I see Senator Feeney there, smiling away. Perhaps he knows the Labor Party are going to change their longstanding opposition to uranium sales to India when it comes up at the national conference. But good luck to Senator Cameron and his at least committed colleagues, who will try and maintain the Labor Party on their former path—not a path I agree with, I might say. I am delighted that Ms Gillard has now adopted the coalition's policy in relation to the sale of uranium to India.


What I really want to comment on, as a Queensland senator, naturally enough, is how this treaty might affect my state of Queensland, which, I would say with some parochial enthusiasm, has vast deposits of good quality uranium. But the Queensland Labor Party is all over the shop in relation to uranium. Premier Bligh has just made yet another commitment that she will not be mining or exporting uranium from Queens­land no matter what Ms Gillard or the Labor Party national conference says. So, clearly, the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party are at odds with our current Prime Minister, notwithstanding that Ms Bligh has just recently retired as the national chair of the ALP. So it is very difficult for us Queenslanders to understand just what is Australian Labor Party policy when it comes to uranium. 


I am more concerned up my way in the north of Queensland with the electorate of Kennedy, where there are a lot of uranium deposits. In the state seat of Mt Isa, Ms Betty Kiernan is the Labor member for that seat. It is an area which contains a lot of the reserves of uranium in our state. Ms Kiernan is very much in favour of uranium mining and uranium exporting, yet she is in a govern­ment led by a Premier and by a party that opposes uranium. This is made more interesting because the former minister for mines and energy in Queensland, Mr Tony McGrady, was the former member for the state seat of Mt Isa in the Queensland parliament. As minister for mines and energy, he opposed uranium and went along with Labor Party policy in Queensland. But, now, Mr McGrady is a lobbyist for the uranium industry. So he is actively supporting the mining and export of uranium in Queensland. I welcome Mr McGrady's conversion to the understanding of the clean and peaceful use of uranium. It is a clean fuel. If we are worried about carbon emissions, why wouldn't we be looking at clean uranium energy around the world? I am delighted that the Labor Party seem to be moving towards the selling of uranium to the biggest democracy in the world. 


Getting back to the uranium debate in my state of Queensland, which is relevant to this treaty, which the committee has reported upon, it is fascinating that I hear that Mr McGrady, the former state Labor member for Mt Isa and a former mines minister, is now an advocate for uranium and is on the same wavelength, one would think, as Ms Kiernan, the current state Labor member for Mt Isa. But I understand from my friends in the Labor Party that Mr McGrady and Ms Kiernan are sworn enemies, that Mr McGrady is doing everything possible to ensure that Ms Kiernan is not the member for Mt Isa after the next state election. I am not sure whether his enthusiasm to see the sitting Labor member defeated is due to his support for uranium these days or whether it is due to something else. But it does make it rather confusing for those of us in Queensland when trying to understand what the Australian Labor Party's view is on uranium in Queensland. I must ensure there is some time in case any Queensland Labor Party senator might want to participate in the debate and tell the rest of us exactly what Queenslanders can expect from a state government in future should it be that the Labor state government is returned at the next state election. According to all the polls, the chances of that happening are very, very slight—but you never know. 


As a voter in the state election, as a Queenslander and as one who is interested in the north of Australia and the wealth that mining has brought to Northern Australia and to North Queensland, I would be interested to know just what the Labor Party policy is in relation to uranium in Queens­land. I will watch with great interest and some fascination as to how the party that is the government of Australia, which has a firm and written policy against the sale of uranium to India, treat their Prime Minister and their leader at the national conference, after Ms Gillard, unilaterally I assume, announced that she was going to change sides on the export of uranium to India. So that is interesting and it will be a fascination for all of us in Australia. But as a Queenslander, I am particularly interested in what the Queensland Labor Party policy is in relation to this, what Ms Kiernan's view is and what Mr McGrady's view is. I again congratulate the committee on their work on these treaties. As the acting chairman has recommended, I will certainly be supporting the adoption of this report.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (17:19):  On behalf of the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the 122nd report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on treaties tabled on 23 August 2011, 13 and 20 September 2011 and 13 October 2011. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.


Leave granted.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I am pleased to present this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, report no. 122, which contains the committee's views on a series of treaties tabled in the parliament on 23 August, 13 and 20 September and 13 October 2011. This contains a range of agreements, as I indicated, and one of the more important agreements covered in this report is the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, of which the committee has approved.


This treaty will establish an international framework for criminalising certain conduct relating to nuclear material and other radioactive substances or devices. The convention lists a series of crimes specifically related to nuclear terrorism, including performing an act of terrorism with nuclear materials, planning or threatening such acts or acting in support of such acts. The convention encourages international cooperation to prevent such crimes, which I am sure all members of the Senate would agree come with enormous potential consequences, and encourages further international cooperation to ensure such crimes are investigated and prosecuted and ensure the extradition of persons who commit such crimes. Although Australian legislation largely covers the treaty's requirements, the treaty's provisions will strengthen our already existing legislation.


As all members of this place and indeed all Australians recognise, the issue of international terrorism has had a high profile over the last decade since the tragic terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September, 2001 and following attacks, particularly those in Bali, targeting many Australians. The idea that terrorists could get access to either nuclear weapons or nuclear material is of grave concern to the international community and, of course, to all Australians, hence Australia's strong support for all international efforts to ensure that this outcome does not occur and the welcoming of this treaty as a step to hopefully strengthening our resolve and actions in that regard.


On a related issue, the committee also examined and approved the agreement between the government of Australia and the European Atomic Energy Community, otherwise known as Euratom, for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The treaty governs cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and is consistent with Australia's other bilateral agreements. It is also Australia's first such agreement to include specific provisions on nuclear safety.


As I indicated, the treaty with Euratom for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is consistent with our other bilateral agreements. It is part of the very high benchmark that Australia sets—one of the highest in the world—for the export of uranium for peaceful purposes with the countries to which we export. It is a benchmark that one would expect to be applied equally in any agreement that might be struck with India.


I cannot help but note the difficulty the government has got itself into over the export of uranium to India. The Labor Party has long been tied up in knots when it comes to uranium mining and the export of uranium. I well remember the early debates in my home state about whether uranium should be mined, whether Olympic Dam should be established and whether uranium should be mined from a site such as Olympic Dam. I remember that former Premier Mike Rann when he was but a backbencher strongly opposed the establishment of the Olympic Dam mine.




Senator Feeney:
  He's the hero of Olympic Dam; it's his mine!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Yet at the end of his career he was proclaiming it, as Senator Feeney rightly says, as his mine. It was quite a conversion that Premier Rann underwent during his time in public office. It was a not dissimilar conversion to that which the new South Australian Premier has undergone. He also is someone from the Left of the Labor Party who would always have opposed the export of uranium to India, but he was very quick, as the new Premier, to spruik Olympic Dam and its economic benefits to South Australia.




Senator Feeney:
  The power of common sense.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I do welcome the conversions of former Premier Rann and new Premier Weatherill to positions recognising the economic common sense of pursuing uranium mining and exporting it for safe and peaceful purposes to relevant countries. On 18 September 2008, the Hansard reminds me, I spoke about a Treaties Committee report about a very similar agreement on the export of uranium and nuclear materials to Russia for peaceful purposes. At that time, the Labor members, the government members, of the Treaties Committee opposed the ratification of that agreement. So we had the perverse situation where Australia had set in place an agreement to export uranium to China but the government was saying, 'We're not sure about Russia'. The leadership was saying, 'We're all for the export to Russia,' yet the Labor members of the Treaties Committee said no to ratification of the Russian agreement. Of course, the government was saying no outright to India then.


I welcome the conversion of the Prime Minister which led to her saying yes to India, but I do question the motives behind the conversion. I do not believe for a moment that the Prime Minister sat in her office going over a thorough analysis of whether we should put to one side the longstanding provision of the Labor Party about the nuclear non-proliferation treaty being a prerequisite. I do not think for a moment that the Prime Minister sat there studying the implications of this change. I do not think for a moment that she sat there studying what it would mean for India and what it might mean for greenhouse gas emissions. I think quite simply that the Prime Minister decided that she wanted to pick a fight, at the national conference of the Labor Party next month, on her terms rather than having a fight on everybody else's terms, as she was being shoehorned into. It was a case of 'Let's look down the list'.




Senator Feeney:
  That sounds like a compliment!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Indeed, Senator Feeney would see it as a compliment to the Prime Minister. To a political tactician, as Senator Feeney is, I am sure it would be a compliment. I would like to think that public policy is made in a slightly wiser way. Indeed, on this side we are proud that we have shown a consistent approach to this issue—




Senator Feeney:
  Consistent! How much uranium have you sold to India over the last 10 years?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Our policy position since we were in government has been clear: we were happy to embark on this process and to work with the countries in this direction when we could see it was possible to set in place a sensible framework. The sensible framework is one that is very similar to the Euratom treaty that is being considered here. This will provide a model. I hope that we see further discussion at the international level, as the Treaties Committee has highlighted in other reports, on how we bring countries like India into a nuclear weapons convention framework, on how we actually ensure that we have responsible management of nuclear weapons in these non-NPT states. However, that does not mean that Australia should not provide uranium to a country like India, the world's largest democracy, for peaceful purposes under the same strict conditions that we impose for so many other countries.


This report covers a number of other treaties, including two providing for air services agreements between Australia and the Czech Republic and between Australia and Vietnam, as well as an exchange of notes between the government of the United States of America and the government of Australia concerning space vehicle tracking and communication facilities, which cover the centre located at Tidbinbilla here in the ACT. This agreement is a tangible expression of international cooperation in space exploration. Australia gets practical benefits from this arrangement, including overseas training for our personnel and investment in facilities in Australia. This exchange of notes will continue a productive and successful relationship that has lasted over 50 years. It is with pleasure for all of those, particularly in the ACT, who work in this facility or who have been to this facility that the committee recommends that binding treaty action be taken.


The exploration of space, while led by larger countries such as the United States, is an international endeavour. On occasion it can unite humanity in common purpose and achievement, as happened with the first moon landing. Australia has been very proud to play its role in assisting these endeavours, and such facilities are critical to them. The committee concludes that this and the other treaties covered in report No. 122 should all be supported with binding action. I thank the secretariat very much for their assistance throughout these inquiries. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,17,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-11-22,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:29):  I rise to add my comments to those of Senator Birmingham, to thank him for his work and, as ever, thank the secretariat and staff of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for their work. Unfortunately, in this instance, the committee has let us down and missed a very important opportunity to reassess the sale of uranium to countries in Europe where most Australians, I believe, think it is going to safe pairs of hands where nothing can possibly go wrong and where meaningful safeguards are in place. In the wake of the horrific disaster in Japan earlier this year, the tabling of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report No. 122 this afternoon gives us an opportunity to pause, take breath and look at what actually happens. We do not agree that this treaty should simply be uncritically renewed, as essentially the majority report indicates.


What is happening here demonstrates a fundamental denial of the risk of the uranium trade. It glosses over the steep decline in nuclear capacity in Europe. The industry there has been in decline literally for decades—since the early 1980s—and it perpetuates the delusion that the safeguards regime actually provides meaningful safeguards. It provides political safeguards. The safeguards regime that is spoken of at such length in this report is political safeguards. It allows the Prime Minister to wave her hand and say: 'We have accounted for Australian obligated uranium in nuclear material. Their safeguard system is in place.' I suspect that very few people who get up in this place and talk with such confidence about the safeguards regime have the foggiest idea of what is involved at both an accounting and an enforcement level. 


Key European players like Germany and Switzerland are pulling out of the nuclear industry, Austria and other European countries have formed an anti-nuclear block to push for a nuclear-free Europe, and nuclear energy has been in decline in the eurozone for many decades. This treaty says that it is the first agreement to include specific provisions on nuclear safety. So we thought that was interesting and that it was good that the treaties committee had dug into that a bit as the first agreement of its kind to include provisions on nuclear safety. We dug into it to work out exactly what it was invoking, and it turns out that it simply notes the existence of four pre-existing treaties. That is all it does—it invokes four pieces of paper that already existed. As demonstrated by the events at Windscale—now known as Sellafield, because after the fire there they had to change the name of the place—Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and now Fukushima, you cannot do nuclear safety by simply cross-referencing bits of paper. Senior officials have now admitted that Australian obligated nuclear material was at the Fukushima Daiichi site—probably in all of the destroyed reactors. That does not seem to have sunk in with this government. 


Renegotiating this treaty was an opportunity for Australia to demonstrate that it has learned something from the disaster in Japan, but after the glib and rather dismissive comments of Senator Birmingham just now we will wait and see if anything of sense is put on the record by the government. I find it difficult to imagine how bad a nuclear disaster has to get for Australian policy makers to wake up. Although many people think having a triple or quadruple full-scale meltdown on Japan's Pacific Coast is a worst-case scenario, it is not. These things can get worse, and Japanese authorities are now reporting what they believe may be continuing fission events inside the melted fuel at the base of one or more of the reactors in Japan, which are throwing out certain types of isotopes that occur only when fission is operating. In other words, these reactors, in some uncontrolled form, could start up again because the moderators that keep these plants from blowing themselves all across the landscape have melted along with the fuel and are now lying in a puddle at the base of the reactors, having gone right through the floor.


The Japanese authorities and the IAEA are now starting to report hints that occasional criticality or fission events may still be occurring. We may not yet have seen the worst of a disaster. Authorities there now freely admit they are not sure how they are going to bring those plants under control. How do you do that when you have got in the order of 1,000 tonnes of melted uranium fuel lying in a blazing heap that has gone part way through the floor of the reactor buildings on an earthquake-prone coast? What are they supposed to do, when human beings will never go inside those containment vessels or inside the core of those plants again? What exactly is the proposal? Yet the Australian government, with the full and uncritical support of the opposition, intends through instruments like this treaty to just keep shovelling the stuff out the door. 


Now there is the madness of India. If we thought the Japanese run a tight ship, and they do—I would say they probably run one of the safest nuclear industries in the world, yet they have lost control of a complex of six plants—how much do senators in this place know about the Indian civil nuclear industry? Obviously, they know very little; otherwise, the proposal of the Prime Minister on the weekend would have sent up, at least from the opposition, some whimpers of opposition. We are used to Tony Abbott saying no and this would have been one opportunity when it would have been handy—but no, Senator Birmingham has rubber stamped that as well. 


Learn a little bit about the history of civil nuclear energy in India before we race down this path of shovelling this material to plants all across the Indian subcontinent, because the long and honourable history of the anti-nuclear movement in India will tell you there are very good reasons why people are staging sit-ins and hunger strikes at the moment at the site of a plant that is under construction by, of all people, the Russian government. There is a reason that people are putting their bodies on the line and it is that they are sick of being showered in radioactive fallout from the normal operating practices of nuclear plants in India. The reason we do not have nuclear plants in Australia is that people do not want them in their backyard. I do not want them in other people's backyards either. It is long past the time that Australia took some responsibility for what happens to these concentrates when we put them on boats, wave them goodbye and count the meagre export revenues that, for some reason, MPs in both the major parties seem to think are so much more than they actually are. Less than a third of one per cent of our export revenue comes from this toxic, destructive and obsolete trade. Yet somehow it has been painted as some sort of economic saviour, even as the mining boom is warping and damaging other parts of our economy. Why do we not take a proper look at the lessons that could be learnt from the horrific suffering in Japan, right across eastern and western Europe in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster and in the various and numerous other parts of the world where near misses have almost depopulated huge areas and huge population centres? 


So this report on trade to Europe is a mistake. It is a brazen illustration that the government and the opposition are deter­mined not to learn the lessons of the industry. I have to ask: how bad does it have to get? How many areas need to become radiation sacrifice zones? How many Aboriginal elders do you need to hear from about the destructive impact on country, on culture and on water here in Australia? How bad does it need to get? All I am asking before we rubber-stamp this thing and push this treaty through the parliament is that people simply learn the lessons not just of history but of what is going on right around us right now in the countries to which we export this material.


Senator Birmingham was teasing Senator Feeney across the chamber before about Labor's inconsistent position. I say to the coalition: the ALP may be in the process of selling their principles out, but at least they had them to begin with. I wish Labor well for its conference in December because I think there is still a chance to rescue some sanity from the dangerous turn that this debate has taken.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (17:38):  It is important to have a look at the steps that Australia has taken to deal with the uranium that we trade with other nations. Yes, it has been pointed out we do not have a nuclear industry as such. In fact, there is only one place where we have anything to do with nuclear products in the context we are talking about today and we have to purchase those materials from other parts of the world as part of the non-proliferation treaty and return those rods. They leave the country. Of course, that place is our research facility at Lucas Heights.


As I have said often in this place, we need to remind ourselves what the consequences would be of not having such a place. We enjoy a wonderful health system in this country, and a fundamental part of that health system is access to radiopharma­ceuticals for detecting and ameliorating as much as we can within our technology the effects of cancer. Many lives are saved by its detection and removal. I do not believe that many Australians understand the full context of what we are asked to do by those people who say that we should not mine uranium, we should not use it, we should not store it and we should not be responsible for the material that we send away and return. But that has been the consistent approach of the Greens—very consistent, and at least for that I will commend them.

implement the Treaty Between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America Concerning Defense Trade Cooperation, and


strengthen Australia’s controls over activities involving defence and dual-use goods, and related technology and services.




Treaty implementation



This year marks the 60th anniversary of the ANZUS alliance.


Australia’s alliance with the United States is our most important defence relationship and the foundation stone of our foreign policy and national security arrangements.  


Four years ago, Australia signed a treaty with the United States to create a framework for two-way trade in defence articles between 'trusted communities' without the need for export licences.  


On 14 March 2008, the Implementing Arrangement for the treaty was signed and the treaty was tabled in parliament for consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.


On 18 September 2008, the committee recommended that the Australian government implement the treaty in domestic law.  


On 29 September last year, the US Senate recommended ratification of the treaty. This followed the passage of the treaty’s implementing legislation through the US Congress on 28 September 2010. 


This important step was the catalyst for the Australian Department of Defence to develop the necessary legislation.


This bill is the result of that work, and is required before the treaty can enter into force.




Treaty Benefits



Companies in Australia and the United States do a lot of work together to provide the equipment our Defence Forces need to do their job.


Cooperation in defence capability and technology is one of the most important elements of the alliance.  


About 50 per cent of Australia’s war-fighting assets are sourced from the United States, and we will replace or upgrade up to 85 per cent of our military equipment over the next 10 to 15 years.


Strengthening this area of our alliance cooperation is therefore clearly in our national interest.


Currently, Australian companies that need access to defence items or technology from the United States must seek an export licence from the US Department of State in accordance with their International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR system.


Under the ITAR system, individual licences are required for each export application and can often be the subject of delays.


The treaty removes the requirement for individual licences to be obtained for each export, and allows for the licence-free movement of eligible defence articles within the approved Australian and US communities.  


For companies that are part of the Approved Community, this will save time and money.  


For the Australian Defence Force the treaty will also improve interoperability with US Armed Forces, by making it easier for both militaries to share common equipment and spares during exercises and operations.




Treaty Operation



The Australian Approved Community will consist of government agencies, companies that are approved as community members and their eligible employees.  


Approval of an applicant for membership of the Australian Community will include consideration of a range of factors including: 


any convictions for export control offences; 


the level of foreign ownership or control; and 


prejudice to the security, defence or international relations of Australia. 


The bill sets out the framework in which the Australian Community will trade in Defence Articles with US Community members.  


Membership of the Approved Community is voluntary and brings with it obligations.


Members of the Approved Community will have to comply with certain security and administrative requirements to protect the US technology they will have access to.   


There are offences for Australian Community members who do not comply with the terms of their approval or operate outside the framework of the Approved Communities.  


To ensure that Australian Community members comply with the treaty obligations, the bill will provide the government with monitoring powers that will be exercised by Authorised Officers who have appropriate qualifications and relevant experience.  


These measures will enhance the cooperation and interoperability of the Australian and the United States Defence Forces and defence industries.  


It is expected that Australian Community members will also be better positioned to bid for US government defence projects that will require access to US defence articles regulated by the ITAR system.




Industry Consultation



This bill is the result of extensive consultation with the Australian defence industry.


This has been led by Mr Ken Peacock AM, an experienced former CEO of a major defence company.


The treaty process must be easier to use and more commercially attractive than using the current ITAR system, otherwise it will not be a success.


That’s why the government has consulted with Australian industry –large and small. 


This consultation has been conducted over three major stages:


   Stage 1 was meetings with industry in eight capital cities and regional centres in December last year.


   Stage 2 was the establishment of the Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty Industry Advisory Panel in May this year.  


   The panel includes experts from major Australian defence companies, small-to-medium businesses and the Department of 


Defence and has provided  important advice on the development of this bill.


   Stage 3 was the release of the exposure draft of the bill for broader industry and community feedback in July this year.


This consultation process has been extremely valuable, and can I take this opportunity to thank Mr Peacock for his work and leadership of this process.


Industry raised a number of important issues during the consultation process.  These included:


implementation details;


transition arrangements for moving from the current system to the new arrangements;


the costs and complexity involved in operating as part of the Approved Community;


the monitoring powers of Authorised Officers; 


interpretation of brokering as an activity; and


the level of support to be provided to small to medium enterprises that want to become Approved Community Members.


This feedback has led to a number of important changes to the bill and explanatory memorandum.


These include:


The definition of Australian person in section 4 – which has been amended to clarify that it includes an individual who is a holder of a permanent visa under the Migration Act to provide further certainty for industry.


The Defense Trade Cooperation Munitions List in section 36 – which has been amended to allow the minister to list in one place those goods that are within the scope of the treaty and those that are exempt from the scope of the treaty. This will provide certainty and make it easier for industry to comply with the provisions of the bill and treaty obligations.


The powers of an Authorised Officer at section 41 have also been amended to require an Authorised Officer to provide at least 24 hours notice of the intention to enter the premises of a member of the Australian Community. This change was made in response to concerns expressed by industry, to reflect the fact that the purpose of the Authorised Officers is to monitor and encourage industry compliance with treaty obligations rather than simply to enforce those obligations.  


The explanatory memorandum has also been amended to provide further guidance on the concept of “arranging” for the purposes of brokering trade in defence and strategic goods, technology and services.


All of these decisions were made based on feedback from the consultation process.


The Department of Defence will allocate resources including training, to assist individuals and companies to comply with the new legislation.


The government has also made the decision not to charge industry for approvals, registrations or security clearances associated with the bill.




Next Steps



Before the treaty can become operational, there is a lot of work to do:


the draft regulations for this bill will be released for industry consultation;


the United States will move forward with its implementing arrangements; 


the Australian and US governments will work together on a Pathfinder Program to test the treaty framework; and


the Department of Defence will complete its transition planning, including introducing a new IT system to support the Treaty and new strengthened export controls.


Within two years of the treaty coming into force the Department of Defence will also conduct a Post Implementation Review of the treaty provisions of this bill.  


This review will be presented to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.




Regulations



The draft regulations will be released before the end of the year.  They will be subject to further significant consultation with industry.


That will include consultation with the Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty Industry Advisory Panel chaired by Mr Ken Peacock. 


The regulations will include:


requirements to be satisfied by an employee or contractor for Australian Community membership;


key conditions of approval for Australian Community membership;


exceptions to treaty offences;


record keeping requirements for Australian Community members;


compliance reporting requirements for Australian Community members;


process for being approved as an intermediate consignee;


exceptions to the offences for supply of technology or the provisions of defence services;


record keeping requirements for permit holders and brokers;


identification cards for Authorised Officers; and


other administrative matters.




United States Implementation



On 29 September 2010, after lengthy and complex negotiations, the US Senate recommended ratification of the treaty, following the passage of the treaty’s implementing legislation through the US Congress on 28 September 2010.  


Since that time, the US Administration has been working to meet the requirements of the Congressional Resolution of Ratification.  As part of this, the necessary changes to the ITAR system are being proposed.  


The United States will soon release for public comment a draft amendment to the ITAR system which will enable trade under the treaty.  


Once the US and Australian governments have completed the necessary preparations and transition planning, the Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty will be brought into force.




Pathfinder Program



To ensure the treaty is a success, the Australian and US governments are also developing a Pathfinder Program to test the effectiveness of the Australian and United States systems being developed.  This bilateral process will be administered by the Treaty Management Board.


The board will select and evaluate test projects to identify what works well and what requires refinement before the treaty enters into force.  


These projects will be real examples that will be selected for their ability to cover the full range of treaty scenarios, including support to current operations and cooperation on new major defence systems in Australia’s Defence Capability Plan. 




Transition Planning



Work is also required to transition approved Australian Community members from the current export control system to the new system.


This includes the introduction of a new IT system to support the treaty and strengthen export controls.


The current export control IT system has been in operation for almost 20 years.


A procurement process to select a partner to develop and implement a new system is underway, and a contract is expected to be signed early next year.


The new system will be set up and tested before the treaty enters into force.  




Strengthening Export Controls



The second purpose of the bill is to enhance the existing legislative export controls measures.


Australia’s current export control of defence and strategic goods is regulated through legislation that includes the Customs Act 1901 and the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Act 1995, as well as through the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 and the Autonomous Sanctions Act 2011.  


In order to strengthen Australia’s export controls, the bill includes provisions covering:


intangible transfer of technology relating to defence and strategic goods, such as transfer by electronic means;


provision of services related to defence and strategic goods and technology, such as training and maintenance services; and


brokering the supply of defence and strategic goods, technology and services.


Associated amendments to the Customs Act 1901 will cover the export of non-regulated goods that may contribute to a military end-use that may prejudice Australia’s security, defence or international relations.


Australia has played a prominent international role in developing, implementing and enforcing effective export controls on major arms and dual-use goods.  These changes are in line with commitments Australia has made within the multilateral export control regimes; including, the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Australia Group.  


These strengthened measures will bring Aust­ralia’s defence export controls in line with inter­national best practice and are useful preparatory steps for Australian participation in negotiations on the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty.


Under this bill, a permit will be required for any supply of technology relating to controlled defence and strategic goods, any provision of services related to those goods and technologies and any brokering of defence and strategic goods, technologies and related services.  This builds upon the current licence and permit arrangements in existing export control legislation.


The bill also establishes who will need to apply for a permit, when and how to apply for a permit as well as offences for situations when a permit is not obtained or when conditions under a permit are breached. 


All these measures aim to ensure the responsible export of defence and strategic goods, technology and related services and prevent them from being transferred to destinations that may prejudice Australia’s security, defence or international relations.  The measures will be implemented to minimise the impact on industry so that trade can be maintained while complying with the new requirements.




Conclusion



This is important legislation that will:


strengthen our alliance with the United States and the relationship between our defence industries;


improve interoperability of the Australian and United States armed forces;


help to deliver equipment to our troops faster and cheaper;


provide opportunities for the Australian defence industry to win work in the US defence market; and


enhance Australia’s defence export controls to bring them in line with international best practice.


Debate adjourned.


CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (MILITARY END-USE) BILL 2011


This bill complements the new powers included in the Defence Trade Control Bill, for strengthening Australia’s Defence Export controls, by providing measures to prohibit the export of goods where they may have a military end-use contrary to Australia’s interests. 


The power is a 'catch all' provision that will operate by giving the Minister for Defence an authority to issue a notice to prohibit goods from being exported, where the minister is of the view that they may be for a military end-use that could prejudice Australia’s security, defence or international relations; and the goods are not otherwise regulated.


It is not expected that this power will be used very often. However, an example of when it could be used would be to prevent an Australian export from proceeding if it was potentially going to be used by an armed group such as a terrorist organisation.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

The speech read as follows—



This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia's tax laws.


Schedule 1 amends the income tax law to provide the Commissioner of Taxation with discretion to disregard certain events that would otherwise trigger the assessment of certain income for a primary production trust in the year of the event. 


Currently, the income tax law allows primary producers to defer or spread profits made on certain forced disposals or death of livestock arising from natural disasters.


However, the concession immediately ends upon the happening of a disentitling event, for example, when a beneficiary leaves Australia permanently. This can produce some inappropriate outcomes. For this reason the government is broadly restoring the discretion which existed prior to the Tax Laws Improvement Project in 1997. 


This schedule also removes the death of a beneficiary as a disentitling event.


These amendments apply retrospectively from the 2005-06 income year and ensure a favourable position for affected taxpayers. 


Schedule 2 relates to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT). Since its introduction by the Hawke Government in 1986, the PRRT has played an important role in ensuring that a share of the economic rent generated from offshore petroleum projects is retained by the community. From 1 July 2012, as part of the Government's resource tax reforms, the PRRT will be extended to cover all Australian oil and gas projects, including for the first time those located onshore, as well as the North West Shelf project.


In this context, it is vital that current and prospective PRRT taxpayers can be certain as to how the PRRT applies to their specific projects.   


Schedule 2 provides this certainty by amending the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 to reinforce the long-established interpretation, recently affirmed by the Federal Court, of how the 'taxing point' is determined for the purposes of the PRRT. 


The taxing point is central to the determination of PRRT liabilities, in that it is the point at which assessable revenue for a petroleum project is determined, and up to which project expenditures are deductible. 


Specifically, this bill clarifies the definition of a 'marketable petroleum commodity' in the PRRT law. Under the PRRT law, the taxing point occurs where marketable petroleum commodities produced by a petroleum operation become 'excluded'—normally by being sold or by being moved from the place of production.


The new definition explicitly requires that the intended final use of a substance be taken into account in determining where in the production chain a marketable petroleum commodity is produced. This requirement has always existed, albeit implicitly, and is clear given the structure and operation of the PRRT law as a whole. The PRRT has operated on this basis for over twenty years.


By making this existing requirement explicit, the amendments will put the matter beyond doubt, removing any lingering uncertainty around a central element of the PRRT. 


This measure was first announced in the 2011-12 budget. Consistent with that announcement, the amendments are effective from 1 July 1990. 


Because the measure serves only to clarify and affirm the current application of the PRRT, it does not impose any additional tax burden. Accordingly, these amendments have no revenue impact. 


Schedule 3 contains minor consequential amendments to the taxation arrangements that bring the gaseous fuels (liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) into the fuel tax regime. The changes ensure that legislation applies as intended and does not impose excessive compliance costs on the gaseous fuels industry.


The amendments in this schedule confirm that excise duty does not apply when CNG fuel is manufactured in home refuelling units that do not have commercial scale capacity. 


The amendments also confirm that entitlements to fuel tax credits are available to unlicensed distributors of LPG for non-transport applications; and that the content of notices to accompany the supply of LPG for non-transport use, which will be developed in consultation with the gaseous fuels industry, will be set out entirely in regulations.


The measures contained in this Schedule apply from 1 December 2011. 


The Gillard government will also introduce new legislative arrangements, that will allow up to six business days after the end of the weekly duty accounting period before duty payments must be made by entities with gaseous fuel tax obligations. 


The changes will apply to duty obligations for LPG, LNG and CNG. They will not impact on payment of duty for other types of fuel. 


The revised arrangements are in response to the concerns of marketers who, in many cases, are unable to identify whether deliveries of gaseous fuels are for transport use or for non-transport use until deliveries are made and invoices are processed. This may be some days after the fuel has left excise or customs-licensed premises.


The revised arrangements provide flexibility for existing parties in the fuel tax system to maintain their existing payment arrangements. This reflects the Gillard government's willingness to respond to industry concerns and develop workable and practical solutions.


In the short term, in the absence of legislation, I am advised by the Commissioner of Taxation that he will administer the periodic settlement permissions under the existing excise law to allow duty to be paid for gaseous fuels up to six business days after the end of the weekly duty accounting period from 1 December 2011. 


These arrangements by the Commissioner will continue once legislation is enacted to give effect to the government's decision on the six business day payment arrangement for gaseous fuels.


Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:02):  As Chair of the Community Affairs References Committee, I present the report on regulatory standards for the approval of medical devices, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


On 16 June 2011, the Senate referred the regulatory standards for the approval of medical devices in Australia to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee for inquiry. The committee received 34 submissions: 18 from industry and industry associations and peak bodies, three from government, two from consumer groups and 11 from affected patients and consumers. We held a public hearing on 27 September 2011. 


The committee examined the regulation of medical devices in Australia. This is a complex and evolving area. The committee considered whether the current mechanisms for premarket assessment and postmarket surveillance of medical devices are appropriate for ensuring patient safety. The inquiry was conducted in a dynamic policy and legal environment. It was occurring in parallel with the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the health technology assessment review and the consideration of the Therapeutic Goods Administration transparency review. 


The inquiry also focused on the consumer experience of those approximately 5,500 Australians who have received the DePuy ASR metal-on-metal hip replacement, including total hip replacements and hip resurfacing systems. This was a matter brought to the public attention on 16 May 2011 by the Four Cornersprogram Joint Reaction. That followed other stories around this issue.


The committee heard shocking evidence of patients experiencing devastating health problems as a result of being implanted with either the DePuy ASR hip or the hip resurfacing system. Many witnesses spoke of their repeated surgeries, repeated and extended hospital stays, significant financial loss and major personal and family impacts. Health problems cited included severe pain, loss of mobility and a complex process of both physical and psychological effects due to the shedding of cobalt and chromium irons from the implanted devices. The excessive levels of chromium and cobalt in these patients' bodies have produced symptoms such as bone loss, extensive damage to bone and soft tissues, and hip dislocations. The Department of Health and Ageing notes that excessive levels of these metals can also produce other significant medical complications. One submitter's condition is in fact now terminal.


I will cite only a few quotes from the report, because other members of the committee also want to contribute: 


The committee was shocked by the intolerable, and unacceptable, experiences of patients who received the DePuy hip and hip resurfacing system. These very personal experiences—


which we heard—


serve to underline the need for improved pre-market clinical testing and post-market surveillance systems for medical devices, as well as improved timeliness and decisiveness when acting upon the information that is available.


These experiences brought home to the committee that the TGA could have done more in response to the concerns with the device and that Johnson & Johnson Medical did not serve patients well.


The report further states:


It appears to the committee that ASR hip devices were in use after a higher than expected revision rate had been identified. The committee believes that insufficient information was provided to consumers regarding the concerns with the device. This is regrettable.


The committee has made 18 recommendations in the report and these go to improving the regulation of medical devices by the TGA and increasing the rigour of the regulatory assessment of the higher risk medical devices, both before the devices come to market as well as through monitoring and surveillance of these devices post market. The committee has recommended that the HTA review recommendations 8c, 13, 14 and 15 are fully implemented in a timely manner—in other words, the recommendations that have been made from ongoing processes need to be implemented. We recommend investigating whether the increasing number of medical devices on the Australian market is actually improving clinical outcomes and we make a range of other recommendations.


An issue I have not touched on in my comments relates to inducements, which came up during the inquiry. We recommend the need for further work to address the issue of inducements paid by pharmaceutical companies and medical device manu­facturers to doctors and teaching hospitals. This issue has been addressed in the United States through the physician payment sunshine provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Cure Act of 2009. The definition of inducements should include a commercial interest in a company or device, any cash payments or discounts offered to medical practitioners and any other gifts provided to medical practitioners. As I said, these are just some of the recommendations we made. I believe there was a lot of compelling evidence provided to this inquiry of the trauma and physical impacts that consumers have suffered as a result of receiving some of these hip devices.


I commend the recommendations to the government. I thank committee members and particularly thank, once again, the staff of the Community Affairs References Committee staff and the staff that we borrowed from the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, Christine McDonald and Bu Wilson, who served us extremely well in a both timely and professional manner.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,21,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-11-22,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:09):  At the outset I join with the chair of the committee, Senator Siewert, in the remarks she made about the assistance of the secretariat and other support that the committee received. I heartily endorse those remarks on the professionalism of the secretariat in preparing this important report.


This report came to the committee as a result of a referral, a motion I put up in the Senate as a result of being contacted by a number of constituents who have suffered severe, some would say life-threatening, health problems as a result of DePuy hip replacements and joint resurfacing. These are issues that ought not to have occurred in the first place. That is why this report is important. I have added additional comments to this report where I agree with the committee's recommendations but say I believe there ought to be some further rigour in the recommendations in terms of time lines in dealing with these important issues.


Let us put into perspective what is at stake here. We have a watchdog, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, that is supposed to have appropriate processes to deal with medical devices such as this. I believe the watchdog has failed Australian consumers. I believe that the watchdog, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, could have and should have done much better. There was significant evidence given to the committee that points out a failure of process, a failure in dealing with these matters.


Let us put this into perspective in the context of what has occurred here. In the case of the DePuy hip replacements and the joint resurfacing devices, approximately 5,500 Australians have received such devices. Many people who have received these devices have had to undergo multiple revision surgeries. We know that the average surgical revision rate is in the order of 3.5 per cent but the current revision rate for these devices in Australia is 10.2 per cent after five years. We know that independent UK research indicates a failure rate for some of these DePuy devices to be in the order of 49 per cent.


This is made even more tragic by the fact that many of the people who are undergoing these revisions are having severe health effects relatively young. Many of them are in their 40s. The problems caused by these devices relate to the trauma of surgery, the risks inherent with surgery—particularly for older patients—and also cobalt and chromium leeching into patients' systems, into their bodies, from the devices. This has caused a wide range of problems—and the committee heard evidence in relation to this—from depression, memory loss, fatigue and tinnitus to bone necrosis in the affected joint. Many of the patients who gave evidence to the committee stated they were not aware that their health problems stemmed from their devices until they saw the issue raised in the media or they conducted their own research. That shows there is a failure of transparency, and the committee has made some good recommendations in respect of that.


Some also stated that they had problems getting their health practitioner to take them seriously, and I have also been contacted by people who have been faced with similar problems from metal-on-metal devices, indicating that the whole category of device may be problematic.


What is particularly significant is the evidence that the committee heard from the National Joint Replacement Registry. I am very grateful for the work of that registry and for the work of the head of the registry, Professor Stephen Graves, whom I think is eminently qualified and well respected nationally; indeed internationally, given his role internationally in setting up a register for these devices.


I have been questioning the TGA on these issues at estimates hearings for several years and it has been a valuable opportunity to explore this through this committee process. I must say, for those who are listening on NewsRadio and those who are following this, that I think one of the things the Senate does best is the way the committee process works—without political rancour, without any party political basis to it and where the committee as a whole is looking to get to the truth of matters.


While the committee focused on these devices, it is important to remember that they are not the only problem devices and there are systemic issues in the way we deal with these devices. And then there is whether we ought to go to the French system, where you need to show the efficacy, the benefit, of new devices before they are put onto the market and before they get, if you like, government assistance. I believe the TGA has failed in its role as regulator and it is vital that new systems and processes are put in place to adequately protect Australia's health consumers. I believe the TGA's response to the DePuy situation was very poor, as evidenced in the report. In one case, information on the failure of the devices provided by the National Joint Replacement Registry was not examined by the TGA adequately until over a year after it was provided. That is clearly unsatisfactory. 


One of the recommendations is to introduce legislation to require medical practitioners to disclose any financial, commercial or other interests they have which are relevant to the treatment of the patient. I will be providing instructions for legislation to be drafted along these lines in the near future if the government declines to do so. We need to have that transparency legislation.


In relation to DePuy devices, it should be pointed out that Dr Roger Oakeshott, one of the orthopaedic surgeons who implanted a number of these devices, did not, according to patients I have spoken to, disclose his commercial interest as one of the co-designers of the device. I think that is clearly unsatisfactory. 


It is important that patients are able to give informed consent with regard to these devices. It is important that we have a better system in place. It is important that we have increased regulation of devices, including postmarket monitoring, and overall increased transparency in the operation of the TGA from the health technology assessment review and the Therapeutic Goods Administ­ration transparency review. The fact is that many Australians who have had these DePuy devices implanted are looking at a ticking time bomb in terms of the impacts it can have on their health. At the moment the revision rate is some 10 per cent. If we go anywhere near the UK revision rates, that will be a very significant issue. I commend this report and I look forward to the government acting seriously to deal with a number of fundamental issues of reform.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2011-11-22,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (18:16):  The TGA is a very important part of the health system in this country. It was developed as part of the Department of Health and Ageing:


… to protect public health and safety by regulating therapeutic goods that are manufactured or supplied in, or exported from, Australia—


as well as aiming—


… to ensure the Australian community has access, within reasonable timeframes, to therapeutic advances.


This is an important responsibility for the organisation and it is absolutely critical that we have in place effective processes to ensure there is genuine trust in the role the TGA plays. Through the process of this inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, we have heard that things should be done better. There is no doubt about that. The committee has come up with 18 recommendations and they have a similar theme. As Senator Xenophon and Senator Siewert have said—and as I know Senator Boyce will say, because we were very much in agreement about the process, about the concerns that need to be addressed and about the reasons it is important that we address those concerns—during the evidence we heard that the TGA, by and large, does a very sound job. In fact the AMA said that it served Australia well. Dr Hammett, the head of the TGA, whom we know well through Senate estimates, said:


It is a constant matter of balancing the challenges of regulating the large number of products we regulate. One of the important foundations of how we approach this is that we have an understanding that it does not matter what amount of resources we have; it is not possible to create a completely safe medical device, medicine or medical procedure. 


It is important to know that. There can never be absolute guarantees, but we must have a process where we know that the best possible communication, the best possible science and the best possible cooperation has taken place so that we can come up with a sound medical system. 


Our committee was shocked and saddened by the information provided to us by people who, in good faith, had received advice from practitioners in this country about a new process for hip implants which, they were told, was going to serve them better. In fact one of the biggest ironies in all of this was that many people had this particular process—the DePuy implant, DePuy being a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson—because it was going to be the new best process in the medical arena. This was going to be the best way they could be helped. That was based on practice—this particular process had been used and had worked overseas. However, what we have seen—and we have heard some of the figures—is that there are problems with this device. This has come out through information that is fed back through the system, information which tells us there has been too much revision—people having to go back and have more surgery. There have also been way too many other kinds of medical problems caused by this process. 


We heard some very sad things and I think the whole committee sends its best wishes to the people and the families who came forward with stories about what was happening in their lives. As Senator Siewert said, one of those patients, whom Senator Xenophon had been working with in South Australia, has a terminal diagnosis. We can never stop that happening, but, when we can see that things can be done better, we as a government, we as a parliament and we as the Australian community must do better. 


The 18 recommendations are aimed at trying to ensure that there is much better communication and much better under­standing in the process. The community affairs committee had previously inquired into the National Joint Replacement Registry, so we had already heard about some of the issues in terms of the volume of transplantation and the volume of devices available in this country. What we need to have is an assurance that the process works as well it can—that knowledge is being shared and that people are getting the necessary information as quickly as possible so they can then take action quickly. 


It must be remembered through all of this that the device in question was actually removed from the Australian market several months earlier than anywhere else in the world, simply because of the pressure that the TGA process had placed on the company. I think, within the overall discussion, that we need to see that. It was not good enough, but nonetheless this process was stopped in Australia a good nine months before it was stopped overseas and I think the Australian move led to the international decision to have this device, which is proven to be dangerous—I think I can go that far—removed from the market. 


One of the things that I just wanted to mention briefly—I know Senator Boyce wishes to make a contribution as well—is an issue which came up in this committee's hearings as well as in previous ones: the importance of the relationship between the consumer and the practitioner in any kind of medical process. We found that consumers were not fully informed about the surgical process or about the type of implant they were going to have. We value the concept of informed choice in our medical system, but it did not occur. I think that we as a community need to keep that concept on the agenda—to make sure that every person in this country working with our health system understands as well as they can what is going to happen to them, the options they have and the probable consequences of their decisions. They should not be reliant on a doctor—of any kind, in any place—just telling them what is going to happen and no more. This had happened consistently to the patients who came before us in the committee.


It is important to know that the TGA has been subject to two reviews. The government is working through those. There is a confidence that things can be done better. The government acknowledges that. I again thank all the people who contributed to our committee and shared their lives and their expertise with us to allow the committee system and this process, of which I am very proud, to operate again in this day.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (18:22):  I would like to add my thanks to the secretariat of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, particularly the co-opted members of the secretariat, who were in the main responsible for the production of this report, The regulatory standards for the approval of medical devices in Australia. My thanks go also to the committee members for the amount of effort that went into coming up with a consensus report. I think it is a great feature of the community affairs com­mittee that we very often produce reports that are consensual, because we are looking at issues that we believe affect everyone.


The biggest issue that came out of this report was the complete disconnect between the idea of a hip implant, a hip replacement device, and the needs of health consumers in Australia. The TGA, as Senator Moore has said, dealt perhaps not so promptly but certainly reasonably when they discovered the problems with the DePuy ASR hip replacement devices, but I do not think there was any consideration in that of the effect on patients. It is quite easy to talk about the 'revision' of a hip replacement as though it is something like a piece of paper where you might revise the words that have been written before, but we know in this case that the revision of a hip involves surgery, hospital stays and very large problems for patients.


I would just like to talk about some of the evidence that came out of the submissions of people who have been affected by these hip replacements. Amongst the problems that developed were the need for revision and for other surgery, the need for repeated and extended hospital stays, multiple and exten­ded courses of antibiotics, major personal and family impacts and—in many, many cases—significant financial loss caused by their health problems and the need for other members of the family to care for them. Health problems that were cited by sub­mitters include severe pain, loss of mobility and a complex mix of physical and psycho­logical effects that were due to the shedding of cobalt and chromium ions from the DePuy implanted device. We had evidence from submitters saying that the excessive amounts of cobalt and chromium in their bodies had produced symptoms such as bone loss, ex­tensive damage to bone and soft tissues, hip dislocation, pus coloured fluid and pseudo­tumours, and depression. And, as has been mentioned by a number of speakers, one person who received a DePuy hip replace­ment in fact is now in a terminal condition as a result of complications that have developed from that hip replacement. But let us just talk about the straight revision surgery. The symptoms for patients who get to the stage of needing a replacement of the replacement are pain, swelling and problems with walk­ing, which can be on a recurrent or a continuing basis. That is enough of an issue, enough of a productivity problem, surely, and enough of a human problem for us to do better than we do here.


Wearing another hat, I happen to know that for at least 15 years the place and time of manufacture and the path to its final resting place of a septic tank in Australia has been very, very carefully monitored. You can look at any septic tank installed in Australia in the last 15 years and know exactly who made it and when. If we can do that well with a product like that—which I admit could be very unpleasant if it fails as a product and may cause some local environmental damage—surely we can do much better with products that are being put inside patients, not just in terms of the fact that having the revision done causes pain but also in terms of the fact that it is leading to a poisoning of their system.


The other topic I want to very briefly cover whilst I am here is recommendation 18 of our report, which looks at the conflict-of-interest issues regarding surgeons and others involved in perhaps recommending these products without suggesting that there are alternatives and certainly without giving patients the ability to make an informed decision about which implant to have. I think we also need to notice that Johnson and Johnson Medical have agreed to pay $21.4 million as a criminal penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement for improper payments by Johnson and Johnson subsidiaries to public healthcare providers in Greece, Poland and Romania, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This is a US decision. Similarly, the UK Serious Fraud Office obtained a civil recovery order against DePuy International Ltd in recognition of unlawful conduct relating to marketing and the sale of orthopaedic products in Greece between 1998 and 2006.


I find it difficult to believe that, if that sort of behaviour had been going on in Europe, there is not at least the potential that that had also been happening in Australia. We have no direct evidence of that, but there are suggestions by people who have been affected by these hip replacement devices that they certainly were not aware of options and they were not aware that the recom­mendations to them about having these hip replacements were being made by people who had a direct or indirect financial interest in their accepting that hip replacement. So I think it is important that particularly recom­mendation 18 be taken up quickly by the government. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-11-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:02):  As Chair of the Community Affairs References Committee, I present the report on regulatory standards for the approval of medical devices, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SIEWERT:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


On 16 June 2011, the Senate referred the regulatory standards for the approval of medical devices in Australia to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee for inquiry. The committee received 34 submissions: 18 from industry and industry associations and peak bodies, three from government, two from consumer groups and 11 from affected patients and consumers. We held a public hearing on 27 September 2011. 


The committee examined the regulation of medical devices in Australia. This is a complex and evolving area. The committee considered whether the current mechanisms for premarket assessment and postmarket surveillance of medical devices are appropriate for ensuring patient safety. The inquiry was conducted in a dynamic policy and legal environment. It was occurring in parallel with the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the health technology assessment review and the consideration of the Therapeutic Goods Administration transparency review. 


The inquiry also focused on the consumer experience of those approximately 5,500 Australians who have received the DePuy ASR metal-on-metal hip replacement, including total hip replacements and hip resurfacing systems. This was a matter brought to the public attention on 16 May 2011 by the Four Cornersprogram Joint Reaction. That followed other stories around this issue.


The committee heard shocking evidence of patients experiencing devastating health problems as a result of being implanted with either the DePuy ASR hip or the hip resurfacing system. Many witnesses spoke of their repeated surgeries, repeated and extended hospital stays, significant financial loss and major personal and family impacts. Health problems cited included severe pain, loss of mobility and a complex process of both physical and psychological effects due to the shedding of cobalt and chromium irons from the implanted devices. The excessive levels of chromium and cobalt in these patients' bodies have produced symptoms such as bone loss, extensive damage to bone and soft tissues, and hip dislocations. The Department of Health and Ageing notes that excessive levels of these metals can also produce other significant medical complications. One submitter's condition is in fact now terminal.


I will cite only a few quotes from the report, because other members of the committee also want to contribute: 


The committee was shocked by the intolerable, and unacceptable, experiences of patients who received the DePuy hip and hip resurfacing system. These very personal experiences—


which we heard—


serve to underline the need for improved pre-market clinical testing and post-market surveillance systems for medical devices, as well as improved timeliness and decisiveness when acting upon the information that is available.


These experiences brought home to the committee that the TGA could have done more in response to the concerns with the device and that Johnson & Johnson Medical did not serve patients well.


The report further states:


It appears to the committee that ASR hip devices were in use after a higher than expected revision rate had been identified. The committee believes that insufficient information was provided to consumers regarding the concerns with the device. This is regrettable.


The committee has made 18 recommendations in the report and these go to improving the regulation of medical devices by the TGA and increasing the rigour of the regulatory assessment of the higher risk medical devices, both before the devices come to market as well as through monitoring and surveillance of these devices post market. The committee has recommended that the HTA review recommendations 8c, 13, 14 and 15 are fully implemented in a timely manner—in other words, the recommendations that have been made from ongoing processes need to be implemented. We recommend investigating whether the increasing number of medical devices on the Australian market is actually improving clinical outcomes and we make a range of other recommendations.


An issue I have not touched on in my comments relates to inducements, which came up during the inquiry. We recommend the need for further work to address the issue of inducements paid by pharmaceutical companies and medical device manu­facturers to doctors and teaching hospitals. This issue has been addressed in the United States through the physician payment sunshine provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Cure Act of 2009. The definition of inducements should include a commercial interest in a company or device, any cash payments or discounts offered to medical practitioners and any other gifts provided to medical practitioners. As I said, these are just some of the recommendations we made. I believe there was a lot of compelling evidence provided to this inquiry of the trauma and physical impacts that consumers have suffered as a result of receiving some of these hip devices.


I commend the recommendations to the government. I thank committee members and particularly thank, once again, the staff of the Community Affairs References Committee staff and the staff that we borrowed from the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, Christine McDonald and Bu Wilson, who served us extremely well in a both timely and professional manner.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,21,2,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-11-22,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:09):  At the outset I join with the chair of the committee, Senator Siewert, in the remarks she made about the assistance of the secretariat and other support that the committee received. I heartily endorse those remarks on the professionalism of the secretariat in preparing this important report.


This report came to the committee as a result of a referral, a motion I put up in the Senate as a result of being contacted by a number of constituents who have suffered severe, some would say life-threatening, health problems as a result of DePuy hip replacements and joint resurfacing. These are issues that ought not to have occurred in the first place. That is why this report is important. I have added additional comments to this report where I agree with the committee's recommendations but say I believe there ought to be some further rigour in the recommendations in terms of time lines in dealing with these important issues.


Let us put into perspective what is at stake here. We have a watchdog, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, that is supposed to have appropriate processes to deal with medical devices such as this. I believe the watchdog has failed Australian consumers. I believe that the watchdog, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, could have and should have done much better. There was significant evidence given to the committee that points out a failure of process, a failure in dealing with these matters.


Let us put this into perspective in the context of what has occurred here. In the case of the DePuy hip replacements and the joint resurfacing devices, approximately 5,500 Australians have received such devices. Many people who have received these devices have had to undergo multiple revision surgeries. We know that the average surgical revision rate is in the order of 3.5 per cent but the current revision rate for these devices in Australia is 10.2 per cent after five years. We know that independent UK research indicates a failure rate for some of these DePuy devices to be in the order of 49 per cent.


This is made even more tragic by the fact that many of the people who are undergoing these revisions are having severe health effects relatively young. Many of them are in their 40s. The problems caused by these devices relate to the trauma of surgery, the risks inherent with surgery—particularly for older patients—and also cobalt and chromium leeching into patients' systems, into their bodies, from the devices. This has caused a wide range of problems—and the committee heard evidence in relation to this—from depression, memory loss, fatigue and tinnitus to bone necrosis in the affected joint. Many of the patients who gave evidence to the committee stated they were not aware that their health problems stemmed from their devices until they saw the issue raised in the media or they conducted their own research. That shows there is a failure of transparency, and the committee has made some good recommendations in respect of that.


Some also stated that they had problems getting their health practitioner to take them seriously, and I have also been contacted by people who have been faced with similar problems from metal-on-metal devices, indicating that the whole category of device may be problematic.


What is particularly significant is the evidence that the committee heard from the National Joint Replacement Registry. I am very grateful for the work of that registry and for the work of the head of the registry, Professor Stephen Graves, whom I think is eminently qualified and well respected nationally; indeed internationally, given his role internationally in setting up a register for these devices.


I have been questioning the TGA on these issues at estimates hearings for several years and it has been a valuable opportunity to explore this through this committee process. I must say, for those who are listening on NewsRadio and those who are following this, that I think one of the things the Senate does best is the way the committee process works—without political rancour, without any party political basis to it and where the committee as a whole is looking to get to the truth of matters.


While the committee focused on these devices, it is important to remember that they are not the only problem devices and there are systemic issues in the way we deal with these devices. And then there is whether we ought to go to the French system, where you need to show the efficacy, the benefit, of new devices before they are put onto the market and before they get, if you like, government assistance. I believe the TGA has failed in its role as regulator and it is vital that new systems and processes are put in place to adequately protect Australia's health consumers. I believe the TGA's response to the DePuy situation was very poor, as evidenced in the report. In one case, information on the failure of the devices provided by the National Joint Replacement Registry was not examined by the TGA adequately until over a year after it was provided. That is clearly unsatisfactory. 


One of the recommendations is to introduce legislation to require medical practitioners to disclose any financial, commercial or other interests they have which are relevant to the treatment of the patient. I will be providing instructions for legislation to be drafted along these lines in the near future if the government declines to do so. We need to have that transparency legislation.


In relation to DePuy devices, it should be pointed out that Dr Roger Oakeshott, one of the orthopaedic surgeons who implanted a number of these devices, did not, according to patients I have spoken to, disclose his commercial interest as one of the co-designers of the device. I think that is clearly unsatisfactory. 


It is important that patients are able to give informed consent with regard to these devices. It is important that we have a better system in place. It is important that we have increased regulation of devices, including postmarket monitoring, and overall increased transparency in the operation of the TGA from the health technology assessment review and the Therapeutic Goods Administ­ration transparency review. The fact is that many Australians who have had these DePuy devices implanted are looking at a ticking time bomb in terms of the impacts it can have on their health. At the moment the revision rate is some 10 per cent. If we go anywhere near the UK revision rates, that will be a very significant issue. I commend this report and I look forward to the government acting seriously to deal with a number of fundamental issues of reform.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (18:16):  The TGA is a very important part of the health system in this country. It was developed as part of the Department of Health and Ageing:


… to protect public health and safety by regulating therapeutic goods that are manufactured or supplied in, or exported from, Australia—


as well as aiming—


… to ensure the Australian community has access, within reasonable timeframes, to therapeutic advances.


This is an important responsibility for the organisation and it is absolutely critical that we have in place effective processes to ensure there is genuine trust in the role the TGA plays. Through the process of this inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, we have heard that things should be done better. There is no doubt about that. The committee has come up with 18 recommendations and they have a similar theme. As Senator Xenophon and Senator Siewert have said—and as I know Senator Boyce will say, because we were very much in agreement about the process, about the concerns that need to be addressed and about the reasons it is important that we address those concerns—during the evidence we heard that the TGA, by and large, does a very sound job. In fact the AMA said that it served Australia well. Dr Hammett, the head of the TGA, whom we know well through Senate estimates, said:


It is a constant matter of balancing the challenges of regulating the large number of products we regulate. One of the important foundations of how we approach this is that we have an understanding that it does not matter what amount of resources we have; it is not possible to create a completely safe medical device, medicine or medical procedure. 


It is important to know that. There can never be absolute guarantees, but we must have a process where we know that the best possible communication, the best possible science and the best possible cooperation has taken place so that we can come up with a sound medical system. 


Our committee was shocked and saddened by the information provided to us by people who, in good faith, had received advice from practitioners in this country about a new process for hip implants which, they were told, was going to serve them better. In fact one of the biggest ironies in all of this was that many people had this particular process—the DePuy implant, DePuy being a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson—because it was going to be the new best process in the medical arena.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (19:30):  Family law is the one jurisdiction of the federal judicial system to which almost all Australians have some level of exposure at some time in their lives. It is a sad fact of life that virtually every one of us will either have a first-hand experience or have someone—or most likely more than one person—within our family or close circle who will have contact with the Family Court or the Federal Magistrates Court in its family law jurisdiction. It is also a sad fact of life that family law disputes are among the most intractable matters that come before a court, often in a context of extreme personal bitterness and too often occasioned by violence and abuse of the most horrible kind, conduct which, it should be unnecessary to say, is abhorrent to all members of the community.


It is also a fact of life that any attempt to resolve these disputes will often leave both parties feeling aggrieved and, much worse, their children exposed to the fallout and remaining at risk of violence and abuse. Many of the failed relationships that come before the courts have been blighted by mental illness and substance abuse problems, sometimes on both sides, and because judges are human the courts do not always get it right, much as they strive to do so. In disputes involving children, the principal guidance provided by the Family Law Act is that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration. Just how the best interests of children can be determined, however, is and will always be a vexed question and a matter on which decent people will arrive at different views.


In December 2003 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs tabled a unanimous report entitled Every picture tells a story. The committee was asked to consider, given that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration, what other factors should be taken into account in deciding the respective time each parent should spend with their children post-separation. The committee, headed by Kay Hull MP, heard evidence from more than 2,000 witnesses over the course of six months. One of its findings, which informed many of its recommendations, was:


We—


that is, the entire committee across party lines—


are convinced that sharing responsibility is the best way to ensure as many children as possible grow up in a caring environment. To share all the important events in a child’s life with both mum and dad, even when families are separated, would be an ideal outcome.


The committee heard heartbreaking evidence of children separated from one of their parents by inflexible Family Court orders which caused anguish to parents and children alike and which had long-term detrimental effects on children. The so-called 'shared parenting laws' which were introduced by Mr Ruddock, the Attorney-General in the Howard government in 2006, were a response to the report. In my view, they were some of the best and most important law reforms for which that great Attorney-General was responsible.


The changes to the family law system included changes to both the legislation and the family relationship service system. The main elements of the legislative changes were: to require parents to attend family dispute resolution before filing a court application, except where there are serious concerns about family violence and child abuse; to place an increased emphasis on the need for both parents to be involved in their children's lives after separation, including the introduction of a presumption of shared parental responsibility; to place greater emphasis on the need to protect children from exposure to family violence and child abuse; and to introduce legislative support for less adversarial court processes in children's matters. This legislative suite included a requirement for the Australian Institute of Family Studies to undertake a large-scale longitudinal evaluation of the effect of the reforms. That evaluation was completed in December 2009, and I will return to its findings in a moment.


The coalition is proud of the Ruddock reforms. The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 seeks to amend the Family Law Act by including an additional object to give effect to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which decision-makers may have regard when dealing with children's matters. This will change the definitions of family violence and abuse; strengthen the obligations of lawyers, dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors to prioritise the safety of children; require inquiry and reports on family violence and child abuse in court proceedings; repeal the so-called 'friendly parent provisions'; repeal the provision for cost orders in the case of false family violence allegations; and provide for simpler procedures for the participation of child welfare agencies in family law proceedings. Some of these amendments will have the coalition's support. Others, however, in our view will have the effect of winding back the Ruddock reforms and will therefore be opposed. I will deal with the substantive provisions in turn.


The bill proposes to insert a new section 60CC, which requires the court when determining what is in the child's best interests to give greater weight to the primary consideration that protects the child from harm where there is inconsistency in applying the two primary considerations, the other being the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. This amendment is unnecessary and gratuitous. The existing section 60CA makes the best interests of the child the paramount consideration. The existing section 60B clearly articulates that a meaningful relationship with a parent is subordinate to the paramount consideration. In purported aid of the objective of this amendment, the bill seeks to add as a further object of part VII of the act that it is to give effect to the UN convention. The explanatory memor­andum states that the intention is to confirm in cases of ambiguity that part VII should be interpreted consistently with the convention. However, to the extent to which the act departs from the convention, the act will prevail. The proposed amendment does not corporate the convention into domestic law. Given that the act already gives effect to the principle of the paramountcy of the best interests of the child, the need for that amendment is not clear.


The exposure draft of the bill proposed a definition of family violence that included any behaviour that was subjectively emotionally, psychologically or econom­ically abusive or threatening. Many stake­holders voiced their concern that any instance of marital discord could be tailored to fit the definition. The definition now proposed defines family violence as 'violent, threatening or other behaviour that coerces or controls a member of the person's family or causes the family member to be fearful.' It differs from the existing definition in that it imposes a subjective test. The definition in the existing act requires a reasonable fear for the family member's wellbeing or safety.


The new definition attempts to qualify its subjectivity by incorporating a list of examples of behaviour, which includes assault, repeated derogatory taunts, damage to property and other unreasonable or criminal behaviour. However, it is an open question whether the list of examples is sufficient to frame and limit the subjectivity of the definition. There is no doubt that any of the behaviours listed would cause a person to be fearful; however, they would also give rise to a reasonable fear for a person's wellbeing or safety under the existing test. The problem with a subjective test is that a person seeking to demonstrate that another person is violent need only state that he or she feared controlling or coercive conduct. The state of mind need not be reasonable. The consequences of a finding of violence can be drastic and permanent. It is not appropriate to divert a court from inquiry as to whether a fear alleged to exist is well founded. Accordingly, the coalition will press for the retention of the objective test in the act.


The AIFS evaluation—that is, the longitudinal study to which I referred a few moments ago—found that the legislative changes introduced as part of the 2006 reforms placed greater emphasis on the need to protect children from harm and from exposure to family violence and child abuse. This meant that the identification of and response to family violence became more systematic under the reforms. However, it found that improvements still needed to be made in identifying and responding to pertinent safety concerns. The proposed amendments broaden the reporting requirements in this regard to interested persons, rather than just parties in child related proceedings. This will include independent children's lawyers, dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors. There is a continuing need to improve responses to child safety concerns and these amendments will therefore be supported by the coalition. Similarly, the record of child welfare agencies in family law proceedings has in many cases been unsatisfactory. Amend­ments to improve their participation and accountability are welcomed by the coalition and will be supported.


Section 60CC(3)(c) of the act currently requires family courts to consider the willingness of one parent towards facilitating the other to have a meaningful relationship with the child. The provision has been criticised as discouraging parents' disclosures of family violence and child abuse for fear of being found to be unfriendly. The bill seeks to repeal this provision and replace it with considerations of the extent to which each of the child's parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in major long-term decisions in relation to the child and spend time with and communicate with the child, and the extent to which each of the parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil the parent's obligation to maintain the child. However, these criteria already exist in section 60CC(4).


The explanatory memorandum cites the AIFS evaluation and the Family Law Council report as the basis for the repeal of the friendly parent provision. This, however, is misleading. The AIFS found that some concerns were expressed that the provision discouraged the reporting of violence but that there was no statistical information to suggest that this was the case. The criticism was in fact voiced in the Chisholm report, uncited in the explanatory memorandum, and was described as gossip by the Family Law Council.


The failure to facilitate a relationship between a child and a separated parent remains a salient issue for the attention of a court and has been found to be an incident of emotional abuse in several reported cases. If the enhanced violence and abuse reporting obligations are supported, there can be no reason for a parent's obstructive behaviour to be excluded from consideration. It should also be noted that this consideration should not arise in the usual course if there are well-founded fears that contact with the other parent exposes the child to violence or abuse. The existing section 60CG makes that clear. Unwillingness on the part of a parent to facilitate a close and continuing relationship with the other parent is undoubtedly a relevant consideration in making parenting orders, which is why the coalition supports the retention of the friendly parent provision.


In the 2009 case of Villey and Prabsik, Mr Justice Watts ordered that a seven-year-old child be removed from his father's primary care to that of his mother. The relevant factual findings were that the mother had suffered a significant mental illness following the parties' separation as a result of the treatment she had suffered at the hands of the father during the relationship. Psychiatric examination of the parties revealed the mother to be fully recovered with an excellent prognosis. She demonstrated insight into her illness as well as its impact on the child. She had rebuilt her relationship with the child in an appropriate manner assisted by professionals. The father, however, was assessed as having a narcissistic personality with overvalued ideas or a delusion that the mother remained ill, unsafe and should have minimal involvement in the child's life. Mr Justice Watts accepted the mother's argument that it would be more likely for the child to have a meaningful relationship with both parents if he lived with his mother rather than his father and that the child would be likely to suffer psychological harm by damage to his relationship with his mother if he continued to reside with his father. This finding would have been more difficult to arrive at had the friendly parent provisions not been in the present act. That case illustrates why the coalition views it as an unwise decision to amend the act by repealing that provision.


The bill proposes to repeal section 117AB, which provides for mandatory cost orders—albeit some such orders might cover only a portion of the costs—where a party knowingly makes a false allegation or statement in the proceedings. The explana­tory memorandum cites the AIFS evaluation and the Family Law Council report's finding that the section operates as a disincentive for disclosing family violence. Again, this is misleading. The Chisholm report alludes to practitioner concern as the basis of its recommendation for repeal, but neither of the major studies cited makes any substantive finding. The Family Law Council report in fact recommends that the provision be clarified with an explanatory note or public education, not that it be repealed.


It should be noted that the test propounded in section 117AB is a stringent one. A mandatory cost order could not arise from evidence which was not proffered in the circumstances or even was given recklessly or without belief. It applies only to knowingly false evidence. If a court was prepared to make such a finding there is no reason why a cost order should not follow, as it would in any other court. Individual members of the judiciary have confirmed that such false accusations are by no means unknown and that sanctions must apply in such cases, yet this bill would remove that sanction.


The courts have provided guidance on the application of the existing provision. In Charles and Charles in 2007, Justice Cronin said:


There can be no room for misunderstanding or doubt; objectively, the person making the statement cannot believe the statement to be true.


So constrained, there is no reason to believe that the existing provision acts as a disincentive to properly made allegations or even erroneous allegations made in good faith of abuse. Cost orders are made much less routinely in the family jurisdiction than in any other. Sadly, it is clear that some parties can and will make false statements if they perceive an advantage in doing so. Because cost orders are not routine, there must be an express disincentive within the act.


The policy objectives of the 2006 reforms were: firstly, to help build strong and healthy relationships and prevent separation; secondly, to encourage greater involvement by both parents in their children's lives after separation and to protect children from violence and abuse; thirdly, to help separated parents agree on what was best for their children, rather than litigating, through the provision of useful information, advice and effective dispute resolution services; and, fourthly, to establish a highly visible entry point that operated as a doorway to other services and helped families to access those other services. As the AIFS evaluation confirmed, the legislative changes introduced as part of the reforms placed greater emphasis on the need to protect children from harm, exposure to family violence and child abuse. This meant the identification of and response to family violence became more systematic under the reforms.


Although the Ruddock reforms have been subject to some criticism, all the indications are that overall they have been hugely successful. Some of those criticisms have arisen from misrepresentation or misinterpretation, whether wilful or otherwise. Sensibly, the government has withdrawn its more radical proposals and at this stage will leave the core shared parenting provisions largely intact. However, it is disturbing that it accepted criticisms of the friendly parent and cost orders provisions at face value and has misleadingly cited positive or neutral findings on those provisions in support of its proposed amendments.


The coalition will support any sensible proposals to reduce the exposure of children to abuse and family violence. Our record indicates that we take these issues very seriously indeed. Some of the amendments proposed by this bill are worthy of support; however, as I have said, it must be recognised that proceedings in the family jurisdiction are some of the most bitterly contested and intractable found in any court process. Judges and practitioners are well aware that child related proceedings may be brought with any number of collateral purposes, themselves a form of child abuse, and mechanisms must exist to deal with them. To the extent to which this bill facilitates that objective it will have the coalition's support but to the extent to which in the areas I have indicated the bill overreaches or erroneously applies the conclusions of the studies of the operation of the Ruddock reforms and in doing so sets back those objectives the coalition will move amendments to delete those provisions from the bill.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-11-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:50):  The Greens support the intent of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill. In 2006, when the Howard Government brought in their so called reforms to the Family Law Act, the Australian Greens expressed our strong concern and opposition to many of the amendments. In fact, we moved many of our own to address those issues. We were particularly concerned about the reforms that affected the best interests of the child, the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility and also the definition of domestic violence.


Specifically, we were concerned with the aspects of the bill that sought to privilege parents' rights over parental responsibilities and children's rights. The notion of equal shared parenting presented in this bill, we believe, reflected a commodification of children that failed to address the best interests of the child based on individual need and circumstances. We were also concerned that the definition of family violence adopted in the bill and then, of course, in the act failed to address the complexity and multidimensionality of this issue and, in so doing, did not provide adequately for family members at risk of family violence, particularly women and children. We were also concerned about the implications of some of the other amendments, specifically the cost orders for false allegations. I outlined these concerns at the time quite extensively, but I would particularly like to remind the chamber of a specific comment I made expressing concern that:


Provisions which require consideration of specific types of parenting arrangements, whether they call for equal or substantially shared time, necessarily direct attention away from a free and open consideration of what arrangements may be in the best interests of the child in any specific case. That is why the Greens believe that a presumption of equal shared responsibility should not be introduced and that each case should be considered on its own merits.


We were concerned at the time that:


… the two-tiered approach of having primary and additional considerations when determining the best interests of the child does not consider the best interests of the child. The Greens support the retention of the current structure of the act. We are concerned that the child's views will be relegated to the list of additional considerations, effectively putting the parent's desire for access ahead of the child's need for security.


I canvassed those issues extensively at the time. We are not surprised that, since then, these so-called reforms have come under harsh criticism from lawyers, advocates and parents for placing the rights of the parents over the best interests of the child. We believe that the reforms have put many children and their families in dangerous situations. That is why we welcome the government's efforts to address these problems and undo some—unfortunately, only some—of the mistakes made by the Howard government. Later, I will go into our concerns that this bill does not go far enough.


We support the prioritisation of the safety of children in family law proceedings and the changes to the definitions of family violence and abuse. Importantly, as we have advocated for over five years, the bill places the best interests of the child as the primary consideration in parenting matters. The definition of abuse has been expanded to include psychological harm, neglect and, notably, exposure to family violence, and a definition of family violence has been placed in the act. The friendly parent and mandatory costs orders provisions, both of which have raised great concern as a major disincentive for reporting family violence, are also being repealed. These changes, and many others contained within the bill, represent very important steps forward in protecting the best interests of children and victims of family violence. The Greens support these changes; however, we believe they do not go far enough.


In our dissenting report of the inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee into the 2006 amendments, the Greens recommended that the definition of family violence not be amended and considered that the proposed tests were not adequate. We further recommended:


Upon completion of the Australian Institute of Family Studies review; the Government should work closely with State and Territory Govern­ments to formulate a comprehensive, effective and uniform definition of family violence.


I am therefore very pleased that the government has revised the flawed approach of the 2006 changes. I commend this bill for recognising that exposure to family violence is a form of abuse. It is an important step in improving the protection of children and prioritising their safety. However, the Australian Greens believe that exposure should be included in the definitions of family violence and of abuse and that the definition of family violence should be clarified to ensure that the parent victim is not held responsible for the exposure. The Australian Law Reform Commission notes:


There has been a considerable amount of research documenting the fact that exposure of children to family violence causes long term emotional, psychological, physical and behavioural issues.


It urged the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill to include exposure in the definition of family violence and abuse, as certain behaviour can constitute both. It must also be made clear that victims of violence must not be held responsible for not being able to remove children from the violence. This recommendation is supported by the Australian Law Reform Commission and Women's Legal Services Australia. We seek assurances from the government that it considers this to be implicit in the changes it is making.


While we are pleased that the government is addressing the best interests of the child, we were concerned that, because some of the bill's other provisions were not being amended, the way in which the changes had been drafted presented inconsistencies about whether the best interests of the child or maintaining a meaningful relationship with parents prevails. This issue was raised in the committee inquiry by a number of witnesses and in a number of submissions. So we are pleased that the government is seeking to amend the bill to ensure that this is clear. The Australian Greens were concerned that the changes do not go far enough and that the changes do not go to the issues of perceived equal shared parenting and equal shared parenting responsibility. A large number of submissions, including those of professors Rhoades and Dewar and of the WLSA, recommended removing the two tiers of factors present in section 60CC and creating a single list, of which child safety would be the first consideration and be given priority. The government amendments address that. We would have liked to see them go a little bit further.


The Australian Greens support the fact the government has recognised that it is absolutely essential that the best interests of the child are given primary consideration. That is why we find it very concerning that the government took a step back from the amendments that, as I understand it, they were originally considering around address­ing equal shared parental responsibility, which the 2006 changes introduced into the act. We believe that the government has not gone far enough in addressing this issue and that having that in place still puts at risk the best interests of the child. 


We have consistently opposed the equal shared parental responsibility requirement since its introduction in 2006. As we argued at the time, it creates a de facto presumption of equal time. As I said at the time: 


While 'equal shared parental responsibility' and 'equal time' are not one and the same, they are inter-related in a way that creates an unacceptable formula in the bill—


I said 'bill', but it is now obviously in the act.


The concept has moved from a 'presumption of equal time' to a presumption of 'equal shared parental responsibility'. 


I acknowledge that. I went on:


However, we are concerned that with a starting point of a child spending 'equal time' or 'substantial and significant time' with each parent this will be a de facto presumption of equal time. 


The operation of a presumption such as this, de facto or otherwise, is likely to lead to an inappropriate and harmful focus in determining what is best for children


Evidence to the committee inquiry clearly pointed out that that is in fact what happens. Starting from a presumption of equal time, regardless of what is said about it not being that, that is in fact what happens.


Subsections 61DA(1) and (2) of the act required the court to presume that it is in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse or family violence. There are numerous problems with this provision. Professor Chisholm, an expert in this area of law, who presented a submission in person at the inquiry, has explained that aspects of the legislation, including ESPR, are 'unnecessarily complex and confusing, making it hard for people to focus on the best interest of children'. While the act does not create a presumption of favouring equal time, it can easily be interpreted that way, as it is the only outcome the act specifically mentions. Professor Chisholm notes:


On this, as on other matters, I believe that the Act is subtly incoherent, sending out inconsistent messages. Not surprisingly, the AIFS Evaluation and other reports reveal that it has caused considerable misunderstanding.


As I pointed out, that was raised a number of times.


According to evidence given at the inquiry, the presumption of equal shared care is meant to be rebutted by family violence, but it is not given due weight, especially at an interim stage where the family violence allegations are unlikely to be considered or tested. These concerns are supported by the AIFS evaluation which found that, of parents who had set up arrangements after the 2006 reforms, those with safety concerns were no less likely than other parents to have shared care-time arrangements. 


It is self-evident that failure to adequately consider family violence can lead to negative outcomes. Data provided as part of the inquiry indicates that the reforms have been successful in producing an increase in shared care arrangements since the legislation came into force. At the same time, however, the research indicates that a significant number of these arrangements are characterised by intense parental conflict and that shared care of children is a key variable affecting poor emotional outcomes for children. Further evidence from the Family Law Council stated that there is no clear evidence on the benefit of shared parenting arrangements. They said:


The recent research that has been released, including reports by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Cashmore and others and McIntosh and others, indicates that shared parenting arrangements of themselves offer no independent benefit to children compared with other types of arrangements where children see their non-resident parent regularly and there are no concerns about safety, violence and conflict.


It became increasingly evident throughout the hearing process that a flexible approach is needed, tailored to the circumstances of each family, not a one-size-fits-all requirement of shared responsibility. Parenting arrangements should always be governed by the best interests of the child and should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Evidence indicates that the presumption of ESPR does not necessarily equal the best interests of the child. We believe that these provisions should be repealed. In fact, I have got amendments to do that, because that would complement the other amendments that the government has made. This is not to say that we do not think shared parenting arrangements work. We are not saying that. We are saying you need to work those out in the best interests of the child, and there is still a part of this act that is inconsistent with the changes that the government wishes to make.


Finally, the Australian Greens draw attention to a recommendation made by the Women's Legal Service Australia when we were holding this inquiry into this bill. Over 50 per cent of parenting matters in the family law courts involve allegations of child abuse and/or family violence. As such, the WLSA recommends implementing a risk manage­ment framework to identify and explore issues of family violence and child abuse at the initial stages of application. Such early risk assessment 'would contribute to ensuring that the matter proceeds through the most appropriate court division and ensuring less adversarial and earlier resolution of issues' as well as assisting 'agencies to ensure that appropriate referrals can be made and safety planning undertaken for women and their children when necessary'. 


The Australian Greens recognise that implementing a risk assessment framework would present a significant and broad reform of the family law system and related government policy. However, we believe that this suggestion is worthy of support and we recommend that it be explored further in any other amendments that are made to the Family Law Act. We will be supporting this law reform. We believe they are significant reforms. As I articulated earlier, we believe that they address significant flaws in the Family Law Act. They do not go far enough. I was concerned, and am still concerned, that the government did not proceed with as full and extensive a set of amendments as we had at first anticipated they would. Having said that, these amendments will make a real difference to the safety of families, and the safety of children in particular, and put the best interests of the child at the centre of things rather than sublimating the interests of the child to the de facto presumption of equal shared care, which actually then prioritises a parent's rights above the best interest of the child. This redresses those flawed amendments. Having said that, we will be supporting this legislation. However, we will be moving amendments specifically to improve the definition of family violence and also, as I said, to remove the shared parental responsibility provisions that are currently in the Family Law Act.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2011-11-22,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (20:07):  I rise this evening to speak on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011, a bill which I believe is long overdue. This bill is important, as it seeks to address serious issues with our family law system. The system as it currently stands does not adequately protect children from family violence.


The evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that two-thirds of separated mothers and over half of separated fathers reported experiencing abuse, either emotional or physical, by the other parent—I want to emphasise that. The institute also found that one in five of the separated parents who were surveyed reported safety concerns associated with ongoing contact with their child's other parent. Disturbingly, the evaluation also found that shared parenting responsibility was the outcome for 75 per cent of children where there were allegations of family violence and child abuse. A report by the Family Law Council highlights data that victims of family violence receive more psychiatric treatment and have an increased incidence of attempted suicide and alcohol abuse than the general population. Violence is also a significant cause of homelessness. So research and various reports by leading social scientists and academics have consistently shown that exposure to family violence and child abuse leads to poor developmental outcomes for children.


It is truly concerning that the family law system in this country is failing our children. Children have a fundamental right to live happy and healthy lives in a safe environment. The family law system must prioritise the safety of children to ensure that their best interests are met. The bill before the Senate this evening goes a long way to addressing the current failings in our family law system. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Family Law Act 1975 to better protect children and families at risk of violence and abuse, while also making technical amendments to provide efficiencies for the courts and litigants.


The exposure draft of this legislation was released for public comment by the Attorney-General's Department as far back as November 2010, so it has been out there for at least a year. In that consultation period 400 submissions were received, with 73 per cent supporting the amendments and 10 per cent bravely offering information about people's own experiences with family law.


As the explanatory memorandum states, the key provisions of the bill aim to prioritise the safety of children in parenting matters; to change the definitions of 'abuse' and 'family violence' to better capture harmful behaviour; to strengthen the obligations of advisers by requiring family consultants, family counsellors, family dispute resolution practitioners and legal practitioners to prioritise the safety of children; to ensure that courts have better access to evidence of abuse and family violence by improving reporting requirements; and to make it easier for state and territory child protection authorities to participate in family law proceedings where appropriate.


I want to make it clear this evening that the government continues to support shared care and a child's right to a meaningful relationship with both parents. What I do not support is for shared care to take precedence over the safety and wellbeing of a child. That is what this bill clarifies: that the safety of the child is of utmost, paramount, import­ance. Importantly, the bill changes the definitions of family violence and abuse to better define harmful behaviour such as emotional, psychological and economic abuse and stalking. The definition clearly states examples of behaviour which may constitute family violence as including intentionally damaging or destroying property, intentionally causing death or injury to an animal, unreasonably denying a family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had, and preventing a family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture. Another important change clarifies that exposing a child to family violence is abuse in relation to the child. As victims know all too well, family violence takes many forms, not only physical, and can affect any member of the family regardless of gender.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which I chair, held a public inquiry into the bill that is before us today. The inquiry was referred to the committee on 25 March this year and we tabled our report on 22 August. We received 275 submissions, which I might say is quite a large number. They came from a range of organisations, government departments and individuals and the majority supported the bill's objectives. In its final report the committee made eight recommendations and I am pleased to say today that the government is adopting six of those eight, I think.


The government has accepted the following recommendations made by the committee. The first recommendation that our committee put forward, which has been adopted, is that we clarify the provision that requires the court to give greater weight to the protection of children from harm when determining what is in the child's best interests. Our third recommendation, which proposes a new paragraph to better define what a court can consider in relation to family violence orders as part of considering the child's best interests, will also be taken into consideration by this government in moving further amendments.


Recommendations 5 and 7 propose to have schedule 1 commence on the day after the end of the period of three months beginning on the day of royal assent. This will provide certainty around the commencement date of the provisions of the bill and the matters to which the amendments apply. This was a matter of some discussion amongst all members of the committee. As we all well know, when new legislation like this comes into place, there are always matters before the court that may or may not get caught up in the new provisions. That required some discussion and careful determination by the committee as to what we should do with regard to the recommendations in our report.


The sixth recommendation does not require amendments to the bill, but the committee proposed that the Attorney-General's Department, along with the family law courts and relevant organisations, institute an education campaign to ensure the public as well as those involved in the family law system are well aware of these new changes and how they may affect them.


We also recommended that the bill be amended to require that the Family Court give consideration to the reasons that one parent might not have facilitated a relationship with the other parent, and to remove reference to the word 'serious' in the new definition of abuse. With regard to the latter, organisations were concerned that only serious abuse is defined as child abuse, whereas it could be argued that any abuse is in fact serious. The Attorney-General's Department responded to those concerns by saying serious was included to avoid over-reporting, that authorities may be hindered from identifying and dealing with serious cases of harm due to excessive reporting. This government has also stated it does not accept those two recommendations as 'they would likely have unintended consequences and decrease protections for children from violence and abuse'.


As Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, I want to thank everyone who participated in the inquiry, brought forward submissions and appeared before us to give evidence, particularly those who attended the hearing.


There have been many reports into the family law system in Australia: the Australian Institute of Family Studies, the Australian Law Reform Commission, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, the Family Law Council and of course the work that has been done by Hon. Professor Richard Chisholm AM, to name a few, who have provided research and analysis into the failings of the current family law system. Their research has a similar conclusion: that more needs to be done to protect and support families within the system who have experienced or are at risk of abuse or violence, particularly children.


The bill before us today takes crucial steps towards ensuring that the safety of children is paramount, particularly during the difficult time of family separation. Also, the bill and the amendments that have been picked up by the government reinforces the valuable work that Senate committees do in this place in terms of looking at legislation and providing a means by which organisations and experts can have input into and propose sensible changes to legislation before us. Govern­ments are willing to listen and pick up those amendments and adopt them.


The bill retains the substance of the shared parenting laws that were introduced in 2006—and I cannot emphasise that enough. The bill continues to promote a child's right to a meaningful relationship with both parents, but with one very important condition: that the best interests of the child must and should always come first. The government has now picked up my committee's recommendations and will seek to amend those during the course of the debate on this legislation. I support the bill and commend my report and this bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (20:19):  No matter what position and what perspective one brings to discussion of family law, one thing we all agree on is that this is an incredibly difficult area of law and of public policy. Family law matters tend to be emotionally charged and too often of course involve intractable disputes, often dysfunctional parental or family dynamics, and tragically, as Senator Crossin and other senators have noted, sometimes even issues of abuse and domestic violence as well. It is often remarked, unfortunately, that lawyers practising in this area experience the highest rate of mental health problems: addiction, depression, marital problems and even suicide. Quite clearly, this is an area of law that takes its toll not only on the people subject to the law but on the very profession itself.


The legislators, the members of parliament and the senators concerned with family law in many ways have both the best and the worst of involvement. It is the best because our professional involvement often amounts to no more than a 20-minute debate contribution followed perhaps by a committee and then by a vote. But the worst because the laws we thus enact can make the difference between the hell or the mere purgatory for tens of thousands, young and old, brought before the family law system. The role of family law should ideally be to facilitate the smoothest resolution of the matters in dispute in what is, I think all senators would agree, typically an emotionally charged atmosphere, balancing competing interests in a way that is fair, just and equitable. In the end, the coalition is forced to conclude that this bill will take us further away from achieving this primary objective.


It is impossible to understand this bill without first understanding the context of the 2006 family law reforms. These legislative reforms followed literally years and years and years of consultations, which culminated in the landmark report Every picture tells a story by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in December 2003. That inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation undertook, I think it is fair to say, exhaustive public hearings. Most notably, the resulting report was—I should remind the Senate of this—bipartisan and the result was also unanimous. Over the next three years the report of the House of Representatives committee gave impetus to reforms that at their heart had the concept of shared parental responsibility. This involved recognition and protection of the right of the child to a mother and a father, as well as grandparents, in their lives. It also involved recognition that despite separation of parents shared care was an important ideal to strive for, particularly for children.


The 2006 reforms recognised that shared care was not always possible and, indeed, it was not always appropriate or responsible. As such it was not, and was never, the only consideration to be weighed in family law disputes. An extensive range of factors the courts must have regard to is set out in section 60CC of the act.


The bill before the Senate this evening at its core is a rollback of the 2006 shared care reforms. To the mind of the coalition, it reflects a lack of understanding as to how to truly put children and their best interests at the centre of family law proceedings. It shows no genuine understanding of how that system works in practice and of the many difficulties it produces. I believe that in the legislative struggle to make family law dispute resolution less like hell and more like purgatory, or perhaps hell with hope as it is often described, this bill tips the scales again back towards hell.


I worry that in time it will stand as yet another example of Labor's inability to implement anything competently. I am no expert on family law and I do not claim to be. But I am more than aware of heartbreaking stories of many men and many women and how their lives have been impacted and sometimes devastated when they come into contact with family law matters or separation from their children. I know all my coalition colleagues would agree that while we support the ostensible aim of this bill we cannot support the bill as it is currently drafted.


The coalition—and I share this with Senator Crossin and remarks made by other senators—believes strongly in protecting both children and adults from violence and abuse. The government is right to point that out. There is absolutely no excuse for domestic violence or sexual abuse of any kind against women, or children, or in some instances, against men. Of course, it is absolutely crucial that children are kept safe from abuse of all kinds: physical, emotional, sexual and so on. That is true.


But also it is critical that children are kept safe from the effects of false allegations of sexual abuse by one parent against another in family law proceedings. Let the Senate not forget that. Children need to be protected against both of these evils. Both can have devastating effects on families but, most importantly, long-term detrimental and profound effects on the kids involved, both socially and emotionally. The coalition's serious reservations and, indeed, our misgivings, about the key defects in this bill are reflected in the additional comments of coalition senators in the Senate committee's report on this bill, and I note Senator Humphries being here this evening.


Overall, the fundamental problem with this bill lies in the unintended, the unfair and potentially even the perverse consequences that will arise from the bill's application and from its interpretation. These consequences, to the mind of the coalition, threaten to undo any good otherwise achieved by the bill. Let me touch on a few of the failings of this bill as they are reflected in the opposition's amendments, to be moved later this evening in committee.


Firstly, the absurdly broadened definition of family violence diminishes and trivialises the very serious issue of violence which a small minority of men and some women perpetrate. The coalition is not opposed to a sensible broadening of the legislative definition of family violence, but the proposed new definition embraces such a breadth of behaviour as to make the concept of violence as commonly understood in the community almost meaningless. Combined with the removal of any objective criteria, thereby imposing an entirely subjective test of what constitutes family violence, this amendment can only lead to much heartache and much litigation.


Secondly, the repeal of the so-called 'friendly parent' provision makes little sense. That is, the removal of the current positive obligation upon separating parents to facilitate a child's relationship with the other parent, to have a positive duty to support that ongoing relationship. It is claimed this current provision inhibits women from disclosing violence, but where is the evidence of this other than the purely anecdotal? It is a very serious claim that the government has not really substantiated to underpin this bill. 


Thirdly, by repealing section 117AB, the bill also deletes the only penalty that applies to those who make—I want to emphasise this—deliberately false allegations of child abuse or family violence in proceedings. After the amended bill takes effect, what will be the sanction for someone who deliberately makes false allegations of child abuse? There will be none. Making an allegation that turns out to be unsubstantiated is one thing, as Senator Humphries knows. This is not simply an allegation that cannot be proven but one that is known to be false at the time it is made. What is the sanction? 




Senator Humphries:
  Zero.




Senator MASON:
  Senator Humphries is right. There is not one. Again, for this reason, the coalition does not support the bill. The coalition argues that it will be a great tragedy if this bill starts a race to the bottom to see who can allege family violence first. Husband or wife: who alleges it first? Will be it be a race to the police to allege family violence first? That really worries the opposition. It beggars belief that the government simply closes its eyes to this likelihood. Let us see what happens in the future. I hope I am wrong, but I am not sure I am. If an allegation does not have to be substantiated, if it is purely subjective and there are no penalties for making knowingly false allegations, do we really believe that some family lawyers and litigants will not use this procedurally to gain leverage and exert pressure upon the other party? Do we really believe that they will not do that? I wish I was wrong about human nature. 


If there is no longer a positive obligation to encourage and support a child to have a meaningful relationship with a former partner who is that child's parent, do we really believe that this will help children better cope at this most difficult time in their lives? Do we really believe that? If there is no longer a legal obligation, do we really believe that many people will not put their personal animosities, their conveniences and their comforts ahead of the objective best interests of their children? Just how much do we have to suspend our beliefs in order to pass this bill? 


Just as the government does not believe that this bill will have negative consequences, it does not believe it will require any additional resourcing for the Family Court or that it will create any increased workload. In this bill the government demonstrates a lack of understanding of both human nature and the nature of the family law system. It is a system already stretched to the absolute limit—delays are endemic and practitioners already describe the Family Court as the court of fairytale. That is without adding the burden of this bill's provision to the mix. 


Regrettably, the likely consequences of this bill will be a massive surge in the number of apprehended violence orders and temporary protection orders across Australia. I hope I am wrong, but I am just not sure I am going to be. Already discredited and all too often misused as tactical devices, DVOs will come into further disrepute and indeed further disdain. This is neither in the best interests of family law courts nor the children affected, let alone the women and children who genuinely need the protection of these court orders for their very safety. 


This bill will likely lead to more false allegations being made in family law proceedings. More children will be deprived of time and contact with one of their parents. Enormous pressure will be put on litigants to settle against the threat of unfounded allegations that do not have to be substantiated by the other party, and that is the key. Given that around 94 per cent of all family law cases are resolved before formally going to trial, only six per cent of family law cases go to final judgment. There is plenty of bargaining being done in the shadow of the law, as the old expression goes. 


While ostensibly intending to further protect those affected by violence and abuse with the shield of the law, the government has instead produced a club that parties to a dispute can use to freely trash each other. It is a club that the opposition is very concerned will be much used and indeed abused. The winners may well be the unscrupulous. The losers will be the real victims—the kids who will be unfairly denied contact with both parents and indeed our justice system. 


This is a difficult bill and I concede this is a very difficult area of law and public policy. I concede further that I am not an expert in this area, but I do know as a member of parliament that it is highly contentious, very emotional and very difficult. The coalition does not believe that this bill deserves the Senate's support. It does not believe the case for the amendments in schedule 1 of the bill has been made by the government.


Regrettably, I suspect the probably guillotining here tonight of this bill that is critical potentially for hundreds of thousands of people in this country. This is major legislation with a major impact. The bill will not receive the scrutiny it deserves, particularly in committee tonight, which is wrong, given that it will have such an enormous effect on the emotional and family structure in this country. This is a very important piece of legislation and will affect families throughout the nation. It will change the family dynamic. Indeed, it will change the prospects of custody for both men and women in our country. This is major legislation with major consequences.


In conclusion, I reiterate the coalition's deep concern about the drafting of this bill, the lack of evidence from the government to support these changes and the bill's dire implications for families already facing the heartache and difficulties of separation. It is such a pity we will not have further time, particularly in committee, to talk about the evidence that is available and ask the hard questions of the minister as to how the bill will operate. We are not going to have that time. It is a great pity and, given how important this bill is, it is ridiculous.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:38):  I will limit my remarks to no more than five or so minutes because I am grateful to my colleagues who have slotted me in tonight. I want to reflect on something that Senator Madigan told me privately, with his permission. I want to share his disgust at the lack of appropriate process in dealing with such an important piece of legislation.


What is more, there are four other bills tonight that there will be no opportunity to speak on because at 9.30 effectively the guillotine will be applied. We will not have an opportunity to discuss the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011, which deals with issues of systemic corruption; we will not have an opportunity to discuss the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011, again an important piece of legislation; we will not have an opportunity to discuss the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Participants in British Nuclear Tests) Bill 2011; nor will we have an opportunity to discuss the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oils in the Antarctic Area) Bill 2011. That is clearly unsatisfactory. This is meant to be the house of review. This is the place where we are supposed to scrutinise legislation. What is happening in this place tonight, and indeed what occurred last night, is completely unsatisfactory.


In the remaining two or so minutes I will reflect on this particular piece of legislation, the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. There is no question that the safety of children is absolutely fundamental and paramount in our family law system and that we are dealing with vexed and difficult issues. We are dealing with deep sadness, instances of violence and abuse and the fundamental issue of protecting children. I have reservations about the bill in its current form—reservations as to whether there will be a number of unintended consequences and as to whether we will end up taking a step backward from having a fair and just family law system, a system that will put the protection of children first and foremost.


I am concerned that the bill does, as Senator Brandis indicated, overreach and, by doing so, is fundamentally flawed. I think there are issues in relation to the proposed new definition of family violence—that the existing definition is being taken away from us and that issues of reasonableness and a test at common law will be taken away from us with this bill; not to have a more measurable test is deeply flawed. I am concerned that removing issues of reasonableness is dangerous. I am concerned, in relation to the friendly parent provisions that this bill effectively seeks to remove, that there will be a number of adverse consequences. I am concerned that the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee makes mention that some submitters argued that repealing the friendly parent provisions could reward those parents who actively prevent non-resident parents from having contact with their children. And I am concerned at remarks made by the Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Hon. Diana Bryant, who argued that many cases close to completion could be prolonged, putting children at extra risk by log jamming the courts and increasing family stress, unless there are significant extra resources for the Family Court.


But there is one clause that I find particularly objectionable, a clause that I think is almost Orwellian in its scope—that is, the clause that proposes to repeal section 117AB, which provides for mandatory costs orders in the event that false statements have been made. You need to prove that. There is a high threshold.


Mandatory costs orders in such circumstances send a strong message to family law litigants that making false allegations is not tolerated. Unfortunately, false allegations are made in this jurisdiction by all sides. There are a number of cases that have been brought to my attention. I will not mention the names of the parties but, for instance, there was a case where the mother was found to have fabricated allegations of abuse against the father, another where a father was found to have knowingly made false statements about the mother's parenting capacity, another where the mother was found to have knowingly made false statements that a child sustained an injury while in his father's care. Although mandatory costs orders are not often applied, removing the ability for the courts to impose such orders will remove the incentive for people not to make false accusations. That is a fundamental concern I have in relation to this bill.


I also have a concern about the process here. Australians deserve better. They deserve such an important piece of legislation to be debated properly, to be dealt with properly in the committee stages and to be subject to appropriate scrutiny—for questions to be asked and substantially answered by the government. We will not get that opportunity tonight.


I cannot support the bill in its current form. There will be a number of amendments moved by the coalition. I indicate that I will support those amendments because I think they will make the bill tenable. But in the absence of those amendments being passed, I cannot in good conscience support this bill.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2011-11-22,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (20:44):  I rise to speak in relation to the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. My Greens colleague Senator Rachel Siewert has already spoken on this bill, and I support her comments and the amendments she has proposed.


My comments on the bill, and the amendments proposed by the Greens, are informed by my experience in this area, which I think is particularly relevant. In the 1980s, I worked as a solicitor and some of my clients were women experiencing what was called domestic violence in those days but is now called family violence. More recently, I worked as a family dispute resolution practitioner or mediator with Relationships Australia until 2010. I will come back to those experiences in a minute. The government's stated purpose of the bill is to:


… amend the Family Law Act 1975 … to provide better protection for children and families at risk of violence and abuse.


Schedule 1 of the bill primarily amends part VII, dealing with children, of the Family Law Act 1975 to enable the courts and the family law system to respond more effectively to parenting cases involving violence or allegations of violence. Schedule 2 contains more technical and procedural amendments to the Family Law Act and Bankruptcy Act 1966. This proposed legislation has been prompted by research findings from credible Australian institutions and academics, including the Australian Institute of Family Studies in their Evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms, Professor Richard Chisholm in his Family courts violence review and the Family Law Council in its Improving responses to family violence in the family law system: an advice on the intersection of family violence and family law issues. In addition, the October 2010 report from the Australian Law Reform Commission and the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, Family violence—a national legal response, has informed the discussion about the current state of the law. 


Much of this research has been focused on assessing the consequences of the 2006 amendments to the Family Law Act, of which we have heard something tonight, to promote the equal sharing of time by parents after separation by creating a presumption of equal shared parental responsibility. Over time, through anecdotal evidence and then as a result of research findings, it has become clear that there are serious concerns about the effects of the 2006 changes to the law. 


During my time as a mediator, I worked with many separating couples. I was drawn to this work because it offers an alternative to the conflictual and adversarial process that sadly often accompanies family break-ups. By helping parents to focus on the most important aspect of their life together—their kids—they can be assisted to move beyond their hurt and discord to make strong and powerful decisions which benefit their children and, as a consequence, themselves. I have a strong belief in the value to children of having strong, loving relationships with both parents where those relationships are respectful, responsible and safe. My brother was the primary caregiver for his three daughters, nurturing them through their teenage years and into their secure, happy, adult years. I have the utmost admiration for the safe, loving environment in which he raised his daughters and the great job that most parents—fathers and mothers—do in raising their children. But the fundamental requirement for safety and protection of children from harm must not be sacrificed for some notion of a parent's unassailable right to have a relationship with a child if the risks associated with that relationship are unacceptably high. 


Unfortunately, in the course of my mediation work, it became increasingly apparent to me that what may have been well-intentioned amendments to encourage parents to share the parenting of their children after separation have had some unintended and extremely harmful consequences. It is some of those consequences which this legislation is aimed at addressing. It became obvious that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility for children had become a de facto presumption of equal time and was contributing to a rigid and demanding expectation on the part of parents which undermined the possibility of reaching a flexible agreement that responded to the unique needs of a particular child and family. Parents began to come to the mediation sessions with a fixed requirement based on the misconception that equal and shared parental responsibility meant equal parental time. Their rights to time with their child were uppermost in their mind—not the quality of the time or the needs of the child. They were fixated on their rights as against the rights of the other parent and the interests of the child were lost. 


Although I would try to encourage parents to focus on their child as an individual with particular and unique needs which needed to be factored into the arrangements they were making, there was often nothing I could do to shake the attitude. Quite often my attempts to explain the difference between shared responsibility and shared time would elicit incredulity or accusations that I was biased against one parent or the other. In one particular case, I was abused by an angry parent who refused to accept that it may not be in the best interests of his four-month-old daughter, who was still breastfeeding, to spend overnights away from her mother at that stage. He accused me of discriminating against him because he was not a woman—absolutely unwilling to consider the nutritional or emotional needs of his young child at that time because he was so fixated on his right to shared responsibility as a parent. 


Because some parents were demanding the right to 50 per cent of a child's time, it was difficult to get them to consider such things as the age of the child, the child's needs and circumstances, the practicality of arrangements which might mean travelling long distances to effect the changeover or the overall best interests of the child. I witnessed this across the whole spectrum of ages, from very young children right through to teenagers of 15 or 16 who had social lives and commitments of their own and were not very keen to be divided down the middle in order to meet their parents' sense of entitlement. 


Due to the pervasive view that equal shared parental responsibility means equal time, the default position for negotiating became a fifty-fifty shared care arrangement. Because of this, parents became less willing to negotiate any alternative that might take into account the child's needs based on their schooling, their interests or their particular personality. Where a child is quite robust, moving from one home to another on a regular basis—weekly, every three or four days or, in some notable cases, every two days—may not be difficult for them. But another child might have a personality which is not suited to constant change. A perceptive parent would see that their child would benefit from having a single identifiable home base while spending quality time with the other parent at that parent's home. But a parent fixated on strictly equal parenting time would be unable to recognise that need. I am strongly of the view—which is supported by evidence before the Senate inquiry—that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in section 61DA of the Family Law Act has detrimental outcomes for children. It skews the consideration of the court as to what the best interests of the child are and contributes to a prevailing misconception that parents are entitled to equal parenting time with their children irrespective of the child or the circumstances. The presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not conducive to the best interests of a child and should be repealed in accordance with the Greens amendments to be introduced by Senator Siewert.


Let me turn now to the vexed issue of family violence, which is an aspect of life for many Australian children and adults—and this bill reflects that reality. Ensuring their safety, as much as possible, must be a priority. In its study, the Australian Institute of Family Studies concluded that, while the 2006 reforms had a positive impact in some areas, there was clear evidence that the family law system as a whole had a way to go in achieving an effective response to families presenting with family violence and child abuse. Alarmingly, it noted that, while children in shared care represent a minority overall, and while the majority of families with shared care appear to be doing well, there is evidence that these arrangements are sometimes made even in circumstances where parents have safety concerns, with adverse consequences for the wellbeing of children. Alarmingly, the evaluation found that families where violence had occurred were no less likely to have shared care-time arrangements than those where violence had not occurred. Similarly, families where safety concerns were reported were no less likely to have shared care-time arrangements than families without safety concerns.


Evidence before the inquiry, including studies from the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Professor Richard Chisholm and the Family Law Council, indicates that provisions in the Family Law Act are a disincentive to parents to raise safety concerns for fear of falling foul of the court. These include the so-called 'friendly parent' provisions and the ability of the court to order costs for false allegations against another parent.


It is not hard to understand why this would occur, as in each case the stakes are high for a parent who is not believed. In relation to the 'friendly parent' provisions, a court is required to take into account the willingness and extent to which one parent has facilitated the child having a relationship with the other parent when determining the best interests of the child and, ultimately, orders dealing with parenting arrangements and parental responsibility. A finding that a parent has not facilitated the relationship with the other parent may result—and has resulted—in a court deciding to grant more, or exclusive, time with the other parent even though there may be good reasons to explain the failure to facilitate, such as a fear of violence, abuse or risk to the child. Professor Chisholm's review concluded:


On the material available, it seems likely that the friendly parent provision, s 60CC(3)(c), while it might have had a beneficial effect in many situations, has had the undesirable consequence in some cases of discouraging some parents affected by violence from disclosing that violence to the family court.


In my mediation work I witnessed coercive, threatening and sometimes violent relation­ships where there was pressure by one parent on the other to agree to fifty-fifty shared care because it was seen as a default position, a normative arrangement, irrespective of the effect on the child. I also saw parents who were subject to violence or intimidation or were concerned about the treatment of their children by the other parent but who were reluctant to discuss these things or to withstand the pressures of the other parent to reach agreements about parenting that they felt were not in the best interests of their children. This was because they were fearful of being labelled an 'unfriendly' parent, due to the serious consequences such a label would attract. So they made a choice, understandable in the circumstances, to stay silent or risk losing contact with their child.


This bill will amend the 'friendly parent' provision by requiring a court to consider why a parent may not have been willing or able to facilitate the child's relationship with the other parent, and those reasons may well encompass violence or abuse. If the 'friendly parent' provision is to remain a factor to be taken into account by a court, and this bill does not repeal the provision altogether, it is imperative that the court be required to consider the context for a parent's failure to facilitate the child's relationship with the other parent. This will provide a fuller picture of the situation for the court and encourage a parent to disclose violence or abuse.


I also support the bill's removal of the mandatory penalty of $10,000 to be imposed by the court for false allegations of family violence or abuse. The evidence before the inquiry was that it had been little used but still caused fear among those who had experienced violence or abuse but were terrified that they would not be able to prove it, thus silencing them. Many of the submissions to the inquiry supported the repeal of the relevant section because it had the effect of discouraging the disclosure of violence and abuse. That is not good for the person who has been subject to the violence and it is not good for the children who are part of that relationship.


In conclusion, our family law system must make the safety of children a priority. This must be the predominant determinant of their best interests. There is a compelling case for reform of the existing situation. This bill has been the subject of a thorough inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. Submissions were received from a diverse range of individuals and organisations. Of these, 73 per cent were in favour of the proposed amendments to the Family Law Act contained in the bill. More recent research from the Benevolent Society based on a survey of 1,071 respondents revealed that 93 per cent of people agreed that safety and security are the most important issues for a child when a relationship between parents breaks down, and between 86 and 93 per cent of the respondents agreed that a child's right to safety is more important than a parent's right to equal time.


I commend the government for the reforms that are included in this bill. It has heeded the calls of many for changes to a system that was clearly not adequately protecting some children and adults from family violence and abuse. However, as I have discussed, I believe that these measures have not gone far enough in responding to the evidence of what is needed to protect children and adults from family violence. For this reason, I urge the Senate to support the further amendments that will be moved by the Australian Greens.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (20:59): I also want to say a few words in support of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The coalition, as has been indicated by Senator Brandis, supports the strengthening of the provisions relating to family violence and child abuse because the coalition believes that nothing is more important than the welfare of children in the event of marital breakdown. The fact that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee heard submissions from some 200 interest groups on this issue is testament to the broad community concern the matter has generated.


In 2006 the Howard government recognised some of the shortcomings of the Family Law Act following the handing down of the House of Representatives committee report entitled Every picture tells a story. Our government enacted appropriate amendments. The bill before the Senate takes those improvements a step further. I commend the bill because it provides greater protection for the most vulnerable members of our society—our children—during and after a relationship breakdown. We should all be disturbed at the statistics showing an alarming prevalence of abuse experienced by separated mothers and fathers. A detailed study by the Australian Institute of Family Studies revealed that two-thirds of separated mothers and over half of separated fathers reported experiencing physical or emotional abuse from the other parent. One in five parents expressed safety concerns associated with contact with the other parent.


Having said that, I want to raise a potentially disturbing matter relating to the valuable work of the Family Court based in Townsville. As senators will know, my office is based in Townsville and I live in that region, and I am interested in how the Family Court does its work in that area. There has been a Family Court judge based in Townsville since 1982, servicing not just Townsville but the whole of the vast North Queensland region. The incumbent Family Court judge, the Hon. Justice Monteith, is due to retire at the end of November, but there is no certainty that he will be replaced. This is despite assurances given prior to the 2007 federal election by the then shadow Attorney-General Senator Joe Ludwig that the position would be retained.


In addition to Senator Ludwig's 2007 commitment the Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Hon. Diana Bryant, publicly assured the Townsville legal profession in early 2008 that the Townsville based position of a Family Court judge would be maintained. Despite Senator Ludwig's promise and Justice Bryant's assurance the Gillard government has so far declined to name a successor, prompting very great and very real concern in legal circles in the north and raising serious questions about the truthfulness of the assurances given by this government. Could this be another lie in the making? We all know that Prime Minister Gillard went to the last election promising not to introduce a carbon tax, but what did she do as soon as she was elected? She broke her solemn word to the Australian people and introduced her toxic carbon tax, under duress from Senator Brown and the Greens, in a desperate bid to cling to power.


There can be no question about the need to continue the work of the Family Court in North Queensland. Indeed, there is a case, I submit, for providing even more resources than the court currently has at its disposal. As most senators would know, Townsville and the North Queensland region have grown exponentially since 1982 when the first Family Court judge was appointed. This growth has been fuelled by major develop­ments in the defence, mining, minerals processing and primary industry sectors. Over the next few months 750 soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment and their families will complete their relocation to Townsville, boosting the regional economy by an estimated $60 million a year. New mines are being opened up and many existing mines are being expanded to keep pace with the international demand for our mineral resources. This is despite the minerals resource tax imposed by the Labor government—which will only last as long as the Labor government does, and hopefully that will be a very short time. International mining companies, understanding that this government is on a very limited tenure, are still looking at the north of Australia for further investment in minerals.


Over 40 per cent of Australia's export earnings, I am always proud to say, are now generated in Northern Australia, despite the fact that only five per cent of Australia's population lives in what we class as Northern Australia. But this incredible growth brings with it an increase in social problems and marital breakdown, and this is exacerbated in the north by issues such as defence related psychological factors, fly-in fly-out working arrangements and deprived living conditions in Indigenous communities which exist mainly in northern and remote Australia. These factors have combined to significantly increase the case load for the Townsville based Family Court, which covers the vast area from as far south as Rockhampton and Mackay, north to Cairns and west to Mount Isa and encompasses Cape York and the Torres Strait Islands. Even the Labor Party, which has shown little interest in rural areas such as North Queensland, should be able to recognise the importance of supporting the work of the Family Court in this region by announcing a replacement for the retiring Judge Monteith as a matter of urgent priority. I fear that with a Canberra based government consisting of the Labor Party, who have little interest in Northern Australia and little interest in regional Australia, this is another one of their out of sight, out of mind approaches.


The President of the Townsville District Law Association, Diane Ruhl, wrote to the Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert McClelland, on 8 November this year formally requesting that he honour Senator Ludwig's election promise to continue the practice of basing a Family Court judge in Townsville by naming Justice Monteith's successor. I understand that to date there has been no response to the law association's request. The Labor government and the Labor Party showed no hesitation when Senator Ludwig shut down the northern live cattle export industry to appease the Greens earlier this year, with disastrous consequences for Northern Australia. I now call upon Senator Ludwig to urge the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, to honour the election promise that Senator Ludwig made in 2007 and thereby put to rest any suggestion that Justice Monteith will not be replaced and that the valuable work of the Family Court in North Queensland can continue.


Unfortunately Senator Ludwig, who represents the Attorney-General in this chamber, is not here tonight to hear this debate. I call on Senator Conroy, who is the minister at the table, to seriously listen to the issues of the Family Court in Townsville. Senator Conroy, could you please pass this on to your colleague Senator Ludwig, who was the Attorney-General when he came to Townsville prior to the 2010 election and promised the Townsville people that there would be a new appointment of a Family Court judge in Townsville. Many of us in Australia have got to the stage where we assume promises by Prime Ministers from the Labor Party and ministers from the Labor Party will never be honoured. Who can blame Australians for being cautious of promises made by Labor Party ministers when their own leader, Ms Gillard, promised prior to the last election there would be no carbon tax. We are now in the throes of implementing a carbon tax for Australia in spite of the Prime Minister's assurance and solemn promise that it would not happen. I leave that to one side.


It is important that the north of Queensland have a resident Family Court judge. Justice Monteith, I repeat, is retiring at the end of this month. Why the government has not announced a successor to Justice Monteith is of great concern not just to the legal profession but to all people in North Queensland. I repeat again that it is a fast-growing area of Australia. It has more than sufficient work in the Family Court to be assured of a Family Court judge permanently based in Townsville. I ask the minister at the table, who I assume is dealing with this legislation in the Senate chamber: why has the Gillard government not yet announced a successor to Justice Monteith just a few days before his retirement? I would ask you, Senator Conroy, to speak to Senator Ludwig, who as Attorney-General made this solemn commitment to the Townsville legal community and indeed to the wider Townsville and North Queensland community that there would be a northern based Family Court judge. I simply repeat: if there is to be another northern based Townsville judge, why has it not been announced just 10 days before the retirement of the incumbent northern Family Court judge?


I fear that my pleas are falling on deaf ears. For those who might be interested in this debate and are listening to the broadcast, there are two Labor Party people in the chamber tonight for this very important debate. The minister is reading his laptop and seems to be taking no interest. Perhaps I malign him. I would ask you, Senator Conroy, to take this message to your colleague in this chamber Senator Ludwig, and to Mr McClelland, and to give us some assurance in the next few days of who the successor to retiring Judge Monteith might be. Whilst I never expect much from the Labor government at the present time, I would hope that your advisers, Minister, will take these pleas on notice and perhaps come back to me within 24 hours and indicate just who the successor to the northern Family Court judge might be. With that plea, which I fear has fallen on deaf ears in this chamber, I indicate my support for the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and my support for the submissions made by Senator Brandis on behalf of the coalition.

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (21:14):  I rise to support the coalition's position on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. I do want to focus in particular on the amendments proposed in item 17 of this bill to section 60CC(2)(a). Before I do that, however, I want to make it clear that I do not profess to be any sort of expert in family law. I have had some experiences in court, some more recent than others, but I have certainly not been near and hope to never go near the Family Court or the Federal Magistrates Court exercising the family law jurisdiction. That said, I can read legislation, statutes and bills. On that basis, I have some questions, some of which I was fortunate enough to be able to ask during a Senate inquiry into this bill but which I was unfortunate, I think, not to have had answered through questions on notice during that inquiry. I think this Senate is even more unfortunate in that I and my colleagues and the likes of Senator Xenophon and Senator Madigan have not been allowed the proper time and the proper process to ask about the very important issues that underlie not only this bill but family law writ large as implemented in this country.


Item 17, as I understand it—and I refer to the explanatory memorandum—says that the new subsection 60CC(2A) requires the court:


… when determining what is in a child’s best interests, to give greater weight to the primary consideration that protects the child from harm in cases if there is inconsistency in applying the considerations.


The explanatory memorandum goes on to say that the new provision will make it clear that:


… the two primary considerations are: (a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents; and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.


Obviously those are very important concerns. The explanatory memorandum then goes on to say:


Where child safety is a concern, this new provision will provide the courts with clear legislative guidance that protecting the child from harm is the priority consideration.


That is not the evidence that was given to the Senate committee. That was not the evidence that was reported in the Senate committee's report as a result of the inquiry—clear legislative guidance.


Professor Richard Chisholm told the committee that the intended provision was anything but clear. Whilst he did say that this provision would improve the law, he recommended an amendment to it. As of this moment, we do not know if the government have taken it up or not and we will not have the opportunity to debate it because of the time we do not have to speak on or deal with the bill. But Professor Chisholm, before saying, 'Well, okay, this provision will make it better than it is at the moment,' said that this provision was yet another technical complication. That is hardly clear, despite the government's explanatory memorandum. He went on to say that, with the new subsection, the decision maker will have to decide if there is an inconsistency between the two provisions. He went on to say that, if there is, greater weight must be given to the second provision—the safety of the child. But how much greater? He argues that the new provision is certain to increase the amount of complication and technicality relating to determining what is best for children. That is hardly clear legislative guidance.


Nor, despite clear legislative guidance being claimed by the explanatory memorandum, is it guidance according to the Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland. It told the inquiry that, in its view, rather than providing guidance the proposed amendment contained in the bill mandates a court to give greater weight to the second of the primary considerations—that is, the safety of the child—in the event of there being a conflict between that and the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. The Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland told the inquiry in its submission:


Such a provision removes the Court’s licence to assess in each individual case the degree of risk, its probability or in the case of family violence its context in terms of frequency, intensity and recency in the determination of the weight to be given to such risk or harm.


It urges caution in terms of the legislation becoming:


… too specific, descriptive, prescriptive or presumptive with respect to the treatment of risk.


As far as we can tell, the government has done nothing about that concern expressed by the Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland. In fact, it has flown in the face of it by maintaining the very provision that that association criticised and claiming in its recent supplementary explanatory memorandum that this provision provides clear legislative guidance. Well, poppycock!


As for the extent to which a child may be at risk of violence, there is nothing in the bill to make clear what is to be required by a court in terms of the second limb to which priority is now to be given—that is, the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm or being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence. How is it not going to be as simple as one party to the earlier relationship alleging a concern about violence? As Family Voice Australia said to the committee:


The phrase 'any inconsistency' virtually invites the court to ignore completely the requirement to consider 'the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents' once it decides to entertain an allegation of any kind about abuse or exposure to family violence.


So there is nothing clear about this provision at all. It is a mandate, not guidance. It is an invitation for one party to a former relationship to make an allegation. Worse than that, when we pressed the government and officers of the Attorney-General's Department to provide the government's evidence of the need for this position and to demonstrate its case that this provision will fix whatever it says is the problem, all the department and the government could provide was the report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, which was foreshadowed by the Howard government in implementing the earlier reforms in 2006—actually, the reforms in 2006, because this bill is no reform; reform in my book is usually good. The department, in answer to its question on notice, citing only the Institute of Family Studies report as evidence that the existing law needed change, cited findings that two-thirds of mothers and half of fathers separated since 2006 reported that their child's other parent had emotionally abused them. I thought it was the safety of the child that was paramount, not what happened to mum or dad.


The second so-called bit of evidence from the same report was that around one in four mothers and one in six fathers reported that the other parent had hurt them physically prior to separation. I make the same point: that is about the mums and dads; it is not the kids. The only one that gets close to the kids is this one: around one in five parents reported safety concerns associated with ongoing contact with a child's other parent. What does that mean? What is that by way of evidence? It is not hard to imagine in marriage breakups that one parent might want to allege concerns about safety in proximity of children from the former partner whom they liked a lot and with whom they are now largely disaffected.


Turning to my final point, which consolidates my concerns. I asked the department during the hearing: 


What evidence do you have that item 17 of the bill will address that evidence and fix, for example, the concern that a fifth of parents have ongoing concerns about their child's safety?


Mrs Pirani from the department said:


I guess we do not know until the changes are made.


That is it. I guess the government does not know until the changes are made. My colleague Senator Mason talked about this bill really taking family law from being hell, or maybe it was the 2006 reforms that took it to being hell with hope. I reckon mums and dads will just want to hope like hell, because that is about all they are going to have, in my humble opinion, if this bill becomes law.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (21:25):  I am very pleased to contribute to this debate on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011, such as my opportunity will be, given that the debate is to be truncated by the guillotine. Like Senator Fisher, I was a participant in the inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee into this legislation. I think that the legislation represents a very significant piece of change to the law. Like Senator Fisher I hesitate to call it reform, although I have to acknowledge that some parts of the legislation are valuable, do improve the state of the law and do make it easy to use for those people who require access to the Family Court. I echo the concerns of colleagues on this side of the chamber in this debate: significant changes in the law will be enacted by the Senate tonight in a shortened debate. We will not have time to consider amendments put forward by the Greens and by the coalition. We will not have key opportunities to consider issues in the legislation which are critical and which have been extensively debated in the public arena and in specialist circles and which were subject to intense debate before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee or to consider issues around which there is a rich vein that the Senate ought to be explore. We will not deal with them tonight except by a simple vote on the floor of the Senate.


In her contribution, Senator Wright advocated for her amendments. Maybe she has put forward, on behalf of the Greens, some wonderful amendments to this legislation. I am afraid we will not get the chance to find out, because Senator Wright and her colleagues in the Greens have joined with the Labor Party to ensure that there will not be a committee stage on this bill. We will not have a chance to debate the amendments that the Greens are putting forward, wonderful though they might be.


I ask senators to consider what we are dealing with tonight. These amendments, in effect, go to the framework of family law in this country. The Family Law Act 1975 was a seismic change in the landscape with respect to personal relationships in this country. It was very significant legislation. We can all have different views about this, but it was undoubtedly an iconic piece of law reform. Tonight, we are dealing with that legacy. We are dealing with that great change in the law and the consequences and the developments that we have dealt with in the succeeding 35 or so years. But we are dealing with it tonight in an entirely unsatisfactory way. We are going to rush this through the Senate. We have important amendments to consider, but we are going to rush this through the Senate because of the deal that has been done between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens.


I wonder what the ghosts of people like Lionel Murphy, Lionel Bowen, Bob Ellicott and others who were involved with those great debates would think, as they look down on this debate, about the way the Senate is dealing with that legacy legislation and the changes we are making to it, supposedly to bring it into contemporary use and to address the needs of 21st-century Australia. What would they make of it if they saw this debate going on? I do not think they would think very much of it, but that is the way it is being handled tonight.


I will address some of the issues in this legislation and point out what I believe would be some of the advantages were the Senate to adopt the amendments put forward by the coalition. I want to affirm, though, that the coalition very much values the essential elements of the legislation as it now stands and believes that our amendments underpin those important values—values that were described in the 2006 amendments moved by the then Attorney-General Philip Ruddock as the shared parenting reforms. We stand by a central feature of that legislation, which was that the paramount consideration of the courts was the best interests of the child when it came to issues relating to the care and maintenance of that child. We stand by the presumption, displaced only on substantial and exceptional grounds—for example, on the basis of what is in the best interests of the child—that there should be equal shared parental respon­sibility in the raising of a child and in the direction made by parents in the course of a child's life. We stand by the recognition in the law—again, I emphasise, subject to a child not being exposed to harm or having its interests otherwise detracted from—of the benefit to a child of having a meaningful relationship with both of its parents. Those principles are in the legislation. They have been there for some time. The level of emphasis placed on those principles has varied from time to time, but those values are core to the way that our Family Law Act works today, and we believe on the coalition side that they ought to be retained and not detracted from.


It is fair to say that the 2006 reforms did require the court to take into account a parent's willingness to abide by those principles dealing with the behaviour of a parent and the parent's attitude towards another party to the marriage or relationship—again, subject to the child's best interests. I heard a suggestion in the course of the debate by Senator Crossin that, for example, in some way the reforms of 2006 weakened or watered down the central focus on the court making decisions that were subject to the child's best interests. That, of course, is completely untrue. The paramount consideration before the court remains what is in the child's best interests. The extent to which other considerations can apply subject to that overarching qualification is what, in a sense, the 2006 reforms and this legislation debate.


Much of the bill enacts appropriate, balanced refinements of the law, but it is the view of the coalition that some of the amendments do undermine the shared parenting principles. Accordingly, the coalition has moved amendments to protect those principles—principles which we were responsible for in the first place. I want to touch on a few of those in a few minutes given I do not have an opportunity to put these issues in the course of a committee stage debate. The issue of a friendly parent provision reflects the fact that coalition senators in the course of the inquiry believed that the bill, to some extent, undermined the principles of shared parenting by repealing those provisions in existing paragraphs 60CC(3)(c) and 60CC(4)(b), which take account of a party's willingness to facilitate another party's involvement in the child's welfare. It is hard to represent those changes as anything other than an attack on that key principle of shared parenting. We were not persuaded that parties to proceedings are not disclosing concerns about family violence or child abuse for fear of being found to be an unfriendly parent. That was not the substantial weight of the evidence before the committee, in our opinion. We consider that the provisions should be preserved as they stand now, more or less, in order to ensure that that important principle is not detracted from. 


On the question of a new definition of family violence, the coalition senators who took part in the inquiry certainly endorsed the objective of giving greater recognition to the breadth of behaviours comprising family violence in our community. However, we did not consider in this inquiry that the net should be cast so wide as to capture all human behaviours, which is what the proposed definition effectively would do. Professor Richard Chisholm, a former judge of the Family Court, gave very strong evidence that there were problems with proposed new subsection 4AB(1). I note that Senator Wright quoted approvingly of the evidence given by Professor Chisholm. I hope she listened, therefore, to the suggestion that we perhaps should consider a different approach towards this particular provision than the one the government is proposing to the Senate. Professor Chisholm said that the new subsection was overinclusive and captured any behaviour that caused a family member to be fearful. I think he gave the example of a family member who rushed into a room to say: 'Fire! Fire! Get out of the house now.' That kind of behaviour would be captured as being behaviour that would cause a member of the family to be fearful, even though it obviously is not appropriate to characterise that as something which could be called family violence. Coalition senators believe that such a provision undermines the objective of the bill as it makes no allowance for the intent of the party giving rise to this 'fear'. Professor Chisholm proposed an alternative provision, which I would commend to the Senate. We will not have a chance to debate those sorts of provisions because the debate has been truncated.


Other senators, including Senator Mason, have made reference to the absolutely preposterous proposal to remove section 117AB of the legislation that allows the Family Court to make an order for costs—a rare thing in the Family Court—where a party has deliberately come forward and knowingly made false allegations of abuse and family violence in the course of Family Court proceedings. We are not talking about allegations which are made which cannot be substantiated on the balance of probabilities. We are not talking about claims that are contested before the court which the court considers in all the circumstances to be made out or not to be made out. We are talking about a finding by the court that a party to the proceedings has deliberately set out to mislead the court by making false allegations of abuse or family violence. The court has the power under the present framework of the law to make an order for costs against the party making false allegations. It is preposterous that this bill proposes to take that power away from the Family Court on the basis that some people have misunderstood what that provision means or that some people have supposedly failed to make allegations that there had been violence in a relationship for fear that they might be ordered to pay costs.


Senator Wright said that there was evidence that this was a widespread problem. With great respect, that was not the evidence that was presented to the committee. The evidence was that it was rumoured to be an issue. Nobody could actually come forward to the committee and tell us that they actually had a case where it had occurred. No-one provided that evidence and the Family Court representatives themselves who came before the committee said that they did not have any evidence of such practices going on. On that basis, the government proposes to remove the capacity of the court to punish a party, in effect—not through an order to award a child to another party, not to take away from the best interests of the child, obviously—and to send the signal that deliberately false allegations should carry some consequence, should resonate through an order for costs. To suggest that that should be removed from the legislation is just outrageous. I think the government's approach to this issue is completely misconceived.


The coalition is also concerned about the timing of the commencement of the legislation. The Family Court itself expressed a preference for the substantive provisions of the bill to apply only to those applications filed after the commencement date of this legislation. Has the government done that? No, it has not. It is applying the provisions to earlier litigation, with the potential effect that parties will have to go back to the court and amend their pleadings before the court because the law changed after the proceedings had commenced. I would have thought that was quite an unsatisfactory state of affairs, but that is what the legislation the government is putting forward does. We do not have a chance to debate this issue properly, because again this amendment cannot be considered in the course of tonight's debate.

Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I have a point of order. I ask how under the standing orders we can possibly vote on this when I have not heard the Greens move the amendment and explain what the amendment is. I may well want to vote for it but I have had no opportunity to hear the debate. I simply ask how could we possibly have—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Macdonald, resume your seat.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Conroy and those on my left. Senator Macdonald, you have the call and you are raising a point of order.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I was raising the point of order that we are being asked to vote on some amendments moved by the Greens. I have not heard the Greens move the amendments. I do not know what the arguments are. I fancy that I may want to vote for them but I have not heard them debated. How can I possibly vote for an amendment that I have not heard debated.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  There is no point of order. A resolution of the Senate was passed yesterday to orchestrate the facility of the bills to be put as they are currently being put. The question now is that amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7150 circulated by the Australian Greens be agreed to.

  A division is required.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  I will go back to the previous question. A division is required. Ring the bells for one minute.



An opposition senator:  This is a farce.




Senator Brandis:
  I have a point of order, Mr Deputy President. You have called this vote for the ayes. You asked whether a division was required. There was no voice for the noes calling for a division.




Senator Conroy:
  Yes, there was.




Senator Brandis:
  No, there was not. You then moved on. If the government, who have obviously not been following the process tonight, have made a mistake and they wish the matter to be recommitted there is a manner of doing that. But the manner of doing that is not to shout down the Presiding Officer, as government senators have been attempting to do. If they want to recommit the division they should get up and explain themselves.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Thank you, Senator Brandis. There was a lot of noise in the chamber. Government senators as well as opposition senators have been making a lot of noise during all of the divisions and the reading out of what the divisions are. I am happy to give the government the benefit of the doubt and allow them to call the division because of the noes that they have called. A division has been called for; the bells are going to be rung for one minute. Clerk, have the bells been rung for one minute? No? Ring the bells for one minute.

  The question is that amendment (11) on sheet 7149 moved by the opposition be agreed to.

Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order on a very serious matter of etiquette in this chamber. There are two Labor senators sitting where I normally sit. They happen to be looking through my papers. 



Government senators interjecting—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, this is a very, very serious matter. When we move sides in this chamber you expect that you can leave your papers on your desk and not have them looked at by members of the other party. I would ask that the matter of Senator Collins looking through my papers actually be—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Put it on the record!




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Macdonald has the call, in an unusual circumstance, being out of his seat. Senator Macdonald.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I only paused then because Senator Collins was shouting at one of my colleagues. But I do raise this as a very serious matter of privilege that someone who is sitting in my seat because we have changed sides is actually looking through my papers that I left on my desk about the speeches I am going to make on the next four bills that are scheduled to be dealt with by this chamber tonight. I am very serious about senators from other parties looking through the papers of senators from the other party when they sit in their seats because of changing sides in divisions. I think I should ask that this matter actually be referred to the Privileges Committee.




Senator Lundy:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order there is absolutely no basis to the complaint that Senator Macdonald has made. I am sitting next to Senator Collins, and it is utterly false.



Opposition senators interjecting—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senators on my right, order! Senator Macdonald, in relation to your point of order, I say two things. I remind all senators that the courtesy and the conduct of this Senate over numerous years is that you do observe that protocol of not reading material on desks when divisions are in progress. That is the first matter. The second matter, Senator Macdonald, is I will discuss with the President your cause and if further action needs to be taken the President can make that decision and come back to the Senate.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (19:30):  Family law is the one jurisdiction of the federal judicial system to which almost all Australians have some level of exposure at some time in their lives. It is a sad fact of life that virtually every one of us will either have a first-hand experience or have someone—or most likely more than one person—within our family or close circle who will have contact with the Family Court or the Federal Magistrates Court in its family law jurisdiction. It is also a sad fact of life that family law disputes are among the most intractable matters that come before a court, often in a context of extreme personal bitterness and too often occasioned by violence and abuse of the most horrible kind, conduct which, it should be unnecessary to say, is abhorrent to all members of the community.


It is also a fact of life that any attempt to resolve these disputes will often leave both parties feeling aggrieved and, much worse, their children exposed to the fallout and remaining at risk of violence and abuse. Many of the failed relationships that come before the courts have been blighted by mental illness and substance abuse problems, sometimes on both sides, and because judges are human the courts do not always get it right, much as they strive to do so. In disputes involving children, the principal guidance provided by the Family Law Act is that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration. Just how the best interests of children can be determined, however, is and will always be a vexed question and a matter on which decent people will arrive at different views.


In December 2003 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs tabled a unanimous report entitled Every picture tells a story. The committee was asked to consider, given that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration, what other factors should be taken into account in deciding the respective time each parent should spend with their children post-separation. The committee, headed by Kay Hull MP, heard evidence from more than 2,000 witnesses over the course of six months. One of its findings, which informed many of its recommendations, was:


We—


that is, the entire committee across party lines—


are convinced that sharing responsibility is the best way to ensure as many children as possible grow up in a caring environment. To share all the important events in a child’s life with both mum and dad, even when families are separated, would be an ideal outcome.


The committee heard heartbreaking evidence of children separated from one of their parents by inflexible Family Court orders which caused anguish to parents and children alike and which had long-term detrimental effects on children. The so-called 'shared parenting laws' which were introduced by Mr Ruddock, the Attorney-General in the Howard government in 2006, were a response to the report. In my view, they were some of the best and most important law reforms for which that great Attorney-General was responsible.


The changes to the family law system included changes to both the legislation and the family relationship service system. The main elements of the legislative changes were: to require parents to attend family dispute resolution before filing a court application, except where there are serious concerns about family violence and child abuse; to place an increased emphasis on the need for both parents to be involved in their children's lives after separation, including the introduction of a presumption of shared parental responsibility; to place greater emphasis on the need to protect children from exposure to family violence and child abuse; and to introduce legislative support for less adversarial court processes in children's matters. This legislative suite included a requirement for the Australian Institute of Family Studies to undertake a large-scale longitudinal evaluation of the effect of the reforms. That evaluation was completed in December 2009, and I will return to its findings in a moment.


The coalition is proud of the Ruddock reforms. The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 seeks to amend the Family Law Act by including an additional object to give effect to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which decision-makers may have regard when dealing with children's matters. This will change the definitions of family violence and abuse; strengthen the obligations of lawyers, dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors to prioritise the safety of children; require inquiry and reports on family violence and child abuse in court proceedings; repeal the so-called 'friendly parent provisions'; repeal the provision for cost orders in the case of false family violence allegations; and provide for simpler procedures for the participation of child welfare agencies in family law proceedings. Some of these amendments will have the coalition's support. Others, however, in our view will have the effect of winding back the Ruddock reforms and will therefore be opposed. I will deal with the substantive provisions in turn.


The bill proposes to insert a new section 60CC, which requires the court when determining what is in the child's best interests to give greater weight to the primary consideration that protects the child from harm where there is inconsistency in applying the two primary considerations, the other being the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. This amendment is unnecessary and gratuitous. The existing section 60CA makes the best interests of the child the paramount consideration. The existing section 60B clearly articulates that a meaningful relationship with a parent is subordinate to the paramount consideration. In purported aid of the objective of this amendment, the bill seeks to add as a further object of part VII of the act that it is to give effect to the UN convention. The explanatory memor­andum states that the intention is to confirm in cases of ambiguity that part VII should be interpreted consistently with the convention. However, to the extent to which the act departs from the convention, the act will prevail. The proposed amendment does not corporate the convention into domestic law. Given that the act already gives effect to the principle of the paramountcy of the best interests of the child, the need for that amendment is not clear.


The exposure draft of the bill proposed a definition of family violence that included any behaviour that was subjectively emotionally, psychologically or econom­ically abusive or threatening. Many stake­holders voiced their concern that any instance of marital discord could be tailored to fit the definition. The definition now proposed defines family violence as 'violent, threatening or other behaviour that coerces or controls a member of the person's family or causes the family member to be fearful.' It differs from the existing definition in that it imposes a subjective test. The definition in the existing act requires a reasonable fear for the family member's wellbeing or safety.


The new definition attempts to qualify its subjectivity by incorporating a list of examples of behaviour, which includes assault, repeated derogatory taunts, damage to property and other unreasonable or criminal behaviour. However, it is an open question whether the list of examples is sufficient to frame and limit the subjectivity of the definition. There is no doubt that any of the behaviours listed would cause a person to be fearful; however, they would also give rise to a reasonable fear for a person's wellbeing or safety under the existing test. The problem with a subjective test is that a person seeking to demonstrate that another person is violent need only state that he or she feared controlling or coercive conduct. The state of mind need not be reasonable. The consequences of a finding of violence can be drastic and permanent. It is not appropriate to divert a court from inquiry as to whether a fear alleged to exist is well founded. Accordingly, the coalition will press for the retention of the objective test in the act.


The AIFS evaluation—that is, the longitudinal study to which I referred a few moments ago—found that the legislative changes introduced as part of the 2006 reforms placed greater emphasis on the need to protect children from harm and from exposure to family violence and child abuse. This meant that the identification of and response to family violence became more systematic under the reforms. However, it found that improvements still needed to be made in identifying and responding to pertinent safety concerns. The proposed amendments broaden the reporting requirements in this regard to interested persons, rather than just parties in child related proceedings. This will include independent children's lawyers, dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors. There is a continuing need to improve responses to child safety concerns and these amendments will therefore be supported by the coalition. Similarly, the record of child welfare agencies in family law proceedings has in many cases been unsatisfactory. Amend­ments to improve their participation and accountability are welcomed by the coalition and will be supported.


Section 60CC(3)(c) of the act currently requires family courts to consider the willingness of one parent towards facilitating the other to have a meaningful relationship with the child. The provision has been criticised as discouraging parents' disclosures of family violence and child abuse for fear of being found to be unfriendly. The bill seeks to repeal this provision and replace it with considerations of the extent to which each of the child's parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in major long-term decisions in relation to the child and spend time with and communicate with the child, and the extent to which each of the parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil the parent's obligation to maintain the child. However, these criteria already exist in section 60CC(4).


The explanatory memorandum cites the AIFS evaluation and the Family Law Council report as the basis for the repeal of the friendly parent provision. This, however, is misleading. The AIFS found that some concerns were expressed that the provision discouraged the reporting of violence but that there was no statistical information to suggest that this was the case. The criticism was in fact voiced in the Chisholm report, uncited in the explanatory memorandum, and was described as gossip by the Family Law Council.


The failure to facilitate a relationship between a child and a separated parent remains a salient issue for the attention of a court and has been found to be an incident of emotional abuse in several reported cases. If the enhanced violence and abuse reporting obligations are supported, there can be no reason for a parent's obstructive behaviour to be excluded from consideration. It should also be noted that this consideration should not arise in the usual course if there are well-founded fears that contact with the other parent exposes the child to violence or abuse. The existing section 60CG makes that clear. Unwillingness on the part of a parent to facilitate a close and continuing relationship with the other parent is undoubtedly a relevant consideration in making parenting orders, which is why the coalition supports the retention of the friendly parent provision.


In the 2009 case of Villey and Prabsik, Mr Justice Watts ordered that a seven-year-old child be removed from his father's primary care to that of his mother. The relevant factual findings were that the mother had suffered a significant mental illness following the parties' separation as a result of the treatment she had suffered at the hands of the father during the relationship. Psychiatric examination of the parties revealed the mother to be fully recovered with an excellent prognosis. She demonstrated insight into her illness as well as its impact on the child. She had rebuilt her relationship with the child in an appropriate manner assisted by professionals. The father, however, was assessed as having a narcissistic personality with overvalued ideas or a delusion that the mother remained ill, unsafe and should have minimal involvement in the child's life. Mr Justice Watts accepted the mother's argument that it would be more likely for the child to have a meaningful relationship with both parents if he lived with his mother rather than his father and that the child would be likely to suffer psychological harm by damage to his relationship with his mother if he continued to reside with his father. This finding would have been more difficult to arrive at had the friendly parent provisions not been in the present act. That case illustrates why the coalition views it as an unwise decision to amend the act by repealing that provision.


The bill proposes to repeal section 117AB, which provides for mandatory cost orders—albeit some such orders might cover only a portion of the costs—where a party knowingly makes a false allegation or statement in the proceedings. The explana­tory memorandum cites the AIFS evaluation and the Family Law Council report's finding that the section operates as a disincentive for disclosing family violence. Again, this is misleading. The Chisholm report alludes to practitioner concern as the basis of its recommendation for repeal, but neither of the major studies cited makes any substantive finding. The Family Law Council report in fact recommends that the provision be clarified with an explanatory note or public education, not that it be repealed.


It should be noted that the test propounded in section 117AB is a stringent one. A mandatory cost order could not arise from evidence which was not proffered in the circumstances or even was given recklessly or without belief. It applies only to knowingly false evidence. If a court was prepared to make such a finding there is no reason why a cost order should not follow, as it would in any other court. Individual members of the judiciary have confirmed that such false accusations are by no means unknown and that sanctions must apply in such cases, yet this bill would remove that sanction.


The courts have provided guidance on the application of the existing provision. In Charles and Charles in 2007, Justice Cronin said:


There can be no room for misunderstanding or doubt; objectively, the person making the statement cannot believe the statement to be true.


So constrained, there is no reason to believe that the existing provision acts as a disincentive to properly made allegations or even erroneous allegations made in good faith of abuse. Cost orders are made much less routinely in the family jurisdiction than in any other. Sadly, it is clear that some parties can and will make false statements if they perceive an advantage in doing so. Because cost orders are not routine, there must be an express disincentive within the act.


The policy objectives of the 2006 reforms were: firstly, to help build strong and healthy relationships and prevent separation; secondly, to encourage greater involvement by both parents in their children's lives after separation and to protect children from violence and abuse; thirdly, to help separated parents agree on what was best for their children, rather than litigating, through the provision of useful information, advice and effective dispute resolution services; and, fourthly, to establish a highly visible entry point that operated as a doorway to other services and helped families to access those other services. As the AIFS evaluation confirmed, the legislative changes introduced as part of the reforms placed greater emphasis on the need to protect children from harm, exposure to family violence and child abuse. This meant the identification of and response to family violence became more systematic under the reforms.


Although the Ruddock reforms have been subject to some criticism, all the indications are that overall they have been hugely successful. Some of those criticisms have arisen from misrepresentation or misinterpretation, whether wilful or otherwise. Sensibly, the government has withdrawn its more radical proposals and at this stage will leave the core shared parenting provisions largely intact. However, it is disturbing that it accepted criticisms of the friendly parent and cost orders provisions at face value and has misleadingly cited positive or neutral findings on those provisions in support of its proposed amendments.


The coalition will support any sensible proposals to reduce the exposure of children to abuse and family violence. Our record indicates that we take these issues very seriously indeed. Some of the amendments proposed by this bill are worthy of support; however, as I have said, it must be recognised that proceedings in the family jurisdiction are some of the most bitterly contested and intractable found in any court process. Judges and practitioners are well aware that child related proceedings may be brought with any number of collateral purposes, themselves a form of child abuse, and mechanisms must exist to deal with them. To the extent to which this bill facilitates that objective it will have the coalition's support but to the extent to which in the areas I have indicated the bill overreaches or erroneously applies the conclusions of the studies of the operation of the Ruddock reforms and in doing so sets back those objectives the coalition will move amendments to delete those provisions from the bill.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-11-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:50):  The Greens support the intent of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill. In 2006, when the Howard Government brought in their so called reforms to the Family Law Act, the Australian Greens expressed our strong concern and opposition to many of the amendments. In fact, we moved many of our own to address those issues. We were particularly concerned about the reforms that affected the best interests of the child, the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility and also the definition of domestic violence.


Specifically, we were concerned with the aspects of the bill that sought to privilege parents' rights over parental responsibilities and children's rights. The notion of equal shared parenting presented in this bill, we believe, reflected a commodification of children that failed to address the best interests of the child based on individual need and circumstances. We were also concerned that the definition of family violence adopted in the bill and then, of course, in the act failed to address the complexity and multidimensionality of this issue and, in so doing, did not provide adequately for family members at risk of family violence, particularly women and children. We were also concerned about the implications of some of the other amendments, specifically the cost orders for false allegations. I outlined these concerns at the time quite extensively, but I would particularly like to remind the chamber of a specific comment I made expressing concern that:


Provisions which require consideration of specific types of parenting arrangements, whether they call for equal or substantially shared time, necessarily direct attention away from a free and open consideration of what arrangements may be in the best interests of the child in any specific case. That is why the Greens believe that a presumption of equal shared responsibility should not be introduced and that each case should be considered on its own merits.


We were concerned at the time that:


… the two-tiered approach of having primary and additional considerations when determining the best interests of the child does not consider the best interests of the child. The Greens support the retention of the current structure of the act. We are concerned that the child's views will be relegated to the list of additional considerations, effectively putting the parent's desire for access ahead of the child's need for security.


I canvassed those issues extensively at the time. We are not surprised that, since then, these so-called reforms have come under harsh criticism from lawyers, advocates and parents for placing the rights of the parents over the best interests of the child. We believe that the reforms have put many children and their families in dangerous situations. That is why we welcome the government's efforts to address these problems and undo some—unfortunately, only some—of the mistakes made by the Howard government. Later, I will go into our concerns that this bill does not go far enough.


We support the prioritisation of the safety of children in family law proceedings and the changes to the definitions of family violence and abuse. Importantly, as we have advocated for over five years, the bill places the best interests of the child as the primary consideration in parenting matters. The definition of abuse has been expanded to include psychological harm, neglect and, notably, exposure to family violence, and a definition of family violence has been placed in the act. The friendly parent and mandatory costs orders provisions, both of which have raised great concern as a major disincentive for reporting family violence, are also being repealed. These changes, and many others contained within the bill, represent very important steps forward in protecting the best interests of children and victims of family violence. The Greens support these changes; however, we believe they do not go far enough.


In our dissenting report of the inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee into the 2006 amendments, the Greens recommended that the definition of family violence not be amended and considered that the proposed tests were not adequate. We further recommended:


Upon completion of the Australian Institute of Family Studies review; the Government should work closely with State and Territory Govern­ments to formulate a comprehensive, effective and uniform definition of family violence.


I am therefore very pleased that the government has revised the flawed approach of the 2006 changes. I commend this bill for recognising that exposure to family violence is a form of abuse. It is an important step in improving the protection of children and prioritising their safety. However, the Australian Greens believe that exposure should be included in the definitions of family violence and of abuse and that the definition of family violence should be clarified to ensure that the parent victim is not held responsible for the exposure. The Australian Law Reform Commission notes:


There has been a considerable amount of research documenting the fact that exposure of children to family violence causes long term emotional, psychological, physical and behavioural issues.


It urged the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill to include exposure in the definition of family violence and abuse, as certain behaviour can constitute both. It must also be made clear that victims of violence must not be held responsible for not being able to remove children from the violence. This recommendation is supported by the Australian Law Reform Commission and Women's Legal Services Australia. We seek assurances from the government that it considers this to be implicit in the changes it is making.


While we are pleased that the government is addressing the best interests of the child, we were concerned that, because some of the bill's other provisions were not being amended, the way in which the changes had been drafted presented inconsistencies about whether the best interests of the child or maintaining a meaningful relationship with parents prevails. This issue was raised in the committee inquiry by a number of witnesses and in a number of submissions. So we are pleased that the government is seeking to amend the bill to ensure that this is clear. The Australian Greens were concerned that the changes do not go far enough and that the changes do not go to the issues of perceived equal shared parenting and equal shared parenting responsibility. A large number of submissions, including those of professors Rhoades and Dewar and of the WLSA, recommended removing the two tiers of factors present in section 60CC and creating a single list, of which child safety would be the first consideration and be given priority. The government amendments address that. We would have liked to see them go a little bit further.


The Australian Greens support the fact the government has recognised that it is absolutely essential that the best interests of the child are given primary consideration. That is why we find it very concerning that the government took a step back from the amendments that, as I understand it, they were originally considering around address­ing equal shared parental responsibility, which the 2006 changes introduced into the act. We believe that the government has not gone far enough in addressing this issue and that having that in place still puts at risk the best interests of the child. 


We have consistently opposed the equal shared parental responsibility requirement since its introduction in 2006. As we argued at the time, it creates a de facto presumption of equal time. As I said at the time: 


While 'equal shared parental responsibility' and 'equal time' are not one and the same, they are inter-related in a way that creates an unacceptable formula in the bill—


I said 'bill', but it is now obviously in the act.


The concept has moved from a 'presumption of equal time' to a presumption of 'equal shared parental responsibility'. 


I acknowledge that. I went on:


However, we are concerned that with a starting point of a child spending 'equal time' or 'substantial and significant time' with each parent this will be a de facto presumption of equal time. 


The operation of a presumption such as this, de facto or otherwise, is likely to lead to an inappropriate and harmful focus in determining what is best for children


Evidence to the committee inquiry clearly pointed out that that is in fact what happens. Starting from a presumption of equal time, regardless of what is said about it not being that, that is in fact what happens.


Subsections 61DA(1) and (2) of the act required the court to presume that it is in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse or family violence. There are numerous problems with this provision. Professor Chisholm, an expert in this area of law, who presented a submission in person at the inquiry, has explained that aspects of the legislation, including ESPR, are 'unnecessarily complex and confusing, making it hard for people to focus on the best interest of children'. While the act does not create a presumption of favouring equal time, it can easily be interpreted that way, as it is the only outcome the act specifically mentions. Professor Chisholm notes:


On this, as on other matters, I believe that the Act is subtly incoherent, sending out inconsistent messages. Not surprisingly, the AIFS Evaluation and other reports reveal that it has caused considerable misunderstanding.


As I pointed out, that was raised a number of times.


According to evidence given at the inquiry, the presumption of equal shared care is meant to be rebutted by family violence, but it is not given due weight, especially at an interim stage where the family violence allegations are unlikely to be considered or tested. These concerns are supported by the AIFS evaluation which found that, of parents who had set up arrangements after the 2006 reforms, those with safety concerns were no less likely than other parents to have shared care-time arrangements. 


It is self-evident that failure to adequately consider family violence can lead to negative outcomes. Data provided as part of the inquiry indicates that the reforms have been successful in producing an increase in shared care arrangements since the legislation came into force. At the same time, however, the research indicates that a significant number of these arrangements are characterised by intense parental conflict and that shared care of children is a key variable affecting poor emotional outcomes for children. Further evidence from the Family Law Council stated that there is no clear evidence on the benefit of shared parenting arrangements. They said:


The recent research that has been released, including reports by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Cashmore and others and McIntosh and others, indicates that shared parenting arrangements of themselves offer no independent benefit to children compared with other types of arrangements where children see their non-resident parent regularly and there are no concerns about safety, violence and conflict.


It became increasingly evident throughout the hearing process that a flexible approach is needed, tailored to the circumstances of each family, not a one-size-fits-all requirement of shared responsibility. Parenting arrangements should always be governed by the best interests of the child and should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Evidence indicates that the presumption of ESPR does not necessarily equal the best interests of the child. We believe that these provisions should be repealed. In fact, I have got amendments to do that, because that would complement the other amendments that the government has made. This is not to say that we do not think shared parenting arrangements work. We are not saying that. We are saying you need to work those out in the best interests of the child, and there is still a part of this act that is inconsistent with the changes that the government wishes to make.


Finally, the Australian Greens draw attention to a recommendation made by the Women's Legal Service Australia when we were holding this inquiry into this bill. Over 50 per cent of parenting matters in the family law courts involve allegations of child abuse and/or family violence. As such, the WLSA recommends implementing a risk manage­ment framework to identify and explore issues of family violence and child abuse at the initial stages of application. Such early risk assessment 'would contribute to ensuring that the matter proceeds through the most appropriate court division and ensuring less adversarial and earlier resolution of issues' as well as assisting 'agencies to ensure that appropriate referrals can be made and safety planning undertaken for women and their children when necessary'. 


The Australian Greens recognise that implementing a risk assessment framework would present a significant and broad reform of the family law system and related government policy. However, we believe that this suggestion is worthy of support and we recommend that it be explored further in any other amendments that are made to the Family Law Act. We will be supporting this law reform. We believe they are significant reforms. As I articulated earlier, we believe that they address significant flaws in the Family Law Act. They do not go far enough. I was concerned, and am still concerned, that the government did not proceed with as full and extensive a set of amendments as we had at first anticipated they would. Having said that, these amendments will make a real difference to the safety of families, and the safety of children in particular, and put the best interests of the child at the centre of things rather than sublimating the interests of the child to the de facto presumption of equal shared care, which actually then prioritises a parent's rights above the best interest of the child. This redresses those flawed amendments. Having said that, we will be supporting this legislation. However, we will be moving amendments specifically to improve the definition of family violence and also, as I said, to remove the shared parental responsibility provisions that are currently in the Family Law Act.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2011-11-22,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (20:07):  I rise this evening to speak on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011, a bill which I believe is long overdue. This bill is important, as it seeks to address serious issues with our family law system. The system as it currently stands does not adequately protect children from family violence.


The evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that two-thirds of separated mothers and over half of separated fathers reported experiencing abuse, either emotional or physical, by the other parent—I want to emphasise that. The institute also found that one in five of the separated parents who were surveyed reported safety concerns associated with ongoing contact with their child's other parent. Disturbingly, the evaluation also found that shared parenting responsibility was the outcome for 75 per cent of children where there were allegations of family violence and child abuse. A report by the Family Law Council highlights data that victims of family violence receive more psychiatric treatment and have an increased incidence of attempted suicide and alcohol abuse than the general population. Violence is also a significant cause of homelessness. So research and various reports by leading social scientists and academics have consistently shown that exposure to family violence and child abuse leads to poor developmental outcomes for children.


It is truly concerning that the family law system in this country is failing our children. Children have a fundamental right to live happy and healthy lives in a safe environment. The family law system must prioritise the safety of children to ensure that their best interests are met. The bill before the Senate this evening goes a long way to addressing the current failings in our family law system. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Family Law Act 1975 to better protect children and families at risk of violence and abuse, while also making technical amendments to provide efficiencies for the courts and litigants.


The exposure draft of this legislation was released for public comment by the Attorney-General's Department as far back as November 2010, so it has been out there for at least a year. In that consultation period 400 submissions were received, with 73 per cent supporting the amendments and 10 per cent bravely offering information about people's own experiences with family law.


As the explanatory memorandum states, the key provisions of the bill aim to prioritise the safety of children in parenting matters; to change the definitions of 'abuse' and 'family violence' to better capture harmful behaviour; to strengthen the obligations of advisers by requiring family consultants, family counsellors, family dispute resolution practitioners and legal practitioners to prioritise the safety of children; to ensure that courts have better access to evidence of abuse and family violence by improving reporting requirements; and to make it easier for state and territory child protection authorities to participate in family law proceedings where appropriate.


I want to make it clear this evening that the government continues to support shared care and a child's right to a meaningful relationship with both parents. What I do not support is for shared care to take precedence over the safety and wellbeing of a child. That is what this bill clarifies: that the safety of the child is of utmost, paramount, import­ance. Importantly, the bill changes the definitions of family violence and abuse to better define harmful behaviour such as emotional, psychological and economic abuse and stalking. The definition clearly states examples of behaviour which may constitute family violence as including intentionally damaging or destroying property, intentionally causing death or injury to an animal, unreasonably denying a family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had, and preventing a family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture. Another important change clarifies that exposing a child to family violence is abuse in relation to the child. As victims know all too well, family violence takes many forms, not only physical, and can affect any member of the family regardless of gender.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which I chair, held a public inquiry into the bill that is before us today. The inquiry was referred to the committee on 25 March this year and we tabled our report on 22 August. We received 275 submissions, which I might say is quite a large number. They came from a range of organisations, government departments and individuals and the majority supported the bill's objectives. In its final report the committee made eight recommendations and I am pleased to say today that the government is adopting six of those eight, I think.


The government has accepted the following recommendations made by the committee. The first recommendation that our committee put forward, which has been adopted, is that we clarify the provision that requires the court to give greater weight to the protection of children from harm when determining what is in the child's best interests. Our third recommendation, which proposes a new paragraph to better define what a court can consider in relation to family violence orders as part of considering the child's best interests, will also be taken into consideration by this government in moving further amendments.


Recommendations 5 and 7 propose to have schedule 1 commence on the day after the end of the period of three months beginning on the day of royal assent. This will provide certainty around the commencement date of the provisions of the bill and the matters to which the amendments apply. This was a matter of some discussion amongst all members of the committee. As we all well know, when new legislation like this comes into place, there are always matters before the court that may or may not get caught up in the new provisions. That required some discussion and careful determination by the committee as to what we should do with regard to the recommendations in our report.


The sixth recommendation does not require amendments to the bill, but the committee proposed that the Attorney-General's Department, along with the family law courts and relevant organisations, institute an education campaign to ensure the public as well as those involved in the family law system are well aware of these new changes and how they may affect them.


We also recommended that the bill be amended to require that the Family Court give consideration to the reasons that one parent might not have facilitated a relationship with the other parent, and to remove reference to the word 'serious' in the new definition of abuse. With regard to the latter, organisations were concerned that only serious abuse is defined as child abuse, whereas it could be argued that any abuse is in fact serious. The Attorney-General's Department responded to those concerns by saying serious was included to avoid over-reporting, that authorities may be hindered from identifying and dealing with serious cases of harm due to excessive reporting. This government has also stated it does not accept those two recommendations as 'they would likely have unintended consequences and decrease protections for children from violence and abuse'.


As Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, I want to thank everyone who participated in the inquiry, brought forward submissions and appeared before us to give evidence, particularly those who attended the hearing.


There have been many reports into the family law system in Australia: the Australian Institute of Family Studies, the Australian Law Reform Commission, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, the Family Law Council and of course the work that has been done by Hon. Professor Richard Chisholm AM, to name a few, who have provided research and analysis into the failings of the current family law system. Their research has a similar conclusion: that more needs to be done to protect and support families within the system who have experienced or are at risk of abuse or violence, particularly children.


The bill before us today takes crucial steps towards ensuring that the safety of children is paramount, particularly during the difficult time of family separation. Also, the bill and the amendments that have been picked up by the government reinforces the valuable work that Senate committees do in this place in terms of looking at legislation and providing a means by which organisations and experts can have input into and propose sensible changes to legislation before us. Govern­ments are willing to listen and pick up those amendments and adopt them.


The bill retains the substance of the shared parenting laws that were introduced in 2006—and I cannot emphasise that enough. The bill continues to promote a child's right to a meaningful relationship with both parents, but with one very important condition: that the best interests of the child must and should always come first. The government has now picked up my committee's recommendations and will seek to amend those during the course of the debate on this legislation. I support the bill and commend my report and this bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (20:19):  No matter what position and what perspective one brings to discussion of family law, one thing we all agree on is that this is an incredibly difficult area of law and of public policy. Family law matters tend to be emotionally charged and too often of course involve intractable disputes, often dysfunctional parental or family dynamics, and tragically, as Senator Crossin and other senators have noted, sometimes even issues of abuse and domestic violence as well. It is often remarked, unfortunately, that lawyers practising in this area experience the highest rate of mental health problems: addiction, depression, marital problems and even suicide. Quite clearly, this is an area of law that takes its toll not only on the people subject to the law but on the very profession itself.


The legislators, the members of parliament and the senators concerned with family law in many ways have both the best and the worst of involvement. It is the best because our professional involvement often amounts to no more than a 20-minute debate contribution followed perhaps by a committee and then by a vote. But the worst because the laws we thus enact can make the difference between the hell or the mere purgatory for tens of thousands, young and old, brought before the family law system. The role of family law should ideally be to facilitate the smoothest resolution of the matters in dispute in what is, I think all senators would agree, typically an emotionally charged atmosphere, balancing competing interests in a way that is fair, just and equitable. In the end, the coalition is forced to conclude that this bill will take us further away from achieving this primary objective.


It is impossible to understand this bill without first understanding the context of the 2006 family law reforms. These legislative reforms followed literally years and years and years of consultations, which culminated in the landmark report Every picture tells a story by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in December 2003. That inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation undertook, I think it is fair to say, exhaustive public hearings. Most notably, the resulting report was—I should remind the Senate of this—bipartisan and the result was also unanimous. Over the next three years the report of the House of Representatives committee gave impetus to reforms that at their heart had the concept of shared parental responsibility. This involved recognition and protection of the right of the child to a mother and a father, as well as grandparents, in their lives. It also involved recognition that despite separation of parents shared care was an important ideal to strive for, particularly for children.


The 2006 reforms recognised that shared care was not always possible and, indeed, it was not always appropriate or responsible. As such it was not, and was never, the only consideration to be weighed in family law disputes. An extensive range of factors the courts must have regard to is set out in section 60CC of the act.


The bill before the Senate this evening at its core is a rollback of the 2006 shared care reforms. To the mind of the coalition, it reflects a lack of understanding as to how to truly put children and their best interests at the centre of family law proceedings. It shows no genuine understanding of how that system works in practice and of the many difficulties it produces. I believe that in the legislative struggle to make family law dispute resolution less like hell and more like purgatory, or perhaps hell with hope as it is often described, this bill tips the scales again back towards hell.


I worry that in time it will stand as yet another example of Labor's inability to implement anything competently. I am no expert on family law and I do not claim to be. But I am more than aware of heartbreaking stories of many men and many women and how their lives have been impacted and sometimes devastated when they come into contact with family law matters or separation from their children. I know all my coalition colleagues would agree that while we support the ostensible aim of this bill we cannot support the bill as it is currently drafted.


The coalition—and I share this with Senator Crossin and remarks made by other senators—believes strongly in protecting both children and adults from violence and abuse. The government is right to point that out. There is absolutely no excuse for domestic violence or sexual abuse of any kind against women, or children, or in some instances, against men. Of course, it is absolutely crucial that children are kept safe from abuse of all kinds: physical, emotional, sexual and so on. That is true.


But also it is critical that children are kept safe from the effects of false allegations of sexual abuse by one parent against another in family law proceedings. Let the Senate not forget that. Children need to be protected against both of these evils. Both can have devastating effects on families but, most importantly, long-term detrimental and profound effects on the kids involved, both socially and emotionally. The coalition's serious reservations and, indeed, our misgivings, about the key defects in this bill are reflected in the additional comments of coalition senators in the Senate committee's report on this bill, and I note Senator Humphries being here this evening.


Overall, the fundamental problem with this bill lies in the unintended, the unfair and potentially even the perverse consequences that will arise from the bill's application and from its interpretation. These consequences, to the mind of the coalition, threaten to undo any good otherwise achieved by the bill. Let me touch on a few of the failings of this bill as they are reflected in the opposition's amendments, to be moved later this evening in committee.


Firstly, the absurdly broadened definition of family violence diminishes and trivialises the very serious issue of violence which a small minority of men and some women perpetrate. The coalition is not opposed to a sensible broadening of the legislative definition of family violence, but the proposed new definition embraces such a breadth of behaviour as to make the concept of violence as commonly understood in the community almost meaningless. Combined with the removal of any objective criteria, thereby imposing an entirely subjective test of what constitutes family violence, this amendment can only lead to much heartache and much litigation.


Secondly, the repeal of the so-called 'friendly parent' provision makes little sense. That is, the removal of the current positive obligation upon separating parents to facilitate a child's relationship with the other parent, to have a positive duty to support that ongoing relationship. It is claimed this current provision inhibits women from disclosing violence, but where is the evidence of this other than the purely anecdotal? It is a very serious claim that the government has not really substantiated to underpin this bill. 


Thirdly, by repealing section 117AB, the bill also deletes the only penalty that applies to those who make—I want to emphasise this—deliberately false allegations of child abuse or family violence in proceedings. After the amended bill takes effect, what will be the sanction for someone who deliberately makes false allegations of child abuse? There will be none. Making an allegation that turns out to be unsubstantiated is one thing, as Senator Humphries knows. This is not simply an allegation that cannot be proven but one that is known to be false at the time it is made. What is the sanction? 




Senator Humphries:
  Zero.




Senator MASON:
  Senator Humphries is right. There is not one. Again, for this reason, the coalition does not support the bill. The coalition argues that it will be a great tragedy if this bill starts a race to the bottom to see who can allege family violence first. Husband or wife: who alleges it first? Will be it be a race to the police to allege family violence first? That really worries the opposition. It beggars belief that the government simply closes its eyes to this likelihood. Let us see what happens in the future. I hope I am wrong, but I am not sure I am. If an allegation does not have to be substantiated, if it is purely subjective and there are no penalties for making knowingly false allegations, do we really believe that some family lawyers and litigants will not use this procedurally to gain leverage and exert pressure upon the other party? Do we really believe that they will not do that? I wish I was wrong about human nature. 


If there is no longer a positive obligation to encourage and support a child to have a meaningful relationship with a former partner who is that child's parent, do we really believe that this will help children better cope at this most difficult time in their lives? Do we really believe that? If there is no longer a legal obligation, do we really believe that many people will not put their personal animosities, their conveniences and their comforts ahead of the objective best interests of their children? Just how much do we have to suspend our beliefs in order to pass this bill? 


Just as the government does not believe that this bill will have negative consequences, it does not believe it will require any additional resourcing for the Family Court or that it will create any increased workload. In this bill the government demonstrates a lack of understanding of both human nature and the nature of the family law system. It is a system already stretched to the absolute limit—delays are endemic and practitioners already describe the Family Court as the court of fairytale. That is without adding the burden of this bill's provision to the mix. 


Regrettably, the likely consequences of this bill will be a massive surge in the number of apprehended violence orders and temporary protection orders across Australia. I hope I am wrong, but I am just not sure I am going to be. Already discredited and all too often misused as tactical devices, DVOs will come into further disrepute and indeed further disdain. This is neither in the best interests of family law courts nor the children affected, let alone the women and children who genuinely need the protection of these court orders for their very safety. 


This bill will likely lead to more false allegations being made in family law proceedings. More children will be deprived of time and contact with one of their parents. Enormous pressure will be put on litigants to settle against the threat of unfounded allegations that do not have to be substantiated by the other party, and that is the key. Given that around 94 per cent of all family law cases are resolved before formally going to trial, only six per cent of family law cases go to final judgment. There is plenty of bargaining being done in the shadow of the law, as the old expression goes. 


While ostensibly intending to further protect those affected by violence and abuse with the shield of the law, the government has instead produced a club that parties to a dispute can use to freely trash each other. It is a club that the opposition is very concerned will be much used and indeed abused. The winners may well be the unscrupulous. The losers will be the real victims—the kids who will be unfairly denied contact with both parents and indeed our justice system. 


This is a difficult bill and I concede this is a very difficult area of law and public policy. I concede further that I am not an expert in this area, but I do know as a member of parliament that it is highly contentious, very emotional and very difficult. The coalition does not believe that this bill deserves the Senate's support. It does not believe the case for the amendments in schedule 1 of the bill has been made by the government.


Regrettably, I suspect the probably guillotining here tonight of this bill that is critical potentially for hundreds of thousands of people in this country. This is major legislation with a major impact. The bill will not receive the scrutiny it deserves, particularly in committee tonight, which is wrong, given that it will have such an enormous effect on the emotional and family structure in this country. This is a very important piece of legislation and will affect families throughout the nation. It will change the family dynamic. Indeed, it will change the prospects of custody for both men and women in our country. This is major legislation with major consequences.


In conclusion, I reiterate the coalition's deep concern about the drafting of this bill, the lack of evidence from the government to support these changes and the bill's dire implications for families already facing the heartache and difficulties of separation. It is such a pity we will not have further time, particularly in committee, to talk about the evidence that is available and ask the hard questions of the minister as to how the bill will operate. We are not going to have that time. It is a great pity and, given how important this bill is, it is ridiculous.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-11-22,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (20:38):  I will limit my remarks to no more than five or so minutes because I am grateful to my colleagues who have slotted me in tonight. I want to reflect on something that Senator Madigan told me privately, with his permission. I want to share his disgust at the lack of appropriate process in dealing with such an important piece of legislation.


What is more, there are four other bills tonight that there will be no opportunity to speak on because at 9.30 effectively the guillotine will be applied. We will not have an opportunity to discuss the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011, which deals with issues of systemic corruption; we will not have an opportunity to discuss the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011, again an important piece of legislation; we will not have an opportunity to discuss the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Participants in British Nuclear Tests) Bill 2011; nor will we have an opportunity to discuss the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oils in the Antarctic Area) Bill 2011. That is clearly unsatisfactory. This is meant to be the house of review. This is the place where we are supposed to scrutinise legislation. What is happening in this place tonight, and indeed what occurred last night, is completely unsatisfactory.


In the remaining two or so minutes I will reflect on this particular piece of legislation, the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. There is no question that the safety of children is absolutely fundamental and paramount in our family law system and that we are dealing with vexed and difficult issues. We are dealing with deep sadness, instances of violence and abuse and the fundamental issue of protecting children. I have reservations about the bill in its current form—reservations as to whether there will be a number of unintended consequences and as to whether we will end up taking a step backward from having a fair and just family law system, a system that will put the protection of children first and foremost.


I am concerned that the bill does, as Senator Brandis indicated, overreach and, by doing so, is fundamentally flawed. I think there are issues in relation to the proposed new definition of family violence—that the existing definition is being taken away from us and that issues of reasonableness and a test at common law will be taken away from us with this bill; not to have a more measurable test is deeply flawed. I am concerned that removing issues of reasonableness is dangerous. I am concerned, in relation to the friendly parent provisions that this bill effectively seeks to remove, that there will be a number of adverse consequences. I am concerned that the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee makes mention that some submitters argued that repealing the friendly parent provisions could reward those parents who actively prevent non-resident parents from having contact with their children. And I am concerned at remarks made by the Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Hon. Diana Bryant, who argued that many cases close to completion could be prolonged, putting children at extra risk by log jamming the courts and increasing family stress, unless there are significant extra resources for the Family Court.


But there is one clause that I find particularly objectionable, a clause that I think is almost Orwellian in its scope—that is, the clause that proposes to repeal section 117AB, which provides for mandatory costs orders in the event that false statements have been made. You need to prove that. There is a high threshold.


Mandatory costs orders in such circumstances send a strong message to family law litigants that making false allegations is not tolerated. Unfortunately, false allegations are made in this jurisdiction by all sides. There are a number of cases that have been brought to my attention. I will not mention the names of the parties but, for instance, there was a case where the mother was found to have fabricated allegations of abuse against the father, another where a father was found to have knowingly made false statements about the mother's parenting capacity, another where the mother was found to have knowingly made false statements that a child sustained an injury while in his father's care. Although mandatory costs orders are not often applied, removing the ability for the courts to impose such orders will remove the incentive for people not to make false accusations. That is a fundamental concern I have in relation to this bill.


I also have a concern about the process here. Australians deserve better. They deserve such an important piece of legislation to be debated properly, to be dealt with properly in the committee stages and to be subject to appropriate scrutiny—for questions to be asked and substantially answered by the government. We will not get that opportunity tonight.


I cannot support the bill in its current form. There will be a number of amendments moved by the coalition. I indicate that I will support those amendments because I think they will make the bill tenable. But in the absence of those amendments being passed, I cannot in good conscience support this bill.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2011-11-22,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (20:44):  I rise to speak in relation to the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. My Greens colleague Senator Rachel Siewert has already spoken on this bill, and I support her comments and the amendments she has proposed.


My comments on the bill, and the amendments proposed by the Greens, are informed by my experience in this area, which I think is particularly relevant. In the 1980s, I worked as a solicitor and some of my clients were women experiencing what was called domestic violence in those days but is now called family violence. More recently, I worked as a family dispute resolution practitioner or mediator with Relationships Australia until 2010. I will come back to those experiences in a minute. The government's stated purpose of the bill is to:


… amend the Family Law Act 1975 … to provide better protection for children and families at risk of violence and abuse.


Schedule 1 of the bill primarily amends part VII, dealing with children, of the Family Law Act 1975 to enable the courts and the family law system to respond more effectively to parenting cases involving violence or allegations of violence. Schedule 2 contains more technical and procedural amendments to the Family Law Act and Bankruptcy Act 1966. This proposed legislation has been prompted by research findings from credible Australian institutions and academics, including the Australian Institute of Family Studies in their Evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms, Professor Richard Chisholm in his Family courts violence review and the Family Law Council in its Improving responses to family violence in the family law system: an advice on the intersection of family violence and family law issues. In addition, the October 2010 report from the Australian Law Reform Commission and the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, Family violence—a national legal response, has informed the discussion about the current state of the law. 


Much of this research has been focused on assessing the consequences of the 2006 amendments to the Family Law Act, of which we have heard something tonight, to promote the equal sharing of time by parents after separation by creating a presumption of equal shared parental responsibility. Over time, through anecdotal evidence and then as a result of research findings, it has become clear that there are serious concerns about the effects of the 2006 changes to the law. 


During my time as a mediator, I worked with many separating couples. I was drawn to this work because it offers an alternative to the conflictual and adversarial process that sadly often accompanies family break-ups. By helping parents to focus on the most important aspect of their life together—their kids—they can be assisted to move beyond their hurt and discord to make strong and powerful decisions which benefit their children and, as a consequence, themselves. I have a strong belief in the value to children of having strong, loving relationships with both parents where those relationships are respectful, responsible and safe. My brother was the primary caregiver for his three daughters, nurturing them through their teenage years and into their secure, happy, adult years. I have the utmost admiration for the safe, loving environment in which he raised his daughters and the great job that most parents—fathers and mothers—do in raising their children. But the fundamental requirement for safety and protection of children from harm must not be sacrificed for some notion of a parent's unassailable right to have a relationship with a child if the risks associated with that relationship are unacceptably high. 


Unfortunately, in the course of my mediation work, it became increasingly apparent to me that what may have been well-intentioned amendments to encourage parents to share the parenting of their children after separation have had some unintended and extremely harmful consequences. It is some of those consequences which this legislation is aimed at addressing. It became obvious that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility for children had become a de facto presumption of equal time and was contributing to a rigid and demanding expectation on the part of parents which undermined the possibility of reaching a flexible agreement that responded to the unique needs of a particular child and family. Parents began to come to the mediation sessions with a fixed requirement based on the misconception that equal and shared parental responsibility meant equal parental time. Their rights to time with their child were uppermost in their mind—not the quality of the time or the needs of the child. They were fixated on their rights as against the rights of the other parent and the interests of the child were lost. 


Although I would try to encourage parents to focus on their child as an individual with particular and unique needs which needed to be factored into the arrangements they were making, there was often nothing I could do to shake the attitude. Quite often my attempts to explain the difference between shared responsibility and shared time would elicit incredulity or accusations that I was biased against one parent or the other. In one particular case, I was abused by an angry parent who refused to accept that it may not be in the best interests of his four-month-old daughter, who was still breastfeeding, to spend overnights away from her mother at that stage. He accused me of discriminating against him because he was not a woman—absolutely unwilling to consider the nutritional or emotional needs of his young child at that time because he was so fixated on his right to shared responsibility as a parent. 


Because some parents were demanding the right to 50 per cent of a child's time, it was difficult to get them to consider such things as the age of the child, the child's needs and circumstances, the practicality of arrangements which might mean travelling long distances to effect the changeover or the overall best interests of the child. I witnessed this across the whole spectrum of ages, from very young children right through to teenagers of 15 or 16 who had social lives and commitments of their own and were not very keen to be divided down the middle in order to meet their parents' sense of entitlement. 


Due to the pervasive view that equal shared parental responsibility means equal time, the default position for negotiating became a fifty-fifty shared care arrangement. Because of this, parents became less willing to negotiate any alternative that might take into account the child's needs based on their schooling, their interests or their particular personality. Where a child is quite robust, moving from one home to another on a regular basis—weekly, every three or four days or, in some notable cases, every two days—may not be difficult for them. But another child might have a personality which is not suited to constant change. A perceptive parent would see that their child would benefit from having a single identifiable home base while spending quality time with the other parent at that parent's home. But a parent fixated on strictly equal parenting time would be unable to recognise that need. I am strongly of the view—which is supported by evidence before the Senate inquiry—that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in section 61DA of the Family Law Act has detrimental outcomes for children. It skews the consideration of the court as to what the best interests of the child are and contributes to a prevailing misconception that parents are entitled to equal parenting time with their children irrespective of the child or the circumstances. The presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not conducive to the best interests of a child and should be repealed in accordance with the Greens amendments to be introduced by Senator Siewert.


Let me turn now to the vexed issue of family violence, which is an aspect of life for many Australian children and adults—and this bill reflects that reality. Ensuring their safety, as much as possible, must be a priority. In its study, the Australian Institute of Family Studies concluded that, while the 2006 reforms had a positive impact in some areas, there was clear evidence that the family law system as a whole had a way to go in achieving an effective response to families presenting with family violence and child abuse. Alarmingly, it noted that, while children in shared care represent a minority overall, and while the majority of families with shared care appear to be doing well, there is evidence that these arrangements are sometimes made even in circumstances where parents have safety concerns, with adverse consequences for the wellbeing of children. Alarmingly, the evaluation found that families where violence had occurred were no less likely to have shared care-time arrangements than those where violence had not occurred. Similarly, families where safety concerns were reported were no less likely to have shared care-time arrangements than families without safety concerns.


Evidence before the inquiry, including studies from the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Professor Richard Chisholm and the Family Law Council, indicates that provisions in the Family Law Act are a disincentive to parents to raise safety concerns for fear of falling foul of the court. These include the so-called 'friendly parent' provisions and the ability of the court to order costs for false allegations against another parent.


It is not hard to understand why this would occur, as in each case the stakes are high for a parent who is not believed. In relation to the 'friendly parent' provisions, a court is required to take into account the willingness and extent to which one parent has facilitated the child having a relationship with the other parent when determining the best interests of the child and, ultimately, orders dealing with parenting arrangements and parental responsibility. A finding that a parent has not facilitated the relationship with the other parent may result—and has resulted—in a court deciding to grant more, or exclusive, time with the other parent even though there may be good reasons to explain the failure to facilitate, such as a fear of violence, abuse or risk to the child. Professor Chisholm's review concluded:


On the material available, it seems likely that the friendly parent provision, s 60CC(3)(c), while it might have had a beneficial effect in many situations, has had the undesirable consequence in some cases of discouraging some parents affected by violence from disclosing that violence to the family court.


In my mediation work I witnessed coercive, threatening and sometimes violent relation­ships where there was pressure by one parent on the other to agree to fifty-fifty shared care because it was seen as a default position, a normative arrangement, irrespective of the effect on the child. I also saw parents who were subject to violence or intimidation or were concerned about the treatment of their children by the other parent but who were reluctant to discuss these things or to withstand the pressures of the other parent to reach agreements about parenting that they felt were not in the best interests of their children. This was because they were fearful of being labelled an 'unfriendly' parent, due to the serious consequences such a label would attract. So they made a choice, understandable in the circumstances, to stay silent or risk losing contact with their child.


This bill will amend the 'friendly parent' provision by requiring a court to consider why a parent may not have been willing or able to facilitate the child's relationship with the other parent, and those reasons may well encompass violence or abuse. If the 'friendly parent' provision is to remain a factor to be taken into account by a court, and this bill does not repeal the provision altogether, it is imperative that the court be required to consider the context for a parent's failure to facilitate the child's relationship with the other parent. This will provide a fuller picture of the situation for the court and encourage a parent to disclose violence or abuse.


I also support the bill's removal of the mandatory penalty of $10,000 to be imposed by the court for false allegations of family violence or abuse. The evidence before the inquiry was that it had been little used but still caused fear among those who had experienced violence or abuse but were terrified that they would not be able to prove it, thus silencing them. Many of the submissions to the inquiry supported the repeal of the relevant section because it had the effect of discouraging the disclosure of violence and abuse. That is not good for the person who has been subject to the violence and it is not good for the children who are part of that relationship.


In conclusion, our family law system must make the safety of children a priority. This must be the predominant determinant of their best interests. There is a compelling case for reform of the existing situation. This bill has been the subject of a thorough inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. Submissions were received from a diverse range of individuals and organisations. Of these, 73 per cent were in favour of the proposed amendments to the Family Law Act contained in the bill. More recent research from the Benevolent Society based on a survey of 1,071 respondents revealed that 93 per cent of people agreed that safety and security are the most important issues for a child when a relationship between parents breaks down, and between 86 and 93 per cent of the respondents agreed that a child's right to safety is more important than a parent's right to equal time.


I commend the government for the reforms that are included in this bill. It has heeded the calls of many for changes to a system that was clearly not adequately protecting some children and adults from family violence and abuse. However, as I have discussed, I believe that these measures have not gone far enough in responding to the evidence of what is needed to protect children and adults from family violence. For this reason, I urge the Senate to support the further amendments that will be moved by the Australian Greens.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-11-22,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (20:59): I also want to say a few words in support of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The coalition, as has been indicated by Senator Brandis, supports the strengthening of the provisions relating to family violence and child abuse because the coalition believes that nothing is more important than the welfare of children in the event of marital breakdown. The fact that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee heard submissions from some 200 interest groups on this issue is testament to the broad community concern the matter has generated.


In 2006 the Howard government recognised some of the shortcomings of the Family Law Act following the handing down of the House of Representatives committee report entitled Every picture tells a story. Our government enacted appropriate amendments. The bill before the Senate takes those improvements a step further. I commend the bill because it provides greater protection for the most vulnerable members of our society—our children—during and after a relationship breakdown. We should all be disturbed at the statistics showing an alarming prevalence of abuse experienced by separated mothers and fathers. A detailed study by the Australian Institute of Family Studies revealed that two-thirds of separated mothers and over half of separated fathers reported experiencing physical or emotional abuse from the other parent. One in five parents expressed safety concerns associated with contact with the other parent.


Having said that, I want to raise a potentially disturbing matter relating to the valuable work of the Family Court based in Townsville. As senators will know, my office is based in Townsville and I live in that region, and I am interested in how the Family Court does its work in that area. There has been a Family Court judge based in Townsville since 1982, servicing not just Townsville but the whole of the vast North Queensland region. The incumbent Family Court judge, the Hon. Justice Monteith, is due to retire at the end of November, but there is no certainty that he will be replaced. This is despite assurances given prior to the 2007 federal election by the then shadow Attorney-General Senator Joe Ludwig that the position would be retained.


In addition to Senator Ludwig's 2007 commitment the Chief Justice of the Family Court, the Hon. Diana Bryant, publicly assured the Townsville legal profession in early 2008 that the Townsville based position of a Family Court judge would be maintained. Despite Senator Ludwig's promise and Justice Bryant's assurance the Gillard government has so far declined to name a successor, prompting very great and very real concern in legal circles in the north and raising serious questions about the truthfulness of the assurances given by this government. Could this be another lie in the making? We all know that Prime Minister Gillard went to the last election promising not to introduce a carbon tax, but what did she do as soon as she was elected? She broke her solemn word to the Australian people and introduced her toxic carbon tax, under duress from Senator Brown and the Greens, in a desperate bid to cling to power.


There can be no question about the need to continue the work of the Family Court in North Queensland. Indeed, there is a case, I submit, for providing even more resources than the court currently has at its disposal. As most senators would know, Townsville and the North Queensland region have grown exponentially since 1982 when the first Family Court judge was appointed. This growth has been fuelled by major develop­ments in the defence, mining, minerals processing and primary industry sectors. Over the next few months 750 soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment and their families will complete their relocation to Townsville, boosting the regional economy by an estimated $60 million a year. New mines are being opened up and many existing mines are being expanded to keep pace with the international demand for our mineral resources. This is despite the minerals resource tax imposed by the Labor government—which will only last as long as the Labor government does, and hopefully that will be a very short time. International mining companies, understanding that this government is on a very limited tenure, are still looking at the north of Australia for further investment in minerals.


Over 40 per cent of Australia's export earnings, I am always proud to say, are now generated in Northern Australia, despite the fact that only five per cent of Australia's population lives in what we class as Northern Australia. But this incredible growth brings with it an increase in social problems and marital breakdown, and this is exacerbated in the north by issues such as defence related psychological factors, fly-in fly-out working arrangements and deprived living conditions in Indigenous communities which exist mainly in northern and remote Australia. These factors have combined to significantly increase the case load for the Townsville based Family Court, which covers the vast area from as far south as Rockhampton and Mackay, north to Cairns and west to Mount Isa and encompasses Cape York and the Torres Strait Islands. Even the Labor Party, which has shown little interest in rural areas such as North Queensland, should be able to recognise the importance of supporting the work of the Family Court in this region by announcing a replacement for the retiring Judge Monteith as a matter of urgent priority. I fear that with a Canberra based government consisting of the Labor Party, who have little interest in Northern Australia and little interest in regional Australia, this is another one of their out of sight, out of mind approaches.


The President of the Townsville District Law Association, Diane Ruhl, wrote to the Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert McClelland, on 8 November this year formally requesting that he honour Senator Ludwig's election promise to continue the practice of basing a Family Court judge in Townsville by naming Justice Monteith's successor. I understand that to date there has been no response to the law association's request. The Labor government and the Labor Party showed no hesitation when Senator Ludwig shut down the northern live cattle export industry to appease the Greens earlier this year, with disastrous consequences for Northern Australia. I now call upon Senator Ludwig to urge the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, to honour the election promise that Senator Ludwig made in 2007 and thereby put to rest any suggestion that Justice Monteith will not be replaced and that the valuable work of the Family Court in North Queensland can continue.


Unfortunately Senator Ludwig, who represents the Attorney-General in this chamber, is not here tonight to hear this debate. I call on Senator Conroy, who is the minister at the table, to seriously listen to the issues of the Family Court in Townsville. Senator Conroy, could you please pass this on to your colleague Senator Ludwig, who was the Attorney-General when he came to Townsville prior to the 2010 election and promised the Townsville people that there would be a new appointment of a Family Court judge in Townsville. Many of us in Australia have got to the stage where we assume promises by Prime Ministers from the Labor Party and ministers from the Labor Party will never be honoured. Who can blame Australians for being cautious of promises made by Labor Party ministers when their own leader, Ms Gillard, promised prior to the last election there would be no carbon tax. We are now in the throes of implementing a carbon tax for Australia in spite of the Prime Minister's assurance and solemn promise that it would not happen. I leave that to one side.


It is important that the north of Queensland have a resident Family Court judge. Justice Monteith, I repeat, is retiring at the end of this month. Why the government has not announced a successor to Justice Monteith is of great concern not just to the legal profession but to all people in North Queensland. I repeat again that it is a fast-growing area of Australia. It has more than sufficient work in the Family Court to be assured of a Family Court judge permanently based in Townsville. I ask the minister at the table, who I assume is dealing with this legislation in the Senate chamber: why has the Gillard government not yet announced a successor to Justice Monteith just a few days before his retirement? I would ask you, Senator Conroy, to speak to Senator Ludwig, who as Attorney-General made this solemn commitment to the Townsville legal community and indeed to the wider Townsville and North Queensland community that there would be a northern based Family Court judge. I simply repeat: if there is to be another northern based Townsville judge, why has it not been announced just 10 days before the retirement of the incumbent northern Family Court judge?


I fear that my pleas are falling on deaf ears. For those who might be interested in this debate and are listening to the broadcast, there are two Labor Party people in the chamber tonight for this very important debate. The minister is reading his laptop and seems to be taking no interest. Perhaps I malign him. I would ask you, Senator Conroy, to take this message to your colleague in this chamber Senator Ludwig, and to Mr McClelland, and to give us some assurance in the next few days of who the successor to retiring Judge Monteith might be. Whilst I never expect much from the Labor government at the present time, I would hope that your advisers, Minister, will take these pleas on notice and perhaps come back to me within 24 hours and indicate just who the successor to the northern Family Court judge might be. With that plea, which I fear has fallen on deaf ears in this chamber, I indicate my support for the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and my support for the submissions made by Senator Brandis on behalf of the coalition.

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (21:14):  I rise to support the coalition's position on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. I do want to focus in particular on the amendments proposed in item 17 of this bill to section 60CC(2)(a). Before I do that, however, I want to make it clear that I do not profess to be any sort of expert in family law. I have had some experiences in court, some more recent than others, but I have certainly not been near and hope to never go near the Family Court or the Federal Magistrates Court exercising the family law jurisdiction. That said, I can read legislation, statutes and bills. On that basis, I have some questions, some of which I was fortunate enough to be able to ask during a Senate inquiry into this bill but which I was unfortunate, I think, not to have had answered through questions on notice during that inquiry. I think this Senate is even more unfortunate in that I and my colleagues and the likes of Senator Xenophon and Senator Madigan have not been allowed the proper time and the proper process to ask about the very important issues that underlie not only this bill but family law writ large as implemented in this country.


Item 17, as I understand it—and I refer to the explanatory memorandum—says that the new subsection 60CC(2A) requires the court:


… when determining what is in a child’s best interests, to give greater weight to the primary consideration that protects the child from harm in cases if there is inconsistency in applying the considerations.


The explanatory memorandum goes on to say that the new provision will make it clear that:


… the two primary considerations are: (a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents; and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.


Obviously those are very important concerns. The explanatory memorandum then goes on to say:


Where child safety is a concern, this new provision will provide the courts with clear legislative guidance that protecting the child from harm is the priority consideration.


That is not the evidence that was given to the Senate committee. That was not the evidence that was reported in the Senate committee's report as a result of the inquiry—clear legislative guidance.


Professor Richard Chisholm told the committee that the intended provision was anything but clear. Whilst he did say that this provision would improve the law, he recommended an amendment to it. As of this moment, we do not know if the government have taken it up or not and we will not have the opportunity to debate it because of the time we do not have to speak on or deal with the bill. But Professor Chisholm, before saying, 'Well, okay, this provision will make it better than it is at the moment,' said that this provision was yet another technical complication. That is hardly clear, despite the government's explanatory memorandum. He went on to say that, with the new subsection, the decision maker will have to decide if there is an inconsistency between the two provisions. He went on to say that, if there is, greater weight must be given to the second provision—the safety of the child. But how much greater? He argues that the new provision is certain to increase the amount of complication and technicality relating to determining what is best for children. That is hardly clear legislative guidance.


Nor, despite clear legislative guidance being claimed by the explanatory memorandum, is it guidance according to the Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland. It told the inquiry that, in its view, rather than providing guidance the proposed amendment contained in the bill mandates a court to give greater weight to the second of the primary considerations—that is, the safety of the child—in the event of there being a conflict between that and the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. The Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland told the inquiry in its submission:


Such a provision removes the Court’s licence to assess in each individual case the degree of risk, its probability or in the case of family violence its context in terms of frequency, intensity and recency in the determination of the weight to be given to such risk or harm.


It urges caution in terms of the legislation becoming:


… too specific, descriptive, prescriptive or presumptive with respect to the treatment of risk.


As far as we can tell, the government has done nothing about that concern expressed by the Family Law Practitioners Association of Queensland. In fact, it has flown in the face of it by maintaining the very provision that that association criticised and claiming in its recent supplementary explanatory memorandum that this provision provides clear legislative guidance. Well, poppycock!


As for the extent to which a child may be at risk of violence, there is nothing in the bill to make clear what is to be required by a court in terms of the second limb to which priority is now to be given—that is, the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm or being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence. How is it not going to be as simple as one party to the earlier relationship alleging a concern about violence? As Family Voice Australia said to the committee:


The phrase 'any inconsistency' virtually invites the court to ignore completely the requirement to consider 'the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents' once it decides to entertain an allegation of any kind about abuse or exposure to family violence.


So there is nothing clear about this provision at all. It is a mandate, not guidance. It is an invitation for one party to a former relationship to make an allegation. Worse than that, when we pressed the government and officers of the Attorney-General's Department to provide the government's evidence of the need for this position and to demonstrate its case that this provision will fix whatever it says is the problem, all the department and the government could provide was the report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, which was foreshadowed by the Howard government in implementing the earlier reforms in 2006—actually, the reforms in 2006, because this bill is no reform; reform in my book is usually good. The department, in answer to its question on notice, citing only the Institute of Family Studies report as evidence that the existing law needed change, cited findings that two-thirds of mothers and half of fathers separated since 2006 reported that their child's other parent had emotionally abused them. I thought it was the safety of the child that was paramount, not what happened to mum or dad.


The second so-called bit of evidence from the same report was that around one in four mothers and one in six fathers reported that the other parent had hurt them physically prior to separation. I make the same point: that is about the mums and dads; it is not the kids. The only one that gets close to the kids is this one: around one in five parents reported safety concerns associated with ongoing contact with a child's other parent. What does that mean? What is that by way of evidence? It is not hard to imagine in marriage breakups that one parent might want to allege concerns about safety in proximity of children from the former partner whom they liked a lot and with whom they are now largely disaffected.


Turning to my final point, which consolidates my concerns. I asked the department during the hearing: 


What evidence do you have that item 17 of the bill will address that evidence and fix, for example, the concern that a fifth of parents have ongoing concerns about their child's safety?


Mrs Pirani from the department said:


I guess we do not know until the changes are made.


That is it. I guess the government does not know until the changes are made. My colleague Senator Mason talked about this bill really taking family law from being hell, or maybe it was the 2006 reforms that took it to being hell with hope. I reckon mums and dads will just want to hope like hell, because that is about all they are going to have, in my humble opinion, if this bill becomes law.

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (21:25):  I am very pleased to contribute to this debate on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011, such as my opportunity will be, given that the debate is to be truncated by the guillotine. Like Senator Fisher, I was a participant in the inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee into this legislation. I think that the legislation represents a very significant piece of change to the law. Like Senator Fisher I hesitate to call it reform, although I have to acknowledge that some parts of the legislation are valuable, do improve the state of the law and do make it easy to use for those people who require access to the Family Court. I echo the concerns of colleagues on this side of the chamber in this debate: significant changes in the law will be enacted by the Senate tonight in a shortened debate. We will not have time to consider amendments put forward by the Greens and by the coalition. We will not have key opportunities to consider issues in the legislation which are critical and which have been extensively debated in the public arena and in specialist circles and which were subject to intense debate before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee or to consider issues around which there is a rich vein that the Senate ought to be explore. We will not deal with them tonight except by a simple vote on the floor of the Senate.


In her contribution, Senator Wright advocated for her amendments. Maybe she has put forward, on behalf of the Greens, some wonderful amendments to this legislation. I am afraid we will not get the chance to find out, because Senator Wright and her colleagues in the Greens have joined with the Labor Party to ensure that there will not be a committee stage on this bill. We will not have a chance to debate the amendments that the Greens are putting forward, wonderful though they might be.


I ask senators to consider what we are dealing with tonight. These amendments, in effect, go to the framework of family law in this country. The Family Law Act 1975 was a seismic change in the landscape with respect to personal relationships in this country. It was very significant legislation. We can all have different views about this, but it was undoubtedly an iconic piece of law reform. Tonight, we are dealing with that legacy. We are dealing with that great change in the law and the consequences and the developments that we have dealt with in the succeeding 35 or so years. But we are dealing with it tonight in an entirely unsatisfactory way. We are going to rush this through the Senate. We have important amendments to consider, but we are going to rush this through the Senate because of the deal that has been done between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens.


I wonder what the ghosts of people like Lionel Murphy, Lionel Bowen, Bob Ellicott and others who were involved with those great debates would think, as they look down on this debate, about the way the Senate is dealing with that legacy legislation and the changes we are making to it, supposedly to bring it into contemporary use and to address the needs of 21st-century Australia. What would they make of it if they saw this debate going on? I do not think they would think very much of it, but that is the way it is being handled tonight.


I will address some of the issues in this legislation and point out what I believe would be some of the advantages were the Senate to adopt the amendments put forward by the coalition. I want to affirm, though, that the coalition very much values the essential elements of the legislation as it now stands and believes that our amendments underpin those important values—values that were described in the 2006 amendments moved by the then Attorney-General Philip Ruddock as the shared parenting reforms. We stand by a central feature of that legislation, which was that the paramount consideration of the courts was the best interests of the child when it came to issues relating to the care and maintenance of that child. We stand by the presumption, displaced only on substantial and exceptional grounds—for example, on the basis of what is in the best interests of the child—that there should be equal shared parental respon­sibility in the raising of a child and in the direction made by parents in the course of a child's life. We stand by the recognition in the law—again, I emphasise, subject to a child not being exposed to harm or having its interests otherwise detracted from—of the benefit to a child of having a meaningful relationship with both of its parents. Those principles are in the legislation. They have been there for some time. The level of emphasis placed on those principles has varied from time to time, but those values are core to the way that our Family Law Act works today, and we believe on the coalition side that they ought to be retained and not detracted from.


It is fair to say that the 2006 reforms did require the court to take into account a parent's willingness to abide by those principles dealing with the behaviour of a parent and the parent's attitude towards another party to the marriage or relationship—again, subject to the child's best interests. I heard a suggestion in the course of the debate by Senator Crossin that, for example, in some way the reforms of 2006 weakened or watered down the central focus on the court making decisions that were subject to the child's best interests. That, of course, is completely untrue. The paramount consideration before the court remains what is in the child's best interests. The extent to which other considerations can apply subject to that overarching qualification is what, in a sense, the 2006 reforms and this legislation debate.


Much of the bill enacts appropriate, balanced refinements of the law, but it is the view of the coalition that some of the amendments do undermine the shared parenting principles. Accordingly, the coalition has moved amendments to protect those principles—principles which we were responsible for in the first place. I want to touch on a few of those in a few minutes given I do not have an opportunity to put these issues in the course of a committee stage debate. The issue of a friendly parent provision reflects the fact that coalition senators in the course of the inquiry believed that the bill, to some extent, undermined the principles of shared parenting by repealing those provisions in existing paragraphs 60CC(3)(c) and 60CC(4)(b), which take account of a party's willingness to facilitate another party's involvement in the child's welfare. It is hard to represent those changes as anything other than an attack on that key principle of shared parenting. We were not persuaded that parties to proceedings are not disclosing concerns about family violence or child abuse for fear of being found to be an unfriendly parent. That was not the substantial weight of the evidence before the committee, in our opinion. We consider that the provisions should be preserved as they stand now, more or less, in order to ensure that that important principle is not detracted from. 


On the question of a new definition of family violence, the coalition senators who took part in the inquiry certainly endorsed the objective of giving greater recognition to the breadth of behaviours comprising family violence in our community. However, we did not consider in this inquiry that the net should be cast so wide as to capture all human behaviours, which is what the proposed definition effectively would do. Professor Richard Chisholm, a former judge of the Family Court, gave very strong evidence that there were problems with proposed new subsection 4AB(1). I note that Senator Wright quoted approvingly of the evidence given by Professor Chisholm. I hope she listened, therefore, to the suggestion that we perhaps should consider a different approach towards this particular provision than the one the government is proposing to the Senate. Professor Chisholm said that the new subsection was overinclusive and captured any behaviour that caused a family member to be fearful. I think he gave the example of a family member who rushed into a room to say: 'Fire! Fire! Get out of the house now.' That kind of behaviour would be captured as being behaviour that would cause a member of the family to be fearful, even though it obviously is not appropriate to characterise that as something which could be called family violence. Coalition senators believe that such a provision undermines the objective of the bill as it makes no allowance for the intent of the party giving rise to this 'fear'. Professor Chisholm proposed an alternative provision, which I would commend to the Senate. We will not have a chance to debate those sorts of provisions because the debate has been truncated.


Other senators, including Senator Mason, have made reference to the absolutely preposterous proposal to remove section 117AB of the legislation that allows the Family Court to make an order for costs—a rare thing in the Family Court—where a party has deliberately come forward and knowingly made false allegations of abuse and family violence in the course of Family Court proceedings. We are not talking about allegations which are made which cannot be substantiated on the balance of probabilities. We are not talking about claims that are contested before the court which the court considers in all the circumstances to be made out or not to be made out. We are talking about a finding by the court that a party to the proceedings has deliberately set out to mislead the court by making false allegations of abuse or family violence. The court has the power under the present framework of the law to make an order for costs against the party making false allegations. It is preposterous that this bill proposes to take that power away from the Family Court on the basis that some people have misunderstood what that provision means or that some people have supposedly failed to make allegations that there had been violence in a relationship for fear that they might be ordered to pay costs.


Senator Wright said that there was evidence that this was a widespread problem. With great respect, that was not the evidence that was presented to the committee. The evidence was that it was rumoured to be an issue. Nobody could actually come forward to the committee and tell us that they actually had a case where it had occurred. No-one provided that evidence and the Family Court representatives themselves who came before the committee said that they did not have any evidence of such practices going on. On that basis, the government proposes to remove the capacity of the court to punish a party, in effect—not through an order to award a child to another party, not to take away from the best interests of the child, obviously—and to send the signal that deliberately false allegations should carry some consequence, should resonate through an order for costs. To suggest that that should be removed from the legislation is just outrageous. I think the government's approach to this issue is completely misconceived.


The coalition is also concerned about the timing of the commencement of the legislation. The Family Court itself expressed a preference for the substantive provisions of the bill to apply only to those applications filed after the commencement date of this legislation. Has the government done that? No, it has not. It is applying the provisions to earlier litigation, with the potential effect that parties will have to go back to the court and amend their pleadings before the court because the law changed after the proceedings had commenced. I would have thought that was quite an unsatisfactory state of affairs, but that is what the legislation the government is putting forward does. We do not have a chance to debate this issue properly, because again this amendment cannot be considered in the course of tonight's debate.

Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I have a point of order. I ask how under the standing orders we can possibly vote on this when I have not heard the Greens move the amendment and explain what the amendment is. I may well want to vote for it but I have had no opportunity to hear the debate. I simply ask how could we possibly have—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Macdonald, resume your seat.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Conroy and those on my left. Senator Macdonald, you have the call and you are raising a point of order.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I was raising the point of order that we are being asked to vote on some amendments moved by the Greens. I have not heard the Greens move the amendments. I do not know what the arguments are. I fancy that I may want to vote for them but I have not heard them debated. How can I possibly vote for an amendment that I have not heard debated.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  There is no point of order. A resolution of the Senate was passed yesterday to orchestrate the facility of the bills to be put as they are currently being put. The question now is that amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7150 circulated by the Australian Greens be agreed to.

  I will go back to the previous question. A division is required. Ring the bells for one minute.



An opposition senator:  This is a farce.




Senator Brandis:
  I have a point of order, Mr Deputy President. You have called this vote for the ayes. You asked whether a division was required. There was no voice for the noes calling for a division.




Senator Conroy:
  Yes, there was.




Senator Brandis:
  No, there was not. You then moved on. If the government, who have obviously not been following the process tonight, have made a mistake and they wish the matter to be recommitted there is a manner of doing that. But the manner of doing that is not to shout down the Presiding Officer, as government senators have been attempting to do. If they want to recommit the division they should get up and explain themselves.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Thank you, Senator Brandis. There was a lot of noise in the chamber. Government senators as well as opposition senators have been making a lot of noise during all of the divisions and the reading out of what the divisions are. I am happy to give the government the benefit of the doubt and allow them to call the division because of the noes that they have called. A division has been called for; the bells are going to be rung for one minute. Clerk, have the bells been rung for one minute? No? Ring the bells for one minute.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  The question is that amendment (11) on sheet 7149 moved by the opposition be agreed to.

In division—







Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order on a very serious matter of etiquette in this chamber. There are two Labor senators sitting where I normally sit. They happen to be looking through my papers. 



Government senators interjecting—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Deputy President, this is a very, very serious matter. When we move sides in this chamber you expect that you can leave your papers on your desk and not have them looked at by members of the other party. I would ask that the matter of Senator Collins looking through my papers actually be—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Put it on the record!




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! Senator Macdonald has the call, in an unusual circumstance, being out of his seat. Senator Macdonald.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I only paused then because Senator Collins was shouting at one of my colleagues. But I do raise this as a very serious matter of privilege that someone who is sitting in my seat because we have changed sides is actually looking through my papers that I left on my desk about the speeches I am going to make on the next four bills that are scheduled to be dealt with by this chamber tonight. I am very serious about senators from other parties looking through the papers of senators from the other party when they sit in their seats because of changing sides in divisions. I think I should ask that this matter actually be referred to the Privileges Committee.




Senator Lundy:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order there is absolutely no basis to the complaint that Senator Macdonald has made. I am sitting next to Senator Collins, and it is utterly false.



Opposition senators interjecting—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Senators on my right, order! Senator Macdonald, in relation to your point of order, I say two things. I remind all senators that the courtesy and the conduct of this Senate over numerous years is that you do observe that protocol of not reading material on desks when divisions are in progress. That is the first matter. The second matter, Senator Macdonald, is I will discuss with the President your cause and if further action needs to be taken the President can make that decision and come back to the Senate.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (22:51):  Recently I had the pleasure of launching the ACMA's new Cybersmart Networking tool at St Aloysius Catholic College in Kingston, Tasmania. Cybersmart Networking is a new, innovative tool to provide students with insights into the consequences of posting inappropriate information or images online.


I would like to thank the school, in particular its principal, Mrs Elaine Doran, for allowing the Huntingfield campus of St Aloysius to be used for the launch, and for the participation of staff and students in the activities. This modern, open-plan campus with its friendly staff and students was the perfect location to hold the launch.


I would also like to thank Maria Vassiliadis, Acting Executive Manager of the Safety and e-Education Branch of the ACMA, Sharon Trotter, Manager of Cybersafety Programs of the ACMA, and Graham Rodrick, Senior Adviser for Online Education and Strategy at the ACMA, as well as other staff from the ACMA, for their hard work in developing the Cybersmart Networking program, as well as their marvellous efforts in putting together the launch.


As the Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety, I am a passionate advocate for cybersafety and for child safety more broadly. The digital world is an integral part of our lives and the lives of our children and teenagers. For the young, it provides a social lifeline and a world of knowledge and entertainment. Social networking in particular is the cornerstone of the social lives of many older children and teens as they make the transition from passive content consumers to active participants in the online world. As adults, we are aware of the potential risks and the need to help equip our children to manage those risks should they arise.


The ACMA's 2009 'click and connect' research indicated that children and teens think they know what these online risks are. However, it also indicated that many are not consistently adopting behaviours that will help them avoid these risks and keep them safe in the digital world. The Australian government, through the $128 million cybersafety plan, is committed to educating children and teens about the risks associated with the online environment. The new Cybersmart Networking program is targeted at 12- to 14-year-old students, educating them about safe social networking. It empowers students so that they can make informed decisions and deal appropriately with issues when using social networking platforms. This adds to the suite of interac­tive shared learning activities produced by the ACMA, including Cybersmart Detectives and Cybersmart Hero, as well as other educational resources including the Tagged DVD, Wise Up to IT, Let's Fight it Together, and Hector's World.


Cybersmart Networking uses interactive role play to identify issues in a simulated social-networking environment. Children work in teams, online and in real time. Each child plays a central role in the activity, uncovering clues and making suggestions about how a student might deal with the issues identified. Cybersmart guides respond to questions the students ask and help them through the activity. Guides include police, education, government and child welfare advocates who are experts in child safety. As the scenario unfolds, the children discuss the issues they encounter and ways of managing them. Supporting lesson plans provide follow-up activities with teachers, reinforcing what the students have learned. The activity is conducted in schools, and students participate with Cybersmart guides located remotely.


A total of 140 students from four schools participated in the launch of Cybersmart Networking. The schools were from Tas­mania, the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia. These students from across the country were guided from a temporary headquarters set up at St Aloysius. Senior Constable Russell Barratt and Sergeant Brett Saarinen of the Tasmania Police were two of the guides during the launch, responding to the students' questions and messages in real time. The students involved sent a total of 1,085 messages during the activity, with almost all messages answered by the Cybersmart guides. The students involved were genuinely engaged with the program, working in pairs to work through the problems.


I had the opportunity to talk to several pairs of students who were talking through the problems presented to them and were genuinely thinking about cybersafety issues. They loved the fact that they were learning in an interactive environment and were given the opportunity to think through the issues for themselves. They thought it was a much more effective way to learn about these issues than just being told what not to do when online. Teachers were impressed with how engaged the students were with the Cybersmart Networking activity.


The online world is an interactive one, and education about online dangers must also be interactive, mimicking the form of the online environment. The Cybersmart Networking program has been tailored so that students are provided with age-appropriate messages on how students can protect themselves online. Schools wishing to participate in the Cybersmart Networking program in 2012 can do so by filling in an online form at the Cybersmart website.


Cybersmart Networking builds upon the two previous interactive shared learning activities, Cybersmart Detectives and Cybersmart Hero, which have already had over 30,000 participants. Targeted to students aged 10 to 12 years old, Cybersmart Detectives addresses issues of online safety and grooming. It encourages young people to think before posting personal information online and to be wary about people they have only met online. The Cybersmart Detectives activity has recently been independently assessed by Edith Cowan University. Results show that there is clear evidence that this program is a very effective education tool. Feedback from education experts, psychologists and teachers shows this interactive format is highly effective in engaging students to process key learnings during the activity. Targeted to students aged 11 to 13 years old, Cybersmart Hero addresses the issue of cyberbullying and the responsibilities of those in the best position to influence cyberbullying—the bystanders. Over 30,000 students have now taken part in these interactive shared learning activities. 


In September, I joined the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy, ACMA Deputy Chair, Richard Bean, and more than 280 students, teachers and industry experts at the launch of the ACMA's new cybersafety film, Tagged. Tagged has been developed by the ACMA under the government's cyber­safety plan. It tells the story of Kate, Jack, Raz and Em and dramatically illustrates how online actions can have real-world conse­quences. The story-line was developed in consultation with young people, ensuring that it is credible and resonates with the target audience of teens 14 years and older. It addresses contemporary online issues, including sexting, cyberbullying and protecting your digital reputation, in a format that students can relate to. Tagged is recommended for use with students aged 14 years and over and is available free of charge to all schools. Tagged is supported by lesson plans, incorporating realistic scenarios and activities, as well as character reflection interviews which further explore the themes presented in the film.


I have had the opportunity to talk to high-school students about the Tagged film. The students who have viewed the film find it engaging, entertaining, relevant and relatable to issues they are currently facing. They are able to see themselves and their friends in the characters in the film. As one student told me, 'Tagged is cool.' Tagged complements a diverse range of resources aimed at inform­ing, educating and empowering students. Itcan be ordered for free from the Cybersmart website. The film is accompanied by lesson plans, activities and character interviews for use in schools which promote positive online behaviour. The government's online resources to improve knowledge of online risks are being taken up by schools, students, parents and online professionals. In just over two years, over 360,000 participants have attended one of the ACMA's professional development and internet safety presenta­tions, and the Cybersmart website which the minister launched two years ago has received well over one million visits. The Cybersmart site provides access to Kids Helpline for confidential online counselling and access to the government's Cybersafety Help Button. The help button provides practical informa­tion and tips on how to deal with cyber­bullying, unwanted contact and offences or illegal content. A Cybersafety Help Button for Android smart phones is currently available free of charge from the Android market and will be available soon for the Windows Phone 7 and iPhone.


Cybersafety issues are becoming increasingly important for the children and teenagers of today. The tools provided by the ACMA are helping these children and teenagers to learn the risks that are inherent in online activity and teaching them how to stay safe online. The launch of the Cybersmart Networking program and the Tagged film are just two more tools in the arsenal of parents, teachers and schools to improve the safety of the online environ­ment. I am proud that I can be involved with these programs.
