"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2004-08-05,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, Senator Heffernan, I present an interim report of the committee on the administration of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate adopt the recommendation of the interim report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,11,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I rise to speak on that motion. I was going to seek leave to note the tabling of the interim report, but I am happy to deal with it in this fashion. The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has been carefully examining the administration of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and other aviation matters over recent years—examinations, I might say, that have not always pleased the Minister for Transport and Regional Services or made CASA and its senior officers comfortable. Nonetheless, this inquiry has been an example of the Senate at its best: doing the hard work—work the minister has been unwilling or unable to do himself. If the minister paid a modicum of the attention to aviation issues that this committee has demonstrated, the Australian aviation community would have a good deal more confidence in him. There is no better example of this than the minister's national airspace fiasco, a fiasco brought into sharp relief by a near miss last year between a Virgin Boeing 737 and a light aircraft near Launceston—in fact, not very far from where I live. Tasmania is my home state. My office is in the town of Launceston and I live in the Tamar Valley, the approximate area of the near miss. I can assure the Senate that the minister's competence, or lack thereof, is a matter of great interest to air travellers in and out of Launceston airport—and I travel there regularly myself.
Last week's announcement that Airservices Australia recognises the need for change to the government's National Airspace System to enhance safety is welcome; it is albeit belated but good news nevertheless. Labor and aviation unions argued that industry professions had not been involved in the design and implementation of the system introduced in November 2003. We argued that the system may not be as safe as the previous system, particularly because conditions in Australia are significantly different from conditions in the United States of America—the system on which the current National Airspace System model is based. As stated by my colleague the shadow minister for transport, Mr Martin Ferguson, Labor's concerns about the National Airspace System have always been about the safety of the aviation community, aviators and passengers alike. For months the minister abused anyone who dared question the wisdom of his government's national airspace reforms. Now, Labor calls on the minister to back Airservices Australia's move to enhance safety, particularly through a focus on C class airspace at airports and protection for arriving and departing aircraft.
This is a significant announcement by the government and confirms that Labor's longstanding concerns were well grounded. It reinstates safety as the priority for airspace management ahead of economic considerations and, frankly, affirms that CASA has a significant role to play in the analysis of the proposed changes to ensure that they are as safe as possible through their implementation safety case. In my view, the minister and this government ought to reflect on their approach to other aviation issues in the context of their flawed national airspace implementation. Rather than focus on the politics, the minister ought to focus on the policy. 
We have all shared concern about safety in the aviation industry. This committee has looked at issues such as the Whyalla Air disaster. It has looked at issues to do with airspace, at the safety of particular operators, at the system of regulation of operators and at the withdrawal or non-withdrawal of air operating certificates by particular aviators and by certain maintenance organisations. This committee has been doing the work to make sure that, when it comes to the safety regime that applies in this country for aviation, it cannot be said that every effort has not been made to ensure that the regulator has operated properly. You will see in the committee's report, for example, that the committee did pursue the issue of the activities of one CASA officer, Mr Foley, who held a senior position in CASA. His performance, frankly, was under close scrutiny by this committee, and that line of inquiry effectively ceased when Mr Foley ceased to be employed by CASA.
This committee looked at the administration of matters raised by avgas contamination. There can be no doubt that the contamination of avgas and the closing down for a significant period of a sector of aviation reliant on avgas, particularly in a key tourism period, had dramatic effects on communities. One community affected was that of Flinders Island, serviced only by aircraft using avgas. This effectively closed down the aviation services to the island and tourism operations on the island over the Christmas period, the peak period for tourism, and had dramatic effects on business. Frankly, whilst it would be difficult to say that the finger ought to be pointed at the government or the minister for the contamination, one would have to say that the government was not at its best in pursuing the proper outcomes to ensure that what should have been done in the lead-up to that problem occurring was done and that the problem would be obviated in the future.
In the course of the inquiry that is the subject of the interim report today the committee identified problems in the administration of CASA and in the course of pursuing those problems it sought solutions. The single recommendation of this report sets out the view of the committee that it will report its findings on these matters in the context of its standing inquiry into annual reports. I say again that this committee has played an outstanding role in scrutinising the actions of this government in a whole range of critical policy areas. The committee substantially operated on the basis of consensus and unanimity so it cannot be said that it operated with a political intent and with the usual political divisions that one might see in certain other committees of the parliament—certainly committees of the other place. 
I have to say that the sloppiness of Ministers Truss and Anderson in particular has caused a lot of work for members of this committee. I have to also say that those ministers have been quick to criticise this committee and the findings of its members and individuals who choose to make statements to hold this government to account. I think it is important to note that this committee has been led well in the past by former senator Winston Crane, and Senator Bill Heffernan has continued Senator Crane's tradition of seeking to find a consensus view on committee reports. That is not always possible, but that has been the tradition of this committee and I would hope that, insofar as it is possible, it will continue into the future. 
The issue of national airspace ought to be reflected on. Not only has this committee used the ordinary committee inquiry processes but it has used the Senate estimates process to follow up inquiries before the committee, particularly to do with national airspace. I encourage senators to look at passages of the Senate estimates Hansard to see exactly what the views of the government, as represented by its bureaucrats, have been to criticisms of the National Airspace System. We have seen every contention raised by senators pooh-poohed by officers of CASA on behalf of the government and, frankly, those concerns have now been shown to have been valid. The reality is that, had we not been raising concerns, the public would have been lulled into a false sense of security. 
In my travels around this country—be it to Launceston, Broome, Cairns, Western Australia or Canberra—I have talked to the aviation community and they have significant concerns about the government's proposed National Airspace System. The government has refused to listen to them and it has only been near misses and activities of other agencies which have pointed out those problems which have called this government to account. This committee has played a critical part in keeping the matter on the agenda. I hope to continue to address these matters in the future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,11,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I want to add a few words about this interim report into the administration of CASA, mainly because I have been on this Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. Whilst the committee's work is not perhaps seen by the majority of people as being the sexiest part of the operation of parliament, it is a committee that always has to act in the public interest in matters like this—the transport aspect, or AQIS and the safety of the import of foodstuffs. It is a committee that does, as I think Senator O'Brien said, work with a great deal of cooperation. I think that is something that a lot of committees in this place do not do. Senator O'Brien was correct to say that certainly Winston Crane and in later times Senator Bill Heffernan have done their utmost to try to get a spirit of cooperation and consensus in the reports that we deliver. On most occasions we are able to do that.
This report arose out of the previous parliament and it was a report that came about because of problems that were quite evident in the air traffic industry. The inquiry encompassed three primary issues that were of concern to the committee's predecessor—that is, the committee of the 39th Parliament. Those issues were picked up by this committee and included the appointment of Mr Laurie Foley. We have already heard from Senator O'Brien that that problem was resolved by Mr Foley's resignation. So that was off the agenda for us. But the administration of matters that arose out of the avgas contamination was pursued. With the matter being pursued, there was a settlement with Mobil Oil, the producer of the contaminated avgas. They put on the table an acceptable compensation package to the operators. That took care of the economic loss that they suffered through the contaminated fuel. It was an issue that the committee did pursue with a great deal of vigour and we were satisfied that the right thing had been done at the end of the day. But it did take an effort to ensure that the government actively took their role in bringing about a resolution.
I could talk for hours on that issue alone, but it is important for people to understand that the contamination of fuel was something that did have a large impact on small operators, particularly in regional areas. They could not continue their services until everything was done right—their engines had been checked and they were assured the fuel was clean and it was not waxing up, which was the problem. So it was a real public accountability role that the Senate committee took on that issue. 
The other issue was the oversight of the administration of the maintenance programs of Australia's regular public transport operators. This issue is ongoing and is taken up and dealt with in the recommendation in the report. The recommendation states:
The Committee recommends that it concludes its inquiry into the administration of CASA by reporting its findings as part of the report it makes to the Senate in accordance with the provisions of standing order 25(21).
That is, that it will be dealt with through the process of Senate estimates.
The maintenance programs for Australia's regular public transport operators have become an ongoing issue that is pursued with a lot of interest by the committee. Whilst there may not be a great deal of interest by the responsible ministers, the committee is extremely concerned about this issue. Over the period we have been pursuing it, CASA have been treating this with a great deal of seriousness and are now preparing to properly answer questions put to them during the estimates process. They are ensuring that the practices they talked about are being implemented and monitored and that assurances are given to us. Many of us feel far more comfortable because of that process.
It is not just the Senate committee that should feel comfortable with the answers it gets from CASA; the public should feel a degree of comfort knowing that the right thing is being done to ensure that there is the utmost safety in travel. The committee has adopted an ongoing role in monitoring the work of CASA in relation to maintenance, and it is one that we should be pleased with. The public can rest assured that the committee is serious about ensuring safety in the air.
A couple of other issues need to be highlighted. There is the matter of public accountability of the government. This committee—cooperatively, I have to say—is trying to ensure that there is accountability for the things the government is saying it will do, might do or perhaps is core or non-core in its commitment. We are taking everything the government is saying as something that should be pursued with a degree of vigour that makes sure the public feel that CASA is accountable for their actions.
The government, unlike Labor, is not quite committed to airport security. They are a bit hit and miss on that issue, and many of us who live in non-capital cities can see the difference. When you come through places like Adelaide airport or Canberra airport, you go through screening processes where everything is put through the X-ray, including your baggage. You are picked up if you have metal in your shoes or anything of that nature. I believe this is a good process and should be stepped up. I have no objection to occasionally being pulled aside for a further search to see whether there is any contamination on my clothing that could make me a threat to other travellers. I have no problem with that.
I have a problem when I go to places like Whyalla airport or Port Lincoln airport where there is a large travelling public and I do not go through the same process. An aeroplane is an aeroplane. It does not matter how big or how small it is. It flies and has the potential to create danger to people. I am still devastated and in shock over what happened in New York but, let me tell you, the same thing can happen with a small aircraft in many places—in shopping centres or car parks. Devastation can be the result of that kind of action or a plane not making its destination because something has been put in someone's baggage with the intent of causing destruction and harm. I object to the government's hit and miss attitude. 
Labor will not continue with this government's policy of occasionally doing something to upgrade airports. It seems a coat of paint on the airport door is enough to give greater security—not even security officers to monitor passenger movement. Much of this comes back to CASA in that they have a greater role to play. This committee monitors those kinds of things. As members of the committee, we are concerned that the government has not been serious about upgrading airport security and improving the safety of those who travel by air in Australia.
Another issue of great concern to me is the attitude towards safety on board aircraft, particularly larger aircraft with cabin crew. It is of concern to us, if Australia is to comply with standards overseas and airlines want to ship staff off to New Zealand or employ staff from overseas, that we downgrade cabin crew numbers to suit other countries— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,11,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I rise to note the tabling of the interim report on the administration of CASA by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. I concur very strongly with the remarks of the previous speakers, Senator O'Brien and Senator Buckland, that the committee has had the responsibility of an enormous task in examining the administration of CASA over recent years. Perhaps the examination has been a bit disconcerting for some senior officers in CASA but it has been an important process of investigation and evaluation of air transport and air safety issues that we have been hearing about nationally. This morning I want to raise some of those issues and talk about the responses we have finally seen from the government. I welcome Saturday's announcement that, in particular, the National Airspace System that was implemented only six months ago is now to be reviewed, given the number of disconcerting events that have taken place in the six months since its introduction.
We know that the National Airspace System was modelled on the system used in the United States. I remember arguing here in December last year about how that system, which might work very effectively in America, was not appropriate for regional Australia, particularly for smaller regional airports. Since the implementation of this system, we have had a series of incidents—up to 20—reported by air traffic controllers involving Australia's downgraded airspace. Many light aircraft have been operating without working transponders. Pilots have been operating on wrong frequencies and straying into the tightly controlled international and domestic capital city flight paths. We know that air traffic controllers have been reporting their concerns consistently over time. We have heard about the incidents in regional Australia. We heard what happened in Tamworth, we heard what happened in Launceston—the serious incident which triggered the final inquiry and the decision, announced on Saturday, that there would be a major review of the system. I note that Airservices Australia has said that there will be `enhancements to the system', including of course the reintroduction of the radio frequency boundaries. I say on behalf of all air travellers that we welcome that announcement because it is an important safety feature for all of us.
The proposed changes are significant and confirm that the concerns expressed over the past six months were very well grounded. The changes reinstate safety as the priority for airspace management rather than economic considerations. We heard at the implementation of the National Airspace System that this system would be less costly for aviators. The counterargument that we heard from the unions was that the industry professions had not been involved in the design and implementation of the system. Therefore, how could it be as safe as the existing system? Of course, that is exactly what has been found to be the case. CASA has a significant role to play in the analysis of the proposed changes to ensure that they are as safe as possible through their implementation safety case.  
I also make some comments about airport planning and development issues that have arisen at a number of airports. We have had many local councils and both state and territory governments indicating their concerns about airport developments, particularly relating to rates income and local infrastructure. Many local regional airports—small airports—formerly owned and managed by the council are now being sold simply because of the new rates regime, which means that they are no longer economically viable for councils to operate. That has meant that some small communities' airports have effectively been downgraded to such an extent that they are no longer being used, to the disadvantage of those small communities. We know that airport owners can do something to allay these issues. In particular, airport owners can develop a close and cooperative relationship with local councils to resolve most of the issues before they become major issues. We know—and the industry tells us—that there is a real need for the Airports Act to be reviewed. The government initiated a review in November 2002, but we are yet to see anything like a finalisation of that review—we need to see that very soon.
The other issue raised with us about CASA and its administration is airport charges. Airservices Australia has circulated a proposed fees schedule for users of tower airports from 1 July 2005. The schedule proposes a massive charge increase for smaller and regional towered airports. I have had many representations from regional communities in New South Wales about the implications of these massive charges. The proposed charges are a culmination of the government's decision to impose location-specific charging in 1998 and effectively reflect the removal of government subsidy of these charges. Again, the impact is likely to be fairly significant for small regional airports that provide a vital transport service to isolated communities that are long distances from main service centres. 
There will be some significant increases in charges. I refer to some of the airports in New South Wales. The charges for Albury airport will increase from $8.67 to $29.55 per tonne, which is a huge increase. The charges for Camden airport will increase from $8.67 to $164.22. The charges for Tamworth airport will increase from $8.67 to $41.19. They are significant charges which impact on the economic viability of regional services.
The government purports to be supporting rural and regional Australia, but surely these airport charges are just one more kick in the guts for people living outside our capital cities. That is certainly the message that has been brought home to me by regional communities. Labor has a viable policy alternative—that is, to reintroduce network pricing for these charges. Network pricing equalises the costs across all airports. That would in fact result in a uniform charge much closer to $6 per tonne, rather than the outrageous charge of $164.22 per tonne proposed for Camden airport. 
We have also been considering in recent weeks the analysis of the critical safety and security issues around cabin crew roles. Concerted pressure from federal Labor has forced the government to determine that the maintenance of Australia's longstanding crew-to-passenger ratio was in the national interest and would be retained within our local jurisdiction, despite different rules in other jurisdictions. There has been significant pressure on the air industry to implement changes that would allow crews to be staffed out of other countries at higher crew-to-passenger ratios, which would impact on our local crews. We know that would be a downgrading of safety; it would also be a downgrading of passenger services. 
In the last few weeks we have considered the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand and Other Matters) Bill 2003. Many of the professional aviation industry associations, such as the Flight Attendants Association, led the fight to block the proposed mutual recognition with New Zealand legislation earlier this year. During the recent Senate inquiry into the proposed legislation, Labor developed the position that the government are proposing to introduce a new aviation regime but have not undertaken the research required to justify the change. They appear to have relied on hearsay information that there will be benefits with little cost. No evidence was presented to the committee to justify that. Both the Department of Transport and Regional Services and Qantas, when asked to quantify the benefits, were unable to do so. The greatest cost for Australia in not maintaining the scrutiny of air services and CASA is the potential for reduced safety, and Labor will not allow that to happen.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2004-08-05,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, Senator Heffernan, I present an interim report of the committee on the administration of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I rise to speak on that motion. I was going to seek leave to note the tabling of the interim report, but I am happy to deal with it in this fashion. The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has been carefully examining the administration of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and other aviation matters over recent years—examinations, I might say, that have not always pleased the Minister for Transport and Regional Services or made CASA and its senior officers comfortable. Nonetheless, this inquiry has been an example of the Senate at its best: doing the hard work—work the minister has been unwilling or unable to do himself. If the minister paid a modicum of the attention to aviation issues that this committee has demonstrated, the Australian aviation community would have a good deal more confidence in him. There is no better example of this than the minister's national airspace fiasco, a fiasco brought into sharp relief by a near miss last year between a Virgin Boeing 737 and a light aircraft near Launceston—in fact, not very far from where I live. Tasmania is my home state. My office is in the town of Launceston and I live in the Tamar Valley, the approximate area of the near miss. I can assure the Senate that the minister's competence, or lack thereof, is a matter of great interest to air travellers in and out of Launceston airport—and I travel there regularly myself.
Last week's announcement that Airservices Australia recognises the need for change to the government's National Airspace System to enhance safety is welcome; it is albeit belated but good news nevertheless. Labor and aviation unions argued that industry professions had not been involved in the design and implementation of the system introduced in November 2003. We argued that the system may not be as safe as the previous system, particularly because conditions in Australia are significantly different from conditions in the United States of America—the system on which the current National Airspace System model is based. As stated by my colleague the shadow minister for transport, Mr Martin Ferguson, Labor's concerns about the National Airspace System have always been about the safety of the aviation community, aviators and passengers alike. For months the minister abused anyone who dared question the wisdom of his government's national airspace reforms. Now, Labor calls on the minister to back Airservices Australia's move to enhance safety, particularly through a focus on C class airspace at airports and protection for arriving and departing aircraft.
This is a significant announcement by the government and confirms that Labor's longstanding concerns were well grounded. It reinstates safety as the priority for airspace management ahead of economic considerations and, frankly, affirms that CASA has a significant role to play in the analysis of the proposed changes to ensure that they are as safe as possible through their implementation safety case. In my view, the minister and this government ought to reflect on their approach to other aviation issues in the context of their flawed national airspace implementation. Rather than focus on the politics, the minister ought to focus on the policy. 
We have all shared concern about safety in the aviation industry. This committee has looked at issues such as the Whyalla Air disaster. It has looked at issues to do with airspace, at the safety of particular operators, at the system of regulation of operators and at the withdrawal or non-withdrawal of air operating certificates by particular aviators and by certain maintenance organisations. This committee has been doing the work to make sure that, when it comes to the safety regime that applies in this country for aviation, it cannot be said that every effort has not been made to ensure that the regulator has operated properly. You will see in the committee's report, for example, that the committee did pursue the issue of the activities of one CASA officer, Mr Foley, who held a senior position in CASA. His performance, frankly, was under close scrutiny by this committee, and that line of inquiry effectively ceased when Mr Foley ceased to be employed by CASA.
This committee looked at the administration of matters raised by avgas contamination. There can be no doubt that the contamination of avgas and the closing down for a significant period of a sector of aviation reliant on avgas, particularly in a key tourism period, had dramatic effects on communities. One community affected was that of Flinders Island, serviced only by aircraft using avgas. This effectively closed down the aviation services to the island and tourism operations on the island over the Christmas period, the peak period for tourism, and had dramatic effects on business. Frankly, whilst it would be difficult to say that the finger ought to be pointed at the government or the minister for the contamination, one would have to say that the government was not at its best in pursuing the proper outcomes to ensure that what should have been done in the lead-up to that problem occurring was done and that the problem would be obviated in the future.
In the course of the inquiry that is the subject of the interim report today the committee identified problems in the administration of CASA and in the course of pursuing those problems it sought solutions. The single recommendation of this report sets out the view of the committee that it will report its findings on these matters in the context of its standing inquiry into annual reports. I say again that this committee has played an outstanding role in scrutinising the actions of this government in a whole range of critical policy areas. The committee substantially operated on the basis of consensus and unanimity so it cannot be said that it operated with a political intent and with the usual political divisions that one might see in certain other committees of the parliament—certainly committees of the other place. 
I have to say that the sloppiness of Ministers Truss and Anderson in particular has caused a lot of work for members of this committee. I have to also say that those ministers have been quick to criticise this committee and the findings of its members and individuals who choose to make statements to hold this government to account. I think it is important to note that this committee has been led well in the past by former senator Winston Crane, and Senator Bill Heffernan has continued Senator Crane's tradition of seeking to find a consensus view on committee reports. That is not always possible, but that has been the tradition of this committee and I would hope that, insofar as it is possible, it will continue into the future. 
The issue of national airspace ought to be reflected on. Not only has this committee used the ordinary committee inquiry processes but it has used the Senate estimates process to follow up inquiries before the committee, particularly to do with national airspace. I encourage senators to look at passages of the Senate estimates Hansard to see exactly what the views of the government, as represented by its bureaucrats, have been to criticisms of the National Airspace System. We have seen every contention raised by senators pooh-poohed by officers of CASA on behalf of the government and, frankly, those concerns have now been shown to have been valid. The reality is that, had we not been raising concerns, the public would have been lulled into a false sense of security. 
In my travels around this country—be it to Launceston, Broome, Cairns, Western Australia or Canberra—I have talked to the aviation community and they have significant concerns about the government's proposed National Airspace System. The government has refused to listen to them and it has only been near misses and activities of other agencies which have pointed out those problems which have called this government to account. This committee has played a critical part in keeping the matter on the agenda. I hope to continue to address these matters in the future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Interim Report</title>,Committees,11,2,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I want to add a few words about this interim report into the administration of CASA, mainly because I have been on this Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. Whilst the committee's work is not perhaps seen by the majority of people as being the sexiest part of the operation of parliament, it is a committee that always has to act in the public interest in matters like this—the transport aspect, or AQIS and the safety of the import of foodstuffs. It is a committee that does, as I think Senator O'Brien said, work with a great deal of cooperation. I think that is something that a lot of committees in this place do not do. Senator O'Brien was correct to say that certainly Winston Crane and in later times Senator Bill Heffernan have done their utmost to try to get a spirit of cooperation and consensus in the reports that we deliver. On most occasions we are able to do that.
This report arose out of the previous parliament and it was a report that came about because of problems that were quite evident in the air traffic industry. The inquiry encompassed three primary issues that were of concern to the committee's predecessor—that is, the committee of the 39th Parliament. Those issues were picked up by this committee and included the appointment of Mr Laurie Foley. We have already heard from Senator O'Brien that that problem was resolved by Mr Foley's resignation. So that was off the agenda for us. But the administration of matters that arose out of the avgas contamination was pursued. With the matter being pursued, there was a settlement with Mobil Oil, the producer of the contaminated avgas. They put on the table an acceptable compensation package to the operators. That took care of the economic loss that they suffered through the contaminated fuel. It was an issue that the committee did pursue with a great deal of vigour and we were satisfied that the right thing had been done at the end of the day. But it did take an effort to ensure that the government actively took their role in bringing about a resolution.
I could talk for hours on that issue alone, but it is important for people to understand that the contamination of fuel was something that did have a large impact on small operators, particularly in regional areas. They could not continue their services until everything was done right—their engines had been checked and they were assured the fuel was clean and it was not waxing up, which was the problem. So it was a real public accountability role that the Senate committee took on that issue. 
The other issue was the oversight of the administration of the maintenance programs of Australia's regular public transport operators. This issue is ongoing and is taken up and dealt with in the recommendation in the report. The recommendation states:
The Committee recommends that it concludes its inquiry into the administration of CASA by reporting its findings as part of the report it makes to the Senate in accordance with the provisions of standing order 25(21).
That is, that it will be dealt with through the process of Senate estimates.
The maintenance programs for Australia's regular public transport operators have become an ongoing issue that is pursued with a lot of interest by the committee. Whilst there may not be a great deal of interest by the responsible ministers, the committee is extremely concerned about this issue. Over the period we have been pursuing it, CASA have been treating this with a great deal of seriousness and are now preparing to properly answer questions put to them during the estimates process. They are ensuring that the practices they talked about are being implemented and monitored and that assurances are given to us. Many of us feel far more comfortable because of that process.
It is not just the Senate committee that should feel comfortable with the answers it gets from CASA; the public should feel a degree of comfort knowing that the right thing is being done to ensure that there is the utmost safety in travel. The committee has adopted an ongoing role in monitoring the work of CASA in relation to maintenance, and it is one that we should be pleased with. The public can rest assured that the committee is serious about ensuring safety in the air.
A couple of other issues need to be highlighted. There is the matter of public accountability of the government. This committee—cooperatively, I have to say—is trying to ensure that there is accountability for the things the government is saying it will do, might do or perhaps is core or non-core in its commitment. We are taking everything the government is saying as something that should be pursued with a degree of vigour that makes sure the public feel that CASA is accountable for their actions.
The government, unlike Labor, is not quite committed to airport security. They are a bit hit and miss on that issue, and many of us who live in non-capital cities can see the difference. When you come through places like Adelaide airport or Canberra airport, you go through screening processes where everything is put through the X-ray, including your baggage. You are picked up if you have metal in your shoes or anything of that nature. I believe this is a good process and should be stepped up. I have no objection to occasionally being pulled aside for a further search to see whether there is any contamination on my clothing that could make me a threat to other travellers. I have no problem with that.
I have a problem when I go to places like Whyalla airport or Port Lincoln airport where there is a large travelling public and I do not go through the same process. An aeroplane is an aeroplane. It does not matter how big or how small it is. It flies and has the potential to create danger to people. I am still devastated and in shock over what happened in New York but, let me tell you, the same thing can happen with a small aircraft in many places—in shopping centres or car parks. Devastation can be the result of that kind of action or a plane not making its destination because something has been put in someone's baggage with the intent of causing destruction and harm. I object to the government's hit and miss attitude. 
Labor will not continue with this government's policy of occasionally doing something to upgrade airports. It seems a coat of paint on the airport door is enough to give greater security—not even security officers to monitor passenger movement. Much of this comes back to CASA in that they have a greater role to play. This committee monitors those kinds of things. As members of the committee, we are concerned that the government has not been serious about upgrading airport security and improving the safety of those who travel by air in Australia.
Another issue of great concern to me is the attitude towards safety on board aircraft, particularly larger aircraft with cabin crew. It is of concern to us, if Australia is to comply with standards overseas and airlines want to ship staff off to New Zealand or employ staff from overseas, that we downgrade cabin crew numbers to suit other countries— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Interim Report</title>,Committees,11,2,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I rise to note the tabling of the interim report on the administration of CASA by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. I concur very strongly with the remarks of the previous speakers, Senator O'Brien and Senator Buckland, that the committee has had the responsibility of an enormous task in examining the administration of CASA over recent years. Perhaps the examination has been a bit disconcerting for some senior officers in CASA but it has been an important process of investigation and evaluation of air transport and air safety issues that we have been hearing about nationally. This morning I want to raise some of those issues and talk about the responses we have finally seen from the government. I welcome Saturday's announcement that, in particular, the National Airspace System that was implemented only six months ago is now to be reviewed, given the number of disconcerting events that have taken place in the six months since its introduction.
We know that the National Airspace System was modelled on the system used in the United States. I remember arguing here in December last year about how that system, which might work very effectively in America, was not appropriate for regional Australia, particularly for smaller regional airports. Since the implementation of this system, we have had a series of incidents—up to 20—reported by air traffic controllers involving Australia's downgraded airspace. Many light aircraft have been operating without working transponders. Pilots have been operating on wrong frequencies and straying into the tightly controlled international and domestic capital city flight paths. We know that air traffic controllers have been reporting their concerns consistently over time. We have heard about the incidents in regional Australia. We heard what happened in Tamworth, we heard what happened in Launceston—the serious incident which triggered the final inquiry and the decision, announced on Saturday, that there would be a major review of the system. I note that Airservices Australia has said that there will be `enhancements to the system', including of course the reintroduction of the radio frequency boundaries. I say on behalf of all air travellers that we welcome that announcement because it is an important safety feature for all of us.
The proposed changes are significant and confirm that the concerns expressed over the past six months were very well grounded. The changes reinstate safety as the priority for airspace management rather than economic considerations. We heard at the implementation of the National Airspace System that this system would be less costly for aviators. The counterargument that we heard from the unions was that the industry professions had not been involved in the design and implementation of the system. Therefore, how could it be as safe as the existing system? Of course, that is exactly what has been found to be the case. CASA has a significant role to play in the analysis of the proposed changes to ensure that they are as safe as possible through their implementation safety case.  
I also make some comments about airport planning and development issues that have arisen at a number of airports. We have had many local councils and both state and territory governments indicating their concerns about airport developments, particularly relating to rates income and local infrastructure. Many local regional airports—small airports—formerly owned and managed by the council are now being sold simply because of the new rates regime, which means that they are no longer economically viable for councils to operate. That has meant that some small communities' airports have effectively been downgraded to such an extent that they are no longer being used, to the disadvantage of those small communities. We know that airport owners can do something to allay these issues. In particular, airport owners can develop a close and cooperative relationship with local councils to resolve most of the issues before they become major issues. We know—and the industry tells us—that there is a real need for the Airports Act to be reviewed. The government initiated a review in November 2002, but we are yet to see anything like a finalisation of that review—we need to see that very soon.
The other issue raised with us about CASA and its administration is airport charges. Airservices Australia has circulated a proposed fees schedule for users of tower airports from 1 July 2005. The schedule proposes a massive charge increase for smaller and regional towered airports. I have had many representations from regional communities in New South Wales about the implications of these massive charges. The proposed charges are a culmination of the government's decision to impose location-specific charging in 1998 and effectively reflect the removal of government subsidy of these charges. Again, the impact is likely to be fairly significant for small regional airports that provide a vital transport service to isolated communities that are long distances from main service centres. 
There will be some significant increases in charges. I refer to some of the airports in New South Wales. The charges for Albury airport will increase from $8.67 to $29.55 per tonne, which is a huge increase. The charges for Camden airport will increase from $8.67 to $164.22. The charges for Tamworth airport will increase from $8.67 to $41.19. They are significant charges which impact on the economic viability of regional services.
The government purports to be supporting rural and regional Australia, but surely these airport charges are just one more kick in the guts for people living outside our capital cities. That is certainly the message that has been brought home to me by regional communities. Labor has a viable policy alternative—that is, to reintroduce network pricing for these charges. Network pricing equalises the costs across all airports. That would in fact result in a uniform charge much closer to $6 per tonne, rather than the outrageous charge of $164.22 per tonne proposed for Camden airport. 
We have also been considering in recent weeks the analysis of the critical safety and security issues around cabin crew roles. Concerted pressure from federal Labor has forced the government to determine that the maintenance of Australia's longstanding crew-to-passenger ratio was in the national interest and would be retained within our local jurisdiction, despite different rules in other jurisdictions. There has been significant pressure on the air industry to implement changes that would allow crews to be staffed out of other countries at higher crew-to-passenger ratios, which would impact on our local crews. We know that would be a downgrading of safety; it would also be a downgrading of passenger services. 
In the last few weeks we have considered the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand and Other Matters) Bill 2003. Many of the professional aviation industry associations, such as the Flight Attendants Association, led the fight to block the proposed mutual recognition with New Zealand legislation earlier this year. During the recent Senate inquiry into the proposed legislation, Labor developed the position that the government are proposing to introduce a new aviation regime but have not undertaken the research required to justify the change. They appear to have relied on hearsay information that there will be benefits with little cost. No evidence was presented to the committee to justify that. Both the Department of Transport and Regional Services and Qantas, when asked to quantify the benefits, were unable to do so. The greatest cost for Australia in not maintaining the scrutiny of air services and CASA is the potential for reduced safety, and Labor will not allow that to happen.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Interim Report</title>,Committees,11,2,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2004-08-05,"—Last night I started to speak on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004 but ran out of time, so I continue my remarks today. The question before us, which has not been satisfactorily addressed by the government at any point throughout this debate, is: why were health policy, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and its operation included in a trade agreement? What was the purpose of putting good public health policy into a trade agreement? 
Trade agreements are not areas where we develop good public policy in the national interest; they are for trade policy. One can only make the assumption—I think correctly—that the trade in pharmaceuticals is a concern to the US companies and that the US required the PBS to be in the trade agreement because they wanted to change the operation of it. There can be no other explanation for that: they seek to change the operation of good public health policy. That is something that the Labor Party will never accept or tolerate. We are not the only people who think it is inappropriate for trade agreements to be impinging upon good public health policy. US congressman Mr Tom Allen said:
... I question whether it is appropriate to use trade policy to interfere in other nations' health systems. We certainly wouldn't accept such a demand from other countries.
Clearly US congressmen have a higher standard of what should or should not be in trade agreements. Congressman Tom Allen would not accept these sorts of clauses in agreements, which would impinge upon health policy in the US, but, when the US insisted on them being included in this agreement, the Australian government simply buckled and folded. Mr Henry A. Waxman, another congressman in the US—
—But you support the agreement.
—I am glad Senator Brandis is here. He might be able to answer the question why the PBS has been included in trade policy. I look forward to listening to his speech, and maybe he will address that. What did Mr Henry Waxman say about it? He said:
Domestic healthcare policy should not be decided in trade agreements. It is wrong for us to interfere with another country's domestic health policy, particularly when it comes to the affordability of medicine which is an equally sensitive issue here in the United States. This is special interest policy making at its worst. The Bush Administration is letting the pharmaceutical industry use trade agreements to manipulate the drug laws of the United States and other countries in ways that the industry could not otherwise achieve.
That is an absolute condemnation of the PBS being included in this trade agreement, and it is being condemned by the USA as well. There can be no other explanation. That says it all. The PBS is there so it can be manipulated by US multinational drug companies because they have consistently said they want Australians to pay higher prices for drugs. That is their agenda and that is why the Howard government simply rolled over and allowed the PBS to be included in trade policy. Mark Udall, another US congressman, said: 
I am concerned about the potential precedent of the Administration meddling excessively in the internal affairs of a trading partner. With regard to this treaty, the USTR initially sought substantial changes in Australia's drug-pricing program. Though the USTR was not completely successful, the agreement does give U.S. drug companies more say in what drugs are included under Australia's universal drug coverage program. While market access for U.S. goods is important, we shouldn't be in the business of bullying the world and potentially undermining a country's ability to provide prescription drugs to its citizens.
Again, US congressmen know the end result of including the PBS in this agreement. That is where we come to the difference between us. The only difference between the government and the Labor Party on the free trade agreement is that the Labor Party want to protect the PBS. We will stand by the PBS. We will ensure that Australians continue to get affordable medicines. We will protect the integrity of the PBS and this coalition government will not. The coalition government will not because they have been happy to include it in the trade agreement. They have not come clean with their true agenda and they have not addressed the issue of why the PBS is there in the first place. All they have done all the way through is play party politics with this. They are using their self-interest for political purposes to try to undermine this agreement. They have tried to wedge the Labor Party and they have accused this of being a political stunt. Let me be absolutely clear: this is no political stunt. This is an attempt by the Labor Party to ensure that the PBS remains intact for the purpose for which it was designed: to provide affordable medicines to Australians. We will not back off from that. We will force these amendments through and we will not move away from that position.
The reason we are in this position in the first place is that the government did not negotiate this agreement to its completion because it needed to rush it through. It needed to rush the negotiations to complete them in time to put it up as an election issue before the forthcoming election. It has been rushed through; it has not been negotiated satisfactorily. Quite frankly, the government has achieved only the most meagre of gains for Australia as a result of this agreement. It has been a serious problem. They have rushed it through for their political self-interest.
It was interesting that in one of the previous debates Senator Tierney tried to criticise the Labor Party for going into the committee process with a predetermined position. But Senator Brandis went into the select committee process with a predetermined position, because he had already stated that he supported the free trade agreement. The treaties committee process was likewise compromised, because the chair of that committee had already predetermined and put in writing that he supported the free trade agreement. Prior to even seeing the text of the free trade agreement, and prior to hearing any of the evidence, Senator Brandis and Dr Southcott were happy to make up their minds. And they made up their minds based on what? An agreement they had not seen, on this false hope that everything was going to be good. They were seduced by the word `free'. If coalition MPs can get something for nothing, they will try and grab it.
—The fact is that you should have done more work and you should have negotiated this to a more effective result. All through the debate we have heard your hollow criticisms. When Labor said that we wanted to evaluate the effects of this agreement based on the evidence before us, consider it and then come to a considered position, what did we hear from the government? They said: `How dare you do that. Just sign it. Listen to the Labor premiers.' I do not know how the Labor premiers came to their decision. I think it was probably a little bit of dumb luck, as it was for you guys. That is the position we are in. But now you need to listen to what the Labor premiers are saying. 
—You wanted us to listen to what the Labor premiers were saying. Every one of them now says: pass our amendments. They say this agreement should not go forward without the protection of the PBS. They want you, and urge you, to support our amendments. Eat your own words, Senator Brandis, because you were the one on many occasions saying: `Listen to the state premiers. Why don't you do what the state premiers say?' I throw that challenge back to you, Senator Brandis. Listen to what the state premiers say: support our amendment and protect the PBS. This is an opportunity for the government to actually do something that is right—to stand up for the Australian people and protect the PBS. You will still get your free trade agreement, as meagre as it is. You did not put enough work into it, but there are some very meagre benefits. We will support it on that basis. We could have done a lot better, and we should have done a lot better, but we will not undermine the PBS and nor should you.
I sense, looking at the press today, that there may be a bit of weakening in your position. I heard Mr Downer say, `Well, maybe we could consider some amendments; we might have a little look at it.' It is a little late coming, but you will have your opportunity to support our amendments. At the end of the day, even you will have to conclude that what we propose will protect the PBS. You will have to admit that your misleading statements, made through the whole process, that nothing in the free trade agreement would undermine the PBS were not true. If they were true, you would not have put it in the FTA. You buckled because the US wanted it in there and you just put it in there. Good public health policy being negotiated away through trade agreements is not something that the Labor Party will do. That is not something the Labor Party will stand for, and quite frankly the government ought to be condemned for doing so.
Throughout this year the Labor Party said, as we have always said, that we will judge the Howard government's trade agreement with the United States on the evidence and we will decide whether it is a net plus or a minus. That is why we referred it to a Senate select committee. Again, how many government members did we hear say that that was just a political stunt? The report was tabled today. Unfortunately, there only seems to be one copy of that report available to the opposition, which certainly gives me some concerns. Senator Brandis indicated that these were issues that were heavily contested. I think he went on to say that they were matters of great debate—these `heavily contested matters of great debate', where the government said it was simply a political stunt.
We then heard Senator Ferris, another government member on the committee, say there were four areas of serious concern that she wanted to address through the committee process. So, through their own mouths they say how important the committee process was, but we hear all the other government members saying what a political stunt it was. It just does not ring true. In this matter the government has simply put its own self-interest and its own political goals ahead of the national interest. If anyone has made this a political football, it has been the government from day one. Instead of allowing a proper, fair dinkum process that was going to analyse the benefits and the negatives from this agreement, it has wanted to politicise it all the way through. 
The other thing I want to cover is the concern that Labor has about the lack of economic modelling on jobs. It is something that I asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to do when we had a briefing with them as members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. DFAT indicated that they would do economic modelling on jobs. They would do so based on occupation, on sector and on regions. Ultimately, they did not do that. They refused to do it. That brings into play serious concerns. Understanding that there may be a negative impact on jobs, Labor will boost enterprise export growth in jobs in the Australian manufacturing sector through a manufacturing support package. We will provide a $25 million centre of excellence for advanced manufacturing in this country.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2004-08-05,"—Let there be no doubt about it: this is a historic debate. The free trade agreement with the United States is or will become perhaps one of the greatest achievements of the Howard government and, when this legislation passes—as I hope it will—this debate will come to be seen as perhaps the most important debate that the Senate has had during the 40th Parliament. What the free trade agreement represents is nothing less than this: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for access to the world's largest market and most dynamic economy. The achievement of the Australian negotiators, led by Mr Stephen Deady, in securing this agreement is a historic achievement which will underwrite the prosperity of this nation into the 21st century. For that reason—and you would not have thought it, having heard Senator Marshall's contribution a few minutes ago—we do have bipartisanship on the substance of this issue. Disregard this latest little political stunt that Mr Latham is playing to cover the backdown from his earlier positions—the Labor Party has given us bipartisanship on this issue. The two sides of politics which are capable of forming governments in this country—the coalition and the Australian Labor Party—are both of the view that the free trade agreement is a worthwhile agreement for Australia.
The point that must not be missed, when we listen to the meanderings of people like Senator Ridgeway and Senator Harris from the minor parties, is this: to the extent that there is a controversy, it is a controversy about the extent of the benefits. What a tremendous position to be in, that, where we have a controversy about this epoch-making trade treaty, the controversy is about the extent of the gains. That is the measure of the achievement of the government and of the negotiators who have secured this agreement. This tremendously beneficial agreement delivers conspicuous gains for Australia—not meagre gains, as Senator Marshall would have you believe, but gains like this: the gain, according to the government's modeller, the Centre for International Economics, of $6 billion a year from the start, which will increase with time; and the disappearance of 97 per cent of American tariffs on Australian manufactures from day one. That is not a meagre gain. 
The United States is the most protected economy in the industrialised world, the largest economy in the world, the biggest market in the world—and from day one, tariffs on 97 per cent of Australian manufactures go to zero. How is that a meagre gain? From day one, tariffs on two-thirds of agricultural exports to the United States go to zero, and tariffs on other sectors—in particular, the beef and the dairy sector—will reduce over time so that, at the outyears, the last tariffs go in 2016. And once they are gone, they are gone for good. For all generations to come, there will be no tariffs on manufactured goods and virtually no tariffs on agricultural goods. Every senator in this place knows in particular how protected the American agricultural sector is. So do not kid us, Senator Marshall, about meagre gains; these are real and substantial gains, as every single businessperson, every last businessperson, who appeared before the Senate select committee on the free trade agreement was eager to point out. 
Nevertheless, there have been the carping critics. They have been a bizarre coalition—a veritable political Noah's ark of industrial dinosaurs, pseudo-intellectuals, movie stars, ageing rock stars, footloose trendies, America haters, conspiracy theorists, old-fashioned socialists, right-wing Hansonites, left-wing Hansonites, Luddites, levellers and luvvies—a veritable political witches' brew. But none of them represents the mainstream of the Australian community, and not one of them represents the point of view of the people who will actually trade and take advantage of this agreement. Nevertheless, we did have the old line dished up to us by the inhabitants of the political Noah's ark. It reminded me of nothing more than the debates we had in the early 1980s, when the Hawke government did what the Fraser government should have done, I must say—that is, liberalise the Australian economy—a course of action which the Howard government has continued.
But I decided to go back a bit further into history, because, prior to the US free trade agreement, I think we would all accept that the most important trade agreement that this nation ever entered into was the trade treaty with Japan in 1957. That was the treaty that underwrote the Australia-Japan economic relationship. Japan, in every year since 1967, has been Australia's No. 1 export market. For most years since 1971, the volume of trade between Australia and Japan has been larger than the volume of trade between Australia and any other nation. And the treaty that underwrote that beneficial economic relationship was the great Australia-Japan trade treaty of 1957.
And do you know what? What did the Labor Party do in relation to that treaty? They opposed it tooth and nail. When the then Minister for Trade, Sir John McEwen, introduced the treaty into the House of Representatives on 27 August 1957 and moved that the House take note of the treaty, it was opposed for six days of debate by the Labor Party. If the Labor Party had had their way then, just like the Left if they had their way today with this free trade agreement, we would never have had that treaty. We would never have had the foundation of the economic and trading relationship that this country has enjoyed with Japan in all the half century since. Look at the remarks that were made in that debate by Dr Evatt.
—He was crazy!
—Senator McGauran, there are certain similarities between the late Dr Evatt and the current Leader of the Opposition, it must be said. Dr Evatt said the treaty would have a `detrimental, disastrous' effect upon Australian industry. He accused the Menzies government of `deliberately sacrificing the industry of this country'. He condemned the treaty for its lack of safeguards.
—Is this Latham or Evatt?
—This is Dr Evatt—Mr Latham's strikingly similar predecessor in the office of Leader of the Opposition, an office from which, like Dr Evatt, I am sure Mr Latham will never rise. Dr Evatt said:
I submit that the treaty should not be adopted. From an Australian point of view it is a thoroughly bad treaty. 
He also said that the safeguards were inadequate and that there had been inadequate consultation. Dr Evatt said:
 If the House accepts such an agreement, it, in effect, condones economic aggression—
by Japanese companies against the Australian work force. These are the very same lines that have been trotted out in relation to this free trade agreement. He said:
The treaty represents a serious danger to the Australian industry—
that sees the `the interests of Australian workers' particularly in the manufacturing industry being `prejudiced' by the `aggressive action' of Japanese capital. He said:
... it is against the interests of ordinary people and especially of the employees of Australia.
Dr Evatt was followed in that debate by the redoubtable Mr Eddie Ward. Mr Ward was even more virulent in his condemnation of the Japan trade treaty. He had this to say at the conclusion of a long tirade. He said in his speech to the House of Representatives on 5 September 1957:
... the Australian Labour Party is urging the rejection of this infamous document ...
	...	...	...
this criminal action against the Australian nation and the Australian people.
These are the very arguments, the very forebodings of economic disaster that we have heard lately from people on the Left and trendies wherever they happen to be on the political spectrum at any given time—you can never be sure. These are the same forebodings and doom-laden imprecations in almost the very same words that we have heard from sections of the Australian Labor Party in condemning the free trade agreement that we heard half a century ago explaining why the Japan treaty would be a disaster.
Now, fast forward 47 years to Melbourne on Monday, 7 June 2004 to the evidence of Mr Doug Cameron, the head of the AMWU, to the Senate inquiry on the free trade agreement.
—Doc Evatt's love child.
—The ghost of Dr Evatt; the ghost of Eddie Ward. Among other things he said that if the Australian government and the Australian parliament commit this country to the US free trade agreement they will be committing `economic treason'. That is almost word for word the same ignorant argument as was used half a century before. As Talleyrand once famously said of the Bourbons, so can we say of people like Mr Doug Cameron: `They have learnt nothing and they have forgotten nothing.' Today people like Mr Doug Cameron and the point of view he represents are about as relevant to our contemporary politics as would be a claimant to the Bourbon throne.
I have taken you at some length to that debate in 1957 because I want to remind the Senate that we have heard it all before—not only have we heard it all before but we have heard it in almost the same words before, two generations ago from the Luddites of the 1950s. If the Australian Labor Party had had their way in the 1950s, we would not have had the economically beneficial relationship with Japan that we now have. Perhaps in 50 years time somebody will reflect back on some of the extraordinary evidence given to the Senate committee and they will say, `They were wrong in 1957 and they were wrong in 2004 and they have learnt nothing since.' They have a mindset which is in its essentials hostile to the notion of free trade.
At least Senator Harris in his remarks yesterday was candid enough to say that the One Nation Party opposes free trade—those were his very words. But it is not just the One Nation Party; it is also the Luddites and the left-wing Hansonites of certain sections of the union movement—although not all of them and I should acknowledge, for example, the intelligent contribution made to this debate by Senator Ludwig's father, a very distinguished Queensland trade union leader, and many other more sensible members of the trade union movement. 
I mentioned before Mr Doug Cameron as a kind of poster child of this retro ignorance. But my very poor view of Mr Doug Cameron is not one that I hold alone. This is what Mr Mark Latham said about Mr Doug Cameron and his agenda in an article he published in the Australian Financial Review a few years ago. Mr Mark Latham wrote this:
The key to neo-protectionists like Cameron ... is to decode their message. Having lost the Cold War, they are now using the bogy word “globalisation” to launch a new campaign against capitalism.
	...	...	...
Given a choice between two Scotsmen ... follow Adam Smith, not Doug Cameron ...
—Who was that again?
—That was Mr Mark Latham, writing a few years ago, Senator McGauran. Yes, the same Mr Mark Latham who is now playing chicken with this trade treaty, trying to pull a political stunt, but who nevertheless, it must be said, has given his sanction to bipartisanship on this issue.
Madam Acting Deputy President, we have heard from many senators about the benefits of the treaty. Let me recite, for example, the benefits to my own state of Queensland—the Premier of which has been one of the most eloquent, unambiguous advocates of the adoption of the US free trade agreement. The state of Queensland, which is a mineral-exporting state and an agricultural-exporting state, will benefit enormously from this treaty—from the elimination, for example, of tariffs on the produce of the mining industry. Queensland exports to the United States almost $1 billion worth of beef, $88 million worth of aluminium, $41 million worth of lamb, $33.7 million worth of ships and boats and $24.9 million worth of medicines. My state, like every state in this Commonwealth, will be a huge beneficiary of this agreement. Yet there are still some—the unenlightened, the Hansonites, the Luddites, the trade union leaders like Mr Doug Cameron—who would deny this to the Australian people.
We heard evidence from a variety of witnesses at the Senate committee hearings. We heard evidence from a number of critics of the agreement. We heard the evidence of distinguished economists like Professor Ross Garnaut, who was a critic of the agreement but largely a critic of the process. Professor Garnaut did not say that the agreement was a bad thing for Australia. He advocated the view, which many in this chamber share, that multilateral trade treaties are better than bilateral trade treaties. That may well be so but not even Professor Garnaut was prepared to go so far as to say that it is a zero sum game, that bilateral trade treaties and multilateral trade treaties cannot sit together. Witnesses like Professor Garnaut deserved to be heard with respect, and they were and their evidence was carefully considered.
But I have to say that we also heard evidence from certain witnesses whose critique of the free trade agreement was based, once you scratched the surface, on a visceral, hostile anti-Americanism. No evidence was more so than that of two Sydney academics, Professor Weiss from the University of Sydney and Dr Thurbon from the University of New South Wales. These two commentators, representing themselves as experts in the politics of international economic relations, gave the Senate committee an undistinguished performance and presented a submission which, dressed up as a piece of scholarship, was unadorned by a single scholarly reference and was revealed within a moment to be nothing more than a flimsy polemic. They warned of a new era of economic serfdom. They said that the treaty was anti-Australian, and they gave evidence which revealed that their claimed credentials as experts were nothing more than camouflage for an ideological polemical rant. 
The same, I am sorry to say, must be said of a gentleman who has been responsible for much of the misinformation about the effect on the PBS of this treaty, Dr Thomas Faunce. In his evidence to the Senate committee on 21 June he demanded that Australia stand up for human rights and not allow itself to become America's poodle. That was the degree of scholarly objectivity and calm, mature consideration that Dr Faunce gave to the treaty. But let me finish by quoting the evidence of a true expert, Australia's former Ambassador to the GATT, Mr Alan Oxley. He said on 5 May:
You asked, Chair, what would be the downside for Australia if we rejected the agreement. We would probably be regarded as the most bizarre country in the world ... I honestly do not know how any serious Australian government could justify—
rejection of this agreement to its people or—
to the world at large.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. For the record, I think it is appropriate to point that it was not `Madam Acting Deputy President' in that instance. I think you would be appreciative of the fact that it was `Mr Acting Deputy President'. While we are at it, in the interests of intellectual rigour, I also point out that the French dynasty is not pronounced `Burbons' but actually `Borbons'.
 (Senator Chapman)—There is no point of order.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION (CUSTOMS TARIFF) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-08-05,"—A number of concerns about the effect of the free trade agreement were placed by various people before the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America. They included concerns about the economic, cultural and employment risks that may flow. It is difficult to accurately assess the beneficial and negative consequences of the agreement. I suppose the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, and I guess it is the responsibility of the government of the day to fully assess the costs and benefits to Australia generally.
I want to raise a couple of matters: one is to do with treaties and how the parliament is not able to deal effectively with treaties and the other is about intellectual property. I have had a great concern for most of my 29 years here in the Senate about the process whereby governments commit Australia to international agreements and treaties. Indeed, as far back as 1983 I gave notice to the Senate, through a notice of motion, about appointing a standing committee of the Senate—to be known as the Senate Standing Committee on Treaties—to consider all treaties put before the Senate. That was in 1983. It was not until 1996 that this actually happened in response to the Senate committee report Trick or Treaty?
I should acknowledge that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties reported on the Australia-US free trade agreement in June. But I am still concerned about the process by which these international agreements are arranged. I agree with the Senate committee that there is a lack of transparency and involvement of parliament in this process, as we only get involved after the deal has been done. It becomes in effect a take it or leave it situation. I do not think that is proper parliamentary accountability. I will be interested to hear the government's response on that matter but also on intellectual property. 
Patents have been an issue of concern to me for many years. Other senators more recently have expressed concern, for example, at the push for genes and gene sequences to be patentable. One of my concerns was whether the FTA would impact on section 18(2) of the Patents Act, which says:
Human beings, and the biological processes for their generation, are not patentable inventions.
I will be asking the government about this matter during the committee stage. In a recent estimates committee I did raise the matter and was informed in writing as follows:
The proposed free trade agreement with the United States does not affect section 18(2) of the Patents Act 1990. Article 17.9.2 of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement allows Australia to exclude inventions from patentability where necessary to protect public order or morality, including human, animal or plant life. Section 18(2) of the Patents Act falls within this allowable exclusion.
That is some reassurance, but I note again the general concern that the widespread changes introduced by the FTA may have unintended or unanticipated consequences.
In an estimates committee hearing last year, I raised with IP Australia the issue of the patentability of human beings, the biological processes for their generation, the issue of human embryonic stem cells and whether they are patentable. An article in the Journal of Law and Medicine headed `The attack of the clones: patent law and stem cell research' by Dr Matthew Rimmer states:
... there is a fundamental ambiguity in the Patents Act 1990 ... as to whether stem cell research is patentable subject matter. There is a need to revise the legislation in light of the establishment of the National Stem Cell Centre and the passing of the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002 ...
Given the very strong push for commercialisation of all research, which will be bolstered by the FTA, I imagine there will be pressure from the United States for the patentability of human embryonic stem cells or material derived from these cells. It goes to the very heart of human nature and the dignity of each individual human being. I need to have answers about those matters when we come to the committee stage of the debate.
IP Australia advised last year that it remains unclear exactly what inventions would be excluded from patentability by section 18(2) of the Patents Act. The minister should come clean with all of this. I will be asking the minister to explain to me what effect the free trade agreement would have on the patentability of human embryonic stem cells. I do not want any of the `it's commercial-in-confidence' business that we were faced with in the estimates committee. This stem cell centre, which is a private company, has been given about $100 million of taxpayers' money, and a significant amount of that is for experimentation on human embryos. 
I note that Dr Philippa Dee's report to the Senate select committee estimated that Australia could end up paying 25 per cent more per year in net royalty payments. What is the benefit to the Australian community from a closer harmonisation of intellectual property laws between Australia and the US when that will result in longer patent times and higher costs for Australians? I should also say that, while patents and copyright are important to help to pay patent and copyright holders for the important development costs, risks and talent, the FTA appears to take on many of the excesses of US patent and copyright law.
Patents or copyright, in effect, give a person a monopoly over a particular idea or process. In this sense, it is ironic that apparently we are awarding longer monopolies and more stringent systems of fines in a free trade agreement. For example, I understand that US copyright for an author was recently extended from the life of the author plus 50 years to the life of the author plus 70 years. That seems excessive to me—it is obviously of little assistance to the author. Are we to have that in Australia too? If we are serious about a competitive economy, why would we be increasing these monopolies and the associated costs of licence fees and administration?  
The United States is often seen as the exemplar of free trade and competition but, under their more expensive intellectual property restrictions, we are in fact being persuaded to pay them more royalties for no real return. It is in the interests of the US to persuade the rest of the world to keep paying them licence fees and royalties in perpetuity for copying, viewing, listening or whatever, but it is not in our interests.
In principle, I am in favour of free trade as long as Australia does not lose out, but the intellectual property parts of this agreement seem to be taking us to a more restricted, less competitive and more expensive environment. I am also concerned about how much of the US intellectual property system we have to take on as part of the FTA. Do we have to accept the validity of all US patents and apply them in Australia? Will we have to extend or change Australian IP laws every time the US Congress changes US laws in this area?
I am also concerned about the effect of the freer access of US capital to Australian markets. Will this lead to a further increase in Australian housing prices, making it even more difficult for Australians to afford a home? Would it mean that privatised utilities—the basic infrastructure of Australia—such as water and electricity et cetera are sold off over time to United States interests? These are very important questions that need to be dealt with thoroughly by the government in the committee stage of the debate. Again, I acknowledge that I am generally in favour of free trade so long as there is no concern remaining about the effects of the measures that I have mentioned. Again, I look forward to the committee stage and the full answers to be provided by the minister at that time.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION (CUSTOMS TARIFF) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-08-05,"—I acknowledge that I have already contributed to the second reading debate but I want to make some comments in respect of a second reading amendment circulated by Senator Nettle on behalf of the Australian Greens. I understand the rules allow for those senators who have spoken before circulation of such amendments to make further comments. In that context I want to say on behalf of the Australian Democrats that we will support the Australian Greens second reading amendment but note that, unfortunately, this is not going to make the free trade agreement any better. In many respects I think the damage has already been done and no amount of further study is really going to change our minds. We have seen enough to know that, on balance, it is going to do real harm to our national interest and therefore cannot be supported.
For the record, I note that the Democrats sought to compel the government to do exactly this type of review way back in March this year. You might recall that we successfully moved a motion in the Senate noting that under US trade law, before any agreement can be ratified, a thorough environmental impact assessment must be done to review the extent to which positive and negative environmental impacts may flow from economic changes estimated to result from any prospective agreement. On that occasion our motion called on the government to conduct a full public analysis of the environmental, social and cultural impact of the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America and, in line with the way the government was conducting their assessment of whether or not it would be in Australia's interest to require the consultants that had been engaged—I think the Centre for International Economics or others as the case may have been—not only to conduct a proper analysis of the other issues that needed to be considered but to table the reports of those reviews in parliament for its consideration. The Senate did agree to that motion. Unfortunately, the government would not listen. 
We already know that the agreement is not in Australia's interest and will have a disastrous effect on social, cultural and environmental outcomes—most of all because that analysis has not been done. Quite frankly, whilst our laws are somewhat relaxed or even deficient in addressing these issues, I think that any trade agreement with any nation in the context of any national interest assessment should look beyond the economic bottom line to also include social, cultural and environmental outcomes.
Those issues are particularly important given that, through this sort of arrangement, we open ourselves to a range of pressures and influences from the United States. For example, whilst the government gives some assurances, it may be under pressure to change some of our laws in the future. I do not believe that the Australian Democrats would want that to happen. Certainly, I do not believe anyone in this place would want to go down that path. We will be supporting the second reading amendment although, as I said, it has little effect other than to make the point that the analysis of the free trade agreement is deficient. Obviously, there should have been public input into the environmental impact assessment and it should have been one which looked at what the real and likely outcomes were going to be. 
At the time the motion was brought on I recall also having asked a direct question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, on this particular matter. The response from government was that these were things that were going to be difficult to quantify in any form whatsoever. It seems to me that if the Americans can do it, and it is a requirement of the national interest assessment process there, then there is no reason why we ought to use the excuse that it cannot be done. It simply must be done. I would hope that, if nothing else, this agreement will provide an opportunity for us to fix our laws not just on the question, as Senator Harradine has rightly said, of the role of parliament in ratifying treaties but, more particularly, on trade agreements. It is one matter where I think the Democrats have been hard on the trail for quite some time. Obviously, we see it in a much broader way. The US Congress follows that path. The Congress decides, as a result of the instructions that are given by the US President on any trade agreements with any country, and so it should in this case as well.
The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Australian Greens second reading amendment. Again, we do not see the reason for it because the agreement itself is fatally flawed and it will have a negative impact, I think, in the short, medium and long term.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION (CUSTOMS TARIFF) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I rise to speak on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. The Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America has attracted, as you would expect, significant attention. There have been two significant reports by parliament on this matter. The first report was report No. 61 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties titled Australia-United States, Free Trade Agreement. The second report—the Final Report on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America—was tabled today by the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America. The summary of the report was made available on the web site on Monday. Obviously, on close scrutiny, there has been a bit more work done since then.  
I listened carefully to Senator Brandis's speech and I agree with him on one point—which I do not often do—that it is a historic period that we are entering in relation to this agreement. This agreement is a living document. It will continue past my life and his, I suspect, and the life of the 40th Parliament. It will, in my view, create an environment of allowing trade and growth and productivity for Australia.   
A couple of issues hanging in the balance at the moment and exercising the minds of Senator Brandis and others relate to the two amendments Labor has proposed. Senator Brandis says that $6 billion worth of additional benefits may flow from the trade agreement, whereas we say, based on our commissioned report into the area, that perhaps there will be a marginal gain. If one takes the view of Senator Brandis, it is difficult to understand why the government cannot pick up Labor's two amendments. The government has indicated clearly that it can accept the amendment relating to local content and I already detect in the media today some back-pedalling by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson, and Mr Downer on the strong stance they took earlier in the week on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 
This may be a bit predictive, and perhaps not quite in order, but I think that by question time today in the House or perhaps by early next week we will witness a significant movement by the government on the PBS issue. I cannot understand why the government would put in jeopardy such a historic agreement on issues that do require protection, such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I think the government will come to the conclusion, as we have, that you can have both—you can protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and you can have the free trade agreement. That goes without saying.
What Labor has said—both Mr Mark Latham and Senator Stephen Conroy—is that we will assess the Howard government's trade agreement with the US and ascribe to it a plus or minus: is it a plus or a minus for Australia? The agreement does not come into force until next year. We are now debating the enabling legislation, two bills that will give effect to the free trade agreement and allow Australia to meet its obligations under the trade treaty in Australian domestic law. 
The Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America in its final report came to the conclusion that on balance it was in Australia's interest to support the free trade agreement. Mr Latham and Senator Conroy said that they would take into consideration the conclusions of the Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States. We are now at the juncture where, whether the gain for Australia from the free trade agreement be small, as indicated in the majority report, or whether it be enormous, as Senator Brandis believes, we can say without a doubt that there is a benefit to Australia. Therefore, the free trade agreement is an agreement which we should support. It marks the beginning of an important part of our history. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I direct my question to Senator Hill, representing the Prime Minister.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-08-05,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, given that you have said that it may have been because of pressure of business, would you concede though, given the other elements contained in the Flood report, that an annual review of these classified documents on a whole-of-government basis is desirable? Will you seek at least an answer from the Prime Minister as to whether the future practice will always be to have these agency reports reviewed?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>National Security: Annual Reports</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,question
"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2004-08-05,"—This was a matter raised by Mr Flood in his recent report—as I recall it, he made the assertion that on two occasions the reports were not considered on a whole-of-government basis—and I therefore assume that that is accurate. The reports of agencies are made to the individual ministers with responsibility for those agencies. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the reports were noted by the appropriate ministers, those with specific responsibility. In relation to the whole-of-government consideration, I think the point is that ONA has some responsibility under its charter to draw together the various agencies and present that on a whole-of-government basis. I think that it did not occur on these occasions simply because of the pressure of other business.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-08-05,"—I think part of the emphasis of the Flood report was in fact that ONA should play a greater national coordinating and leadership role as the senior intelligence assessment body. I certainly accept that in principle. Whether much additional value is gained through ONA then bringing its view on the totality of the reports to whole-of-government assessment through NSC is, I think, a debating point. I certainly cannot see any downside in it and, as it is ONA's responsibility, as I understand it now, it clearly should occur. I am sure that as a result of the Flood investigation drawing to the government's attention that it has not occurred on two occasions it will not reoccur.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>National Security: Annual Reports</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,answer
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2004-08-05,"—Yesterday Senator Faulkner asked me a question in relation to performance enhancing drugs in sport. I undertook to get some further information in relation to the question and I now seek leave to incorporate that information.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
1.	Can the minister confirm that changes to the Customs regulations introduced in August 1999 removed all impediments to Customs notifying the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Sports Drug Agency of anyone caught importing performance enhancing drugs?
Answer:
The changes to laws completed in November 1999 involved changes to regulation under the Customs Administration Act 1985, and also to legislation governing ASDA and ASC. This technically allowed Customs to pass information to these agencies, but there also needed to be protocols developed by the three agencies to define the nature of the information to be provided and the processes for securely passing information. These protocols were completed in February 2000.
2.	Can the minister now explain why this process has not been followed and why the Australian Customs Service has not notified the ASC and ASDA in all cases as expected under Customs law?
Answer:
Since the protocol was in place, the process has been followed in all instances where Customs had sufficient information to identify a sports-related importation..
3.	On how many occasions since 1999 has Customs intercepted suspected prohibited performance enhancing drugs and not passed the information to the relevant Commonwealth authorities?
Answer:
Customs has made a total of 5140 detections of Image and Performance Enhancing Drugs (PIEDs) since 2000/01. The overwhelming majority of these did not relate to sports persons. Customs has made 25 referrals to ASC and ASDA under the legislation and protocols.
4.	On how many occasions has Customs intercepted importations of these materials and no follow-up action has occurred—either legal action by Customs or breach action by the Australian Sports Commission?
Answer:
Customs investigates and prosecutes taking into account such things as the strength of the evidence, the intent of the offender, the seriousness of the offence and the public interest. It would not be reasonable for Customs to prosecute in many PIED cases. Customs has investigated 1017 cases of PIEDs importation since the beginning of calendar year 2000. As noted earlier, the vast majority did not relate to sports persons. The ASC would have to provide the number of instances of breach action. 
5.	Is the minister aware of a recent case regarding an Olympian where breach action was initiated more than five years after the interception by Customs? Is he also aware that this action could not progress in the Court of Arbitration for Sport because proper analysis and identification could not be undertaken on the suspect material as Customs had destroyed the material shortly after the interception?
Answer
I take it the referral is to a case brought against Mr Eadie in the Court for Arbitration in Sport. The case against Mr Sean Eadie was not a prosecution for drug trafficking, but a hearing to determine his suitability to be a member of the Olympic team. All the information Customs had—including the facts on the goods in question—was provided to ASDA and ASC before they commenced action against Mr Eadie.
In this case, Customs carried out procedures that applied five years ago in dealing with two shipments of prohibited imports (PIs) intercepted in the mail. One shipment was returned to the sender at the request of the addressee, who told Customs he had not ordered the goods. The other shipment was destroyed following notification by Customs to the addressee to which no reply was made.
Customs does not—and cannot—retain all the material for all detections of PIs indefinitely. PIs are generally transferred to Customs Stores until the claims for them, legal action or other proceedings are resolved. If there is no claim or no action, the goods are disposed of in accordance with the Customs Act. All actions, including disposals, are recorded and audited.
Customs Stores receive in excess of a thousand consignments a month. A consignment can comprise one or some hundreds (in some cases, thousands) of items. Such substantial quantities impose a significant workload and storage requirement with an attendant cost to the taxpayer. Destruction ensures that costs are managed.
6.	Is the Minister for Justice and Customs satisfied with these actions of the Customs Service in the fight against drugs in sport? If not, what actions has he ordered Customs to take?
Answer:
I am fully satisfied with the actions of the Customs Service in the fight against drugs in sport. No other Customs service in the world provides this level of support to the fight against drugs in sport. However, it needs to be borne in mind that importations are only means to detect athletes who may be using prohibited sports substances.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Australian Customs Service</title>,Questions Without Notice,15,1,speech

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
Perhaps I should say `non-explanation'. This morning—about mid-morning, I think it was—as I always do before moving that the Senate take note of unanswered questions, I advised the minister's office that I would be asking for reasons as to why these questions have not been answered. I would have suspected that by now the minister would have a reasonable explanation, but it seems not. Question No. 3015 is a very important one. It relates to a study being done at present, the Australian longitudinal study on women's health. That study indicated that partial incontinence affects 13 per cent of young women and more than a third of middle-aged and older women. Risk factors for incontinence severity include heavy smoking in young women, hysterectomy in middle-aged women, use of hormone replacement therapy in older women and being overweight in all three age groups. I asked the minister what measures were being put in place by the government to warn women about these risk factors. 
I would have thought it would be relatively easy for the government to at least answer the first question because this week is Continence Awareness Week. In fact, on the government's own web site is an initiative, paid for by the government, which encourages people to talk to their doctor, nurse continence advisers or physiotherapists. One of the reasons I asked this question is that the majority of women do not seek help. There are 1.8 million women in this country who have some degree of incontinence. It is a much smaller number for men—in fact, only 216,000. 
There is also a helpline. The minister could have explained that here were some of the efforts that the government was making in this respect. We also know that the awareness week initiative and the helpline encourage women—in fact, anyone with incontinence—to seek a doctor's assistance, but doctors have been found to be very reluctant in dealing with incontinence and unenthusiastic about treatment such as pelvic floor exercises. My purpose in asking this question was to draw attention to the predominance of women in this category and the need for government to act on the risk factors and, particularly, to warn women about those risk factors.
I asked: what, if any, economic analysis had been done of the potential health services and aged care savings that might be achieved by reducing the incontinence rate through prevention? We know that somewhere between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of all of those in nursing homes are incontinent. It is a mistake to assume that incontinence is related to age or is not treatable. In fact, it is. A great deal could be done to encourage women, in particular, but also men to deal with incontinence in their lives.
Another point that needs to be made concerns the causal relationship between caesarean section and the need for hysterectomy in later life. I asked: what efforts were being made to reduce the rates of caesarean section in childbirth—particularly in the private hospital sector, where we know there are far higher rates of caesarean section—and draw attention to the fact that very few women are warned about this situation? Very few women are warned that, if they have their baby in a private hospital, the chances are greater that they will have a caesarean section, and so it is with a hysterectomy. I think very few women are warned about this situation when they undergo surgery—not that they undergo it for trivial reasons—but these matters are very important to women.
—Senator Hill does not seem to think so but, believe me, they are. 
—I think you are unfairly attacking the medical profession. What is your basis for saying that?
—I am pointing to some very clear statistics. In fact, had the Minister for Health and Ageing paid attention to this question—and I will give Minister Patterson a copy of this document as well—he would know that there are quite clear statistics which show that the rates of caesarean section are greater in the private hospital system and that there is a causal relationship between caesarean section and the need for a hysterectomy. It is clearly shown in the statistics. I will acquaint your office with them, Senator Patterson, if you doubt them. The Minister for Health and Ageing did have the opportunity to answer those questions. If I am wrong, I will stand corrected. I would be very happy if there were a sensible explanation for those statistics. I think it is important that we take care of women's health, and that is why I asked these questions. I want to know why it is that the government is so casual about answering questions like these. There is now an increasing understanding that there is a link between incontinence—particularly in the elderly—and anxiety and depression. I would like to know what measures the federal government is taking in that regard. There is a range of very good and very important questions there.  
There is also a question I have not yet mentioned about current negotiations which have been going on for months on end into the public health outcomes funding agreement—the so-called PHOFA review, or rather the review that was conducted but has not yet been finalised. No doubt the report is still sitting on some minister's desk somewhere, joining all the others. There is no explicit reference in the National Women's Health Program—in the draft PHOFAs between the federal and state governments—to a number of the programs that were previously there. I think we are entitled to know why that is, and that is what my question goes to.
I have a very long list of questions that have not been answered by this government. I am a patient person, I am happy to accept that some of those questions might be difficult to answer, but the habit of this government, the arrogance of this government in ignoring questions—sometimes for years on end—needs to be drawn attention to. If everyone in this place stood up and complained at the end of question time that their questions had not been answered—and I would encourage other senators to do that—maybe we would get some action. But the minister needs to be warned that I will keep raising these problems until we have answers to those questions. I am going to keep coming in here after question time and using up the time of the Senate in this way. I think it is important. We deserve to have answers to significant questions. Quite frankly, it is pretty pathetic of the minister to come in here today, having been warned that I would be asking these questions, and not have the faintest idea why they have not been answered.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Arts and Sport (Senator Kemp) to questions without notice asked today.
We received some very disappointing responses from Senator Kemp this week. The sloppy handling of the investigations into the alleged use of banned substances by cyclists at the AIS and the obfuscation in relation to evidence that has come to light recently have made a mockery of the claim by the Minister for the Arts and Sport that the Howard government is `getting tough on drugs in sport'. In fact, his appalling responses in question time this week reinforce the level of farce. The minister said that, if people do not abide by the rules, they will be caught. These words ring very hollow, considering the minister's failure to order an immediate and thorough investigation into the allegation of doping practices at the AIS's Del Monte residence. The minister yesterday attempted to pass the buck by implying that investigations into those allegations had not been made easier by the disclosure of information contained in the investigation reports. The truth is that if the so-called evidence had not been questioned by people concerned by the government's total lack of interest in catching those who do not abide by the rules, then some of the people who attempted to cheat the system would never have been caught. That is the truth. We have watched the minister as he has allowed this matter to bumble along for eight long months. Five separate investigations have failed to produce an acceptable resolution, and half a tabled report and unanswered questions regarding the securing of computer evidence and DNA testing raise the spectre that there is something more to it than we are being told. 
We now face the situation where serious questions have been raised regarding the thoroughness and independence of investigations into a number of doping allegations. At best these investigations have been lacklustre and shoddy and at worst they indicate weak and timid acquiescence by the minister to allow these allegations to be swept under the carpet. The clumsiness and inconsistency with which the minister and the Australian Sports Commission have handled these investigations, and the spectre of cover-ups that has been raised as a result, have undeniably tarnished Australia's reputation as a world leader in the fight against drugs in sport. Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Australian Sports Commission, said that the findings regarding the use of banned substances by Australian cyclists were very serious. World Anti-Doping Agency head, Dick Pound, has slammed the government's handling of this matter by stating:
The rest of the world is going to say, `How it is that Australia deals with all these things in secret?'
The mishandling of this investigation, which should have been dealt with immediately and decisively last year, has left Australian cyclists in the precarious position where, with just a little over a week to the Athens Olympics, the final make-up of the cycling team is still under question due to outstanding appeals. So athletes are still not certain whether they will be competing at the Olympics and Australia's standing as a world antidoping leader has been called into question—all this under the watch of the Howard government. It is time for Senator Kemp to come clean or move on. To do neither will only further tarnish what was, under the previous Labor government, a strong reputation for being tough on drugs in sport. 
The one positive thing in this whole affair is that it has established without question the need for a totally independent and wholly credible investigative and prosecutorial body which can comprehensively and without bias assess cases relating to allegations of improper use of banned substances in sport. A Latham Labor government has given its commitment to immediately establish a sports doping ombudsman who is empowered to receive and investigate allegations of doping practices within, and impacting on, sport. When will the minister finally admit that the current in-house practices regarding the investigations of sport doping cases are totally inadequate and do something decisive to change them before time runs out?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2004-08-05,"—It shows when someone comes into this chamber and reads a speech. Every word of the speech by Senator Lundy was read—regardless of the answers given in question time today. I looked very closely at Senator Lundy. Senator Lundy had written down `lacklustre and shoddy', regardless of the answers to the questions. The questions were answered very comprehensively and effectively, I thought. The speech was all written down, given to Senator Lundy and she read it.  
Senator Lundy knows very little about what has happened here. Her remarks show that. Senator Lundy will be aware that initially the allegations that were made were tested in the independent report by Justin Stanwix. Allegations were made about unnamed athletes and we had the first independent report by Justin Stanwix. The second report—the Robert Anderson report—grew out of allegations made at the end of May. So this nonsense that Senator Lundy goes on about—seven months—is absolutely disgraceful. 
—Why did you cover it up?
—Mr Deputy President, I listened to Senator Lundy in quiet, and I think I am entitled to the same sort of respect. When you question Senator Lundy on fact, she always gets very defensive. Let me get this clear. Five athletes were named at the end of May in a hearing before CAS. As a result of the naming of those athletes, another investigation, by Robert Anderson, was put in train. A former Australian Supreme Court justice and much respected Australian jurist, Robert Anderson QC, was asked to conduct an inquiry. 
—Why did you cover it up?
—There was no cover-up. Robert Anderson is a man of outstanding repute, a man who everyone agrees is an eminent jurist. Robert Anderson produced his report, and that report has been tabled in this parliament. There is no cover-up. That is complete, absolute nonsense. In fact, the report is available. The report has been made public, and Senator Lundy goes around talking about a cover-up. 
—You covered it up from December. 
—Senator Lundy, you have had your shot. Give Senator Kemp his chance. 
—Exactly. When we question Senator Lundy's grasp of the detail, we always get this semi-hysterical attack. Senator Lundy, it is not seven months. Get this clear—
—Senator Kemp, you will assist the debate not by addressing other senators in the chamber, but by addressing the chair.
—The point I am making is that the investigations were not `lacklustre and shoddy'. We have had an independent inquiry by Justin Stanwix into allegations about unnamed athletes, and action was taken in relation to that. Then, when five athletes were named at the end of May, another investigation was put in train. So much for Senator Lundy's comments about delay. Where is the cover-up? The `cover-up', apparently, Senator Lundy, is that a very effective and respected jurist is asked to conduct an investigation, that investigation is conducted, and the report is tabled. Yet Senator Lundy parrots, time after time, `Cover-up! Cover-up! Cover-up!' 
Senator Lundy went on to make a number of other statements which I will cover. Of course, when mud is thrown, as I pointed out to Senator Faulkner, some of it sticks. There is no question that some very strong statements were made in this parliament by Senator Faulkner. Senator Faulkner has just come into this debate—presumably to help salvage something from Senator Lundy's performance. Robert Anderson, in his report, commenting on the issue involving up to six athletes in a shooting gallery, said, `Those paragraphs have been widely understood and stated in parliament and reported in the media to the great personal prejudice of the athletes concerned.' That is what was said in the Anderson report.  
The time has come, in my view, for Senator Faulkner to recognise that the allegations thrown around in this chamber by Senator Lundy and Senator Faulkner inevitably do damage. They are made not because the Labor Party is seeking the political truth but because it is seeking to make political points, regardless of the damage that is done to the Australian sports system and to the reputations of some athletes. I think it is a pretty disgraceful performance. There is no cover-up.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-08-05,"—Today in this chamber we have had proof positive of the utter incapacity of Australia's Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp. He still cannot answer simple questions on what has happened in relation to the biggest scandal we have seen about drugs in sport in this country for at least a decade, if not longer. All this has occurred under Senator Kemp's stewardship. He cannot give a clear account of the responsibilities and the role played by the Australian Sports Commission and the AIS in this scandal. These are Commonwealth agencies in Senator Kemp's portfolio; they are under his stewardship. 
Let us be clear about one thing: a scandal has been brewing in the AIS cycling program since December last year, and Senator Kemp has been utterly incapable of cleaning it up. He did absolutely nothing until the federal opposition, the Labor Party, held the Howard government and Senator Kemp accountable for these matters in this chamber. Instead, what has he been doing? He has either consciously or through absolute ignorance been a party to an attempted cover-up of this scandal, and he stands condemned for it.
This cover-up has failed because enough people in Australian sport could not stomach the stench of drugs, which has been fostered by the incompetence of Senator Kemp, Australia's minister for sport. People could not stomach it in sport. And the opposition insists, as always, in holding Senator Kemp and the Howard government accountable. Senator Kemp knows—many people know—how incompetent he is. The actions of the Prime Minister, his ministerial colleagues and the public servants clearly demonstrate that his many failures in relation to this scandal are obvious. 
Senator Kemp should have done the right thing and developed some backbone and cleaned up this mess before now, before the eve of the Olympics, which is what the Labor Party wanted. This mess is staining Australia's sport, and I hold Senator Kemp completely and fully responsible for it. He knows that he has to demand a comprehensive account of the responsibilities of his agencies. He needs to come clean with the public, and he needs to impose changes on reluctant agencies so this can never happen again.
Senator Kemp should certainly know by now that the solution lies in the establishment, albeit belated, of a truly independent and credible investigation. We need a truly credible investigation, a hearing and a prosecution process for allegations about drugs in sport in this country. It is in the hands of the minister to finally direct all agencies to properly and thoroughly investigate all evidence relating to the use of drugs in the AIS cycling program, with a duty of care to those young cyclists in that program. In my view and in the opposition's view, that duty of care ought to be the guiding principle. 
All evidence, all possible sources of information or identification of those that have been involved in wrongdoing—and I refer to all DNA analysis which has finally been undertaken eight months after the discovery—should have been taken eight months ago, back in December last year. Analysis of computers, DNA analysis, payment records, credit card records and Internet ordering patterns should have been done and insisted on by this incompetent and hopeless minister eight months ago. But now we have him embarrassing Australia and Australian sport on the eve of the Olympics.  
Do not listen to this nonsense about false claims being made. We know about the direct evidence of French; we know about the admissions of self-injection by Shane Kelly; we know about the admissions of self-injection in Europe by Graeme Brown; we know about admissions of self-injection by Brett Lancaster; we know about the untruthful denials by Jobie Dajka, we know about the two different sets of DNA in the sharps bucket; we know about the purchase of Testicomp in Germany; and we know this incompetent minister should go.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2004-08-05,"—That was an incredible tirade against the Minister for the Arts and Sport. It was an outrageous tirade about his administration of the sports portfolio. I have two words to say in response to that tirade: Ros Kelly. If we are talking about cover-up, about rorting, about maladministration and about sports ministers, the words `Ros Kelly' come to mind immediately. There is no amnesia on the part of our sports minister. There are no claims that he was merely relying on a whiteboard for inspiration. 
There have been a series of allegations made about the cyclists. Independent processes have been put in place and are being followed. The matters are still being examined; action has been taken. What is the outrage here? That we should not follow due process? That we should smear the reputations of cyclists? That is Labor's typical approach. `What did you know, when did you find out, what did you do and who did you tell?'—it is the same approach across every single portfolio. The Sports Commission, the Australian Cycling Federation and the Australian Olympic Committee acted quickly in relation to Mr Dajka. The information was presented to them. They acted quickly; they took decisive action.
What we need to keep in mind here is the reputation of our athletes. We need to protect the reputation of our cyclists and the Australian Olympic team. Using phrases like `shooting galleries' might be good to get you on the front page of the tabloids but it maligns an entire team. If the Labor Party are genuinely interested in getting to the bottom of these matters, if they are genuinely interested in protecting the reputations of our sportsmen and sportswomen, they will not use terms like `shooting gallery' to malign an entire team. 
On this side of the chamber we want to support our athletes. We think the reputations of our athletes should be protected. We do not think their reputation should be dragged through the mud. Allegations have been made, processes have been put in place, investigations are being undertaken and action is being taken. Senator Kemp has been very up-front, very transparent. Senator Kemp has said that the government will look at the idea of an independent investigatory agency. This was a proposal recommended in 1990 when Labor were in office. Senator Faulkner was sports minister around 1993. What happened? Nothing. We are looking at the proposal. So those on the other side of the chamber are in no position to allege a cover-up or failure of action.
I would just like to quote Dr Pipe, who commented that Australia is seen as a nation that takes doping very seriously. He said:
People around the world are not surprised that doping incidents come to the fore in Australia, given this is a country that takes both sports seriously and takes anti-doping activities very seriously indeed. 
Dr Pipe, FINA's Doping Control Review Board Chairman, recognises that we take doping seriously and we take sport seriously. The Anderson inquiry, which Senator Kemp referred to, being conducted by a retired jurist, is ongoing. Mr Anderson has agreed to continue his investigation, including consideration of the issues concerning computers at the AIS Del Monte campus and any other scientific or other information that may come to hand. Mr Anderson is also proceeding with the second part of his inquiry, which involves investigating and reporting on the processes employed by the Australian Sports Commission, Cycling Australia and any other relevant parties involved since this issue arose in December last year. Mr Anderson is due to report his findings by 31 October 2004. We know that Senator Lundy has a vendetta against the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport. That is fair enough; it was for domestic Canberra political reasons. But she and Senator Faulkner should not be dragging the reputations of our sports men and women through the mud. Senator Faulkner should apologise to the cyclists.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2004-08-05,"—Isn't it astonishing? Senator Fifield comes in here and tries to defend a pathetic and incompetent minister who is unable to manage his portfolio properly. He tries to defend him by asserting that the opposition somehow are not supportive of Australia's Olympic athletes, that somehow we are unpatriotic because we want to be tough on drugs in sport. It is offensive to cloak yourself in that sort of patriotism. This is not about whether or not we support our athletes. Of course we do. We on this side of the chamber say that we are committed to clean athletes. We are committed to there being no drugs in sport. We are tough on drugs in sport. Unlike the Howard government, which has presided over a cover-up, whether through incompetence or for some other reason, the Labor Party are serious about cleaning up drugs in sport, as we should be.
Australia until this time has had a reasonably good reputation when it comes to drugs in sport. But then in December last year a sharps bucket was found by cleaners in the Del Monte facility in Adelaide. This certainly suggests that some athletes who use that facility—some cyclists in the Australian team—have been injecting themselves. What did this minister do? Did he require that the evidence in that sharps bucket be held and tested by scientists for DNA, for residues of whatever chemicals were in the sharps bucket contents? No, he did not. In fact, DNA testing was not undertaken until June 2004. So this minister sat on evidence found in an Australian Institute of Sport facility that demonstrated or clearly implicated one or some or more of the athletes using that facility. It suggested that injecting had been occurring and he sat on the evidence for seven months.
If any police officer undertook this sort of investigation, leaving evidence which could have implicated, which could have indicated who was doing what for seven months, the public and this parliament and anyone else who knew about it would say that they should be hauled over the coals. But this minister dares to come in here, cloak himself in patriotism and accuse the opposition raising this issue of attacking our athletes in some attempt to cover up his own incompetence. The reality is that this evidence was found in December 2003. It was suggested at the time that equine growth hormone had been injected. Although it is a banned substance, it was not detectable in the drug testing procedures which existed then. So one of the only ways that we could possibly have found out what was injected and by whom was by properly testing what was found in the sharps bucket. It is appalling that for seven months this minister has done nothing about it and that, as we understand from the Anderson report, even to this day only some of the items in the sharps bucket have been tested. If this minister were really serious about being tough on drugs in sport, surely that testing would have been done immediately. 
Today in the Senate when the minister was asked yet again why he had not done it, why he had not actually gone and ensured that that testing was done on what was found in room 121, the minister was unable—as on every occasion—to provide an answer. He has been unable to provide an explanation as to why for seven months DNA testing and other scientific testing of all the items in that sharps bucket have not occurred. He has been unable to provide an answer. 
We say that Australian sports athletes deserve better than that. Our reputation as a sporting nation deserves better than that. This minister should have investigated this immediately. He should have undertaken investigations or caused them to be undertaken. He ought not to have left this until the evidence had clearly deteriorated and was virtually unusable or at least compromised. Instead, in August, many months after the discovery, we still have as many questions as answers, right on the eve of the Australian team walking into the opening ceremony in Athens. Frankly, our athletes deserve better than that. Our reputation as a clean sporting nation deserves more than that. (Time expired)

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-08-05,"—I seek leave to make a statement on behalf of Senator Hill.
Leave granted.
—This statement is in response to a motion moved by Senator Brown and agreed to by the Senate on 4 August 2004 that there be laid on the table by the Minister for Defence no later than 4 p.m. today the memorandum of understanding between the governments of Australia and the United States of America concerning the program of cooperation on missile defence. The memorandum of understanding is not a public document and for it to be released would require the mutual agreement of both governments.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-05,"—by leave—That is quite an extraordinary statement coming from Minister Hill, who did not see fit to come into the Senate and read it himself. The Australian government signed up some months ago now to this joint arrangement with the United States—essentially, the Prime Minister and President Bush—to foster the missile defence program known as Son of Star Wars, with quite massive ramifications for this nation and this region. One does not have to be well read on the subject to know that it will potentially lead to a new arms race in the Asia-Pacific involving powerful players like China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia, and it has major ramifications for our nation. 
What the minister has put before the Senate today is that the document signed with much fanfare by the Howard government and the Bush administration, and upon which so much of our external affairs relationships and the safety of this country depends in the years ahead, is not available to this parliament. The minister did not say in the statement that Senator Troeth read out that an attempt had been made to get clearance from the Bush administration to produce the document. He simply said, `We're not going to produce it, because we signed it with another country.' That is not acceptable. This is a sovereign parliament.
When an agreement of this importance is consummated with a foreign government, it is the right of this parliament and the duty of the government involved to be informed in detail. If there are some secrecy provisions, the government should say that so arrangements can be made to have the matter dealt with in camera. This is a matter of enormous public interest and geopolitical significance for our nation, for Australia. It is just not acceptable for the minister to have a junior representative of the government in the parliament read out a dismissive document like the one we just heard read out. It is just not acceptable. The government can be assured that the Greens will pursue this further. It is a matter of high public information and high public importance. The Senate and this parliament should not be treated in a cavalier fashion like this.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE: MISSILE DEFENCE SYSTEM</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-08-05,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, Senator George Campbell, I present the report of the committee on the Office of the Chief Scientist, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The committee's inquiry into the role of the Office of the Chief Scientist was triggered by the government's refusal to allow the Chief Scientist, Dr Robin Batterham, to appear before Senate estimates hearings to answer serious conflict of interest allegations arising from his dual part-time roles as Chief Scientist for the Commonwealth and chief technologist for Rio Tinto. It is a matter of concern to this committee that the minister had refused the Chief Scientist the opportunity to accept invitations to appear before the committee. I want to stress that this inquiry has not in any way questioned Dr Batterham's standing in Australia and overseas as a highly respected research scientist. Dr Batterham's professional record is beyond reproach and was never at any time under question.
The committee rejects outright the claim by the Minister for Science that there has been a `witch hunt' against Dr Batterham. At no time during the inquiry was Dr Batterham's character or his professional conduct questioned in the performance of his duties as Chief Scientist. These were not and were never going to be issues that the committee was going to address. Conflict of interest allegations surrounding Dr Batterham deserved close examination to establish any weaknesses in how the Office of the Chief Scientist is structured and whether the terms of Dr Batterham's appointment had resulted in difficulties for him in discharging his duties as Chief Scientist. 
The main issue before the committee is the perception of a possible conflict of interest arising from Dr Batterham's dual part-time roles as Chief Scientist for the Commonwealth and chief technologist for Rio Tinto. The committee is concerned that the Chief Scientist's contract of employment with the Minister for Science does not contain any accountability provisions for parliamentary oversight of the Office of the Chief Scientist. The committee believes that the contract provides an inadequate mechanism to identify and manage potential conflict of interest arising from the Chief Scientist's dual part-time roles.
The inquiry was concerned principally with broader issues of public administration and government accountability. The committee is concerned that public trust in science and therefore in the Office of the Chief Scientist has been damaged and will be eroded further if the position of Chief Scientist remains a part-time appointment. Such public trust is of importance to the public education role of this position. The position necessarily has a high profile role in representing the interests of science to a wider public. Scientific research involves many issues and debates that are contestable, and a high degree of public trust in the position of Chief Scientist is necessary if the incumbent is to be able to play an effective role in such debates to the extent of expressing controversial views or analyses.
The committee holds the view that the way the government restructured the Office of the Chief Scientist in 1996, to create a part-time position, resulted in a public perception of an apparent conflict of interest and, to a lesser extent, an apparent indirect pecuniary conflict of interest involving the Chief Scientist's public duties. The committee is also concerned that the Chief Scientist is required to comply with several sets of conflict of interest guidelines which vary in scope and operation. It is particularly concerned about how the Australian Public Service and CRC conflict of interest guidelines apply to the Chief Scientist.
The committee considered the allegations of conflict of interest raised by the Australian Greens. It finds that there is a clear conflict of public and private duties arising from the dual part-time roles performed by Dr Batterham. The circumstances of Dr Batterham's part-time appointment fall squarely within any mainstream definition of conflict of interest. However, the committee does not believe there is any evidence to demonstrate either a direct or indirect pecuniary conflict of interest, or a real conflict of interest arising from the Chief Scientist's advisory role. The committee also finds that the actual, potential and apparent conflicts of interest arising from Dr Batterham's dual part-time roles have not been addressed and managed to the committee's satisfaction.
The committee finds that the CRC guidelines and their application to the Chief Scientist are confusing and lack perceptual clarity on the issue of conflict of interest. At the very least, the committee believes that the CRC committee should obtain from Rio Tinto details of how the so-called firewall which applies to the Chief Scientist is put into practice. Any firewall arrangements should be formally recognised in the CRC committee conflict of interest guidelines. 
The committee finds that the Australian Public Service conflict of interest guidelines were compromised by the government's administrative arrangements with regard to the Office of the Chief Scientist. The committee's report makes four recommendations to address these conflict of interest concerns. Firstly, it recommends that the conflict of interest guidelines included in the Australian Public Service code of conduct should be reviewed to ensure that the broader conflict of interest concepts examined in the report can be addressed more transparently and rigorously. Secondly, the committee recommends that in view of the responsibility and potential workload attached to the Office of the Chief Scientist, and in the light of the potential for conflict of interest associated in particular with a part-time Chief Scientist, the position of the Chief Scientist should be full time. Thirdly, it recommends that guidelines, codes of conduct and procedures on dealing with potential and actual conflicts of interest applying to holders of public office in the Australian government should be similar and consistent across all government agencies and bodies. Finally, the committee recommends that the position of Chief Scientist should be appointed under Public Service conditions. The terms of the appointment should be such that the Office of the Chief Scientist will be subject to public accountability equivalent to that applying to other senior public servants. 
The committee concludes that potential and apparent conflicts of interest which arise from Dr Batterham's dual part-time roles are as damaging to the Office of the Chief Scientist as any real conflict of interest. They erode public confidence in the political and administrative process and call into question the integrity of high-level scientific advice provided to government. The public interest is not being served as long as the perception of a conflict of interest remains and is not properly managed. This is why the committee recommends restoring the position of Chief Scientist to a full-time appointment under Public Service conditions as a matter of importance and sound public administration.
In closing, I thank our colleagues on the committee from all parties for their efforts and their cooperation in producing this report. I thank all those who assisted the committee with its deliberations including, of course, the committee secretariat—namely, John Carter, David Sullivan, and Dijana Jurjevic.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-08-05,"—I also wish to speak to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee's report on the Office of the Chief Scientist in my capacity as the Democrats' science spokesperson and as a member of the committee and the subcommittee for the purposes of this inquiry. The Democrats supported the motion that came before the Senate for this inquiry, despite some concerns about the process that led to that point. I believed that there were issues that needed to be addressed and it was important to me and the Democrats that this was done in an appropriate manner. A number of us, certainly Senator Carr and I, as members of that committee were very disappointed by the decision of the Minister for Science to refuse to allow the Chief Scientist, Dr Batterham, to appear before the committee—either through the estimates committee process or, as per one suggestion, at a private hearing, or even a private meeting, of the committee—to resolve some of the matters that we perceived as requiring responses or that needed to be investigated.
The minister's stubbornness, which is reflected in correspondence provided to the committee, left the Senate with few options other than the one we decided to explore, which was the decision to hold a brief inquiry into these matters. Even then there was the potential—and, I think, an attempt—to thwart those processes by delaying the appearance of the Chief Scientist before that committee. I make it very clear that it was not the Chief Scientist's decision; it was very much a government decision. At every step of the way I believe that the government has not made this process as smooth as it could and should have been. 
We supported this inquiry on the basis of growing concerns from many within the community, specifically within the science community, who had concerns—and, I must admit, continue to express them—about the nature of the Chief Scientist's appointment. My party and I strongly support the position and the role of the Chief Scientist. However, the issue of the effectiveness and the perceptions of the part-time appointment of Australia's Chief Scientist needs to be examined. That is especially so when we compare ourselves with other nations. For example, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America all have full-time appointments, as should we.
The perpetual danger of real and/or perceived conflicts of interest with the Chief Scientist—who is employed part time—while holding that office required examination and I am glad the committee has done so. The recent announcement of the expansion of the role of the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council, PMSEC, of which the Chief Scientist is chief executive officer, has no doubt made it more important to ensure the accountability and the independence of the Chief Scientist's position. The Democrats believe investigation of these issues was necessary to ensure the appropriate strategic coordination of our research effort.
To that end, when the motion for the inquiry initially came to the Senate, I amended the terms of reference to include an examination of the need for statutory criteria for the appointment of the Chief Scientist. As we all know, a key part of the role of the Senate is to keep the government accountable, and the Democrats are very proud of our record in this respect. This was an appropriate inquiry for the Senate committee to conduct. The Australian Democrats are in agreement with the majority of recommendations and the observations contained in the chair's report. I have, however, provided a supplementary comment on the issues where we may have had different views from those of the chair. The committee was unanimous—I make that very clear—in recommending that the position of the Chief Scientist become a full-time position. However, this is only one of several criteria that we believe, and that I believe, should be detailed in legislation. This view was also expressed by FASTS in their submission to the inquiry.
It also concerns the Democrats that much of the chair's recommendation 4 actually relies on the minister of the day being agreeable to the terms set out in that recommendation. So there is that extraordinary opportunity still for ministerial discretion or approval. The Democrats have long been committed to ensuring that appointments to governing organisations or authorities that are public, for example, are based on merit and that the processes by which these appointments are made are transparent, accountable, open and honest. Such a system works effectively in places such as the United Kingdom.
We believe that a position such as that of the Chief Scientist, the holder of which enjoys a significant level of influence over government—and who is, of course, on the public payroll—must be appointed from now on in an open and transparent way against defined criteria. That is the thrust of my supplementary report. Such criteria would also reduce the likelihood of future conflicts of interest. I welcome the chair's report and the reports from others who participated in this inquiry. I endorse the comments made by Senator Crossin in thanking the secretariat, witnesses and all participants. I think this was an incredibly useful inquiry and I urge the government to pay attention to the recommendations contained in this report.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-05,"—The committee has found that there is a clear conflict of public and private duties arising from the dual part-time roles performed by Dr Batterham. His circumstances fall squarely within any mainstream definition of conflict of interest. The follow-on from that is that clearly the Chief Scientist should relinquish one of his jobs. It is not tenable for the Chief Scientist to maintain both the jobs of Chief Scientist of this nation and chief technologist for the major coal company, Rio Tinto. There is a clear conflict of duty and interest as seen from the public's point of view. The committee's findings speak volumes of that, but they speak also of the need for there to be an improvement in the way in which the government applies Public Service rules to all posts to ensure that this sort of conflict does not apply in the future.
I want to point to the some of the background as to why the Chief Scientist has been found to be in an invidious position from the point of view of public perception. Rio Tinto is a big corporation. We are in an age where there is enormous concern about global warming. We are in an age where government has a big role in stimulating technology and research about ways forward that will get us off the global warming treadmill and away from being the world's worst per capita polluter amongst industrialised nations.
The government has been very tardy about that. There has been not only limited but also dwindling government input into renewable energy and energy efficiency businesses, which are hugely job prospective and hugely export oriented for the future of this country. I want to point out here that 12 or 13 years ago we outcompeted Japan in the production of solar panels. Now Japan produces 50 per cent of the world's output and Australia produces less than one per cent. This is the sunshine country. Japan is technology oriented and looks much more at the future. It has streeted the field while this government has pulled the purse strings.
But the government has not pulled the purse strings everywhere. When we look at Rio Tinto, the company for which the Chief Scientist has been chief technologist since his appointment in 1999, we find that some $340 million in direct, indirect or enhancing grants has gone to that corporation. In October 2001, $35 million went, in the form of a 24-year interest free loan, to the Rio Tinto Foundation for a Sustainable Minerals Industry. The foundation is not a legal entity; it is an advisory group to Rio Tinto. Also in October 2001, $102 million went to a strategic investment incentive for energy generation to support the Comalco alumina refinery at Gladstone. In May 2002, another $125 million went to a strategic investment incentive for the HIsmelt iron smelter. More funding has gone to cooperative research centres in which Rio Tinto has core participation. In December 2000, $14.5 million went to the CRC for Coal in Sustainable Development. In December 2002, $21.8 million went to the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies. In December 2002, $18.8 million went to a sustainable resource processing investigation. In August 2003, $23.4 million in additional funding was allocated to the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies with in-kind contributions from Geoscience Australia, the CSIRO and the Australian Greenhouse Office. 
When you look at the other side of the ledger, Mr Acting Deputy President, you find that the well of funding for the sunrise industries for environmental technology—which are based on renewable energy serving the whole of Australia and on energy efficiency—is basically dry. We have seen this extraordinary conjunction of the billowing of government largesse directly and indirectly to a huge company like Rio Tinto, whose chief technologist is Dr Batterham, at the same time as Dr Batterham has been the Chief Scientist for the government—whose role is to advise the government on the way forward. This gives the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
We heard a lot in the committee process about how the Chief Scientist absents himself from decisions which involve Rio Tinto, about how he is not there when the vote is taken and about how—when it comes to CRCs and applications for other funding from Rio Tinto—a firewall is set up in Rio Tinto so that the Chief Scientist is not involved. But the committee could not get, and did not get, any indication from Rio Tinto of what that firewall was—nor did anybody in the government have any idea of what the firewall was. Nobody could tell us. Any fair observer from the outside would be led to believe that this firewall is a fiction—insofar as anybody could believe that there are tight, laid-down and publicly examinable rules which are, in effect, a firewall. We all know that it is not about the words you say and it is not about the contacts you make; it is about the influence you have that can work enormously to favour your point of view in working with posts such as that of Chief Scientist.
The committee also found that, on one occasion, Dr Batterham did use unpublished and unverified data, which was supplied by Rio Tinto, in a meeting of Commonwealth and state energy ministers and failed to declare the source of that information. That created the appearance of a real conflict of interest. The report went on to say:
The same data subsequently appeared in a high profile report prepared by a PMSEIC working group. It appears that the working group was not aware Rio Tinto had commissioned information attributed to a private company, Roam Consulting.37 However, the committee finds that the Chief Scientist is not responsible for this oversight because he was not directly involved in preparing the presentation to PMSEIC and did not present it to the working group. The committee concludes that this case has contributed to a perception of conflict of interest which risks eroding public confidence in the independence of advice provided to Government by the Chief Scientist.
This is no small matter, because the figures that went through to the Prime Minister's scientific advisory group were extraordinarily influential in terms of the outcomes for this nation. They presented a very low-cost option for geosequestration. They actually came from Rio Tinto and its consulting company. That ought to have been acknowledged, but it was not. If you are going to have the presentation of verifiable information to such extraordinarily influential advisory organisations as the Prime Minister's scientific advisory group then they need to know the source of that information. The committee was unable to find anybody else on the planet who had such low costings for the potential of geosequestration. Nobody else was able to present such low costings, and therefore present such a favourable view of the potential for unproven technology to take carbon dioxide out of the exudates from coal-fired power stations and put them underground. This is unproven technology. It was presented as the lowest cost option without the information being identified as coming at the behest of the coal company for whom the Chief Scientist is the chief technologist—that is, Rio Tinto. 
Of course, this has the mark of a conflict of public interest written all over it. Such a circumstance should not be allowed to recur. Those who are competing for government moneys, those who are promoting solar power, wind power, biofuels, energy efficiency, wave power and geothermal power all have a right to feel aggrieved that such an important committee as that advising the Prime Minister could use figures which were not corroborated by other scientific sources but which came from the company itself.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-08-05,"—by leave—I would like to correct the record. I made a comment in my address that a recommendation was unanimous. I meant to say that it was a majority recommendation, a cross-party recommendation, of the Labor Party, the Greens and the Australian Democrats. I want to make that very clear. As much as I would love the government to sign on to that recommendation, it was not a unanimous one and I apologise to the government if it was in any way worried that I misrepresented it.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-08-05,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, Senator George Campbell, I present the report of the committee on the Office of the Chief Scientist, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The committee's inquiry into the role of the Office of the Chief Scientist was triggered by the government's refusal to allow the Chief Scientist, Dr Robin Batterham, to appear before Senate estimates hearings to answer serious conflict of interest allegations arising from his dual part-time roles as Chief Scientist for the Commonwealth and chief technologist for Rio Tinto. It is a matter of concern to this committee that the minister had refused the Chief Scientist the opportunity to accept invitations to appear before the committee. I want to stress that this inquiry has not in any way questioned Dr Batterham's standing in Australia and overseas as a highly respected research scientist. Dr Batterham's professional record is beyond reproach and was never at any time under question.
The committee rejects outright the claim by the Minister for Science that there has been a `witch hunt' against Dr Batterham. At no time during the inquiry was Dr Batterham's character or his professional conduct questioned in the performance of his duties as Chief Scientist. These were not and were never going to be issues that the committee was going to address. Conflict of interest allegations surrounding Dr Batterham deserved close examination to establish any weaknesses in how the Office of the Chief Scientist is structured and whether the terms of Dr Batterham's appointment had resulted in difficulties for him in discharging his duties as Chief Scientist. 
The main issue before the committee is the perception of a possible conflict of interest arising from Dr Batterham's dual part-time roles as Chief Scientist for the Commonwealth and chief technologist for Rio Tinto. The committee is concerned that the Chief Scientist's contract of employment with the Minister for Science does not contain any accountability provisions for parliamentary oversight of the Office of the Chief Scientist. The committee believes that the contract provides an inadequate mechanism to identify and manage potential conflict of interest arising from the Chief Scientist's dual part-time roles.
The inquiry was concerned principally with broader issues of public administration and government accountability. The committee is concerned that public trust in science and therefore in the Office of the Chief Scientist has been damaged and will be eroded further if the position of Chief Scientist remains a part-time appointment. Such public trust is of importance to the public education role of this position. The position necessarily has a high profile role in representing the interests of science to a wider public. Scientific research involves many issues and debates that are contestable, and a high degree of public trust in the position of Chief Scientist is necessary if the incumbent is to be able to play an effective role in such debates to the extent of expressing controversial views or analyses.
The committee holds the view that the way the government restructured the Office of the Chief Scientist in 1996, to create a part-time position, resulted in a public perception of an apparent conflict of interest and, to a lesser extent, an apparent indirect pecuniary conflict of interest involving the Chief Scientist's public duties. The committee is also concerned that the Chief Scientist is required to comply with several sets of conflict of interest guidelines which vary in scope and operation. It is particularly concerned about how the Australian Public Service and CRC conflict of interest guidelines apply to the Chief Scientist.
The committee considered the allegations of conflict of interest raised by the Australian Greens. It finds that there is a clear conflict of public and private duties arising from the dual part-time roles performed by Dr Batterham. The circumstances of Dr Batterham's part-time appointment fall squarely within any mainstream definition of conflict of interest. However, the committee does not believe there is any evidence to demonstrate either a direct or indirect pecuniary conflict of interest, or a real conflict of interest arising from the Chief Scientist's advisory role. The committee also finds that the actual, potential and apparent conflicts of interest arising from Dr Batterham's dual part-time roles have not been addressed and managed to the committee's satisfaction.
The committee finds that the CRC guidelines and their application to the Chief Scientist are confusing and lack perceptual clarity on the issue of conflict of interest. At the very least, the committee believes that the CRC committee should obtain from Rio Tinto details of how the so-called firewall which applies to the Chief Scientist is put into practice. Any firewall arrangements should be formally recognised in the CRC committee conflict of interest guidelines. 
The committee finds that the Australian Public Service conflict of interest guidelines were compromised by the government's administrative arrangements with regard to the Office of the Chief Scientist. The committee's report makes four recommendations to address these conflict of interest concerns. Firstly, it recommends that the conflict of interest guidelines included in the Australian Public Service code of conduct should be reviewed to ensure that the broader conflict of interest concepts examined in the report can be addressed more transparently and rigorously. Secondly, the committee recommends that in view of the responsibility and potential workload attached to the Office of the Chief Scientist, and in the light of the potential for conflict of interest associated in particular with a part-time Chief Scientist, the position of the Chief Scientist should be full time. Thirdly, it recommends that guidelines, codes of conduct and procedures on dealing with potential and actual conflicts of interest applying to holders of public office in the Australian government should be similar and consistent across all government agencies and bodies. Finally, the committee recommends that the position of Chief Scientist should be appointed under Public Service conditions. The terms of the appointment should be such that the Office of the Chief Scientist will be subject to public accountability equivalent to that applying to other senior public servants. 
The committee concludes that potential and apparent conflicts of interest which arise from Dr Batterham's dual part-time roles are as damaging to the Office of the Chief Scientist as any real conflict of interest. They erode public confidence in the political and administrative process and call into question the integrity of high-level scientific advice provided to government. The public interest is not being served as long as the perception of a conflict of interest remains and is not properly managed. This is why the committee recommends restoring the position of Chief Scientist to a full-time appointment under Public Service conditions as a matter of importance and sound public administration.
In closing, I thank our colleagues on the committee from all parties for their efforts and their cooperation in producing this report. I thank all those who assisted the committee with its deliberations including, of course, the committee secretariat—namely, John Carter, David Sullivan, and Dijana Jurjevic. I commend this report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,20,2,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-08-05,"—I also wish to speak to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee's report on the Office of the Chief Scientist in my capacity as the Democrats' science spokesperson and as a member of the committee and the subcommittee for the purposes of this inquiry. The Democrats supported the motion that came before the Senate for this inquiry, despite some concerns about the process that led to that point. I believed that there were issues that needed to be addressed and it was important to me and the Democrats that this was done in an appropriate manner. A number of us, certainly Senator Carr and I, as members of that committee were very disappointed by the decision of the Minister for Science to refuse to allow the Chief Scientist, Dr Batterham, to appear before the committee—either through the estimates committee process or, as per one suggestion, at a private hearing, or even a private meeting, of the committee—to resolve some of the matters that we perceived as requiring responses or that needed to be investigated.
The minister's stubbornness, which is reflected in correspondence provided to the committee, left the Senate with few options other than the one we decided to explore, which was the decision to hold a brief inquiry into these matters. Even then there was the potential—and, I think, an attempt—to thwart those processes by delaying the appearance of the Chief Scientist before that committee. I make it very clear that it was not the Chief Scientist's decision; it was very much a government decision. At every step of the way I believe that the government has not made this process as smooth as it could and should have been. 
We supported this inquiry on the basis of growing concerns from many within the community, specifically within the science community, who had concerns—and, I must admit, continue to express them—about the nature of the Chief Scientist's appointment. My party and I strongly support the position and the role of the Chief Scientist. However, the issue of the effectiveness and the perceptions of the part-time appointment of Australia's Chief Scientist needs to be examined. That is especially so when we compare ourselves with other nations. For example, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America all have full-time appointments, as should we.
The perpetual danger of real and/or perceived conflicts of interest with the Chief Scientist—who is employed part time—while holding that office required examination and I am glad the committee has done so. The recent announcement of the expansion of the role of the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council, PMSEC, of which the Chief Scientist is chief executive officer, has no doubt made it more important to ensure the accountability and the independence of the Chief Scientist's position. The Democrats believe investigation of these issues was necessary to ensure the appropriate strategic coordination of our research effort.
To that end, when the motion for the inquiry initially came to the Senate, I amended the terms of reference to include an examination of the need for statutory criteria for the appointment of the Chief Scientist. As we all know, a key part of the role of the Senate is to keep the government accountable, and the Democrats are very proud of our record in this respect. This was an appropriate inquiry for the Senate committee to conduct. The Australian Democrats are in agreement with the majority of recommendations and the observations contained in the chair's report. I have, however, provided a supplementary comment on the issues where we may have had different views from those of the chair. The committee was unanimous—I make that very clear—in recommending that the position of the Chief Scientist become a full-time position. However, this is only one of several criteria that we believe, and that I believe, should be detailed in legislation. This view was also expressed by FASTS in their submission to the inquiry.
It also concerns the Democrats that much of the chair's recommendation 4 actually relies on the minister of the day being agreeable to the terms set out in that recommendation. So there is that extraordinary opportunity still for ministerial discretion or approval. The Democrats have long been committed to ensuring that appointments to governing organisations or authorities that are public, for example, are based on merit and that the processes by which these appointments are made are transparent, accountable, open and honest. Such a system works effectively in places such as the United Kingdom.
We believe that a position such as that of the Chief Scientist, the holder of which enjoys a significant level of influence over government—and who is, of course, on the public payroll—must be appointed from now on in an open and transparent way against defined criteria. That is the thrust of my supplementary report. Such criteria would also reduce the likelihood of future conflicts of interest. I welcome the chair's report and the reports from others who participated in this inquiry. I endorse the comments made by Senator Crossin in thanking the secretariat, witnesses and all participants. I think this was an incredibly useful inquiry and I urge the government to pay attention to the recommendations contained in this report.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-05,"—The committee has found that there is a clear conflict of public and private duties arising from the dual part-time roles performed by Dr Batterham. His circumstances fall squarely within any mainstream definition of conflict of interest. The follow-on from that is that clearly the Chief Scientist should relinquish one of his jobs. It is not tenable for the Chief Scientist to maintain both the jobs of Chief Scientist of this nation and chief technologist for the major coal company, Rio Tinto. There is a clear conflict of duty and interest as seen from the public's point of view. The committee's findings speak volumes of that, but they speak also of the need for there to be an improvement in the way in which the government applies Public Service rules to all posts to ensure that this sort of conflict does not apply in the future.
I want to point to the some of the background as to why the Chief Scientist has been found to be in an invidious position from the point of view of public perception. Rio Tinto is a big corporation. We are in an age where there is enormous concern about global warming. We are in an age where government has a big role in stimulating technology and research about ways forward that will get us off the global warming treadmill and away from being the world's worst per capita polluter amongst industrialised nations.
The government has been very tardy about that. There has been not only limited but also dwindling government input into renewable energy and energy efficiency businesses, which are hugely job prospective and hugely export oriented for the future of this country. I want to point out here that 12 or 13 years ago we outcompeted Japan in the production of solar panels. Now Japan produces 50 per cent of the world's output and Australia produces less than one per cent. This is the sunshine country. Japan is technology oriented and looks much more at the future. It has streeted the field while this government has pulled the purse strings.
But the government has not pulled the purse strings everywhere. When we look at Rio Tinto, the company for which the Chief Scientist has been chief technologist since his appointment in 1999, we find that some $340 million in direct, indirect or enhancing grants has gone to that corporation. In October 2001, $35 million went, in the form of a 24-year interest free loan, to the Rio Tinto Foundation for a Sustainable Minerals Industry. The foundation is not a legal entity; it is an advisory group to Rio Tinto. Also in October 2001, $102 million went to a strategic investment incentive for energy generation to support the Comalco alumina refinery at Gladstone. In May 2002, another $125 million went to a strategic investment incentive for the HIsmelt iron smelter. More funding has gone to cooperative research centres in which Rio Tinto has core participation. In December 2000, $14.5 million went to the CRC for Coal in Sustainable Development. In December 2002, $21.8 million went to the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies. In December 2002, $18.8 million went to a sustainable resource processing investigation. In August 2003, $23.4 million in additional funding was allocated to the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies with in-kind contributions from Geoscience Australia, the CSIRO and the Australian Greenhouse Office. 
When you look at the other side of the ledger, Mr Acting Deputy President, you find that the well of funding for the sunrise industries for environmental technology—which are based on renewable energy serving the whole of Australia and on energy efficiency—is basically dry. We have seen this extraordinary conjunction of the billowing of government largesse directly and indirectly to a huge company like Rio Tinto, whose chief technologist is Dr Batterham, at the same time as Dr Batterham has been the Chief Scientist for the government—whose role is to advise the government on the way forward. This gives the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
We heard a lot in the committee process about how the Chief Scientist absents himself from decisions which involve Rio Tinto, about how he is not there when the vote is taken and about how—when it comes to CRCs and applications for other funding from Rio Tinto—a firewall is set up in Rio Tinto so that the Chief Scientist is not involved. But the committee could not get, and did not get, any indication from Rio Tinto of what that firewall was—nor did anybody in the government have any idea of what the firewall was. Nobody could tell us. Any fair observer from the outside would be led to believe that this firewall is a fiction—insofar as anybody could believe that there are tight, laid-down and publicly examinable rules which are, in effect, a firewall. We all know that it is not about the words you say and it is not about the contacts you make; it is about the influence you have that can work enormously to favour your point of view in working with posts such as that of Chief Scientist.
The committee also found that, on one occasion, Dr Batterham did use unpublished and unverified data, which was supplied by Rio Tinto, in a meeting of Commonwealth and state energy ministers and failed to declare the source of that information. That created the appearance of a real conflict of interest. The report went on to say:
The same data subsequently appeared in a high profile report prepared by a PMSEIC working group. It appears that the working group was not aware Rio Tinto had commissioned information attributed to a private company, Roam Consulting.37 However, the committee finds that the Chief Scientist is not responsible for this oversight because he was not directly involved in preparing the presentation to PMSEIC and did not present it to the working group. The committee concludes that this case has contributed to a perception of conflict of interest which risks eroding public confidence in the independence of advice provided to Government by the Chief Scientist.
This is no small matter, because the figures that went through to the Prime Minister's scientific advisory group were extraordinarily influential in terms of the outcomes for this nation. They presented a very low-cost option for geosequestration. They actually came from Rio Tinto and its consulting company. That ought to have been acknowledged, but it was not. If you are going to have the presentation of verifiable information to such extraordinarily influential advisory organisations as the Prime Minister's scientific advisory group then they need to know the source of that information. The committee was unable to find anybody else on the planet who had such low costings for the potential of geosequestration. Nobody else was able to present such low costings, and therefore present such a favourable view of the potential for unproven technology to take carbon dioxide out of the exudates from coal-fired power stations and put them underground. This is unproven technology. It was presented as the lowest cost option without the information being identified as coming at the behest of the coal company for whom the Chief Scientist is the chief technologist—that is, Rio Tinto. 
Of course, this has the mark of a conflict of public interest written all over it. Such a circumstance should not be allowed to recur. Those who are competing for government moneys, those who are promoting solar power, wind power, biofuels, energy efficiency, wave power and geothermal power all have a right to feel aggrieved that such an important committee as that advising the Prime Minister could use figures which were not corroborated by other scientific sources but which came from the company itself.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-08-05,"—The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report A last resort? National inquiry into children in immigration detention has received a lot of focus out in the community, but I am disappointed to say that it has not received a lot of attention in this parliament. It was tabled either on budget day or on the day after in that short sitting week and was very much subsumed within the focus on what is of course an important document as well—the annual federal budget. We then went into estimates and since then we have been focused on pre-election issues.
This is an incredibly significant report. It is very comprehensive, it is quite long, and it is important because it documents the facts, and amongst all the rhetoric and all the claim and counterclaim about this issue, the facts speak for themselves. The facts cannot be changed, they cannot be swept under the table and, unfortunately for this government, they will not go away. This report details the enormity, breadth, length and extent of harm that has been done to children over a long period as a direct result of government policy and, indeed, I must say, of a legislative regime put in place by this parliament back in the early 1990s against the wishes of the Australian Democrats—a mandatory detention regime. Since that time, it has become more and more harsh, more and more damaging and more and more cruel. 
There have been many forums around the country examining the details of this report and the broader issue of children in detention. The commissioner, Dr Sev Ozdowski, should be congratulated for his work not just in putting together such a comprehensive document but in continuing to try to get the message out to the community. The government must be condemned for such an appalling response to such a significant document about such an important issue. As I said last night in the adjournment debate, the priority we give to children and their protection in this country is far too low. Whilst we might all say nice words from time to time, if we really stop and think about it and take the politics out of it, we are crazy—in our own interests, let alone in the interests of a just community and a just world—if we do anything other than put children at the top of our priorities, ensuring that policies do not cause harm to children and that we address any actions that are causing harm to children rather than saying, `That is an unfortunate by-product.'
There were three responses from this government and they all need to be condemned. Firstly, the main response—and this was confirmed in estimates—was: `I don't think we'll make any response to this; it's all something from the past. We've moved to get children out of detention now so it doesn't matter.' That is grossly inadequate once you look at what is in the report.
The second response has been to say that there are no children left in detention. The minister said that there is one child left in detention and that is the child of a boat arrival seeking asylum. She tried to qualify it very cleverly, as these government ministers always do, again trying to create the false impression that there is only one child left, there is nothing to worry about and they are all free. The facts are that they are not. Even as recently as 28 July, the figure that I have is that 90 children are in secure—that is, closed—facilities. These are children who have had their freedom taken away from them. The minister points to the home detention places in Port Augusta, which I have visited, as has my colleague Senator Stott Despoja. Sure, the environment is nicer, but the children are not free and they are separated from their families. There are still 19 children on Nauru and there are 35 children in Villawood. The harm being done to them is absolutely enormous. The simple fact is that this is causing enormous damage. 
The other appalling response from the government is to say, `If we let all the children out, that would send a bad message to people smugglers.' They are basically saying, `We can implement child abuse because otherwise we will send a bad message to people smugglers.' The Democrats' view is to strip away all the different views about the best way to approach this issue. Any policy, whether it is this one or anything else, that causes such immense harm and damage to children cannot be justified and must be changed. Even though this report is many hundreds of pages long, that is the simple message it gives. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2004-08-05,"—I speak to the 119th report of the Privileges Committee regarding the motion I referred to that committee of possible false or misleading evidence before the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. By way of background, I referred this matter to the Privileges Committee after Telstra officers Mr Bill Scales and Mr Anthony Rix provided evidence at the February estimates that the high rate of faults in the Telstra network was due largely to heavy rain and not network deterioration. This evidence appeared entirely contradictory to an internal Telstra document tabled in the House of Representatives by Mr Lindsay Tanner, which stated that the growth in fault rates appeared to be due to general network deterioration and reduced rehabilitation activity on the network. I note at this point that a references committee report was brought down today which said precisely that.
The Privileges Committee concluded that no contempt should be found because there was no intention to mislead. However, there are several aspects of the report that I would like to comment further on. Firstly, the committee accepted that I found the evidence of Mr Rix in particular to be in direct contradiction to the information contained in the internal Telstra document. The committee accepted that the allegations I raised were not trivial and that there was no other remedy available in this case as the protection of the committee's operations was entirely a matter for the Senate. Importantly, the committee found that: 
... a great deal of contextual and explanatory material is required to support a thesis that Mr Rix's evidence and the internal Telstra document are not inconsistent.
It further said:
... it took several pages of technical detail, additional context and numerous statistical attachments to clarify that the evidence of Mr Scales and Mr Rix was about quite specific technical areas that could be distinguished from the situation covered in the internal Telstra document.
The committee seems to be saying here that the only way Telstra could explain the prima facie inconsistencies in evidence was to load the Privileges Committee with a massive amount of explanatory material. This concerns me somewhat as I believe that the evidence provided in estimates hearings should be clear and concise and should be able to be taken on face value rather than requiring a mass of explanatory material down the track just to contextualise the evidence and to iron out any inconsistencies. I do not believe this reflects the intention of the estimates hearing process. My second concern relates to the finding of the committee that:
... with regard to the apparent contradiction between Mr Rix's evidence and the internal Telstra document, there is no evidence that Mr Rix was aware of the document, let alone that he chose deliberately to proffer apparently contradictory evidence at the additional estimates hearing.
 As such, in the absence of any evidence of an intention to mislead, the committee had no choice but to conclude that no contempt could be found.
This aspect of the report concerns me, as the test for the relevant intent involves a subjective determination of knowledge which, as shown in this case, can simply be denied to avoid responsibility. We do not know with any certainty whether Mr Rix was aware of the contradictory internal document; nor do we know whether he intended to provide contradictory evidence to the estimates hearings. However, what we do know is that those officers who attend estimates hearings are expected to have knowledge of the issues upon which they speak or answer questions. The fact that the Privileges Committee has not found the requisite intent to be satisfied raises the question of whether it is in fact possible to do so. It appears that, in the absence of an outright admission of guilt, intention to mislead or to provide false evidence is impossible to prove. Perhaps the rules of the Senate need to be reviewed with respect to the test applied in such circumstances, to allow for an alternative test of reasonableness.
Further, in his submission to the committee, Mr Scales rebutted my claims on the basis that he had qualified with `I think' his estimates response that the faults over that period were as a result of the weather. I make the point that the findings in this Privileges Committee report ought not to be seen by Telstra as giving tacit approval to such qualified answers being an excuse for inaccuracies in evidence; nor should this be seen as a method of providing a convenient sidestep to avoid questions. As the Privileges Committee noted in its findings:
The integrity and trustworthiness of evidence are essential for the proper performance of a committee's functions. If evidence given to a committee cannot be relied upon, the basis of that committee's conclusions may be called into question and its ability to carry out its functions may be compromised.
I hope that Telstra officials take note of these comments and consider more carefully the answers they provide. 
There is no real excuse for such qualified answers in the estimates hearings, due to the common practice of taking questions on notice when the answers are not known by those in attendance—provided we get them back in a reasonable time, of course. Furthermore, the vast number of officials that Telstra and other agencies—particularly Telstra, with its resources—can and do bring to the hearings ought to ensure that people with a broad range of expertise and knowledge are present and able to respond to a wide variety of questions.
It is reasonable for senators to presume that the answers they are given are accurate. Statements made by the group managing director are, it is reasonable to presume, more likely than not to be accurate, irrespective of whether they are qualified by `I think' or `I presume' or whatever. However, as we have seen in these circumstances, that is not the case. Perhaps qualified answers need to be rejected by senators in future estimates hearings.
My third concern relates to the recommendations of the committee that Telstra report to the Senate on measures it has implemented to ensure that senior officers are appropriately trained in their obligations to parliament. The committee noted in its report that this is not the first time officers of Telstra have come to the attention of the Privileges Committee in the context of false or misleading evidence and that in its 64th report the committee had observed that senior officers of Telstra appeared inappropriately equipped to deal with their accountability responsibilities. So this is not the first time Telstra has been asked to go back to school to learn the process.
However, despite having been through all this before, Telstra officials are, I believe, still lacking in this area. I am sceptical about these latest recommendations being acted on, as I believe that Telstra officials have little regard for their responsibilities to the parliament. In particular, I believe they have a complete disregard for the estimates process. I do not make this statement lightly. I make it in the light of comments made by Telstra officials themselves. On 1 July last year, Mr Scales addressed a packed meeting of 1,000 Telstra employees in Melbourne. In that speech he made a reference to the operation of Senate estimates committees which leaves little doubt in my mind as to his opinion of our Senate and estimates processes. According to a transcript of the speech, he said:
Senate Estimates ... is a somewhat arcane involvement where you almost have to suspend belief for a few days when you go there, where what happens is that you sit there in front of what are effectively 7 or 8 Judge Judies and what they do is that they then ask you a range of questions and as you answer a question there is someone at the back of you on a PC that's composing another question for the various ... Judge Judies to ask you.
He went on:
And the whole intent of the politicians that are there is to try and find a way over those 11 hours for us to make that phrase that gets turned into the headline that becomes news.
I believe that Mr Scales was totally out of order in making these comments, which indicate both a lack of understanding of Telstra's parliamentary responsibilities and a complete disregard for the accountability provisions which apply to Telstra in exactly the same way that they apply to other government agencies.
In fact the Privileges Committee made the point that the partial privatisation of Telstra does not affect the expectations of the committee or of the Senate that senior officers of Telstra have precisely the same responsibility as officers from government departments. I think Telstra do make that distinction. They have often used the protection of commercial-in-confidence and the fact that they operate in a competitive market as a reason for not providing advice to Senate estimates. They do make that distinction, and I can provide evidence of that. 
There were 1,000 people there when Mr Scales made that speech. A video was made of it, and it could well be that another 10,000 Telstra employees have now seen it and have the same view as Mr Scales with respect to the processes of our parliament and our Senate. I think that that speaks volumes. I urge Telstra to be far more careful in future. I urge Telstra to be truthful and unqualified in its responses to the Senate and to fulfil its obligations as a company that is majority owned by the Australian people.

Firstly, the committee accepted that I found the evidence of Mr Rix in particular to be in direct contradiction to the information contained in the internal Telstra document. The committee accepted that the allegations I raised were not trivial and that there was no other remedy available in this case as the protection of the committee's operations was entirely a matter for the Senate. Importantly, the committee found that: 
... a great deal of contextual and explanatory material is required to support a thesis that Mr Rix's evidence and the internal Telstra document are not inconsistent.
It further said:
... it took several pages of technical detail, additional context and numerous statistical attachments to clarify that the evidence of Mr Scales and Mr Rix was about quite specific technical areas that could be distinguished from the situation covered in the internal Telstra document.
The committee seems to be saying here that the only way Telstra could explain the prima facie inconsistencies in evidence was to load the Privileges Committee with a massive amount of explanatory material. This concerns me somewhat as I believe that the evidence provided in estimates hearings should be clear and concise and should be able to be taken on face value rather than requiring a mass of explanatory material down the track just to contextualise the evidence and to iron out any inconsistencies. I do not believe this reflects the intention of the estimates hearing process. My second concern relates to the finding of the committee that:
... with regard to the apparent contradiction between Mr Rix's evidence and the internal Telstra document, there is no evidence that Mr Rix was aware of the document, let alone that he chose deliberately to proffer apparently contradictory evidence at the additional estimates hearing.
 As such, in the absence of any evidence of an intention to mislead, the committee had no choice but to conclude that no contempt could be found.
This aspect of the report concerns me, as the test for the relevant intent involves a subjective determination of knowledge which, as shown in this case, can simply be denied to avoid responsibility. We do not know with any certainty whether Mr Rix was aware of the contradictory internal document; nor do we know whether he intended to provide contradictory evidence to the estimates hearings. However, what we do know is that those officers who attend estimates hearings are expected to have knowledge of the issues upon which they speak or answer questions. The fact that the Privileges Committee has not found the requisite intent to be satisfied raises the question of whether it is in fact possible to do so. It appears that, in the absence of an outright admission of guilt, intention to mislead or to provide false evidence is impossible to prove. Perhaps the rules of the Senate need to be reviewed with respect to the test applied in such circumstances, to allow for an alternative test of reasonableness.
Further, in his submission to the committee, Mr Scales rebutted my claims on the basis that he had qualified with `I think' his estimates response that the faults over that period were as a result of the weather. I make the point that the findings in this Privileges Committee report ought not to be seen by Telstra as giving tacit approval to such qualified answers being an excuse for inaccuracies in evidence; nor should this be seen as a method of providing a convenient sidestep to avoid questions. As the Privileges Committee noted in its findings:
The integrity and trustworthiness of evidence are essential for the proper performance of a committee's functions. If evidence given to a committee cannot be relied upon, the basis of that committee's conclusions may be called into question and its ability to carry out its functions may be compromised.
I hope that Telstra officials take note of these comments and consider more carefully the answers they provide. 
There is no real excuse for such qualified answers in the estimates hearings, due to the common practice of taking questions on notice when the answers are not known by those in attendance—provided we get them back in a reasonable time, of course. Furthermore, the vast number of officials that Telstra and other agencies—particularly Telstra, with its resources—can and do bring to the hearings ought to ensure that people with a broad range of expertise and knowledge are present and able to respond to a wide variety of questions.
It is reasonable for senators to presume that the answers they are given are accurate. Statements made by the group managing director are, it is reasonable to presume, more likely than not to be accurate, irrespective of whether they are qualified by `I think' or `I presume' or whatever. However, as we have seen in these circumstances, that is not the case. Perhaps qualified answers need to be rejected by senators in future estimates hearings.
My third concern relates to the recommendations of the committee that Telstra report to the Senate on measures it has implemented to ensure that senior officers are appropriately trained in their obligations to parliament. The committee noted in its report that this is not the first time officers of Telstra have come to the attention of the Privileges Committee in the context of false or misleading evidence and that in its 64th report the committee had observed that senior officers of Telstra appeared inappropriately equipped to deal with their accountability responsibilities. So this is not the first time Telstra has been asked to go back to school to learn the process.
However, despite having been through all this before, Telstra officials are, I believe, still lacking in this area. I am sceptical about these latest recommendations being acted on, as I believe that Telstra officials have little regard for their responsibilities to the parliament. In particular, I believe they have a complete disregard for the estimates process. I do not make this statement lightly. I make it in the light of comments made by Telstra officials themselves. On 1 July last year, Mr Scales addressed a packed meeting of 1,000 Telstra employees in Melbourne. In that speech he made a reference to the operation of Senate estimates committees which leaves little doubt in my mind as to his opinion of our Senate and estimates processes. According to a transcript of the speech, he said:
Senate Estimates ... is a somewhat arcane involvement where you almost have to suspend belief for a few days when you go there, where what happens is that you sit there in front of what are effectively 7 or 8 Judge Judies and what they do is that they then ask you a range of questions and as you answer a question there is someone at the back of you on a PC that's composing another question for the various ... Judge Judies to ask you.
He went on:
And the whole intent of the politicians that are there is to try and find a way over those 11 hours for us to make that phrase that gets turned into the headline that becomes news.
I believe that Mr Scales was totally out of order in making these comments, which indicate both a lack of understanding of Telstra's parliamentary responsibilities and a complete disregard for the accountability provisions which apply to Telstra in exactly the same way that they apply to other government agencies.
In fact the Privileges Committee made the point that the partial privatisation of Telstra does not affect the expectations of the committee or of the Senate that senior officers of Telstra have precisely the same responsibility as officers from government departments. I think Telstra do make that distinction. They have often used the protection of commercial-in-confidence and the fact that they operate in a competitive market as a reason for not providing advice to Senate estimates. They do make that distinction, and I can provide evidence of that. 
There were 1,000 people there when Mr Scales made that speech. A video was made of it, and it could well be that another 10,000 Telstra employees have now seen it and have the same view as Mr Scales with respect to the processes of our parliament and our Senate. I think that that speaks volumes. I urge Telstra to be far more careful in future. I urge Telstra to be truthful and unqualified in its responses to the Senate and to fulfil its obligations as a company that is majority owned by the Australian people.

That the Senate take note of the document.
Audit report No. 4 of 2004-05, Performance audit: Management of customer debt: Centrelink, might perhaps have been better titled `Mismanagement of customer debt: Centrelink'. I want to take you back to a statement made by Mr Wayne Swan, the shadow minister for family and community services, in May 2003. He said:
A Howard Government policy urging families and social security recipients to repay debts with high interest rate credit cards is irresponsible and will plunge many into a never-ending cycle of debt.
Mr Swan saw what the government refused to acknowledge: that there was a problem with its family and community services portfolio. To add insult to injury, families were being asked to repay the debt on credit cards, even when the overpayment occurred through no fault of their own. Families were expected to not only bear the risk of a system that could not get their payments right but also bear the interest on the debts that resulted from that. Centrelink's own web site revealed that there was an option to pay by credit card. This was being put to families before other more responsible options, like ongoing debt deductions from future benefits. The report into debt management by Centrelink has vindicated Labor's claims that the system is unfair and inflexible. The report found that, as at 30 June 2003, outstanding customer debt represented approximately one-third of one per cent of relevant Centrelink payments—approaching $1 billion at 30 June 2003, having increased by around 20 per cent over that of the previous two years. This figure alone shows the inability of the Howard government to manage its family and community services system. This is a government which touts its economic credibility and money-handling skills. Perhaps it would be fair to say that $1 billion in debt recovery cannot be called money managing but rather gross negligence by the minister in charge. 
Senate estimates figures show that the Howard government raised almost $39 million in Centrelink debts against more than 15,000 pensioners for overpayments resulting from government mistakes. I will say that again: the overpayments resulted from government mistakes. That is what you did: you took money from 15,000 pensioners for overpayments totalling $39 million because of your mistakes. The government failed to conduct annual checks on the income of the partners of pensioners even though this information was regularly supplied to Centrelink. After discovering these basic checks were not done, the government belatedly reviewed the payments to age and disability pensioners and the recipients of parent and carer allowance—and then sent them debt notices to top it off. In some cases, people were receiving bills for payments made over the last seven years. In 2002-03, the government reviewed the entitlements of 37,000-odd pensioners, raising 15,000-odd debts worth $38 million. This is an average debt of around $2,526, which is equivalent to a fifth of a pensioner's income. Some 770 carers have received debts averaging $3,724, which will more than wipe out the money the government promised them in the federal budget. Of the 15,421 debts, almost 10,000 related to discrepancies that were more than a year old.
If the government had regularly checked the information supplied by pensioners and crossmatched tax and Centrelink data at the time, these debts would not have accrued. It is not a matter of saying that the government should not try to recover debt; the government should manage its debt rather than simply let it accrue and then try to draw it out of people. To make matters worse, the following set of figures shows that the government has put low-income earners into incredible situations relating to high-interest debt. Senate estimates figures confirm that around four per cent of debts levied by the government were settled with credit cards. It is a disgrace that the government would coerce pensioners and low-income owners into using credit cards with annual interest rates of around 15 per cent to settle debts rather than look at better and more sensible options. Options other than linking credit card payment options to the Centrelink web site or encouraging pensioners or people with debts to use credit cards should have been canvassed. In 478 cases the government began legal action to recover money—that is, the government is prosecuting benefit recipients who did not, as I understand it, rort the system but rather were victims of it. That is not to say that the money should not be recovered, but it is a case of how you recover it. I think the Australian National Audit Office report should really be renamed `The mismanagement of customer debt by Centrelink'. 
The clawback of pensioner debts follows the $600,000 of annual debts raised as a result of overpaying family tax benefits each year, but this report was not inclusive of those debts, something for which the government can be thankful. In fact, I encourage the Australian National Audit Office to go back and have a look at it in the next year, when those figures will start to work through. The government are experts at paying families and pensioners the wrong amount and then clawing it back from them when they can least afford it. Another disturbing aspect of the ANAO report is that Centrelink does not monitor customer satisfaction with its debt management services. It simply does not want to know. That finding really highlights the way Centrelink has mismanaged customer debt. They do not want to know how the process has been working. The sheer volume of overpayments made each year by Centrelink, and the subsequent complaints of unscrupulous debt recovery practices made to local members, make this service essential in my view. In fact, it would be fair to say that the government's handling of the family and community services portfolio is nothing short of a shambles. With such a level of debt raised against Centrelink recipients, perhaps performance monitoring of this service is a deliberate oversight by the government. Centrelink does not fully measure its debt management resourcing and costs to ascertain relative productivity and cost efficiency and to achieve future savings. That is what the report says.
It seems to me that this government, while quick to rake back any overpayments, ignores how this is being done and at what cost. Now we have waivers available to people who incur a debt of no more than $50, because for a debt of between $51 and $100 it costs Centrelink more than the actual debt to recover the money. Cost efficiency and savings? I doubt it. The ANAO found that Centrelink has improved the profile and importance of debt prevention in the agency by clearly articulating its objectives in the debt servicing strategy from 2001 to 2004. Whilst I have found, at least to balance my view, that there is admirable accounting of how to prevent a debt in real terms, it does nothing to alleviate the number of debts being accrued by non-suspecting and lawful clients. In fact, it could be said that many people have been discouraged from applying for benefits and assistance because of the very real possibility of incurring a debt not of their making.
The report further found that Centrelink's debt services team was facing difficulties in coordinating debt prevention and management initiatives across the agency, including monitoring the performance of debt prevention activities and encouraging areas to adopt better debt prevention practices. Things like training call centre operators to an adequate level could assist in this process. Constituents of mine recently applied for top-up payments of their family tax A and B. Because their family had grown so large that they had to move from their home to rented accommodation, these constituents applied for rental assistance back in February but were rejected. Upon receiving their top-up payment, they were advised by a call centre operator that they were entitled to rent assistance, so they applied for it. After being rejected, they made several more calls to Centrelink and received different advice on each occasion. Of course, then they came to my office and pointed out the different advice they had been receiving. To improve leadership and coordination of debt prevention and management initiatives by the debt services team, Centrelink may benefit from reviewing the implementation of debt prevention activities across the network to ascertain better practice. This report goes on and there are a few other areas I would like to explore. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2004-08-05,"—I want to make a few remarks in the adjournment debate tonight on Australia's involvement in the Solomon Islands. Before I do, I would like to respond to some of the comments made by Senator Mackay when she spoke earlier this afternoon on the report of the Standing Committee on Privileges with respect to a recent inquiry into comments made by officers of Telstra before an estimates committee. I have two comments to make.
Senator Mackay did not disguise her disappointment with the committee's findings that there had not been an abuse or a breach of privilege in the comments made by officers of Telstra. She indicated that she felt that a contradiction between what had been said by certain officers of Telstra appearing before the estimates committee and information that appeared in an internal memo of Telstra demonstrated that the comments made by one or both of those officers to the estimates committee were misleading. I think she felt that that was enough to have found that there was a case to answer.
For Senator Mackay's benefit—and I see Senator Ray here and he might wish to make comment about this; I hope I am not pre-empting the chairman's role—certainly as far as the committee was concerned from my point of view, the committee did not find that there was a case of the estimates committee being misled, not particularly on any construction of the state of mind of either of the gentlemen who it was suggested had misled the committee, but rather that there was no evidence put before the Privileges Committee that the information in the internal memo which had been tabled at the estimates committee was more reliable than the comments made by the gentlemen who appeared before it and gave live evidence. That is, there was no indication put to the committee either by Senator Mackay or anybody else to suggest that the information in the internal memo was truthful and, by implication, the information put by the witnesses was false. I might suggest therefore that Senator Mackay considers that question as she next brings a matter to the Privileges Committee. 
Senator Mackay also made comments about the remarks of one of those two gentlemen to a meeting of Telstra employees at some point—I think she said it was in Melbourne. It was alleged that a particular officer of Telstra made disparaging comments about the estimates committee and its members and referred to members of the committee as `Judge Judys'. I should say at the outset that I do not support people referring to members of committees of the Senate in disparaging ways and I certainly would not expect behaviour of that kind from officers of statutory bodies in which the Australian taxpayer has a considerable interest. But I simply draw Senator Mackay's attention to the irony of what was occurring in her remarks. She spent the first part of her speech making some fairly serious reflections on the two gentlemen concerned, one of whom was responsible for the remarks in Melbourne. She implied, if not actually said, that one or both of the gentlemen had misled the estimates committee if not deliberately then recklessly or accidentally. She then went on to comment about reflections from one of those persons on the estimates committee members at the meeting in Melbourne. Of course, in doing so she was making disparaging comments about that person in much the same way that he allegedly had made disparaging comments about her and her colleagues, the difference between the two being that she was able to make those remarks today and previously in this chamber with the protection of parliamentary privilege—a protection which the gentleman concerned did not have when he made those remarks in Melbourne.
However, that was not the main purpose of my rising to speak on the adjournment debate tonight. I want to talk about the contribution of Australians in the Solomon Islands. Members of this place will be well aware of the work of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, RAMSI, in their efforts under Operation Helpem Fren. In early 2003 most Australians were aware of the horrors of civil unrest occurring in the Solomons and later became aware of Australia's military and paramilitary intervention in that nation. However, I believe that our achievements in respect of that operation have been somewhat overshadowed by other events. In this place we focus very often on our shortcomings as a nation and in those circumstances we tend to sweep under the carpet our national successes. I believe that what we have achieved in the Solomon Islands is certainly a national success and ought not to be overlooked. 
Australia's presence in the Solomon Islands began with a resolution passed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Australia's involvement in the Solomon Islands began with the arrival of personnel of the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service when it was clear that such intervention was supported by the people of the Solomon Islands and, indeed, the parliament and the government of the Solomon Islands. It was also, incidentally, an action that was supported by New Zealand and by the Pacific Islands Forum.
Our involvement in the Solomons I think was welcomed very clearly by the people of the Solomon Islands. They saw the involvement of a peacekeeping force as not only necessary but also a welcome displacement of what had pretty obviously been roving gangs of criminals in the Solomon Islands community. That involvement made a vital contribution to the security of that nation and to the security of the entire region. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's assessment of the position in the Solomon Islands before the intervention was very dire. A young naval officer wrote to me about what was occurring in that military operation and he remarked: 
For us serving personnel it is great to see we are welcomed everywhere we go. Australia must continue to support our South Pacific friends because whether we like it or not, they do look to us for support. The Solomon Islands are full of a wonderful people with much to offer in the way of culture and friendship. 
Of course, the job in the Solomon Islands is not completed yet—not by a long shot. The focus of the mission at this stage is sustainability and self-reliance for Solomon Islanders. We have provided a safe and secure environment in which hopefully the people of the Solomons will rebuild a stable system of government. That is a matter that they have to work out for themselves. The transformation in the Solomons by virtue of the very careful, meticulous and effective work of members of our Defence Force has been most marked.
It is particularly worth observing the role of the Australian Federal Police. It has been very significant. Many officers of the Federal Police in the ACT have taken part in that operation. They have transposed their skills as people providing law and order on the streets of Canberra into a very different environment in the Solomon Islands and they have done so extremely effectively. Our general involvement in the Solomons has been a far cry from either gunboat diplomacy or latter-day colonialism but I believe it does great credit to Australia and to the serving men and women who took part in that operation at a number of levels. I hope that there will be opportunities in the future for Australia to properly recognise the contribution that they have made in securing peace in that country and stability in our region.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Solomon Islands</title>,Adjournment,25,1,speech
