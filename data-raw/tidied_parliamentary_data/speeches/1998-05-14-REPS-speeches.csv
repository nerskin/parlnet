"Campbell, Graeme, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I move:
That the Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997, Nos. 400 and 401, made under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, be disallowed.
In moving this motion for disallowance I am taking advantage of one of the few options that Independents have in this House to bring attention to the situation that exists in Australia, where I believe Australia's national interests are simply not recognised by the government. If this section is not passed, control of advertising would become the province of the TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration. While I do not think this is good, I think it might bring things to a climax because I think their heavy-handed style would have to be countered, particularly in view of the fact that we now operate in this free trade zone with New Zealand. If it is passed, however, the control of advertising will rest with the collegiate of the Proprietary Medicines Association and the Nutritious Foods Association, which would probably be a better outcome.
Under the present situation, I find that there is an unnecessary heavy hand placed on the advertising and promotion of alternative medicines. This is another example of the nanny state. I think people overwhelmingly should have the right and have the ability to 
 discern for themselves whether alternative medicines are working for them or not. In this regard I do not discount the placebo effect. If people think a thing is working for them then it is to all intents and purposes doing just that. Under the present situation herbs such as feverfew cannot be advertised as helping to prevent migraines but they can be advertised as helping to reduce the pain of migraines. It is quite clear they have no effect whatsoever in reducing the pain of migraine, but for many people I think they do help to stop the onset of migraine. It seems to me absolutely ludicrous that the company is not allowed to advertise what they believe the real purpose of this herb is. As a herb I think it has few side effects, unlike many other drugs in this category, and should be free from these sorts of restraints.
We also have the situation that in New Zealand, which has a very liberal view of those matters, manufacturers of proprietary medicines and these sorts of herbal remedies do not have to meet the conditions that are met in Australia, yet they are free to sell in Australia, which gives them a big advantage over Australia manufacturers. This is just another example of the much lauded and illusionary level playing field.
I am taking this opportunity of opposing this to highlight what I see as the unnecessary bureaucratic interference in these drugs. Let us look at vitamins. You cannot advertise vitamins unless you say on the label that they will have no effect unless you have a vitamin deficiency in the diet. There is substantial evidence to say that this is not true. There is substantial evidence that says that large doses of vitamin C are very efficacious in preventing the onset of quite a lot of human problems, including the common cold. There is evidence that vitamin E has therapeutic effects which go beyond merely having adequate amounts in the diet. So here we have a situation where the advertising is in fact advertising an untruth by government mandate.
I believe we should be taking a much more liberal view of this situation and I believe the Australian public is well able to discern. They are not for long going to buy snake oil, and 
 in fact there are already in place under other acts remedies for people who advertise things that do not do what they claim. I think it is just unnecessary to have this very expensive interface of the Therapeutic Goods Administration in there impacting heavily on the costs. I know that one manufacturer of herbal remedies said that their costs had risen astronomically, from something like $2,000 a year to $250,000 a year in compliance costs. For others I believe it is even more severe.
We have a crisis in medicine where people are unable to get into hospitals for elective surgery in many areas and where there is a continual blow-out in medical costs. If people are convinced and satisfied that this is an alternate to the expensive medical system, then I believe it ought to be encouraged. The fact is that we do everything we can to impede this business, and one has to ask why this is done. Is it done at the behest of the medical profession? Certainly a dinosaur like the AMA may be opposing it, but there are many doctors I know who simply say, `If it works, use it.' Is it zealous pharmacists? I do not think so, because pharmacists are in fact one of the big outlets for this sort of medicine. It is hard to say exactly why we are putting all this impediment in the way of these types of remedies.
I had my attention drawn to one proprietary brand, the name of which I have forgotten for the moment. It is a very effective laxative. This has now been put under very strict control, and it is going to become a doctor's only prescription. On two occasions it was prescribed by doctors to very elderly people who died as a result of it. To administer extreme laxatives—it is a very effective laxative—to 90-year-olds does seem to me to be rather foolish. But the effects of this particular herb were known and it was administered by registered medical practitioners, and one has to question why we should have what I consider to be this overreaction—putting this on a list where it can be prescribed only by medical practitioners. After all, there are many people killed in the everyday practice of medicine, and these sorts of accidents do happen. As I say, the effects were known. They were clearly written on the label. It is 
 probably a fact that it should not have been prescribed in the first place under those circumstances.
I know that we are in a sense tilting at windmills—that I am not going to be able to stop this regulation. It may, in the short term, be a good thing that the power to control advertising goes to the collegiate, who are certainly more sympathetic to the industry than the Therapeutic Goods Administration, but I do believe that we as a nation have to have a very close look at what I consider the nanny state interference of decisions that should be made in the normal course of events by ordinary people.
Given that the side effects of most of these preparations are far fewer than prescriptions used in the alternative, I would suggest that it would make for a safer, healthier society if their use was encouraged. I might add that many of these things which we are deeming to be drugs should more properly be looked at as nutritious foods and treated under totally different legislation. I believe that we have a high standard in the preparation of our nutritious foods and herbal remedies in Australia. There is potentially a very large overseas market, and I believe it is not going to develop under the draconian hand and pressure that is put on it by legislation which gives so much power to the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
All I ask is that this parliament look very closely at legislation that comes before it, that it not simply rubber-stamp the will of executive government—and this happens in all the major parties—and that members actually look at the consequences of their actions and give more care to how they vote on these matters. It is a very simple proposition, and I do not intend to take the 20 minutes allotted to me. I have had a lot of correspondence on this issue. It is a concern to a lot of people, and I believe that it should have had a lot more consideration in the parliament than it was originally given.

"Bradford, John, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I second the motion. It is not entirely clear to me exactly what is occurring here, but I understood that this matter was coming 
 back to the House of Representatives as a result of the decision which was taken in the Senate to disallow these regulations. If that is the case, I am a bit surprised that the opposition is now going to vote with the government on this particular issue. In the position in which I now find myself in this place, I am on a very steep learning curve as to how to deal with these matters. I am seconding the motion of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) simply because I believe he is right. That may be an unusual way to operate in this place; I have lived with a system where one essentially does—pretty much as the member for Kalgoorlie suggests—what one is told to do in the situation. But if I am correct, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth) will take the opportunity to correct me if I am not, this deals essentially with the regulations in respect of the issue of `drug free'.
I have just been reminded that I am in the wrong seat. All of this is new to me. That is probably why you failed to recognise me properly, Mr Speaker.
—I know the honourable member for McPherson's heart is in the right place, even though his body may not be.
—This is only my second day in my new seat here and, as I said, I am on a very steep learning curve. I hope the parliamentary secretary will correct me if I am wrong but I understand—and with the resources available to me it is hard to get up to speed on these things—that this deals with the issue coming back from the Senate; that is, the Senate's determination to oppose these particular regulations.
Be that as it may, I happen to believe very strongly that the member for Kalgoorlie is absolutely right in everything that he says. I do not find it easy to stand in this place and agree with him because for the almost nine years I have been here—and he has been here throughout that time—we probably have not agreed on anything at all. But it does underline for me the importance of the new role I have taken on in this place, which is that one actually listens to what other members say and attempts to evaluate what they say to take 
 some sort of decent and intellectually honest approach to what they have said.
I believe that, in this particular area, the government has got it wrong. Like the member for Kalgoorlie, I am very suspicious of why they are going down this track. I notice in the latest budget there is mention of the government's commitment to what it calls preventative health. One would have thought that that would be consistently reflected in their approach to these sorts of issues, but it is not.
All of the input that I have had in this particular area makes me wonder about what is actually going on. I am not much into conspiracy theories. Although in the time that I have been a member of this place I suppose I have heard them all, I generally manage to discount them very heavily. But in this particular area there is evidence that there is some sort of a conspiracy here against the, broadly speaking, alternative professions and against the interests of people who want to choose what is best for their own health care.
If we are really committed to preventative medicine then we ought to take seriously the alternative options that are available to people outside of traditional or, more correctly, modern medical care and access to drugs. My experience in this area leads me to believe very strongly that these alternatives are good for people. More importantly, speaking as an ex-Liberal, people ought to be able to make choices about access to those forms of care rather than have the heavy hand of government come down on them and tell them that they simply cannot make those choices or, worse, tell them that they need the government to tell them what is good for them and to make it difficult for them to make those choices.
In the end it is all about getting information about the availability of these treatments and remedies. Yes, there is a public interest involved and that, of course, is the crux of the issue. I assume that is what leads to this particular debate this morning. People, up to a point, need to be protected and there needs to be in place a reasonable regime to ensure that the information they are given is correct and that they are not given misleading infor 
 mation about medicines, such as herbal, homoeopathic, and vitamin and mineral preparations, which may mislead them or give them advice which may ultimately be contrary to their best health interests.
I wonder what is going on here. I have had a lot of input into this particular subject, obviously like the member for Kalgoorlie has and I assume like a lot of other members of this place have. But, as with a lot of these issues that come up, often members, because they are so busy with a lot of other things which ironically turn out to be fairly peripheral when you are not having to deal with them all the time, do not give them adequate attention.
I need to say—because I am sure the parliamentary secretary will raise it—that I have had some input from Mr Joshua Shaw, who runs a company called Bionic Products and who happens to be a constituent of mine. Frankly, I have not taken a great deal of notice of Mr Shaw. I think he has been responsible for a lot of misinformation in this particular area. I have told him so. I have known him for many years and I am aware of his product. I do not want to take advantage of the privilege of this place by saying anything negative about his product. There may be, as the member for Kalgoorlie said, a placebo effect there but other documentary evidence I have seen shown shows that his product does have some beneficial effects for some people with some conditions. So I do not make a judgment particularly about that but I do want to place on the record, in case there should be any misapprehension, that I am not driven to speak in this particular instance on behalf of a constituent who has been very vocal but nevertheless has misrepresented the situation to a very large extent. That, of course, has quite correctly been taken to task by a number of people in the various associations that represent the manufacturers of vitamins and some of these other products.
Having said that, I do share the member for Kalgoorlie's concern about who is actually making these decisions. Unfortunately I will not have the opportunity to hear from the parliamentary secretary until after I have 
 spoken but I hope that she will make it clear what the government's ultimate concern is about the use of the words `drug free' because it seems to me that the inherent benefit of these particular remedies is that they can claim to be drug free.
I believe they ought to be able to make that claim because there is a distinction between what is a drug and what is not a drug. I do not think it is fair to attempt to enforce regulations which have the intention of preventing people claiming their product is drug free. I do not think it is fair and I do think that it is correct for that sort of regime to be forced on people.
I have got a healthy scepticism about the major drug companies in this country. I realise they are substantial businesses, they are substantial employers. They also have substantial clout—and here I am talking about political clout—and influence and of course everything that goes with those things. They have a lot of money behind them. They have a vested interest in maintaining their dominance of a very big market. I do not have any particular philosophical problems with people in free enterprise doing whatever they can to enhance the worth of their products or promote their products, but in this particular case they enjoy a very privileged position because to a very large extent by virtue of a lot of regulations and laws their regime is protected and entrenched.
For many years I have observed the valiant effort made by these so-called drug companies to prevent the incursion of all the alternatives into that particular marketplace. They have at times done it dishonestly, I suppose it would be fair to say, but they have certainly fought a major battle to prevent people being attracted to alternative treatments or non-drug treatments such as vitamins and a whole range of mineral-type remedies.
I said I am sceptical—I think it is a healthy scepticism. But I am particularly sceptical—I think the member for Kalgoorlie alluded to this, and again the parliamentary secretary may want to correct me on this, if I am wrong—about the fact that they have the numbers, as it were, for the regulatory regime that is in place. There is some concern within 
 the alternative industry that having to deal with a regime or an authority that is stacked against them is not exactly playing on an even playing field.
The other side of the whole issue is the availability of non-traditional forms of treatment. It is amazing when we look back over the years as history has unfolded how things have changed. At one stage, for instance, the chiropractor was regarded by the traditional medical profession as being something of a quack. That has of course changed dramatically in recent years. Now the average general practitioner is not unhappy in a lot of cases about referring a particular patient to a chiropractor who has specialised training in a particular type of care. The same might be said of acupuncture. I can remember that it was not very long ago when acupuncture was regarded as being a fairly extreme form of treatment. Now it is almost considered to be mainstream. In fact, not only do medical practitioners refer people for that sort of treatment in a lot of cases but also they are trained to be able to administer that sort of treatment.
I second the motion by the member for Kalgoorlie because I think he is simply right about this. I do not want to reflect adversely on the parliamentary secretary, but I think that this debate has been dominated by the powers that be: the drug companies which have a huge vested interest in preventing an incursion into their market by the manufacturers of vitamins and mineral therapies, and to some extent the medical profession.
Again, I do not want to reflect on the medical profession because I think they have got a number of genuine grievances against the government at the moment, and I share most of their concerns about the way the government has handled health. In fact, despite the latest budget I still see health as being one of the major Achilles heels of this particular government. However, let us face it: the doctors, the medical profession, are a very powerful and influential lobby understandably and, up to a point, quite correctly so. But when the medical profession and the drug companies combine to look after their own interests—legitimate up to a point as 
 those interests may be—one must in the end be suspicious about who has won the day as far as the political debate in this particular area is concerned. I wonder.
I have had letters from people about this. Even while I was a member of the government I was honest enough to say to them, `This doesn't all add up. There's something missing here, and one finds it very difficult to get to the bottom of what it actually is.' I do not know whether the opposition has sorted itself out on this issue yet. My understanding may be wrong about what the opposition actually joined in opposing in the Senate. If my understanding is different from what is happening here this morning, then I apologise for taking up the time of the House. But I want to support the member for Kalgoorlie in what he actually said. I am not entirely sure what he is trying to do, but I agree with what he had to say on this particular matter.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Amendment) Legislation</title>,Private Members' Business,4,1,speech
"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—I will be very brief. The motion moved by the member for Kalgoorlie seeks disallowance of statutory rules Nos. 400 and 401 made under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The opposition initiated action in the Senate to disallow statutory rule No. 401. The motion was moved by Senator Forshaw, one of the Labor senators from New South Wales, and had the support of the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine. It was one of the few occasions on which we actually had the numbers in the Senate to carry a positive motion. So, for the information of the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), statutory rule No. 401 has been disallowed because of the Labor Party's initiative in the Senate. That effectively means that unless the minister takes another action some time in the future people are allowed to use the expression `drug free' on vitamins, herbal supplements and other substances.
The Parliament Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth) might like to dispute that—I welcome any advice she has to the contrary—but my understanding is that, because the motion on statutory rule No. 401 was carried, the government's initiatives which were gazetted just before Christmas are overturned. That means that 
 statutory rule No. 400 is the only thing we are discussing this morning.
When this came up in the Senate we made it clear that we had concerns about supporting a proposal to disallow statutory rule No. 400 because that would in effect mean that we had minimal regulation in this whole area. Unfortunately there are some people who do make unfounded claims about some of these non-drug supplements. We need to make sure that people do not claim that they can cure cancer or make people look handsome or beautiful.
—Or grow hair!
—Or grow hair, as the member for McPherson interjects with a frown on his face. We believe that a fair position for the opposition to take is to initiate disallowing 401, which we did in the Senate, but we do not believe that it would be right to strike down 400. The reason we think 400 is needed is that, due to some changes initiated by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, we do not have the process of the Advertising Standards Council looking at advertisements that are placed in the media.
We do have some concerns about the fact that the government has increased the scope of regulation with 400, but if we voted to strike down 400 we would leave the community at risk of being misled by a very small proportion of people who are at the extreme edge of this industry who make unfounded claims. That is the reason the opposition will be voting against the motion of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. We have succeeded in knocking over 401, but we do not support disallowing 400.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Amendment) Legislation</title>,Private Members' Business,4,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I will not take too much of the House's time, but I thought I had better put on the record the fact that I, like most members I gather in this place, have received numerous submissions from people on this matter. It is important to remember some comments made in this House in question time by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) several months ago when fiercely defending—and I agree with him—generic drugs that have been put in place, particularly as lower cost drugs available to pensioners, so that the cost on the public purse of providing drugs for the 
 community can be reduced. But, in defending that, he made reference, if I remember correctly, to the lobbying that goes on—I think it was on the golf course—between the medical profession and drug company executives. That should be kept in mind when we are looking at this issue.
As this problem erupted, with letters coming in—they were form letters too, I must admit—from many of the people outraged at these changes, I, my wife and a friend and others were involved in not only investigating but seriously looking at the efficacy and the literature and the questioning that were going on in the medical profession both here and overseas not only about the treatment for women undergoing menopause, and all of the problems associated with that, but also about the rapid increase in the occurrence of breast cancer. Despite our best endeavours, it is a scourge that is biting deeper into the ranks of our women. The medical profession, particularly the established and traditional drug companies, do not appear to be able to come up with anything except a hormone replacement therapy which is being seriously questioned by experts in the field.
If you listen carefully and read the literature, there is a lot being said about the counterproductive nature of hormone replacement treatment. There are some very sound reasons, I believe from what I have heard, for the use of naturally occurring progesterones and other products to balance the system at this time in a woman's life. They also offer a means by which the body's hormonal balance can be re-established without artificial upset. According to my reading, that in turn exacerbates the trend towards the emergence of breast cancer particularly and other diseases.
I have grave doubts about the clout and the motives of the drug companies particularly, and the medical profession, although many parts of that profession are seriously looking at an alternative drug regime—for natural therapies and treatments that are available. I was discussing this with one of my friends at Christmas last year. With the onset of menopause an absolutely suicidal period emerged in her life. It was quite a fluke that she came 
 across this alternative option. We all know about the products that are on sale. Commercially they are being picked up more and more. You only have to look at the racks of the supermarket shelves: commercial producers have seen the value and the demand out there for soya products, one source of alternative and naturally occurring products that the body requires to establish equilibrium.
There are real difficulties out there about the experimental nature of the drugs on offer. The member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and the member for Kalgoorlie have said that the drug companies and the medical profession generally are in a state of constant experimentation, and women particularly do not want to be experimented with. There are many women out there who are wise and well read. They are following the debate on this issue and they know that there are real prospects for the long-term re-establishment of a healthier equilibrium in their bodies through some of these products. If there is any means to try to exclude the advertising of such products—without any outrageous claims of cure; nobody can claim that and we are not arguing that—or any means devised to prevent those products from being presented as efficiently, as widely and as honestly as possible to the general public, I will oppose them to my last breath.
I have not seen enough in this revision of the code. From what I understand, I think the Labor Party is talking about one section only of this advertising code. I think they should rethink it and support the member for Kalgoorlie's disallowance motion as well to ensure that this whole area is looked at far more closely before we accede to what I believe are the demands of the vested interests and the drug companies.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Amendment) Legislation</title>,Private Members' Business,4,1,speech
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—While I am disappointed that the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has chosen to move a disallowance motion against two important amendments to the therapeutic goods regulations, this disallowance debate does provide me with an opportunity to explain the importance of protecting public health and safety 
 and ensuring that the public is protected from false, misleading and unsafe advertising of therapeutic goods.
The member for Calare (Mr Andren) has raised some important issues. Should he not be convinced at the end of what I have to say this morning, then I am happy to have the department provide him with a briefing because hormone replacement therapy is not part of anything to do with this; it is all about public health and safety. I share his concerns about public health and safety and, on the record, offer to provide him—or for that matter any other Independent—with a briefing.
The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) identified correctly that these issues have been canvassed in the Senate. I am happy to put the following issues on the record for the benefit of this House. The member for Dobell mentioned regulation 401 and said that it would now be okay, given the ALP's stand on this, for companies to describe and advertise their products as `drug free'. It might be appropriate for me to actually warn that they could try to describe their product as drug free but they would end up then in legal argument, because all that regulation 401 was trying to do was to clarify Labor's legislation on this. It is the previous Labor government's legislation that in fact prohibits describing drugs as `drug free'. Because there had been legal argument about that, the government sought to clarify that situation and assist all parties involved. That is just a matter of clarification.
As has been said, the Senate disallowed statutory rule No. 401 on 31 March 1998. This disallowance was an example of the political point scoring that occurred despite wide-ranging support for this regulatory change by consumers, public health experts, complementary medicine practitioners and some sectors of industry.
Prior to the disallowance of statutory rule No. 401 and in response to community confusion, which I can see has been carried further here today, about the implications of this amendment, the government established a special committee to examine the use of the term `drug free'. The committee is made up of all key stakeholders on this issue. For the 
 record, the members of this committee are: Professor Dave Roberts, Chair of the Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee and Professor of Nutrition; Ms Juliet Seifert, Chair of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code Council; Ms Val Johanson, Executive Director of the NFAA; Professor Lloyd Sansom, Chair of the Australian Pharmaceutical Advisory Council and Professor of Pharmacology; Mr Matt O'Neil, Australian Consumers Association; Ms Janne Graham, Consumers Health Forum; Dr Giselle Cooke, Australian Comprehensive Medicines Association/Natural Herbalists Association of Australia; Dr Robert Grace, President, Australian Committee of Natural Therapies; Dr Sue Wicker, Royal Australian College of General Practitioners; Ms Bronwyn Capanna, Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia; and Mr Kerry Bone, Chief Executive Officer, MediHerb Pty Ltd.
While there are some who have tried to imply that this committee is biased and is simply a TGA committee looking at the TGA, when you consider the names and qualifications of members of the committee, it is obvious that these criticisms arise out of ignorance, deliberate attempts at political point scoring or even attempts by a small section of industry to seek political, and therefore commercial, advantage from these claims. The committee reported to me last Friday, 8 May 1998, and I will be tabling the report together with the government's response. I take this opportunity to thank the committee in examining the use of the term `drug free' for their detailed consideration of this issue.
To return now to what we are really on about today, despite the confusion of the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) of the issue, most people would agree that we need controls to ensure that the public are protected from false, misleading and unsafe advertising. Statutory rule No. 400—which is the important part of today's debate because No. 401 has already been disallowed in the Senate—provides for the proprietary and complementary medicines industries to approve advertising for their products in the mainstream print media and provides the mechanism by which the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code may 
 be reviewed and updated to reflect the views of health professionals, industry, advertisers and the community. I state again that this is the proprietary and complementary medicines industries, not the TGA, as has been claimed here today.
These are important changes, requested by industry, which deliver consistent application of the advertising code across the industry. Unfortunately, there has been much misinformation about these changes distributed to the public over the past few months. This has caused unnecessary confusion in the community about the access to information about complementary medicines and I suspect that the disallowance motion moved by the member for Kalgoorlie is the result of his and the member for McPherson's confusion about changes to these regulations.
In setting the record straight on these amendments and highlighting the many positive outcomes of these amendments, it would be useful to provide the House with a short history of the advertising code. Guidelines to control advertising of therapeutic goods in Australia have been around since 1972. Since then, advertising controls have been endorsed and administered jointly by industry and government. This code prohibits advertising of therapeutic goods for serious medical conditions which require advice and/or monitoring from health professionals. Examples of that are asthma, heart conditions or depression. It allows advertising of therapeutic goods for the treatment of minor conditions which generally do not require consultation with a health professional. It does not apply to advertisements in publications solely for health professionals. It is reviewed regularly to keep it up to date with community expectations and advances in medical and scientific technology.
The Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code has been developed by the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code Council, comprising representatives from consumer groups, industry, health care professionals and government. One representative only from the following organisations are members of this council, which I will read for the benefit of those who have been confused over this and assume that 
 it is the TGA: the Nutritional Foods Association of Australia, the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia, the Australian Direct Marketing Association, the Direct Sellers Association of Australia, the Australian Association of National Advertisers, the Advertising Federation of Australia, the Australian Consumers Association, the Consumers Health Forum, the Australian Traditional Medicines Society, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia or Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
As with the make-up of the drug-free committee, there have been criticisms that this council is biased against the complementary medicines industry. Concerns have also been raised that it is the government that is determining what can and cannot be advertised to consumers about therapeutic goods. Both of these criticisms are unfounded. The recommendations about what should or should not be advertised are decided by the Advertising Code Council, which is broadly based and only provides the government through the TGA with one vote out of 12.
Until the end of 1996, the Media Council of Australia provided the resources for these arrangements. They also supported the system of pre-clearance of print advertisements for products, including therapeutic goods, by the Australian Print Bureau. In September of 1996 the Media Council advised that they would be disbanding the system and structure of co-regulation of advertising. An alternative system, therefore, had to be established for the pre-clearance of print advertisements and for the maintenance and update of the therapeutic goods advertising code. The government made the decision that the industry organisations, the PMAA and the NFAA, should take over responsibility for the pre-clearance of the print advertisements, in line with the effective co-regulation of advertising in the broadcast media.
The industry organisations, with the support of the TGA, also submitted proposals to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for authorisation to administer the code, and to establish the new code council 
 and appropriate complaint and appeal handling mechanisms. Such authorisation was granted subject to any application for review. Such an application for review was made, and during the subsequent hearings on the authorisation the Australian Competition Tribunal suggested that the industry bodies—I stress this—would have difficulty enforcing the guidelines for advertising unless the sanctions were underpinned by legislation.
So in October 1997 the Nutritional Food Association of Australia and the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia asked the government to formalise the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code through Commonwealth regulation—the government responding to a request from industry. Those regulations were gazetted in December of last year and are being considered today. They provide for the establishment of a new advertising code council and an associated complaints resolution panel and for regulatory support for industry pre-clearance of print advertisement.
So what we have here are regulatory exchanges which are designed to support a system of advertising control which is based on the system that has worked well for industry, government and advertisers since the early 1970s. I can assure the parliament and those members who have been confused about this that the new regulation does not change the existing controls on advertising, does not alter the manner in which consumers or health professionals can obtain therapeutic goods, does not change the existing powers to stop breaches of the advertising code, does not change the right to review decisions through the minister and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, does not allow drug companies to exert major control over the advertising code, does not propose a new advertising code, does allow the proprietary and complementary medicines industries to make decisions about advertising of their own products and does allow consumers, industry and health professionals to have a say in the review and updating of the advertising code.
I could go on quoting letters from the industry bodies to support what I have said here today, but I think the time of the House 
 has been overtaken by the number of speakers on this matter. So I move:

"Campbell, Graeme, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I move:
That the Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997, Nos. 400 and 401, made under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, be disallowed.
In moving this motion for disallowance I am taking advantage of one of the few options that Independents have in this House to bring attention to the situation that exists in Australia, where I believe Australia's national interests are simply not recognised by the government. If this section is not passed, control of advertising would become the province of the TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration. While I do not think this is good, I think it might bring things to a climax because I think their heavy-handed style would have to be countered, particularly in view of the fact that we now operate in this free trade zone with New Zealand. If it is passed, however, the control of advertising will rest with the collegiate of the Proprietary Medicines Association and the Nutritious Foods Association, which would probably be a better outcome.
Under the present situation, I find that there is an unnecessary heavy hand placed on the advertising and promotion of alternative medicines. This is another example of the nanny state. I think people overwhelmingly should have the right and have the ability to 
 discern for themselves whether alternative medicines are working for them or not. In this regard I do not discount the placebo effect. If people think a thing is working for them then it is to all intents and purposes doing just that. Under the present situation herbs such as feverfew cannot be advertised as helping to prevent migraines but they can be advertised as helping to reduce the pain of migraines. It is quite clear they have no effect whatsoever in reducing the pain of migraine, but for many people I think they do help to stop the onset of migraine. It seems to me absolutely ludicrous that the company is not allowed to advertise what they believe the real purpose of this herb is. As a herb I think it has few side effects, unlike many other drugs in this category, and should be free from these sorts of restraints.
We also have the situation that in New Zealand, which has a very liberal view of those matters, manufacturers of proprietary medicines and these sorts of herbal remedies do not have to meet the conditions that are met in Australia, yet they are free to sell in Australia, which gives them a big advantage over Australia manufacturers. This is just another example of the much lauded and illusionary level playing field.
I am taking this opportunity of opposing this to highlight what I see as the unnecessary bureaucratic interference in these drugs. Let us look at vitamins. You cannot advertise vitamins unless you say on the label that they will have no effect unless you have a vitamin deficiency in the diet. There is substantial evidence to say that this is not true. There is substantial evidence that says that large doses of vitamin C are very efficacious in preventing the onset of quite a lot of human problems, including the common cold. There is evidence that vitamin E has therapeutic effects which go beyond merely having adequate amounts in the diet. So here we have a situation where the advertising is in fact advertising an untruth by government mandate.
I believe we should be taking a much more liberal view of this situation and I believe the Australian public is well able to discern. They are not for long going to buy snake oil, and 
 in fact there are already in place under other acts remedies for people who advertise things that do not do what they claim. I think it is just unnecessary to have this very expensive interface of the Therapeutic Goods Administration in there impacting heavily on the costs. I know that one manufacturer of herbal remedies said that their costs had risen astronomically, from something like $2,000 a year to $250,000 a year in compliance costs. For others I believe it is even more severe.
We have a crisis in medicine where people are unable to get into hospitals for elective surgery in many areas and where there is a continual blow-out in medical costs. If people are convinced and satisfied that this is an alternate to the expensive medical system, then I believe it ought to be encouraged. The fact is that we do everything we can to impede this business, and one has to ask why this is done. Is it done at the behest of the medical profession? Certainly a dinosaur like the AMA may be opposing it, but there are many doctors I know who simply say, `If it works, use it.' Is it zealous pharmacists? I do not think so, because pharmacists are in fact one of the big outlets for this sort of medicine. It is hard to say exactly why we are putting all this impediment in the way of these types of remedies.
I had my attention drawn to one proprietary brand, the name of which I have forgotten for the moment. It is a very effective laxative. This has now been put under very strict control, and it is going to become a doctor's only prescription. On two occasions it was prescribed by doctors to very elderly people who died as a result of it. To administer extreme laxatives—it is a very effective laxative—to 90-year-olds does seem to me to be rather foolish. But the effects of this particular herb were known and it was administered by registered medical practitioners, and one has to question why we should have what I consider to be this overreaction—putting this on a list where it can be prescribed only by medical practitioners. After all, there are many people killed in the everyday practice of medicine, and these sorts of accidents do happen. As I say, the effects were known. They were clearly written on the label. It is 
 probably a fact that it should not have been prescribed in the first place under those circumstances.
I know that we are in a sense tilting at windmills—that I am not going to be able to stop this regulation. It may, in the short term, be a good thing that the power to control advertising goes to the collegiate, who are certainly more sympathetic to the industry than the Therapeutic Goods Administration, but I do believe that we as a nation have to have a very close look at what I consider the nanny state interference of decisions that should be made in the normal course of events by ordinary people.
Given that the side effects of most of these preparations are far fewer than prescriptions used in the alternative, I would suggest that it would make for a safer, healthier society if their use was encouraged. I might add that many of these things which we are deeming to be drugs should more properly be looked at as nutritious foods and treated under totally different legislation. I believe that we have a high standard in the preparation of our nutritious foods and herbal remedies in Australia. There is potentially a very large overseas market, and I believe it is not going to develop under the draconian hand and pressure that is put on it by legislation which gives so much power to the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
All I ask is that this parliament look very closely at legislation that comes before it, that it not simply rubber-stamp the will of executive government—and this happens in all the major parties—and that members actually look at the consequences of their actions and give more care to how they vote on these matters. It is a very simple proposition, and I do not intend to take the 20 minutes allotted to me. I have had a lot of correspondence on this issue. It is a concern to a lot of people, and I believe that it should have had a lot more consideration in the parliament than it was originally given.
—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Private Members' Business,4,2,speech
"Bradford, John, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I second the motion. It is not entirely clear to me exactly what is occurring here, but I understood that this matter was coming 
 back to the House of Representatives as a result of the decision which was taken in the Senate to disallow these regulations. If that is the case, I am a bit surprised that the opposition is now going to vote with the government on this particular issue. In the position in which I now find myself in this place, I am on a very steep learning curve as to how to deal with these matters. I am seconding the motion of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) simply because I believe he is right. That may be an unusual way to operate in this place; I have lived with a system where one essentially does—pretty much as the member for Kalgoorlie suggests—what one is told to do in the situation. But if I am correct, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth) will take the opportunity to correct me if I am not, this deals essentially with the regulations in respect of the issue of `drug free'.
I have just been reminded that I am in the wrong seat. All of this is new to me. That is probably why you failed to recognise me properly, Mr Speaker.
—I know the honourable member for McPherson's heart is in the right place, even though his body may not be.
—This is only my second day in my new seat here and, as I said, I am on a very steep learning curve. I hope the parliamentary secretary will correct me if I am wrong but I understand—and with the resources available to me it is hard to get up to speed on these things—that this deals with the issue coming back from the Senate; that is, the Senate's determination to oppose these particular regulations.
Be that as it may, I happen to believe very strongly that the member for Kalgoorlie is absolutely right in everything that he says. I do not find it easy to stand in this place and agree with him because for the almost nine years I have been here—and he has been here throughout that time—we probably have not agreed on anything at all. But it does underline for me the importance of the new role I have taken on in this place, which is that one actually listens to what other members say and attempts to evaluate what they say to take 
 some sort of decent and intellectually honest approach to what they have said.
I believe that, in this particular area, the government has got it wrong. Like the member for Kalgoorlie, I am very suspicious of why they are going down this track. I notice in the latest budget there is mention of the government's commitment to what it calls preventative health. One would have thought that that would be consistently reflected in their approach to these sorts of issues, but it is not.
All of the input that I have had in this particular area makes me wonder about what is actually going on. I am not much into conspiracy theories. Although in the time that I have been a member of this place I suppose I have heard them all, I generally manage to discount them very heavily. But in this particular area there is evidence that there is some sort of a conspiracy here against the, broadly speaking, alternative professions and against the interests of people who want to choose what is best for their own health care.
If we are really committed to preventative medicine then we ought to take seriously the alternative options that are available to people outside of traditional or, more correctly, modern medical care and access to drugs. My experience in this area leads me to believe very strongly that these alternatives are good for people. More importantly, speaking as an ex-Liberal, people ought to be able to make choices about access to those forms of care rather than have the heavy hand of government come down on them and tell them that they simply cannot make those choices or, worse, tell them that they need the government to tell them what is good for them and to make it difficult for them to make those choices.
In the end it is all about getting information about the availability of these treatments and remedies. Yes, there is a public interest involved and that, of course, is the crux of the issue. I assume that is what leads to this particular debate this morning. People, up to a point, need to be protected and there needs to be in place a reasonable regime to ensure that the information they are given is correct and that they are not given misleading infor 
 mation about medicines, such as herbal, homoeopathic, and vitamin and mineral preparations, which may mislead them or give them advice which may ultimately be contrary to their best health interests.
I wonder what is going on here. I have had a lot of input into this particular subject, obviously like the member for Kalgoorlie has and I assume like a lot of other members of this place have. But, as with a lot of these issues that come up, often members, because they are so busy with a lot of other things which ironically turn out to be fairly peripheral when you are not having to deal with them all the time, do not give them adequate attention.
I need to say—because I am sure the parliamentary secretary will raise it—that I have had some input from Mr Joshua Shaw, who runs a company called Bionic Products and who happens to be a constituent of mine. Frankly, I have not taken a great deal of notice of Mr Shaw. I think he has been responsible for a lot of misinformation in this particular area. I have told him so. I have known him for many years and I am aware of his product. I do not want to take advantage of the privilege of this place by saying anything negative about his product. There may be, as the member for Kalgoorlie said, a placebo effect there but other documentary evidence I have seen shown shows that his product does have some beneficial effects for some people with some conditions. So I do not make a judgment particularly about that but I do want to place on the record, in case there should be any misapprehension, that I am not driven to speak in this particular instance on behalf of a constituent who has been very vocal but nevertheless has misrepresented the situation to a very large extent. That, of course, has quite correctly been taken to task by a number of people in the various associations that represent the manufacturers of vitamins and some of these other products.
Having said that, I do share the member for Kalgoorlie's concern about who is actually making these decisions. Unfortunately I will not have the opportunity to hear from the parliamentary secretary until after I have 
 spoken but I hope that she will make it clear what the government's ultimate concern is about the use of the words `drug free' because it seems to me that the inherent benefit of these particular remedies is that they can claim to be drug free.
I believe they ought to be able to make that claim because there is a distinction between what is a drug and what is not a drug. I do not think it is fair to attempt to enforce regulations which have the intention of preventing people claiming their product is drug free. I do not think it is fair and I do think that it is correct for that sort of regime to be forced on people.
I have got a healthy scepticism about the major drug companies in this country. I realise they are substantial businesses, they are substantial employers. They also have substantial clout—and here I am talking about political clout—and influence and of course everything that goes with those things. They have a lot of money behind them. They have a vested interest in maintaining their dominance of a very big market. I do not have any particular philosophical problems with people in free enterprise doing whatever they can to enhance the worth of their products or promote their products, but in this particular case they enjoy a very privileged position because to a very large extent by virtue of a lot of regulations and laws their regime is protected and entrenched.
For many years I have observed the valiant effort made by these so-called drug companies to prevent the incursion of all the alternatives into that particular marketplace. They have at times done it dishonestly, I suppose it would be fair to say, but they have certainly fought a major battle to prevent people being attracted to alternative treatments or non-drug treatments such as vitamins and a whole range of mineral-type remedies.
I said I am sceptical—I think it is a healthy scepticism. But I am particularly sceptical—I think the member for Kalgoorlie alluded to this, and again the parliamentary secretary may want to correct me on this, if I am wrong—about the fact that they have the numbers, as it were, for the regulatory regime that is in place. There is some concern within 
 the alternative industry that having to deal with a regime or an authority that is stacked against them is not exactly playing on an even playing field.
The other side of the whole issue is the availability of non-traditional forms of treatment. It is amazing when we look back over the years as history has unfolded how things have changed. At one stage, for instance, the chiropractor was regarded by the traditional medical profession as being something of a quack. That has of course changed dramatically in recent years. Now the average general practitioner is not unhappy in a lot of cases about referring a particular patient to a chiropractor who has specialised training in a particular type of care. The same might be said of acupuncture. I can remember that it was not very long ago when acupuncture was regarded as being a fairly extreme form of treatment. Now it is almost considered to be mainstream. In fact, not only do medical practitioners refer people for that sort of treatment in a lot of cases but also they are trained to be able to administer that sort of treatment.
I second the motion by the member for Kalgoorlie because I think he is simply right about this. I do not want to reflect adversely on the parliamentary secretary, but I think that this debate has been dominated by the powers that be: the drug companies which have a huge vested interest in preventing an incursion into their market by the manufacturers of vitamins and mineral therapies, and to some extent the medical profession.
Again, I do not want to reflect on the medical profession because I think they have got a number of genuine grievances against the government at the moment, and I share most of their concerns about the way the government has handled health. In fact, despite the latest budget I still see health as being one of the major Achilles heels of this particular government. However, let us face it: the doctors, the medical profession, are a very powerful and influential lobby understandably and, up to a point, quite correctly so. But when the medical profession and the drug companies combine to look after their own interests—legitimate up to a point as 
 those interests may be—one must in the end be suspicious about who has won the day as far as the political debate in this particular area is concerned. I wonder.
I have had letters from people about this. Even while I was a member of the government I was honest enough to say to them, `This doesn't all add up. There's something missing here, and one finds it very difficult to get to the bottom of what it actually is.' I do not know whether the opposition has sorted itself out on this issue yet. My understanding may be wrong about what the opposition actually joined in opposing in the Senate. If my understanding is different from what is happening here this morning, then I apologise for taking up the time of the House. But I want to support the member for Kalgoorlie in what he actually said. I am not entirely sure what he is trying to do, but I agree with what he had to say on this particular matter.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Private Members' Business,4,2,speech
"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—I will be very brief. The motion moved by the member for Kalgoorlie seeks disallowance of statutory rules Nos. 400 and 401 made under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The opposition initiated action in the Senate to disallow statutory rule No. 401. The motion was moved by Senator Forshaw, one of the Labor senators from New South Wales, and had the support of the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine. It was one of the few occasions on which we actually had the numbers in the Senate to carry a positive motion. So, for the information of the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), statutory rule No. 401 has been disallowed because of the Labor Party's initiative in the Senate. That effectively means that unless the minister takes another action some time in the future people are allowed to use the expression `drug free' on vitamins, herbal supplements and other substances.
The Parliament Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth) might like to dispute that—I welcome any advice she has to the contrary—but my understanding is that, because the motion on statutory rule No. 401 was carried, the government's initiatives which were gazetted just before Christmas are overturned. That means that 
 statutory rule No. 400 is the only thing we are discussing this morning.
When this came up in the Senate we made it clear that we had concerns about supporting a proposal to disallow statutory rule No. 400 because that would in effect mean that we had minimal regulation in this whole area. Unfortunately there are some people who do make unfounded claims about some of these non-drug supplements. We need to make sure that people do not claim that they can cure cancer or make people look handsome or beautiful.
—Or grow hair!
—Or grow hair, as the member for McPherson interjects with a frown on his face. We believe that a fair position for the opposition to take is to initiate disallowing 401, which we did in the Senate, but we do not believe that it would be right to strike down 400. The reason we think 400 is needed is that, due to some changes initiated by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, we do not have the process of the Advertising Standards Council looking at advertisements that are placed in the media.
We do have some concerns about the fact that the government has increased the scope of regulation with 400, but if we voted to strike down 400 we would leave the community at risk of being misled by a very small proportion of people who are at the extreme edge of this industry who make unfounded claims. That is the reason the opposition will be voting against the motion of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. We have succeeded in knocking over 401, but we do not support disallowing 400.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Private Members' Business,4,2,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I will not take too much of the House's time, but I thought I had better put on the record the fact that I, like most members I gather in this place, have received numerous submissions from people on this matter. It is important to remember some comments made in this House in question time by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) several months ago when fiercely defending—and I agree with him—generic drugs that have been put in place, particularly as lower cost drugs available to pensioners, so that the cost on the public purse of providing drugs for the 
 community can be reduced. But, in defending that, he made reference, if I remember correctly, to the lobbying that goes on—I think it was on the golf course—between the medical profession and drug company executives. That should be kept in mind when we are looking at this issue.
As this problem erupted, with letters coming in—they were form letters too, I must admit—from many of the people outraged at these changes, I, my wife and a friend and others were involved in not only investigating but seriously looking at the efficacy and the literature and the questioning that were going on in the medical profession both here and overseas not only about the treatment for women undergoing menopause, and all of the problems associated with that, but also about the rapid increase in the occurrence of breast cancer. Despite our best endeavours, it is a scourge that is biting deeper into the ranks of our women. The medical profession, particularly the established and traditional drug companies, do not appear to be able to come up with anything except a hormone replacement therapy which is being seriously questioned by experts in the field.
If you listen carefully and read the literature, there is a lot being said about the counterproductive nature of hormone replacement treatment. There are some very sound reasons, I believe from what I have heard, for the use of naturally occurring progesterones and other products to balance the system at this time in a woman's life. They also offer a means by which the body's hormonal balance can be re-established without artificial upset. According to my reading, that in turn exacerbates the trend towards the emergence of breast cancer particularly and other diseases.
I have grave doubts about the clout and the motives of the drug companies particularly, and the medical profession, although many parts of that profession are seriously looking at an alternative drug regime—for natural therapies and treatments that are available. I was discussing this with one of my friends at Christmas last year. With the onset of menopause an absolutely suicidal period emerged in her life. It was quite a fluke that she came 
 across this alternative option. We all know about the products that are on sale. Commercially they are being picked up more and more. You only have to look at the racks of the supermarket shelves: commercial producers have seen the value and the demand out there for soya products, one source of alternative and naturally occurring products that the body requires to establish equilibrium.
There are real difficulties out there about the experimental nature of the drugs on offer. The member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and the member for Kalgoorlie have said that the drug companies and the medical profession generally are in a state of constant experimentation, and women particularly do not want to be experimented with. There are many women out there who are wise and well read. They are following the debate on this issue and they know that there are real prospects for the long-term re-establishment of a healthier equilibrium in their bodies through some of these products. If there is any means to try to exclude the advertising of such products—without any outrageous claims of cure; nobody can claim that and we are not arguing that—or any means devised to prevent those products from being presented as efficiently, as widely and as honestly as possible to the general public, I will oppose them to my last breath.
I have not seen enough in this revision of the code. From what I understand, I think the Labor Party is talking about one section only of this advertising code. I think they should rethink it and support the member for Kalgoorlie's disallowance motion as well to ensure that this whole area is looked at far more closely before we accede to what I believe are the demands of the vested interests and the drug companies.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Private Members' Business,4,2,speech
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—While I am disappointed that the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has chosen to move a disallowance motion against two important amendments to the therapeutic goods regulations, this disallowance debate does provide me with an opportunity to explain the importance of protecting public health and safety 
 and ensuring that the public is protected from false, misleading and unsafe advertising of therapeutic goods.
The member for Calare (Mr Andren) has raised some important issues. Should he not be convinced at the end of what I have to say this morning, then I am happy to have the department provide him with a briefing because hormone replacement therapy is not part of anything to do with this; it is all about public health and safety. I share his concerns about public health and safety and, on the record, offer to provide him—or for that matter any other Independent—with a briefing.
The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) identified correctly that these issues have been canvassed in the Senate. I am happy to put the following issues on the record for the benefit of this House. The member for Dobell mentioned regulation 401 and said that it would now be okay, given the ALP's stand on this, for companies to describe and advertise their products as `drug free'. It might be appropriate for me to actually warn that they could try to describe their product as drug free but they would end up then in legal argument, because all that regulation 401 was trying to do was to clarify Labor's legislation on this. It is the previous Labor government's legislation that in fact prohibits describing drugs as `drug free'. Because there had been legal argument about that, the government sought to clarify that situation and assist all parties involved. That is just a matter of clarification.
As has been said, the Senate disallowed statutory rule No. 401 on 31 March 1998. This disallowance was an example of the political point scoring that occurred despite wide-ranging support for this regulatory change by consumers, public health experts, complementary medicine practitioners and some sectors of industry.
Prior to the disallowance of statutory rule No. 401 and in response to community confusion, which I can see has been carried further here today, about the implications of this amendment, the government established a special committee to examine the use of the term `drug free'. The committee is made up of all key stakeholders on this issue. For the 
 record, the members of this committee are: Professor Dave Roberts, Chair of the Complementary Medicines Evaluation Committee and Professor of Nutrition; Ms Juliet Seifert, Chair of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code Council; Ms Val Johanson, Executive Director of the NFAA; Professor Lloyd Sansom, Chair of the Australian Pharmaceutical Advisory Council and Professor of Pharmacology; Mr Matt O'Neil, Australian Consumers Association; Ms Janne Graham, Consumers Health Forum; Dr Giselle Cooke, Australian Comprehensive Medicines Association/Natural Herbalists Association of Australia; Dr Robert Grace, President, Australian Committee of Natural Therapies; Dr Sue Wicker, Royal Australian College of General Practitioners; Ms Bronwyn Capanna, Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia; and Mr Kerry Bone, Chief Executive Officer, MediHerb Pty Ltd.
While there are some who have tried to imply that this committee is biased and is simply a TGA committee looking at the TGA, when you consider the names and qualifications of members of the committee, it is obvious that these criticisms arise out of ignorance, deliberate attempts at political point scoring or even attempts by a small section of industry to seek political, and therefore commercial, advantage from these claims. The committee reported to me last Friday, 8 May 1998, and I will be tabling the report together with the government's response. I take this opportunity to thank the committee in examining the use of the term `drug free' for their detailed consideration of this issue.
To return now to what we are really on about today, despite the confusion of the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) of the issue, most people would agree that we need controls to ensure that the public are protected from false, misleading and unsafe advertising. Statutory rule No. 400—which is the important part of today's debate because No. 401 has already been disallowed in the Senate—provides for the proprietary and complementary medicines industries to approve advertising for their products in the mainstream print media and provides the mechanism by which the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code may 
 be reviewed and updated to reflect the views of health professionals, industry, advertisers and the community. I state again that this is the proprietary and complementary medicines industries, not the TGA, as has been claimed here today.
These are important changes, requested by industry, which deliver consistent application of the advertising code across the industry. Unfortunately, there has been much misinformation about these changes distributed to the public over the past few months. This has caused unnecessary confusion in the community about the access to information about complementary medicines and I suspect that the disallowance motion moved by the member for Kalgoorlie is the result of his and the member for McPherson's confusion about changes to these regulations.
In setting the record straight on these amendments and highlighting the many positive outcomes of these amendments, it would be useful to provide the House with a short history of the advertising code. Guidelines to control advertising of therapeutic goods in Australia have been around since 1972. Since then, advertising controls have been endorsed and administered jointly by industry and government. This code prohibits advertising of therapeutic goods for serious medical conditions which require advice and/or monitoring from health professionals. Examples of that are asthma, heart conditions or depression. It allows advertising of therapeutic goods for the treatment of minor conditions which generally do not require consultation with a health professional. It does not apply to advertisements in publications solely for health professionals. It is reviewed regularly to keep it up to date with community expectations and advances in medical and scientific technology.
The Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code has been developed by the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code Council, comprising representatives from consumer groups, industry, health care professionals and government. One representative only from the following organisations are members of this council, which I will read for the benefit of those who have been confused over this and assume that 
 it is the TGA: the Nutritional Foods Association of Australia, the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia, the Australian Direct Marketing Association, the Direct Sellers Association of Australia, the Australian Association of National Advertisers, the Advertising Federation of Australia, the Australian Consumers Association, the Consumers Health Forum, the Australian Traditional Medicines Society, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia or Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
As with the make-up of the drug-free committee, there have been criticisms that this council is biased against the complementary medicines industry. Concerns have also been raised that it is the government that is determining what can and cannot be advertised to consumers about therapeutic goods. Both of these criticisms are unfounded. The recommendations about what should or should not be advertised are decided by the Advertising Code Council, which is broadly based and only provides the government through the TGA with one vote out of 12.
Until the end of 1996, the Media Council of Australia provided the resources for these arrangements. They also supported the system of pre-clearance of print advertisements for products, including therapeutic goods, by the Australian Print Bureau. In September of 1996 the Media Council advised that they would be disbanding the system and structure of co-regulation of advertising. An alternative system, therefore, had to be established for the pre-clearance of print advertisements and for the maintenance and update of the therapeutic goods advertising code. The government made the decision that the industry organisations, the PMAA and the NFAA, should take over responsibility for the pre-clearance of the print advertisements, in line with the effective co-regulation of advertising in the broadcast media.
The industry organisations, with the support of the TGA, also submitted proposals to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for authorisation to administer the code, and to establish the new code council 
 and appropriate complaint and appeal handling mechanisms. Such authorisation was granted subject to any application for review. Such an application for review was made, and during the subsequent hearings on the authorisation the Australian Competition Tribunal suggested that the industry bodies—I stress this—would have difficulty enforcing the guidelines for advertising unless the sanctions were underpinned by legislation.
So in October 1997 the Nutritional Food Association of Australia and the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia asked the government to formalise the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code through Commonwealth regulation—the government responding to a request from industry. Those regulations were gazetted in December of last year and are being considered today. They provide for the establishment of a new advertising code council and an associated complaints resolution panel and for regulatory support for industry pre-clearance of print advertisement.
So what we have here are regulatory exchanges which are designed to support a system of advertising control which is based on the system that has worked well for industry, government and advertisers since the early 1970s. I can assure the parliament and those members who have been confused about this that the new regulation does not change the existing controls on advertising, does not alter the manner in which consumers or health professionals can obtain therapeutic goods, does not change the existing powers to stop breaches of the advertising code, does not change the right to review decisions through the minister and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, does not allow drug companies to exert major control over the advertising code, does not propose a new advertising code, does allow the proprietary and complementary medicines industries to make decisions about advertising of their own products and does allow consumers, industry and health professionals to have a say in the review and updating of the advertising code.
I could go on quoting letters from the industry bodies to support what I have said here today, but I think the time of the House 
 has been overtaken by the number of speakers on this matter. So I move:

"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—Last evening I said that the fundamental tenets of our democracy relate to our private enterprise system, our market economy and our sense of a fair go for all, and that a federal government has the responsibility to serve the national interest.
The issues of stevedoring, which have been so much to the fore in the last few months, have come to pass with the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998 . This morning, in the brief time available, I want to make a few points about the public perception—if I can 
 put it that way—of this issue. One issue that stands out clearly is the monopoly issue. Many in the media—particularly, I believe, in the ABC—would have us believe that the MUA have been hard done by—that they have acted with some justification at most times. But the issue is not about what the ABC think or what many media commentators think; it is more down to whether we want a more efficient waterfront. It is about facing up to the fact that the MUA are fighting for their monopoly right. I believe that is where Patrick have been much maligned in the public debate.
Everybody knows that the union is a closed shop. Everybody knows that you must be a member of the MUA to work on the wharves. Therefore, by definition, any change to work practices that Patrick wanted to introduce would have some impact on MUA members because of that compulsion. For the MUA and all members on the other side to suggest that there is some conspiracy because these people have insisted that they are only standing up for their rights when their monopoly right has been challenged is just too absurd. Mr Chris Corrigan was reported in this morning's Financial Review as saying:
Certainly the ACTU had made it clear that if the courts, the administrator, the government and Patrick do not give them what they want—
that is, the MUA—
then it would be back to the picket line. How long will it take before society judges that it is in no-one's interest to allow the picketers to break the law indefinitely.
And what will happen in the next major industrial dispute in some other industry perhaps of less importance with less media focus.
Certainly if I were advising the ACTU I would recommend that every industrial confrontation now be accompanied by a small but effective picket which prevents the company concerned from doing business during the dispute.
To paraphrase Greg Combet, if it can happen to this company then it can happen to every Australian company.
The issue of our democracy, the issue of the monopoly and the issue of the conspiracy charges are something which I find totally unacceptable if we look at the fundamentals of an employer-employee relationship in this 
 country. If you listen to the MUA, they want to be the boss, they want to be the worker and they want to be the shareholder. They want to be the whole lot.
Let us look at another piece from the paper today. As I understand it, the MUA are actually going to put a case to the meeting of creditors on 25 May that, because they believe there may be some $400 million available to them in damages from the conspiracy charges, they are the largest creditor and therefore they can dictate or vote down at this meeting of creditors any deed of company arrangements not acceptable to the union. There we have this relationship between employer and employee, where John Coombs wants to be the managing director, the shop steward, the chairman of the board and, I suppose, just about the leader of the opposition in this place as well. I cannot see how a country can operate like that. I cannot see who could possibly even suggest that that is the basis of anything that makes any logical sense in our system.
I want to finish by talking about intimidation. I think it is totally un-Australian for any individual—and I do not care whether it is a unionist or a non-unionist or a farmer or a politician or a member of the MUA—to intimidate anyone else in an unlawful way, or in any way whatsoever for that matter. With some of the evidence that is coming out about some MUA members, I really think all Australians should have a good hard look at them to see whether this is fair and reasonably acceptable behaviour in our democracy.
If the MUA are going to allege a conspiracy between Patrick, the banks and others, what sort of conspiracy is there between the ACTU, the MUA and the Labor Party? What sort of a conspiracy is that? I think this is where we have to really take a good hard look at whether we want an efficient waterfront, whether we want to respect our democratic traditions and, most of all, whether we want to act within the law. No-one in this country should be subjected to the kind of intimidation that has been evident in the way the MUA has conducted itself over the last three to four months.",REPS,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Rocher, Allan, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I would start by saying:
What I do accept however, without reservation, is the comment that was made by the interstate commission in both of its reports, brought down very recently, where it said that what is abundantly clear—and I think this is a fairly accurate quote—abundantly clear is that the waterfront is not going to reform itself. I think that is accepted by everybody and the need for government to intervene is there. It's not at all extraordinary that the government is prepared to offer assistance for redundancy on the wharf. In fact, I think it's the most appropriate, reasonable and sensible way to go, in co-operation with employers. A major overhaul is needed.
I was not quoting the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) or even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It was neither of those two gentlemen, whom you might expect to say things along those lines; it was indeed former Senator Bob Collins, the then minister for shipping, during an interview on Radio 2CN on 9 April 1990.
—A good Labor minister.
—A good Labor minister. So let there be no doubt that the opposition, when in government, admitted and acknowledged not only the need for waterfront reform but also that government funded redundancy is `appropriate, reasonable and sensible'. Unfortunately the ALP, when in government, failed to achieve the much needed reform that the current government is now working for. So the opposition are scrambling desperately to find some position on this issue which will have even a modicum of credibility.
It is useful to look at the history of problems on the waterfront, including a consideration of the impotence of the former Labor government and the nature and size of the problem today, before examining the government's proposal to assist structural reform by establishing an industry funded redundancy program. The waterfront is a key link in the distribution of traded goods. The efficiency of the waterfront affects the competitiveness of Australia's trade. The Productivity Commission found recently that, in value terms, approximately 70 per cent of imports and 78 per cent of exports were 
 transported by sea in 1995-96. These trade flows amounted to close to $60 billion.
In the late 1980s the Interstate Commission, the ISC, was asked to investigate the efficiency of the handling, storage and movement of cargo through Australian ports and to formulate an integrated industry plan for waterfront reform. In March 1989 the ISC presented the federal government with the final report of its investigation into the waterfront. The evidence presented to the ISC confirmed the fact that:
The waterfront industry was in urgent need of fundamental change.
The ISC observed `high costs, endemic unreliability, a high level of industrial disputation, inappropriate manning levels and work practices, poor discipline, poor motivation throughout the industry and a pervasive lack of competition'. In its report the commission also noted the concern expressed in the hearings before it about union abuse of monopoly power. The ISC found that over the years working arrangements on the waterfront had been introduced that had had the overall effect of sustaining a larger work force than would be required if the work force was appropriately structured and managed. For example, the commission said that the practice of equalising hours worked and payments received removed any incentives for the work force to provide adequate levels of service and to increase output.
The commission found that rotation of work, partly to equalise hours and earnings, frequently resulted in employees with inappropriate skills operating sophisticated equipment. The ISC concluded:
Those who are more able have little incentive to perform better than average because there are no rewards for doing so.
The response of the then Labor government was to establish the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, WIRA. WIRA's only attempt to solve the appalling situation on the wharves was to pay $420 million in redundancies to aged wharfies in order to re-employ younger ones. Yet today, according to the honourable member for Flinders, the minister, we still see many of these so-called redundant wharfies working as casuals on $30,000 to $40,000 annually. According to the minister, 
 at Patrick's Stevedores alone there are 290 wharfies who received payouts from $80,000 to $100,000 plus superannuation under the WIRA process.
Back in October 1990 when the redundancies were proposed  I said that the Labor government was resorting to buying wharfies out of their jobs as a substitute for comprehensive reform. During debate in this place at the second reading stage of the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990, I urged:
Such generous redundancy packages should be offered only in exchange for real and comprehensive reform in work practices.
I said that regrettably no such reform was in prospect and went on to observe:
We are looking at enormously generous redundancy packages that will achieve little by way of substantial reform. The government's redundancy packages are more like a one-off voluntary retirement scheme than a real redundancy programme.
I advocated then and say now that there is a good case for introducing compulsory redundancy as a solution to overmanning where voluntary schemes are found to be inadequate.
WIRA failed to tackle the hard issues of continuing productivity improvements that are so necessary if Australia is to become internationally competitive. The worst feature of WIRA was that it cemented the rorts and inefficiencies that afflict the waterfront today by allowing a monopoly union for both the waterfront and maritime industries despite being warned by the ISC about the dangers of doing just that.
An example given by the government of such rorts is the three-man lashing team. I understand from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business that at Melbourne's East Swanson Dock the system is that three wharfies lash down containers on board a particular ship supervised by two others—one on board and the other on the wharf. The rort is that if just one of the lashing crew says he is sick, the whole crew knocks off on full pay. The work is not done, of course.
Even without such abuses, Australian wharfies are by no means hard done by. According to figures provided by the minister, wharfies in Sydney receive $74,000 annually 
 for a 35-hour week; five weeks annual leave with a 27.5 per cent loading; 10 days sick leave which can be paid out; subsidised meals costing $2 million annually; clothing, laundry and telephone allowances; two weeks additional leave every 15 weeks taken as rostered days off; and a 27.5 per cent loading on long service leave.
What are the substantive gains that the Labor Party would have us believe they achieved through the WIRA process? Container rates rose from an appalling 13 movements an hour to a very poor 18 movements an hour, but at the huge cost of $420 million and without the continuing reform so much needed by our ports.
Have things changed? In April 1998 the Productivity Commission presented its two reports entitled Work Arrangements in Container Stevedoring and International Benchmarking of the Australian Waterfront. The commission found that there had been some improvements in container stevedoring work arrangements in Australia as a result of enterprise bargaining and the waterfront reform processes so far achieved. These improvements included the use of some supplementary employees at major ports, decreased numbers of workers per gang, earnings equalised over longer periods and more efficient use of drivers otherwise on a rest break. However, the commission also found that there were a number of practices that continued to adversely affect workplace performance on the wharves. These included the arrangement which specified the order in which employees were engaged for a shift, relatively high shift premiums and penalties, relatively high redundancy provision, prescribed work force size and composition, equalisation schemes, some aspects of existing productivity schemes, some aspects of aggregate wage schemes, relatively high leave and rostered time off provisions, minimum call-up and idle time provisions and constraints on contracting out. A handsome list.
The commission concluded that these work arrangements form a complex, inflexible and prescriptive system that continues to constrain container stevedoring workplace performance. The commission said:
Many of them create incentives for permanent employees to work longer hours to obtain high levels of overtime payments which can risk the health and safety of employees.
These risks could be mitigated by alternative rostering and leave arrangements.
However, the order of engagement practice constrains employer flexibility.
The commission found that earnings from overtime continue to outweigh those from productivity bonuses. Therefore, the incentives provided by the productivity bonus schemes to work more efficiently may not be sufficient. They also constrain the opportunities for management to alter the size and composition of the work force. The commission said that the outcome is lower levels of productivity, reduced timeliness and reliability, and higher labour costs.
The Productivity Commission report said that the ability to improve work arrangements is subject to workplace, industry and legislative factors. The workplace factors include `an adversarial workplace culture and the attitudes and abilities of managers and union representatives'. The industry factors include the limitation on industry competition and significant union bargaining power. The commission said that industry factors can reduce the pressure on stevedores and workers to change to the extent that at least some of the costs of inefficiency are passed on to users of stevedoring services.
In its international benchmarking study, the Productivity Commission found Australia also to be underperforming on the waterfront. Container stevedoring charges in Australia are higher than overseas. Ship loading and unloading are slower, and services are less reliable. Other areas of traditional bulk and break-bulk—break-bulk apparently means non-bulk cargo that is not containerised—stevedoring examined by the commission also performed relatively poorly. Even cruise ship baggage handling charges in Sydney were five times those in Auckland. The commission found that the cost of providoring—supplying ships' crew and passenger provisions—was four times that in the port of Miami.
The international benchmarking study showed that marine services and port infra 
 structure charges are two to three times greater in Australia, not all of which reflects pricing polices to recover costs. The study showed also that the port-land interface is not operating effectively and that there is a need for better coordination throughout the transport chain. As the commission also noted, poor performance increases costs to exporters, importers and other shippers both directly and indirectly. The commission concluded that overall there is significant scope for improvement. That is a bit of an understatement.
The poor performance costs Australian jobs and adds to the cost of products for all Australian consumers of imported goods. The current government's approach to these serious problems besetting the waterfront involves raising a levy on stevedoring operations to fund urgently needed restructuring. The bills introduced by the government are designed to ensure that the industry, not the Australian taxpayer, is responsible for the funding.
As part of the waterfront restructuring, the government has reached an agreement with the two major stevedoring companies, P&O Ports and Patrick Stevedores, to adopt seven key performance benchmarks for continuous improvement on the waterfront.
These benchmarks include: an end to overmanning and restrictive work practices; higher productivity, measured by a national average crane rate of 25 movements per hour; greater reliability through less industrial disruption and the elimination of outdated work practices; improved safety; lower costs throughout the logistics chain to the waterfront gateway; more efficient use of the technology available to increase productivity; and improved training.
The levy is intended to provide access for the industry to redundancy funding in order to reduce excess labour arising from future restructuring. According to the government, the stevedoring companies have given undertakings that they will absorb the cost of the levy and will not pass it on in the form of increased costs to shippers. I note that no levy will be applied to bulk cargo, in view of the Productivity Commission's finding that the performance of seaboard bulk cargo terminals 
 in Australia is already internationally competitive. Indeed, performance in that sector is among the best of its kind in the world.
The grain, minerals and energy industries in my home state of Western Australia use the bulk terminals for exporting their produce and in that regard would not be affected by changes at container terminals. However, the efficiencies sought at the container terminals will benefit the rural and resources sectors in a key respect: to the extent that those ports are used in the importation of vital machinery and chemicals in containers and as break-bulk cargo.
The levy proposed by the government will apply to each stevedoring company, whether or not the company draws down on the funds from the maritime industry finance company. This will provide major incentives for the stevedoring companies to restructure their work forces through redundancies. Redundancies are always regrettable, but if the affected workers receive the full value of their entitlements at no cost to our export and import industries, and at no cost to the taxpayer, then the government's proposal should be supported. It will be, I am sure.
On 9 April 1998 the Minerals Council of Australia, through its Executive Director, Dick Wells, said it was vital that long overdue reform on the docks was implemented. He said:
The minerals industry supports ongoing microeconomic reform in Australia particularly in the transport and energy sectors . . .
Maritime costs are a significant burden to the industry where minerals companies have limited opportunities to directly influence the efficient and cost-effective provision of services.
The Metal Trades Industry Association, on 9 April 1998, expressed `unequivocal support' for the reforms. MTIA's Chief Executive, Mr Bob Herbert, emphasised `the paramountcy of an efficient waterfront for Australia as it engages in global trade'. We have identified the problem; the government has proposed a solution and is preparing to implement it.
What is Labor's solution? Another meeting? Another summit? The troglodytes of the ALP have tackled waterfront reform in the past and have failed, at great expense. They are caught 
 in a bind with their ties to their trade union mates. They voice support for waterfront reform through gritted teeth and with their fingers crossed behind their backs.
Australia cannot afford another series of meetings; we cannot afford to wait. We must act now to get the waterfront working, to secure a place for Australian industry in the world and to secure jobs for all Australians—including those who choose to not join a union. Australia cannot afford another series of meetings; we cannot afford to wait. We must act now to get the waterfront working. I therefore commend these bills to the House.",REPS,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—Labor is opposing the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998  and the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998  in this House. We are doing so because the bills are based on illegality, they are based on a conspiracy and they come from a government that is rotten to the core.
The bills are the most visible evidence of the government's part in the conspiracy: a conspiracy that, according to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), involves supporting Patrick and the National Farmers Federation `to the hilt'; a conspiracy to sack all 1,400 members of a work force simply because they belong to a union—contrary to section 298K of the Reith Workplace Relations Act; a conspiracy to sack without notice workers involved in lawful industrial action under section 170ML of the same act and permitted within the rules of their industrial association—an action also prohibited and therefore illegal under section 298K of the act; a conspiracy to sack workers involved in no industrial action and performing to the world's best practice—sacked why? `Because they belonged to a union', as said by the Prime Minister himself on the Ray Martin program the night before Good Friday; a conspiracy to replace the work force that was sacked with an overseas trained and secretly trained work force; a conspiracy that involved midnight raids by balaclavaed commandos with rottweilers; a conspiracy to allow a corporate law scam to do the full monty on Patrick's assets, to strip the companies bare, leaving nothing with which to pay the employees; a conspiracy backed by the govern 
 ment; and a conspiracy that 10-1 our most senior judges in the land have found prima facie occurred and, as a consequence, ordered reinstatement of the workers so sacked.
Most Australians—those not part of the conspiracies—first heard about the mass sacking of Patrick's workers at 11.00 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 April, when the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) announced it by press release—not the company, but the minister. To his press release he attached a statement from Patrick's. The very next morning, just 10 hours later, Mr Reith introduced into this House two pieces of legislation that are the subject of today's debate. They were approved by cabinet the night before. Just 10 hours for this complex legislation, when it has been almost a year and we still have not seen their legislation on car and TCF tariff legislation? Yet, against all of this background, Mr Howard and Mr Reith claim they knew nothing of the scheme. On that morning, Wednesday, 9 April, as the bills were introduced, we saw Mr Howard slapping Mr Reith on the back, grinning triumphantly. What an edifying sight: the Prime Minister revealed his true colours on that day.
But where did all this begin? The government has been involved in this scam at the highest level from the very early stages and the overwhelming weight of evidence will prove it. We have already produced some of that evidence and the parliamentary process will continue to fill in the pieces, bit by bit. Mr Reith recently said he had no idea where the plan to sack Patrick workers came from. Let me refresh his memory. On 27 February 1997, the minister's office received a briefing on two options for waterfront reform. On 10 March 1997, a more detailed minute to Mr Reith from his own department appeared. It recommended considering a strategy. It stated:
What would be needed for the MUA's influence on the waterfront to be significantly weakened would be for a range of affected service users and providers to take decisive action to protect or advance their interests.
It went on:
Another matter that might be canvassed is the proposition that a dispute—of itself—would produce desired change on the waterfront. 

Understand this: this is a department recommending to a minister that engineering a dispute is the first step in the vehicle to break the union. They then go on to say that what was needed was:
Stevedores would need to activate well-prepared strategies to dismiss their workforce, and replace them with another, quickly, in a way that limited the prospect of, for example, the Commission ordering reinstatement of the current workforce.
In this same minute, Mr Reith was urged to meet with Patrick's and P&O two days later, on 12 March, and to recommend to them a course of action built around this strategy. It also recommended that he involve the Prime Minister. From that moment on, the plan was put in place. Everyone knew their role and everyone played their part: the consultants produced their secret reports at an enormous cost of more than $1 million, but still not made public as a result; Fynwest recruited the alternate work force; Patrick's shifted the work force into subsidiaries and stripped the assets; Patrick's provided the financial backing to Fynwest; and the government prepared the ground by demonising the work force and preparing the legislation. Every one of them knew they were doing `a special job for Mr Howard'—the words of Webster. The ACIL report was contracted and polling was commissioned.
On 30 July, Dr Webster was contracted by the government. His consultancy was for $95,000-plus. We understand that he was paid by the previous minister for maritime industries, Mr Sharp, but he was specifically working to Mr Reith. The evidence is that he was also working for the Prime Minister.
On the same day, 30 July 1997, the day that he went on the payroll of this government for $1,000 a day, Webster phoned Mr Wells and told him he was doing a special job for John Howard. He urged Mr Wells to phone Chris Corrigan the next day. On 6 August, Mr Wells met Corrigan at Brencorp. He talked about the numbers he was after and then, from the affidavit of Mr Wells, was `taken by C.C.'—Chris Corrigan—`to visit East Swanston dock—up in a straddle crane. He said'—that is, Corrigan—`he wanted to replace the whole Dock work force on 30 March 1998. He said that he was in regular 
 discussion with the Federal Government and, in particular, he was talking to John Sharp and Peter Reith'.
On 7 August of last year there was another call from Webster to `discuss meeting C. Corrigan and my interest'. On 13 August and 3 September, more meetings with Wells and Corrigan. On 5 September Wells phoned Webster—`everything was in place', according to Mr Wells, from the conversation he had with Webster. Webster said not to phone him again.
On 23 October Kilfoyle, Wells and others meet and sign an `Agreement to Act'. This was the agreement between Corrigan and Fynwest for the replacement work force. Again, on that very same date, 23 October, Webster is taken on the staff of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. On 1 December there is a meeting involving a member of Mr Reith's staff and government officials with Patrick executives to discuss `breaking the MUA hold on the waterfront'.
We have asked the minister in this House to tell us what was discussed at that meeting and specifically whether there was any discussion at that meeting that involved a plan to replace the existing work force of Patrick's with another. He will not answer that question in the parliament, but he continues to claim he knew nothing.
On 3 December, two days later, the Dubai story breaks. Remember this—his office was involved in meetings on 1 December, but Peter Reith in this House on 3 December and subsequently continues to say that neither he nor his office knew anything about a plan that involved the replacement of an existing work force with another work force. On 5 December the Department of Workplace Relations writes to Patrick offering to underwrite redundancies. On 6 January 1998 the minister was briefed on the next stage of the strategy, the Webb Dock operation, the farmers' operation. On 31 January Corrigan meets Wells and Kilfoyle. On 3 February Corrigan admits to the media that he has been linked to Fynwest. The next day, however, he denies having backed it financially. On 9 February Corrigan appears before the Industrial Relations Com 
 mission and under oath denies financial involvement with Fynwest.
The final act of betrayal, the night of the sacking, was when the cabinet met. The minister took the cabinet through the plan and locked them into it. But in all of this the Prime Minister and his minister claim they knew nothing about the plan to sack one work force and replace it with another that was trained overseas secretly, involving ex-commandos.
Let us look at who precisely the Prime Minister is backing to the hilt—Mr Chris Corrigan himself. He is a person whose word a Federal Court judge, Mr Justice Von Doussa, has dismissed as being unreliable. This is reported in the Financial Review on 9 May 1998 in relation to a report tabled in the South Australian parliament back in 1982. He is a person who prima facie has conspired to sack an entire work force because they are members of a union. He is a man who was taped on 31 January admitting that his plan to replace the work force was `partly illegal'. He is on the record as saying it was an illegal act.
He is a person who in 1994, as Chairman of Australian Stevedores, proposed a similar asset stripping scam to get rid of his work force that he actually implemented in this dispute. At that time, 1994, his board rejected the proposal. He is a man who has prima facie committed perjury by swearing under oath that he provided no financial backing to the Dubai operation when evidence, including a letter written by him dated 8 May, shows that he has. He is also a person who has been linked to the Elliott corporate scams of the 1980s.
The Prime Minister has said to this parliament in relation to the Corrigan scheme that he will support them to the hilt provided they act within the law. This is a person who has demonstrated exactly the opposite on many occasions. The Prime Minister was seen in recent weeks asking what was illegal or improper anyway about Dubai. Let us go through those charges. In the Industrial Relations Commission Corrigan was asked whether Patrick's or Lang Corporation had had any financial involvement in relation to 
 the recruitment of personnel by Fynwest. Under oath he says, `No.' Yet we have a letter from him on 8 May which states, `Your clients'- this is signed by Corrigan—`have consistently failed to provide regular accounting and bank reconciliation details in respect of the loan provided by Patrick to Fynwest Pty Ltd.'
Under oath he says that he has had no involvement. When he is in strife and is trying to recover the money, he is threatening to sue to recover money that he claimed had never been lent. If Mr Corrigan has perjured himself in the Industrial Relations Commission, surely the Prime Minister would see fit to at last distance himself. Ten of the country's most senior judges, including six of the seven High Court judges, have found that there is a prima facie case that the Workplace Relations Act—the minister's own act—has been breached by Patrick's and that illegal conspiracy surrounds the whole affair.
If the Prime Minister needs any more evidence of the illegality, he need look no further than the words of Mr Corrigan himself as set out in a transcript of a conversation which he had on 31 January 1998, in which he admits that the scheme to replace Patrick's work force is `Well, partly illegal.' The government has claimed all along that the ALP is tied hand and foot to the MUA, but in reality the only people tied hand and foot are the government to Chris Corrigan. They know they cannot drop him because they know what he knows about their involvement in the conspiracy. But Chris Corrigan is fast developing cement boots, and he will drag this government down with them.
I am pleased to see that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has finally entered the House for this debate. He is the person who has consistently demonised the lack of productivity on the waterfront by the existing work force and claimed that the replacement work force was doing double the rate of waterside workers. It just so happens that documentation was left on the computers at Patrick's of the track record of the replacement work force—the NFF group; the people who were supposedly trained to do a much better job. In Sydney the computer print-outs 
 show that, for the period 12 April to 28 April, the average net crane lifts were 10 an hour. Remember how you have been saying in this parliament that they were doing double what the MUA was doing before; that they were supposed to be doing something like 36 crane lifts an hour. At Port Botany it was 10.1 an hour.
In Melbourne non-union labour managed even worse results than Sydney. Computer print-outs show that for East Swanston dock the average net crane rate was 8.5 an hour and, in addition, most shifts only recorded four or five cranes an hour. In Fremantle it was 9.3 an hour, 9.14 an hour and 8.8 containers an hour at different stages. Mr McGauchie, the National Farmers Federation leader, has also claimed double the rate, but handwritten log sheets at Fishermens Island, the Brisbane terminal, show an average crane rate loading for a number of vessels of a gross rate of 31 boxes for four to five hours.
It is about time the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business told the truth in relation to these issues of productivity on the waterfront. He spent the last 12 months not only conspiring but also building the case to demonise the MUA. This is a person who is shameless when it comes to telling the truth. This is a person who is prepared to keep rattling off productivity rates that bear no resemblance to the facts. This is a person who has claimed that the replacement work force was performing at twice the rate when evidence now before the parliament shows that they were performing at half the rate. Minister, you should have the decency to come into this place and apologise to the people that you have maligned in relation to this whole exercise.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Is it appropriate for a speaker to allege misrepresentation, particularly when there is a Productivity Commission report independently prepared available to the member which substantiates all the claims that the government has made? I believe it is inappropriate. He should be asked to keep his claims to the facts, instead of personal vitriol which is unsubstantiated.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I will stick to the facts. I seek leave to table them because these are documents that have come into my possession—
—There is no point of order.
—I am not asking for a point of order. I am asking for leave to table the documents which show that what the minister for workplace relations has been asserting is untruthful. It is deceitful. It is not true. If he wants to get up and take a point of order, then let him have the documents tabled. Minister, are you allowing it? Of course you are not because you do not want the truth.
—I ask for the word `deceitful' to be withdrawn.
—I will not withdraw it. I seek leave to table the documents, because he has been deceitful. Unless he is prepared to have these documents tabled, he is the one who is covering up the truth.
—Order! You will withdraw the comment `deceitful'.
—I thought `deceitful' was in, Madam Deputy Speaker. Would you like to check with the Speaker on that? `Deceit' is out but `deceitful' is in.
—I am asking you to withdraw.
—Well, `deceitful' is in.
—I am asking you to withdraw your comment.
—What the minister has involved himself in is a deceitful act.
—I am asking you to withdraw your comment.
—On what basis, Madam Deputy Speaker?
—I am asking you to withdraw your comment.
—Are you ruling that I withdraw?
—I am asking you to withdraw your comment.
—`Deceitful' is in on the basis of a ruling of the previous Speaker. Speaker 
 Sinclair has said that `deceitful' is in order. I would ask you to reflect on your ruling.
—I am asking you to withdraw your comment.
—On what basis?
—I am asking you to withdraw.
—On what basis? I take a point of order. I have been through this exercise before. I was asked to withdraw the word `deceit' when I referred to a web of deceit. When I came back and explained that it was a deceitful web, Speaker Sinclair ruled it was in order. He said `deceitful' was appropriate, and now you are telling me it is not because the Leader of the House is mugging you.
—I ask you to withdraw the comment `deceitful', under standing order 76, personal reflections.
—I withdraw the word `deceitful' about the minister, but I say that he has been involved in a deceitful act, and I will not withdraw that. I seek leave to table the documents.
Question (by Mr Reith) put:
That the question be now put.",REPS,<title>STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Miles, Chris, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—in reply—In summing up, I would like to thank the participants in this debate. For a long time all of us in this parliament have recognised that this is a very complex area for the parliament to come to grips with. It is something which involves a lot of emotion, and I think all of us are concerned to try to move the legislation forward.
In reply, I would like to stress a few things. The measures contained in this bill are good, sound changes. They will provide real benefits to parents by introducing flexibility into 
 the child support scheme and will improve timeliness, accuracy and responsiveness in the administration.
I commend the government's continuing commitment to reform the child support scheme to underscore the fundamental principle that parents are primarily responsible for the financial support of their children and that government will not unnecessarily intrude into people's lives. The Australian Labor Party has not properly addressed the child support issues and has ignored the recommendations of the inquiry by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues into the operation and effectiveness of the child support scheme.
The measures in this bill were announced in a joint media release on 30 September 1997 by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Jocelyn Newman, and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Rod Kemp. The bill improves the scheme's flexibility and provides greater equity for parents. It enables parents to take greater responsibility for support of their children. At the same time, the government will provide a safety net to ensure that children of separated parents are adequately supported and that the general community is not asked to carry an undue burden.
The changes in this bill are, firstly, changes to child support payable. They increase paying parents' exempt income by 10 per cent; include an amount for shared care of a child in the exempt income amount; reduce the amount of the payee's disregarded income amount and remove the automatic inclusion of child care in the payee's disregarded income; allow high child-care costs to be a ground for a departure from the assessment; reduce the effect of the payee's disregarded income; introduce a minimum payment of $260 per year and make child support payable for secondary students until the end of the school year in which they turn 18; include rental property losses and foreign exempt income to calculate child support; base child support assessments on the most up-to-date income of parents; use an uplift factor only where the parent has not lodged the most recent tax return; and no longer backdate child support liability.
Changes in the bill also include changes for second families, and these include the following points. They allow credit for child support paid in determining entitlements to family payments for payers' subsequent families. Changes to the administration are several, and I will quickly go through them. They will introduce a formal process to enable parents to object to the CSA's decision; no longer include the names and birth dates of relevant dependent children on the assessment notice; allow parents to agree to collect and pay child support privately at any time; and require parents to pay and collect child support privately where there is a good payment record.
There will be a better alignment of family court and child support legislation relating to the care of children. The changes will allow parents to end a child support assessment where their safety is at risk and provide support and assistance to parents to collect child support where safety is no longer of concern; improve notification and disbursement processes to reduce incidences of overpayments; allow child support debts to be offset between parents; allow the registrar to initiate the process to depart from the administrative assessment and to streamline the departure process; allow estimates of income to be rejected where they do not reflect the actual income; and allow liable parents to apply for a child support assessment.
As the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) foreshadowed in his speech in the Main Committee, I will be moving an amendment to the bill and I am pleased to advise the House that this amendment was announced in the budget on Tuesday night. The amendment will allow payers to make non-agency payments without requiring the payees' agreement.
I would also like to make some comments about the role of the House of Representatives task force and their initiatives at this point. The task force of government members was formed to consider and report to the government on a number of matters related to child support. The government appreciates the work that the task force has done in such a short period and supports the following recommen 
 dations that the task force made. I will just quickly go through those areas of recommendations for people's information, firstly in regard to persons evading child support by travelling overseas. The majority of people with child support liability pay the amount when it is due and pay the correct amount. However, there are some payers who have a child support debt and go overseas before the debt is cleared. The government will amend the child support legislation with effect from 1 January 1999 to give the Child Support Registrar the power to stop a parent who has persistently failed to meet his or her child support liability from leaving Australia through a departure prohibition order process.
The DPO will not be time limited and will remain in force until revoked by the Child Support Registrar when the debt has been paid or when satisfactory arrangements have been made. The process will come into effect from 1 January 1999. This is consistent with the taxation commissioner's powers which include a right of repeal to the Federal Court or Supreme Court. The remedy goes further than the joint JSC recommendation 115.
The second area is consideration of diverse forms of income received and taken into account for determining child support. Child support is calculated using a parent's taxable income. There are a number of ways in which parents can reduce their taxable income and consequently pay less child support. Many of these ways of reducing taxable income such as salary sacrifice are legitimate under the taxation laws.	The government has recognised that parents are able to reduce their taxable income for taxation purposes but this is not appropriate for child support purposes.
The bill before parliament will add back to taxable income rental property losses and exempt employment income. Parents with second jobs and those that work overtime now have this extra income included in the income base for the calculation of child support. The government will establish an inter-departmental committee to examine the diverse manner in which all forms of income are received and taken into account for the purposes of child support assessments and will take account of the scope of tax reforms. The IDC would be 
 chaired by DSS and comprise representatives from Attorney-General's, the Child Support Agency, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Finance and Administration, and Treasury. Other departments could be coopted as necessary.
In regard to transparency and independence of process to depart from the formula assessment I make the following comments:	child support assessments are based on a formula. Parents who believe that the assessment is not appropriate can seek a departure from that assessment. Only about six per cent of parents seek a departure. The current process is perceived as not providing sufficient transparency or accountability. The registrar will review the process and will focus the concerns with a view to providing substantial improvements to current processes. The existing process to depart from formula assessment will be examined to develop a range of options which will improve its transparency and accountability to enable changes to be considered in the 1999-2000 budget process.
A review of the training qualifications and remuneration of officers contracted to determine applications to depart from formula assessment will report to the Assistant Treasurer by 30 June 1998. The examination of the departure process will include legislation, procedures, information needed by clients, physical location and accountability of officers, notification of decisions and appeal mechanisms including an evaluation of the proposed legislative amendment which introduces objection provisions for departure decisions. Reviews are preferred to jumping prematurely to a judicial or quasi-judicial process which will be costly to administer and will run the risk of returning to a system which was largely out of reach of most parents.
As to payer concerns about contact or access with children, currently the only recourse for parents denied contact with children is to lodge repetitive applications for enforcement with the court. These applications involve a delay varying between a few weeks and over six months and a range of penalties that are difficult to impose in the context of the best interests of the children. 
 These processes are a significant cost to government and frequently to legal aid funding. The pilots will provide practical demonstration of alternative community based support for parents experiencing difficulties with contact. Pilots to help ensure compliance with Family Court child contact orders will be established within community based agencies, contracted under the family relationships services program.
Pilots will be contracted at four locations—Parramatta, Brisbane, Townsville and Hobart—and will be three-pronged: firstly, information education sessions when the order is made; secondly, immediate assistance for parents to resolve conflict over contact; thirdly, a compulsory diversionary program for parents in breach of a contact order.
The Attorney-General will also consider the establishment of a parliamentary committee to examine all aspects of family law contact and compliance once the Family Law Council has delivered its report in June 1998. Providing assistance to parents to resolve issues without court intervention is in line with recent changes in family law that encourage people to resolve family disputes outside the judicial system. A compulsory diversionary program provided by community based agencies for parents convicted of breaches would be a credible alternative to the current scope of penalties which range from recognisance to imprisonment.
I thank those people who have participated in this debate and, as I said, I foreshadow that we will be moving amendments in the detail stages.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, have you seen the statement today by the Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and Uniting Church, which states that these groups:
. . . vigorously oppose any increases in taxes on consumption to pay for income tax reductions as both regressive and economically unnecessary?
Why are you now planning to ignore this sound advice?

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—In the preparation of the taxation package, the government has already had some very extensive and some very constructive discussions with a number of the organisations that were mentioned in the Leader of the Opposition's question. Indeed, only two nights ago I personally had a discussion with the president of ACOSS, Mr Raper, and I found that discussion constructive. I found him willing to understand the need for taxation reform.
Let me take the opportunity of saying to the Leader of the Opposition that, when the tax package comes out, the battlers of Australia will be well pleased. When the taxation package comes out the battlers of Australia 
 will see it as a fair and decent and honest attempt to make the Australian taxation system fairer. Let me also take the opportunity of saying that I have, for a long time in my career in public life, pursued the cause of fundamental taxation reform. I intend to preside over a reform of the Australian taxation system that not only takes the economy of Australia into the 21st century in a positive way but also is fair and equitable to the low-income earners of Australia.
It is those who sit opposite who betrayed the interests of low-income earners. It is those who sit opposite who gave the battlers of Australia home mortgage rates of 17 and 18 per cent and who gave to the small businesses of Australia interest rates of 20½ per cent. It is my government which has given this country and the battlers of Australia the lowest housing interest rates in more than 30 years and it will be my government that will deliver taxation justice to the battlers of Australia.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 1998-99</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,answer

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—The budget comes once a year and it is the one time a year that the Australian people get a chance to work out what the federal Minister for Health and Family Services, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), is going to do about the Australian health care system.
What is the position today across the country? We have public hospitals in crisis in every state and in every territory. We have dental waiting lists—waiting lists for emergency and preventative dental care are going 
 through the roof. We have pensioners and low income Australians being asked to pay the highest amounts ever for pharmaceutical care. We have private health insurance coverage at their lowest ever. This was the climate when this Minister for Health and Family Services brought down his health budget last Tuesday.
To understand the context of these papers we have to go to an article in the West Australian of 22 August last year under the headline `The Third Man':
That is how Health Minister Michael Wooldridge talks privately about his leadership prospects. He knows Treasurer Peter Costello and Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith are the frontrunners should Prime Minister John Howard hand over the reins or be removed. According to colleagues, Dr Wooldridge is looking beyond the next election. He wants the finance portfolio, where he hopes to stake his claim for the leadership.
Anyone who saw Lateline  last night saw another bid for anything but health from the current minister for health. But to be the Minister for Finance Dr Wooldridge has at least got to understand the finances of his current department—the department of health. The article in the West Australian  headed `The Third Man' went on to say in a very revealing paragraph:
Those close to him—
that is, Dr Wooldridge—
say that he is cautious, cunning, manipulative, has a grasp for detail and knows how to woo voters.
It is that grasp for detail that we have some doubts about. It is that alleged grasp for detail that was put to the test at a press conference that the minister organised for the health correspondents in Parliament House yesterday. It was an absolute shocker. The minister for health gave probably his worst performance in the two years he has been minister for health. Why do we say it was an absolute shocker? Firstly, the minister handed out some extra money for GPs which he said will be funded by some savings. How is the government going to fund the increase in GP rebates? If we turn to page 1-46 of Budget Paper No. 2, the following claim can be seen:
New funding under this measure of $367.0 million over the period 1998-99 to 2001-02 will be offset by savings of $369.1 million, principally from 
 changes in the remuneration arrangements applying to GP Registrars.
That is what is in the budget papers. At the absolutely shocking press conference the minister gave yesterday he was asked by some of those present how these savings would be achieved. I quote from Laura Tingle's article in the Sydney Morning Herald  today under the headline `Minister in dark over estimates'.
Mr Martin interjecting—
—Today in question time the minister claimed that the correspondent from the Sydney Morning Herald  did not understand. I will let the listeners and the people in the gallery reach their own conclusions. This is what the article in the Sydney Morning Herald  said today:
At a press conference yesterday, Dr Wooldridge was asked how the Government would raise $90 million in savings from a scheme which would see trainee GPs paid a flat government salary instead of receiving fees for service under Medicare.
He said under the proposed scheme ""the registrars would get a reasonably similar income to what they do today"".
But asked how doctors receiving similar salaries could produce such large savings he said:
""We've convinced the Department of Finance, and they're the Department of Finance's figures, and not ours. So perhaps you should put that to them.""
Questioned further, Dr Wooldridge said the ""formula . . . seemed to have worked in the past whatever the magic behind it"".
The real reason the minister has increased the GP rebate is something that he could never admit to. The real reason the minister has increased the GP rebate is that bulk-billing has slumped. The Labor Party has now been predicting for a year and a half that as this government squeezes the GP rebate more and more doctors would switch from bulk-bulking to charging up-front fees.
For nine of the last 10 months we have seen a decline in bulk-billing rates because of the actions of this minister. That is the reason why he was forced to do a humiliating backflip on Tuesday night and provide, one-off for one year, an increase in the GP rebate. We are entitled to ask: where is the minister going 
 to get that $369 million? When he is pressed at the press conference yesterday he says, `Don't ask me, ask the department of finance.' It is not much if you are the person who wishes to become the next Minister for Finance of the Commonwealth of Australia.
He was also asked at the press conference about the private health insurance figures. He was asked why they were massively readjusted and why they showed that there would be a steady decline of more than 30,000 people a year over the forward estimates. His answer—this time it is not Finance's fault; this time it is Treasury's fault—and I quote him: `Treasury initially overestimated the cost'—again, the predictions on that are Treasury's—`we merely go along for the ride on their predictions.' So this time it is Treasury's fault. He was also asked how much money the government would raise through the Medicare levy surcharge that was introduced last year. This was the minister's response:
I would be surprised if the one per cent surcharge would raise $130 million. I do not think it would be anything like that. I mean, I am only talking off the top of my head, but when we thought about it two years we were looking at maybe $18 million to $20 million—nothing like $130 million.
Only a few weeks ago the minister was saying that there were 100,000 couples earning more than the $100,000 threshold before they get hit with the Medicare levy surcharge. He claimed there were another 110,000 singles earning over $50,000 who then get hit by the surcharge. You do not have to be an Einstein or a rocket scientist to work out that that means that the figures are a lot closer to $130 million than the minister's off the top of his head estimate of $20 million.
At the end of the day, you would expect that the day after the budget the federal Minister for Health and Family Services would understand the budget figures for the department of health. You would think that, if he called a press conference with the health correspondents, he would at least try to make sure he understood where he was plucking these fistfuls of dollars out of the air to fund the increase in rebates for GPs. Is it any wonder that we have doubts in the minister's ability to explain where he gets these numbers 
 from? Is it any wonder that other people perhaps question what is going on?
We even get it from people such as the minister's former leader. You will remember the glory days when John Hewson was the leader of the Liberal Party and the current member for Chisholm, the future member for Casey, was then the deputy leader of the Liberal Party.
—He was the second man then.
—He has gone from being the second man to the third man. I thank the member for Werriwa for his interjection. Let me remind the House of what Dr Hewson said yesterday in a speech he gave. This is in response to the government's claim that there is a 15 per cent real increase in this budget in funding for public hospitals—the area of the health system that is in crisis today and the area of the health system that was in greatest need of extra funding last Tuesday night. What is Dr Hewson's response to the Prime Minister's claim that there is a 15 per cent real increase? This is Dr Hewson:
Well, it is true that on the numbers there is a 15 per cent increase, but if you allow for things like population, if you allow for the ageing of the population, if you allow for the service delivery considerations, that 15 per cent shrinks to one per cent and that is why the states are screaming.
When the states came before the Senate committee a week or two ago we had the states indicating that if the government does not increase its offer to the states there will be 1.4 million Australians who will not get the hospital treatment that they deserve and are entitled to because of this government's refusal to put any extra money into public hospitals.
When I go around and visit hospitals in the various states I get a very clear message that public patients in public hospitals are under enormous pressure these days. If you talk to the nurses or the doctors who are treating these patients, if you talk to the people in the waiting queues, you get a very clear message that people are suffering because of the crisis in public hospitals.
The worst example I have come across was a four-year-old who had on several occasions had treatment at Fremantle Hospital cancelled 
 and postponed—a boy who suffered from glue ear, a boy who, on every day that an operation was delayed, was suffering from a restriction in his ability to learn to hear, his ability to learn to speak and his intellectual development—because of the fact that that hospital kept putting off the operations that he and his family were fighting for.
It is because this government is not prepared to put extra money into public hospitals that those waiting lists affect not just young children but also many retirees. It affects their ability to get the hospital care that they are entitled to in a speedy and timely fashion. That is why the states have been fighting this federal government to get extra funding.
What was the response in the budget two nights ago? Not one extra dollar for funding for public hospitals on Tuesday. There was not one extra dollar on the table that was not on the table when the Premiers walked out of the Premiers Conference two months ago. Despite the fact that this government now has a more than $2 billion surplus, it reached the decision that not one extra dollar could be spared to help those public patients like that young four-year-old boy who suffers from glue ear, because this government is not prepared to increase its offer to the states to try to address the crisis in the public hospital system.
It is not just in the public hospitals that we have difficulties. This government abolished the $400 million Commonwealth program for dental care. Day after day in this House we have raised examples of ordinary people who have been affected by this government's abolition of the federal dental health program. We have had the pensioner from the Illawarra, Mr Jones, who has had to use superglue to keep his dentures together while he waits in the queue for treatment. We have had the woman who was told that she had to wait for each of her teeth to develop pain before they would be removed one by one, even though the dentist reached the conclusion that every one of her teeth had to be removed. We had the gentleman from Newcastle who was told that, even though he had a broken tooth, he was not entitled to care unless there was blood coming out of his broken tooth. Is it 
 any wonder that the waiting lists for dental care are exploding because this government has basically halved the public funding effort that is going into dental care right across Australia? Public hospitals and dental care are the areas that Labor has said are the two highest priorities, but there was not one extra dollar for public hospitals and not one extra dollar for dental care in the budget last Tuesday.
The great announcement in the budget was, `We are going to give 220,000 self-funded retirees the senior health care card.' The government forgot to mention that senior health care card holders used to get free access to dental care and free access to Australian hearing services but that that was scrapped for senior health care card holders in the 1996 budget. But for 220,000 self-funded retirees they give out access to cheaper pharmaceuticals. They forgot to mention that the very same self-funded retirees were hit with higher charges for pharmaceuticals in the 1996 budget and that for every one of the self-funded retirees who benefits from cheaper pharmaceuticals in the 1998 budget there are 20 pensioners and low income families who are health care card holders who have been hit by higher pharmaceutical charges in the 1996 budget. For every one who benefits on Tuesday, 20 were hit two years before. So on pharmaceutical charges this government has run a campaign to force people to pay more,	yet we have the government claiming that the health system is in good hands. This minister for health is doing such a great job he let the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announce yesterday that he is going to re-engineer the whole health system.
Government members interjecting—
—On Foxtel, on the John Laws program.
—What does that mean?
—We are entitled to ask what that means. The last time this government had an inquiry into health insurance we had the Productivity Commission wheeled out to make recommendations to the government. They reported almost 14 months ago. This minister went out and did a doorstop saying 
 that he supports in principle, and he has cabinet support in principle, for the introduction of lifetime community rating. Fourteen months later we still know nothing about it; 14 months later, the minister is still running dead on lifetime community rating. Yet the Treasurer announces that he is going to re-engineer the whole health system.
At the end of the day we are entitled to ask: was that article in the West Australian right? Does he have a grasp of the detail? If you look at all of his mistakes at the press conference yesterday, it is quite clear that he does not have a sufficient grasp of the detail to even be the health minister, let alone the finance minister. The article also claims that he knows how to woo voters. If he knows how to woo voters, why has he decided to jump ship from the electorate of Chisholm with a margin of only 2.7 per cent to switch to the electorate of Casey with a margin of 6.6 per cent? He wishes good luck as he waves goodbye to the 16 other National and Liberal members who are on a margin of less than two per cent, and he waves goodbye to all of those people on the public hospital waiting list, the dental waiting list, the people who are paying more for their pharmaceuticals—the people who this government has turned its back on; the people who are entitled to fair and decent hospital care and fair and decent access to dental care.

"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—What a pathetic contribution by the shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). Two years and two months plus into the term of this government and the shadow minister for health does not have a word to say on what he might do should he fluke the position of minister for health or how he might address some of the difficult long-term issues facing the Health portfolio. All he can do is read from an article from last year from the West Australian  and pick up one trivial point out of a press conference that went for 50 minutes, the transcript of which goes to 18 pages. I will answer the shadow minister's points in detail, then I will talk a bit more generally about health.
Firstly, I will read the totality of what was said in relation to that question about the estimates of the general practitioner savings from changing trainees from being on fee for service to being on salary.
Opposition member interjecting—
—I would be happy to. Question: how do you make the savings because, as I understand it, for this measure alone it is going to cost you $180 million in salaries but you actually save $360 million on the MBS. Answer: the way the Medicare benefits schedule is calculated is that you take the number of doctors and multiply by certain on-costs, such as radiology, pathology, other orderings and a certain number of rebates per person—which applies to specialists. Using that formula—and we have used that for 14 years with the Medicare benefits schedule—you take a certain number of doctors out of fee for service and it is assumed you make certain savings on the Medicare benefits schedule. It is fairly precise; the totality of it all has been remarkably accurate in predicting the cost of the MBS. So, using that longstanding formula, that is what the Department of Finance and Administration has come up with for the estimate of savings.
I am fully prepared to admit that might be difficult to understand. I am fully prepared to admit that one journalist out of the 15 may not have understood it. I am not quite sure why it provoked the article that it did, but you would know as well as I that in this job you get some good ones and you get some bad ones. I tend to take them as they come and not hold grudges. I would have thought that, if a journalist had not understood something at the press conference, they might have chosen to ring to have it explained. We had, as far as I know, no follow-up after that press conference seeking further explanation.
The whole point of this is that much of government is driven by formulas: you have to make estimates; you have to make assumptions. I could not in all honesty go through every assumption that underpins a formula that the Department of Health and Family Services and the Department of Finance and Administration jointly use to calculate the $6½ billion program which is the Medicare 
 benefits schedule. If I could, I would probably be wasting my time having learnt it. The point is, I tried to give an honest and open explanation, one person seemed not to have understood it, one person seemed to take exception to it. That is fine, but for that to be the basis on which, two days after the budget, the whole attack on health is directed at the government shows that this opposition is completely devoid of any ideas at all, and they think that they can get through opposition in health by in fact saying nothing.
The shadow minister made a number of other comments that I should really talk about. The first is that he did talk about this article from the West Australian. I was handed a copy of it. The journalist is Grahame Armstrong. As far as I know, I have never met Grahame Armstrong or talked to him in my life. I do not believe I have ever talked to a colleague in this place—certainly not in the last four or five years—about any aspirations I may have for leadership. The reason is fairly simple: I think if I did and it was reported, the locks would be changed on the front door when I got home. I do not know where that article came from. It certainly did not come from me and I do not accept it as accurate. I find it an enormous privilege to do this job, I find it an enormous privilege to serve under John Howard and I am going to be working to make sure he stays there as long as humanly possible.
The shadow minister then went on to make a whole number of incorrect assertions. I have got a long list of them. It is going to be a fairly disjointed reply, but I do think that they need to be responded to. He said that bulk-billing rates had slumped. Bulk-billing rates today are higher than they were two years ago. More services are bulk-billed today than they were two years ago, so that is hardly a dramatic slump.
He talked about the estimates of revenue and how these were rubbery. I am not trying to blame anybody. I am just trying to explain how a formula process works when you have to make certain assumptions, where you have swings and roundabouts, where you are dealing with a very complex area. It does pretty well because the MBS comes in year 
 on year within one half of one per cent of the estimates that we have, and that is pretty good for a program of $6½ billion.
The shadow minister talked about my former leader, John Hewson. I am pleased he is taking an interest in health. I get a great deal of excitement when people take an interest in health. I am afraid I cannot understand his comments. They are simply not accurate. The point is that, if you take out all the factors that we allow for, you will reduce the rate of increase. As well as what the shadow minister mentioned, increasing for age and increasing for population, we also make an allowance for any possible reduction in private health insurance.
If you take out the ageing of the population, if you take out the fact that the population is growing, if you take out the fact that there is a reduction in private health insurance, of course the reduction will be lower. But, even taking out all those things, in the agreement that we are offering the states there is still a 1½ per cent increase per annum for what we call `utilisation drift', and that basically means for all the factors we cannot otherwise account for, probably determined by technology. It is not one per cent; it is 1½ per cent per year for five years, which is very different. Dr Hewson does not seem to have accounted for this. Nonetheless, I am not trying to get stuck into him or criticise him. The more people who take an interest in health the better.
The shadow minister then talked about the very unfortunate case of a four-year-old child at Fremantle Hospital. Any of us who have children ourselves or doctors who have dealt with children know how difficult these sorts of cases are. But I am puzzled, because she is being treated under the current agreement signed by the Labor Party. If he has some criticism to make, he is making it of the agreement that was signed in 1993 by the Labor Party, which is still current, because what is being argued about between the Commonwealth and the states is what will apply from 1 July this year. So he is effectively criticising the incompetence of the people in the Labor Party who signed the last agreement. I can understand him doing this 
 because there is a lot in the last agreement that you would criticise.
The biggest single problem in the last agreement, signed by the Labor Party just before the 1993 election in haste, was that, when the Commonwealth put more money in, the states just pulled it out. Do not take my word for this. This was the excuse used by the then member for Swan, the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), during the 1996 election when he was trying to justify why hospitals were in the position they were in. The fact is they signed a dud agreement. And yes, hospitals are under pressure at the moment, and if there is one person to blame you can blame Paul Keating, who was the person who signed the agreement in haste and stitched up the deals to get them out of the way before the 1993 election.
I feel very sorry for the four-year-old girl. She will be able to get better hospital treatment because of the 15 per cent increase in funding that we are offering over the next five years. She will be able to get better hospital treatment because of the extra flexibility that I am offering Western Australia and other states, flexibility that has already been taken on board by Queensland and by the ACT.
Just to give you an example of that, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Chief Minister for the ACT rang me up a while ago and asked if I could help her fund an asthma campaign that she wanted to run here in Canberra. Given that the whole idea of this campaign is to prevent illness, to keep people out of hospital, I said that I would be very happy for her to use some of her hospital money to try to keep people out of hospital. That was because we had signed an agreement that gave her flexibility she had never had. She could not do that under the agreement that had been signed with the Labor Party in 1993. If she wanted to run a program in the ACT to stop elderly people breaking their hips, and if it had been stunningly successful and reduced by half the numbers of fractured necks of femur in the ACT, the ACT would have been penalised under the old agreement for doing fewer operations, even if the reason it was doing fewer operations was that it had spent money to prevent the illness happening in the first 
 place. What a ridiculous agreement to sign. That sort of flexibility is what will re-engineer the health system. That sort of flexibility is now operating in Canberra and is now operating in Queensland by two ministers who are getting on with the job.
The shadow minister said that there was not one extra dollar in the budget papers beyond what was offered at the Premiers Conference in late March. I am sorry, he might be criticising me because one journalist does not understand what I say, but I am afraid he is showing that he cannot understand the budget papers and he certainly does not have the details in his head of Veterans' Affairs funding. What we announced in the budget was a gold card for 50,000 extra veterans. A gold card gives full cost treatment in the public system or the private system. Where it occurs in the public system, it is on a full cost purchasing basis. So we are taking 50,000 veterans and paying for them outside the Medicare or health care agreements. That is going to cost us $150 million a year. 	Given that the population base that the states have to fund has reduced, we would have every right under the current agreement to take the money that would have been treating those 50,000 veterans out of the hospital system. We would not have to do anything that is in the current agreement because the population base would have changed. That would have saved us $80 million a year, or $400 million over five years. We made a deliberate and conscious decision, as a government, not to take back that money, even though we were entitled to. We were not going to attempt to get treatment for our veterans on the cheap. We were going to be as generous as possible.
What this means is that as a result of that decision on budget night the offer to the states has effectively gone up $400 million, because they have exactly the same amount of money to treat 50,000 fewer people. If we had used our indexation formula, which is based on population, that is one thing. With the population going down the index could have gone down. We have chosen not do that. So he is quite wrong. The budget in that respect is very generous to hospitals.
He talked about Mr Jones using superglue for his dentures. That puzzles me, because I did not think the dental program the Labor Party introduced covered dentures. I do not know how he would be any better or worse off because the program no longer exists. The program no longer exists because it was a four-year program to treat 1.5 million people. It was announced again in the dying days of the 1993 budget. We treated 1.5 million people and the program ended as it was conceived.
In the end what the shadow minister has to come to grips with, if he ever hopes to be minister in this area, is the Labor Party's own failings in health when it was in government. I have already talked about the failings of the Medicare agreements—rigid agreements that did not allow flexibility that meant as soon as the Commonwealth put money in the states would pull money out of the bottom. They are not my words; they are Kim Beazley's words.
When I came to be minister two years and two months ago, I had a look in the budget forward estimates and found there was not a dollar there to run the third national HIV-AIDS strategy. The forward estimates had zero. When I had to look at running all my public health programs, there was not a dollar in the forward estimates. There was zero. We had to find money just to keep basic women's health programs going, such as breast screening and cervical screening programs. When I became Minister for Health and Family Services two years and two months ago, immunisation in Australia ranked 68th in the Western world. It is still far too low, but the average completed childhood immunisation rate for a 12-month-old now is above 76 per cent. In two years time we expect it to be above 90 per cent.
The year before we came to government, the private health system was bleeding to death with losses that it had not experienced previously. It was doing that because of a decade of neglect. It was doing that because of costs that had been piled onto it by the previous government. Premiums were 39 per cent higher than they would be otherwise because of just four decisions the Labor Party made that affected the level of private health 
 insurance premiums. With general practitioners, morale was at an all-time low. There was a massive oversupply of doctors. General practice was considered by many to be the dumping ground of the medical profession. It was where you went if you could not get a job in a speciality. It is far from that. It is the cornerstone of primary health care in this country. We have stopped that.
We have made it so that the only people going into general practice now are those who have fully completed their training. And we have stopped the massive rort of people coming in from overseas countries by various routes, one of which was New Zealand. People became New Zealand citizens and then used it as a staging post to come to Australia, blowing out our medical work force and meaning there was an oversupply of some 5,000 doctors in capital cities alone. They are the failings the Labor Party has never come to grips with. They are the things that we have attempted to address, and address with quite some success. Health is a difficult area, and by the tirade today with not one single policy idea in it the shadow minister has shown that the Labor Party still has not worked out where they went wrong. If they cannot work out where they went wrong in the past, they have no future.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of the matter of public importance of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) this afternoon. As an observation, listening to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for the last few moments, one would believe that every member of the public and every member of my community who comes to me and tells me how concerned they are about the state of health services in this country must all have something terribly wrong, if you believe every word that the minister has just been putting.
After 26 months in office, this minister's legacy is a public health system that is lurching from crisis to crisis; a private health insurance system that is sinking further and further into the mire. One has only to look at a graph that I have here showing the target rates for private health insurance set by this 
 government at 96. Look where they have reached now and one really understands the reason why people are questioning the competency of this government in relation to health insurance or health provision generally. In the last 48 hours the minister has demonstrated a complete inability, in my view, to satisfactorily explain the details of his government's public hospital and private health insurance policies.
I want to take this opportunity to assist the minister in explaining his policies by reminding him of his achievements in this portfolio so far. As health minister, Dr Wooldridge has overseen the Liberal-National government's $3.6 billion cuts to public health. These cuts include $1.4 billion from pharmaceuticals, achieved by increasing co-payments for everyone including pensioners; removing more than 20 drugs from the PBS altogether; introducing therapeutic group premiums which force people to pay more if they want the newer and safer drugs; $1 billion from Medicare achieved by freezing GPs' fees in 1996, which forced down those bulk-billing rates; closing 43 Medicare offices; and restricting provider numbers; $800 million from public hospitals, making waiting lists and the crisis in public hospitals even worse; $400 million from dental care by abolishing the Commonwealth dental health program, which funded emergency and preventative dental care to almost four million adult health card holders. The attempt to refute this by the minister during his address to the House a moment ago was pretty lame. If what he says is true, how could they as a government possibly have boasted a saving of $400 million in the 1996 forward estimates, a declared saving by this government? It was not a scheme already closed off by us. It was one we prepared and were ready to continue with. They were the ones who cut it.
These cuts come with a huge social cost. For example, we have seen a massive slump in the level of bulk-billing for GP consultations. I do not know quite where the minister gets his figures from, but I know that my constituents are telling me that it is harder and harder to get bulk-billing services. Bulk-billing rates for the March quarter are almost 
 a full percentage point lower than the corresponding figure of last year. A one per cent drop in bulk-billing means patients will be forced to pay up-front for more than one million extra GP consultations per year. Every time a GP switches from bulk-billing to charging the AMA scheduled fee, their patients have to pay up to $37 up-front, and even after receiving the Medicare rebate they are $16 a visit out of pocket.
I turn now to the government's heartless decision to scrap the Commonwealth dental scheme. In my view, this would have to rank up there with one of the meanest budget decisions ever made, as I am sure the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) would particularly agree. In my electorate of Namadgi, waiting times for emergency dental care have blown out to over 24 months. If that is the case, and I believe it to be, why does the minister stand in the House here and say that it has nothing to do with him? He should reinstate that program immediately. I understand that waiting periods in other parts of the country are even longer.
Given the disaster that is unfolding before us in public health, one would have expected that the government would have taken some steps in the budget to redress the situation. However, I am disappointed to inform the House—this side does not need informing—that the budget announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on Tuesday night offers no solution to the nation's public health crisis. There is not one extra dollar in that budget for public hospitals that was not offered to the Premiers before their walkout of that famous Premiers Conference.
There is not one extra dollar in the budget for dental health, despite the continuing blow-out in waiting lists for emergency and preventative care. There is not one new idea in private health insurance, and the government's own budget papers show that it expects the numbers in private health insurance to continue to fall—and, again, I refer to the graph. That is right; the numbers in private health insurance are expected to continue to fall.
The government's much trumpeted private health insurance incentives have failed miserably to address the decline in private 
 health insurance. The hundreds of millions of dollars that the government has wasted on those incentives would have been much better spent directly on the public health system.
The minister's close friend, that famous Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, was absolutely correct when he described the incentives as a complete waste of money. When asked why the private health insurance figures had to be massively readjusted in the budget and why they continued to show a steady decline of more than 30,000 people a year into the future, the best the minister could come up with was to blame the Treasury. In his press conference the minister's excuses were:
. . . Treasury initially overestimated the cost.
And:
. . . Well again, the predictions on that are the Treasury's . . . we merely go along for the ride on their predictions.
Perhaps it is time for the minister to get on with his job, to do some hard work. Perhaps he could stop blaming others. I notice that he tends to do that an awful lot in this place. He should start working towards solving the crisis.
I note that the state and territory health ministers, most of whom are of the same political ilk as this minister, have also condemned the budget and the minister for failing to meet the growing demand for health services. What have the state and territory health ministers had to say? Here is one quote:
This budget will barely help us keep up with the growing demand for heart surgery alone.
And another:
The federal government seems to think the Medicare negotiations are just a political game, in which they can push and pull figures at will.
It is hardly a ringing endorsement of the minister's performance. Perhaps Jeff Kennett was right when he said that this minister, despite being a `nice bloke', was simply not up to the job as the nation's health minister.
The states are right to complain about the budget. Despite receiving that $300 million windfall—I suppose we could call it—from the failure of the government's private health insurance measures, there is no increase in the 
 funding offer to the states for public hospitals. The minister's claims about extra public hospital funding are based on extremely dodgy figures. No-one should believe his claims. He has shown no ability to come to terms with the crisis before him.
Unless the Prime Minister intervenes—and, while I suggest that, I do so with a certain amount of query; `trepidation' is a good word—and takes immediate steps to rectify this crisis, there will be more than one million extra patients on public hospital waiting lists. That will be this governments's legacy to the people of Australia.
The bottom line in this debate is really very simple and, as members of this place, I am sure that every day we hear and see examples of it. At the end of the day, it is people—it is families, it is our older Australians, it is our children—who, when they need it, should expect to get and receive appropriate adequate health care. Petulant and smart alecky behaviour on behalf of this government fails that community completely.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—It gives me great pleasure to speak to this matter of public importance. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has suggested some spurious ambition that the current health minister might have for another portfolio including finance.
All I can say is that the member for Dobell has a number of problems. The first of them is that the Liberal Party has endorsed in the seat of Dobell a doctor—someone who actually understands health, who might understand that teeth do not actually bleed when fractured; someone who understands that dentures do not come under the Commonwealth dental health program; someone who understands—a bloke's bloke, I might add—that, debilitating as a chronic ear effusion may be—
Opposition member interjecting—
—I will tell you something: when Mr Kennett—who has been critical of the government, and the minister in particular, over the hospital financing agreements—made some claims in January 1995 that there was not a problem in his public hospitals, I went there to have a look at them. These were under the Medicare agreements that were 
 negotiated and signed in haste, as the minister said, by the previous Labor government—by Mr Brian Howe, the then health minister, and Paul Keating, the then Prime Minister of Australia.
Whilst not for one minute wanting to trivialise the discomfort, the pain and the inconvenience of a chronic ear effusion, I found two people in an 18-bed neurosurgical ward at St Vincent's Hospital, one with hemiparesis and the other with hemiplegia—that means, completely paralysed on one side of the body. Having been filled up with steroids to reduce the pressure on their brains from brain tumours, they had been waiting for elective surgery for three weeks.
The reason that had occurred was because the previous federal Labor government had done two things. It had withdrawn every financial assistance and subsidy that had been provided since 1983 to private health insurance—that is, reinsurance arrangements; making sure that the private health funds paid 25 per cent of Medicare benefit schedule fees; putting expensive prostheses onto basic tables; and withdrawing bed day subsidies. Also, it had withdrawn all political support for private health insurance—and this, of course, had escalated the demand on the public system, whilst reducing the number of people in the community who were caring for themselves.
But what it also did in those 1993 Medicare agreements, which these hospital financing agreements now replace, was to  set in place a program that actually discouraged the public hospitals from treating privately insured patients. So the income that was derived from public hospitals treating privately insured patients significantly declined. Mr Kennett himself and his government contributed substantially to the problems that his hospitals faced because, whilst introducing casemix funding for public hospitals in Victoria, he took $211 million out of the Victorian public hospitals system. In fact, after the Commonwealth had increased funding by 12.6 per cent in that first year, the states reduced it by 12.9 per cent.
We came to government at a time of collapsing aged dependency ratios, a rapidly ageing demographic. We were propping up 
 consumption, as the previous government had propped up consumption through debt and asset sales. We were spending four per cent of our GDP in financing our debt and equity obligations. Those, amongst other things, exposed us to exchange rate depreciations, which begs the imagination as to where under Labor we would be now, with the problems that are occurring with our Asian neighbours.
In health specifically, in the Medicare benefit schedule we would face 5.6 per cent real growth in outlays per annum over the preceding three years and 9½ per cent nominal growth in the preceding decade. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme had increased in the year before we came to government by 14.5 per cent and was predicted to grow 50 per cent over the next four years. Cost shifting was estimated at the time to be worth $400 million a year. That is an activity about which Mr Kennett and the other state premiers should know a great deal—shifting costs from public hospitals at a state level back to the Commonwealth. We also had a significant maldistribution of the medical work force; there was estimated to be 4,000 too many general practitioners in city areas. We also had a decline in private health insurance participation in excess of two per cent per annum.
When the opposition speak with some derision of the current Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and his performance in this role, it is worth reminding them of some of their own performers—not people I would describe as top performers. Mr Brian Howe was the health minister in the Hawke government and then in the Keating government. In April 1992 the then health minister, Mr Brian Howe, said of private health insurance:
Private health insurance makes an insignificant contribution to health financing.
It was Mr Howe as the health minister in the 1991 budget who introduced a medicare co-payment. He said that those people who were not in receipt of social security benefits would be liable for a Medicare co-payment and at the same time he took $430 million out of health to put it into his better cities program—to play with houses. In other words, it 
 was a Labor government that did everything it could to reduce bulk-billing participation.
One hundred million dollars was put aside in the 1993 budget—a pre-election commitment, by the way. That is a significant amount of money. That was to put public patients into private hospitals—it is a bit like sending kids from public schools to the private education sector as a way of dealing with educational crises. Of course, when Senator Graham Richardson became the health minister he had to very quietly slip out the back door with that one because it was simply unworkable. Basically, the $100 million that was budgeted went out the window. Thankfully, Richardson put it into some other more worthy and effective programs.
We also had a GP strategy. The GP strategy came out of the 1991 budget and was subsequently financed in the 1992 budget. This was to do a number of things to provide opportunities for general practitioners to provide services in a non fee-for-service environment. The forward estimates on that were $560 million. Two years into that program, do you know how much of that $560 million had been spent? In two years something like $130 million had been spent. In other words, it was a significant overbudgeting and underspending in what was a very important area for patients and general practitioners.
During the 1993 election, Mr Keating, at the time reported to be worth something like $5 million—I am still trying to find out how one makes that sort of money here—told Australia that people did not need private health insurance. He said that people were wasting their money and that the public health system could look after everybody—that Medicare could look after everybody's services. Then I noticed that the Keatings, the Whitlams, the Hawkes and other luminaries of the Labor movement were all booked into St Vincent's Private over the ensuing Christmas break—as they had every right to be. But the hypocrisy of telling the nation to do one thing and then doing something else for themselves and their families sticks in my craw. 
Then the current member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) became the health minister. One of the things that that minister did was to introduce the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2). This was to introduce the concept of contracting between doctors and private health insurance companies. The way it was introduced, and in particular the way the legislation was set, it was to be disruptive and administratively complex. There were something like $136 million in medical gaps that were unaccounted for and $200 million in hospital gaps that the legislation did not account for. The indirect cost of introducing casemix at the time in the private hospital sector was estimated to be $140 million as a capital one-off cost and $44 million in recurring annual costs. None of that was allowed for in the legislation.
In fact, I recall the then health minister, the member for Fremantle, being interviewed by Mr Kerry O'Brien on Lateline. He asked, `What if you have broken your leg and you are in an ambulance and you have a contract with one insurance company?' Such was her ignorance of the health care system that she said, `You could ring your insurance company and see if you could find another one.' That is not something that I would encourage anyone who has any experience with the health system to suggest people do.
She also talked about efficiency. The government under that health minister was going to make the private health system efficient. The fact is that at the time you would have needed 709,000 extra bed days every year to achieve the same efficiency in the private system that you were achieving in the public system and $50 million just to get to the same level of efficiency as the top 10 diagnostic related groups.
When I was president of the AMA I asked Access Economics to give me some briefings on the budget each year and for the 1993-94 budget they said:
By restricting optometry—
Remember that? The backbench of the Labor Party overthrew this one, such was the effi 
 ciency of the management of the then Labor government—
and some ophthalmology services to card holders only, the government projects to save $48.6 million in this year rising to $107 million next year. These figures appear to be somewhat rubbery as they make no allowance for any run-on of services before the 1 November implementation. Also somewhat rubbery are the estimates of savings over the next four years from combating overservicing and fraud under Medicare.
The then health minister said, `I think it is worth something between $220 million and $330 million a year.' Within six months of that budget estimate he admitted that it was probably worth about $20 million a year. In other words, we are dealing with a period of ineptitude and mismanagement and we are now trying to bring things back to order. (Time expired)

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) has moved amendments and our spokesman, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), will shortly be moving some amendments, but I wanted to particularly address those—and I know he has only spoken part of the way in what he wants to address—in the member for Dickson's proposals. I often remember Paul Keating talking about the marketplace of ideas. I have always welcomed those who put ideas before indifferent forums and it is in that context that I welcome his suggestions, although I hope to explain why I will not be specifically supporting them. I do want to say, very strongly, that I share one aspect and that is that I really think there is a need for a tribunal in family law where lawyers are precluded from appearing. Although there are 
 constitutional difficulties with that, I believe that they can be overcome.
What the member for Dickson is addressing by way of his amendments are very important issues. Firstly, I think in administrative law there is a well established principle that citizens have a right to have an internal review of administrative decisions. The difficulty with the review office is that it purports to operate because the review offices are external, as though it were a proper external body of review, similar to that we have in the Department of Veterans' Affairs or the Department of Social Security. I want to make it clear that I believe we should have a robust system of internal review but also of external review, one that is efficient, cost effective and based on a similar way in which these two departments operate.
During the second reading debate the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) suggested that the government was going to institute a review of review officers to return a degree of consistency and predictability in the way in which they reach decisions. I think that, particularly for an external review body if not internal, this is absolutely vital. Citizens ought to know what reasonable chance they have of success when they appear before it.
During the committee's inquiries, we were being assured 3½ years ago or more that this very same thing was happening. The point I wanted to make to the government members in particular is that you are really faced, at the moment, with two choices: one is the proposals that are being elaborated on by the member for Dickson here in this chamber today and the other is the original proposals the committee put forward, which have been substantially ignored.
I want to reiterate what would happen under those proposals. The existing system is internal review, not external review, and therefore a significant departure from normal administrative practice. We should institute a proper basis of internal review, as operates under other departments. The registrar would have the first right, if you like, to fix a mistake of his own volition or as a result of internal review. But if parties, after having made that request, were dissatisfied then they would 
 have this right to go to an external body like the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. If they were not happy there they would, as they do with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, go to AAT or the Family Court.
It is fatuous to suggest, as the government has tended to, that the proposals either by the member for Dickson or those originally proposed in the committee report are more expensive time wasting. I think these are basic rights that any citizen should have when dealing with departments and even agencies like the Child Support Agency. It is an absolute tragedy that nothing has been done to fix up this serious error of administration. So much of the administrative recommendations have been picked up, I admit that, but not this particular one.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—What the member for Chifley (Mr Price) is basically alluding to there is the need to have procedural fairness in all of this. We do not have procedural fairness while there is justice, so-called, behind closed doors. As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, the very soul of justice is publicity. For people who are not subject to the normal rigorous processes of outside scrutiny, as the review officers are not, it is all very well to say there is an appeal from the review officer, but who can afford to go to the Family Court on appeal from a review officer? Nobody. They are exercising tremendous power, yet story after story that comes to my office indicates that they are not behaving according to the rules of natural justice.
I want to address the question of fairness, which is the purpose behind my amendments. Will anybody in this House say it is fair for a non-custodial parent to pay $1,200 a month for a two-year-old child and that the same amount should be paid for a 16-year-old child? That is the current system and that, in itself, is inherently unfair and inequitable.
Is it fair and equitable, for example, for $100,000 to be paid in child support, tax free, to a custodial parent and for that parent still to be able to get the pension? They are  still able to get the pension and get $100,000. That is the way the system is at the moment. We cannot have a system that works in this 
 way and is not subject to external review. It is not equitable, it is not logical, and yet the system continues.
I emphasise this: it is no good saying, `We have to balance both sides,' when the scales are tipped so far the other way. I am not ashamed to say that. They are tipped in favour of the custodial parent. Let us be honest—they are. As other members have said, it is no good us having a cherry picker approach to the report of the member for Chifley. We have got to look at the whole of that report, the totality of that report. Frankly, having sat on a lengthy inquiry into the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, it is highly insulting for a later group to come along and say, `Thanks very much. You've worked very hard, but we'll just have a little flick through this report. We'll grab one here and one there and then 
 make a point of saying that we are adopting schedule or part such and such of the report.' It is an insult to the people who served on those committees and the people who heard the evidence. We have got to listen to all these things.
The major problem is, in my view, apart from anything else, the unfairness aspect. We must look at matters such as the cost of children. I have before me a document outlining two approaches to the cost of children: the `basket-of-goods approach' and the `expenditure survey approach'. The document came from the Institute of Family Studies. It is a 1998 document. I seek leave to incorporate this document in Hansard.
Leave granted.

Costs of Children in Australia
There are two important differences between results obtained by using the basket-of-goods method and the expenditure survey method as presented in the accompanying Tables. First, the basket-of-goods approach provides only part of the cost of a child, while the expenditure survey measures the total amount spent on the child. Second, the basket-of-goods method indicates how much parents would spend on their children if the child was to enjoy the fruits of the basket specified by the researcher. In this sense, it provides an `ideal' or desirable costing. In contrast, the expenditure survey method indicates how much parents actually spend on their children, even though the amount spent might be considered inadequate or excessive by the objective standards of the basket-of-goods method.

*	 Includes medical and dental costs, education costs and other miscellaneous costs. Costs of children vary according to the number of children in the family, the parents' incomes and whether one or both parents are working.
Note:	 The figures in the table relate to a one-child, one-income family with an income of $693.80 gross per week. The Lee data show that two children cost about 55 per cent more than one child, while three children cost about twice the cost of one child. The dollar costs of children are  relatively `flat' compared with rises in family income: children in poor families cost proportionally more, and children in rich families proportionally less than those in middle income families.

—The basket-of-goods approach is the cost of such things as food, clothing, fuel, household provisions, schooling—not school fees—gifts, pocket money and entertainment. Not included are things such as housing, transport, school fees, uniforms, child care, medical or dental expenses. The expenditure survey approach, said to be based on Lee 1989, chose a much higher figure.
It must be realised at the outset that expenditure does not equal cost. The problem with the expenditure survey approach is that it is said to be based on a regression analysis. Even in the expenditure survey approach we can see in the document references to the expenditure approach and then cost as if those terms were interchangeable—they are not. So inherent in the survey is an inherent defect.
Attempts to track down Mr Lee to find out exactly what that means have been unsuccessful. The document upon which it is based is at the moment unprocurable, yet the document is being peddled by the Institute of Family Studies and frequently forms the basis of orders by courts as to the amount of child support to be paid and government policy in 
 this area. This is simply not good enough. Mr Price's committee recommended that the income of new partners be taken into account. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—What an extraordinary little political drama we are witnessing being played out this afternoon. We have here a member of the government, the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), moving amendments to the government's own bill, the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 . Certainly in my time in this place I have not seen it happen before, and I wonder just how far back in history we would have to go to see such an event.
We have not heard from the government. My question is: what is the government's position in relation to the amendments moved by the member for Dickson? Is the government going to support the member for Dickson or is the government going to oppose him? This is a sign of a government in disarray and, indeed, a Liberal Party in disarray.
When I first came into this place three members were sitting on the cross benches as 
 Independents: the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), the member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). They were previously members of the Liberal Party. Since that time we have seen the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) cross the floor and become an Independent and we have seen the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) cross the floor and become an Independent. Indeed, the member for McPherson has, I understand, seconded the amendments moved by the member for Dickson. It would appear that the member for Dickson is off on a frolic of his own, unsupported by his own government. We now need to hear what the position of the government is in relation to the amendments moved by the member for Dickson.
This is a sign of a government in disarray. We have seen a plethora of ministerial resignations, of parliamentary secretary resignations—including the Deputy President of the Senate—in all these things. I do not think we have seen anything like this since the Stalin cabinet of 1920.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The amendments that I have moved are about specific matters in relation to the setting up of a tribunal. The speaker should address those matters, not embark on a political exercise, which he is doing.
—There is no point of order, but I will ask the speaker to address his remarks to the amendments before the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I certainly intend to do that, but I thought it was worth drawing the attention of the House to what is a fascinating small political drama being played out here this afternoon. 	 But in relation to the amendments before the House, the opposition has not had an opportunity to consider them. They were not provided to us by the member for Dickson, which gives rise to some questions about how seriously he has been pursuing these things. Indeed, we will not be supporting the amendments which have been moved. We think that the concerns which the member for Dickson raises can be better addressed in other ways. Nevertheless, we have listened 
 with interest to the observations that he has made concerning the operation of the scheme and we will be listening to further contributions from him in the course of the debate.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—This is too important an issue for it to become political. It really is a very important issue that is facing so many people around this country. I am trying to raise the profile of this issue. I say to the last speaker, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), that, as a result of my indicating these measures, there have been further moves, and these moves have been reflected in subsequent amendments and foreshadowed amendments to the legislation. The very fact that I came in here, said these things and foreshadowed what I was going to do has at least got the ball moving a little. We have a long way to go, but I am thankful for what has happened so far. I was informed only in the last hour that much more work is being done on this across the board.
We have a system that urgently needs addressing. People are committing suicide because of this system. We cannot ignore that in this country. We have got to do something about it. The only way to do it is to get back to the basics: determining the needs of children, the capacity to pay of both parents, the circumstances of the blended families, and so forth. As I said before, the committee of the member for Chifley (Mr Price) has done some good work on it. The backbench committee—the new task force committee—has done more good work. It needs to go a lot further.
Going back to the regression tables that I was talking about a moment ago, and which now appear to be lost, an essential tenet of the proposition was that `two families spending the same amount on food eaten at home are said to have the same standard of living'. I would have thought that this is a preposterous suggestion. Yet this sort of information is being pushed to found government policy. The previous government was basing policy on some of this stuff. People out there are hurting.
In my respectful submission, we should not adopt a piecemeal approach. What is needed is an approach that addresses this issue. My 
 amendments do that. During the second reading debate many honourable members opposite were calling for a free and open debate on this issue—one with no political restraints. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) was one of those who was saying that, and he is right. It is important for families that we have a free and open vote in this parliament on this issue, bearing in mind that many families are affected by the break-up of marriages and by the pain and heartache involved. The children, in particular, are pulled hither and thither.
These amendments, far from being indicative of a government that is in disarray, are showing the strength of the system on our side of the parliament that forces a review of these things. It is a conscious move by members who are concerned—and it is not just me. There has been a lot of support expressed for this issue both in the Main Committee stage of the debate and also privately. We need this system to be overhauled. My proposals effect that. We have magistrates courts and courts of petty sessions in place all around the country; the cost factor involved is not a lot. They are there now. Each person around the country affected by this system—each divided family by this stage—can go in there and have their case individually treated by a magistrate in a fair and open way, with evidence on oath; all of these things.
As I said at the outset, we need a conscious and urgent approach to fix this system. Progress has been made but much more needs to be done, and done urgently. The message is finally getting through that that is the case. I submit to you that we will need this debate to continue and that these amendments should be accepted.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Bradford, John, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I made a contribution earlier on in this matter. I am disappointed that the Labor Party is not going to support the amendments of the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). I am not sure what the government will do at this stage, but I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) informing the parliament of his intentions. He has brought forward some positive suggestions to improve the Child Support 
 Agency regime. The problem is that this is bandaid legislation. Nobody is saying that this legislation is not positive or that it is not making improvements, but it is only bandaid legislation. It is only fiddling with the problems.
There are no government members in the chamber, with the exception of the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), the parliamentary secretary and the member for Dickson. They know that I know they are all very concerned about this matter. What is more, they have been very outspoken about it. They were very disappointed with the response of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) on this issue, and I assume they still are. She has been very reluctant to do anything substantial in this area and has been very timid and overly cautious about it.
The member for Dickson came in here with a well thought out plan to address many of the fundamental problems. We can expect the government, of which he is a member, to not support his amendments, otherwise they would not be coming up in this form. Unfortunately, the Labor Party does not see fit to support them either, although I know the member for Chifley would generally be sympathetic to what is being proposed by the member for Dickson.
I am disappointed with the way in which this whole issue is proceeding. As I said, every member of this place gets more complaints about the Child Support Agency than any other issue. From my experience with government members, I know that they remain very concerned that the government has not yet done enough to address many of the fundamental problems which exist. Instead of addressing the fundamentals and coming to grips with them in the fairly radical way proposed by the member for Dickson, we have a large list of minor tinkering at the edges which only amounts to, as I said, bandaid solutions.
This agency—this system—is haemorrhaging so badly and adversely affecting so many people in our community that bandaids are just not going to work and are not enough. What is needed is a fundamental rethink. The 
 principle involved of making parents responsible for their children—in most cases making fathers responsible for the children of relationships that they have been in—is a sound one. We all accept and understand that that is the case. But the way that it is being put into effect is not working.
As I was saying earlier today, I have a case at the moment of a couple who are receiving a double whammy. The husband in the new relationship has a former wife who is living the life of Riley with the wealthy man she is now with. The wife in the new relationship's former husband is in the same situation with the lady he is now attached to, but he refuses to pay maintenance and has no income. So this particular family finds themselves almost destitute and they owe the Child Support Agency money which they keep getting reminded about. Every time they get reminders in the mail the situation is made a hundred times worse.
I commend the member for Dickson for what he has done and I support his amendments. I do not know where it will go from here but at least somebody—and that is the member for Dickson—in this place is actually trying to get to some of the basics and to look for fundamental solutions to the problems rather than just doing as this legislation does—albeit improving the situation to some extent, it nevertheless only manages to tinker with the edges.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—I thank the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) for his considered remarks. He has always gone on record as someone who has desired a significant reform of this system. One of the things that I also want to point out in pointing to these amendments as a way to go is what is sometimes forgotten. If I can give just a very short lesson on the common law here, what I am proposing is that the tribunal would exercise the old common law principle with only one departure in that I use the word `parents' rather than `parent'. The old common law just had the principle `the needs of the child and the capacity to pay of the parent'. In this modern time both parents are working in a lot of cases. A lot of parents both have the capacity 
 to pay, therefore we take the whole bundle together these days. That is the only update there.
Another point that I wanted to make clear is that when we are talking about child support what we are talking about is maintenance. At common law, again, an applicant for maintenance could rarely get arrears of maintenance beyond one or two years. It was highly extraordinary to get maintenance beyond that time for the simple reason that the child is two—or sometimes five—years older than the time when that amount of money accrued, and what we are talking about then is a capital payment, not child support, because the child has moved on. It is important to bear that in mind because of the culture of the Child Support Agency. There is the notion that it is just the same as tax because it is part of the Taxation Office; it is not. It has been said that the money is a debt to the Commonwealth.
This is about money for children but it is also about fairness. It is not about creating a situation where a person wears the pendulum of a debt, going back five or ten years in some cases, with absolutely no chance of paying it back. It is hanging like a millstone around their neck. We have to get away from that culture and get to the culture of appreciating that this is about ongoing maintenance of children; it is not about large debts that will turn into capital payments if repaid in the future—which has nothing to do with child support.
The child could be over 18 and there could be a debt of $10,000. Does that mean that at some stage in the future, if the liable parent wins the Casket, suddenly $10,000 goes straight to the person? This has nothing to do with child support unless the person who is the custodial parent has changed his or her position in consideration of not having daily maintenance; that is a different situation. If they have borrowed money and all those sorts of things, that can be considered. I point out that a court can look at these things but a bland agency, with one person exercising great powers with the stroke of a pen, has this myopic view of things. It has no appreciation of the way the common law works or the 
 reality of these things: that this is not about debts; it is about ongoing maintenance. I emphasise that, particularly in relation to the suggestion that there are going to be greater powers in the departure orders that are talked about.
This is not the time to talk about that, but bear in mind that the reason behind this particular amendment is to ensure procedural fairness, to ensure the right of every individual to be heard. It is part of my political philosophy that every individual couple out there can be heard, whether they send their kids to state schools—I used to go to a state school; Salisbury High School—or to Grammar. They all have their opportunity to be heard and to present their case. They are special in the eyes of the court, in the eyes of this tribunal, because they are all given their go, they are all given their day. That is what this is really about. So, without wanting to take any more time of the House, I do urge this proposal upon the House and I thank members for listening to me.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Bradford, John, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I have just got one other point that I would like to make. I appreciate the patience of the government. The Chief Whip has asked me to make my remarks brief. I told him if he would give me 30 seconds, I would cooperate. I am using up the seconds anyway.
I wanted to ask the parliamentary secretary just one question which he might address at some stage, that is, what is the effect of this legislation requiring the introduction of a minimum income of $260 in calculating the amount of child care payable in respect of a day? Is that related to the fact that people are required to pay now regardless of their circumstances? I understand that is the minimum amount that they now have to pay. I am not sure how they are going to do it if they do not have any income, if they are unemployed. They are not liable for a child support payment under those circumstances, but I got the impression that this was a requirement that, regardless of the person's means, they would have to pay a minimum amount. I am not sure where that came from and I would just like to understand where, if the people are 
 destitute, they are going to get even that $260 from.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Miles, Chris, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—To address that amount of $260 to begin with, the government's position on this is that every parent has an obligation to their children. I do not think any parents who have come to me have rejected that concept or principle. To give an example to the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), we are expecting those people who are unemployed to contribute $5 per week for 52 weeks—the $260. That is going on the principle that every parent has a responsibility to the children they have brought into this world. Hopefully, that gives the honourable member a sense of direction in regard to what he is asking about.
The member for Chifley (Mr Price) indicated—and I did not get up at that time to reply—that he believed the bill nets the government $47 million over four years. We do not believe that is the case. It does not. The savings from one measure—for example, private collection funds—fund the other measures, such as the increase in pay as exempt income and allowing credit for the 50 per cent of child support paid to determine the entitlement to family payment. I hope that is helpful to the member for Chifley. Whether he agrees with it is up to him; I recognise that.
To come to the amendments which are now before the House, I make the following comments. The proposal is for a small claims child support tribunal. We believe that this tribunal would not provide a new service and would not assist parents to have contact with their children. There is a range of issues we could go into but I want to come to the point quickly. In regard to the recommendations from the government task force, as announced already here today, the existing process to depart from formula assessment will be examined to develop a range of options that will improve its transparency and accountability. Changes are to be considered in 1999, the 2000 budget process.
Secondly, there will be a review of the training, qualifications and remuneration of 
 officers contracted to determine applications to depart from formula assessment which will report to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) by 30 June this year. This review will include legislation, procedures, information needed by clients, physical location and accountability of officers, and notification of decisions and appeal mechanisms, including an evaluation of the proposed legislative amendment which introduces objection provisions for the departure decisions. So we believe we are moving forward on this.
One or two comments were made earlier in regard to which I make these comments. The government has responded to all of the 163 recommendations of the joint standing committee. We did not accept all of them. The government does not accept the amendments which are now before the House. But I have to say to members of the previous government, now members of the opposition, that the previous government responded to about 50 of the 163 recommendations, whereas we have at least responded to all of them, and the previous government did not introduce any legislation. We believe that this is a definite step forward in regard to this issue. Some people in this parliament are obviously saying it does not go far enough. I guess in that sense that even within the government we are a broad church on a whole range of issues, but these are steps forward and we trust that they will be of benefit to families and children in this country. I state again that the government is opposed to these amendments.

I want to recap briefly on the child support debate as we find it now. The starting point, I guess, in terms of discussion of these issues is the report on the child support scheme by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, chaired by the member for Chifley (Mr Price). As has been mentioned, that committee attracted an extraordinary level of interest. It received over 6,000 submissions. A hotline organised by the joint select committee generated 150,000 calls in two days of operation. That indicates the level of community interest and indeed concern about this issue.
It is also borne out by the fact that, according to the 1995-96 Commonwealth Ombudsman's report, the Child Support Agency accounts for some 16 per cent of all complaints to the Ombudsman's office. The Child Support Agency receives in excess of 4,000 letters a day. Indeed, during the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 November 1997 it received over 17,000 applications for departure from the standard formula. So it is an area that has attracted a lot of community interest.
The government, with the bill before the House, the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998, is essentially acknowledging a lot of the value of the child support scheme by only tinkering at the margins. I think 
 anyone who has had a detailed look at this legislation will acknowledge that the changes are very small indeed and are very much at the margin, a point made by the member for Chifley in some of his earlier remarks about the financial impact of this legislation.
That point is also clear if you look at some of the examples given by the government in its own explanatory memorandum. If you do some calculations on this you find that if your income is $50,000 and you are a payer then presently you have to pay around 22 per cent of your income in looking after two children. Under the government's proposed changes you will still have to pay 22 per cent. In other words, there is no effective change. If your income is $40,000, current payments of 21 per cent move to 20 per cent, allowing for rounding in these matters. So the changes are very much at the margin.
In the hypothetical examples given in the explanatory memorandum of a couple that go by the names of Peter and Francine, we see that Peter's child support annual rate changes from $11,163 to $10,795. In another calculation in a hypothetical example, Peter ends up having to pay Francine $7,663 compared with $7,686 under the current legislation. That is $23 per annum less and hardly cause, as I said in the second reading debate, for breaking out the champagne.
In the second reading debate I indicated amendments that the opposition would be moving. I asked that the government might see their way clear to support these amendments. Indeed, I noted that, if you have pioneering and trailblazing legislation like the child support legislation, it is reasonably predictable that that kind of legislation will require tinkering and adjustment in the future. I asked that the government consider the amendments that we put forward. It is very clear from the amendments which the government propose to move later in this debate that they have considered our proposals and have, to some extent, taken them on board. We welcome the fact that the government have done that. We do want to ask the government some questions about their amendments, but we welcome the fact that they are taking on board some of the proposals that we put 
 forward and flagged during the debate in the second reading on this issue.
I want to run through some of the issues that we are proposing with our amendments, and we will persist with them because we have not had the opportunity to look at the government's amendments in any detail. They have only been flagged within the last 24 hours. We may have the opportunity to consider them more between this place and the Senate. But, given that we have not had those opportunities, and there appear to be some differences between what we have been putting forward and what the government has now agreed—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—Like many of my colleagues, I have been intimately involved in this process since entering the parliament in 1996. I have not spoken to this bill until now. The work I have done, like many of my colleagues, has been done in back rooms talking to ministers and convincing them as to what has to occur.
—How do we know?
—The bottom line is that the proof is in the pudding or in the eating. What we have now is something before the parliament which is actually going to occur. I find it very interesting that the opposition—and I see the member that chaired the report in this parliament—brought down an excellent report. But the bottom line was that the opposition, then in government, did not have the gumption to do one damn thing about this whole issue. They let down both the mothers and the fathers that had been out there striving to come to grips with this system.
It is my opinion that the system when introduced in 1988 set the pendulum from one that supported the non-custodial parent to one that supported the custodial parent to such a degree that there was no balance. So we have gone from one end of the spectrum to the other. What I and many of my colleagues have been about is trying to put some balance back into this so that all parties can gain. What the opposition has done is nothing more than play pathetic politics. The bottom line is that, if they actually wanted to do anything, they had since 1988 to do something about it. They did not do anything about it.
Now when they come into this place with these amendments they do so with the protection of knowing that they do not have to actually make a decision. We in government have strived very hard to ensure that both the payers and the payees were looked at in a respectable and a responsible manner. We have responded not only to the report but also to the people who have come into our electorate offices. In my opinion this is yet another attempt by the opposition to take some of the gloss off what are incredibly good amendments to this legislation. It supports people's rights. It puts back some flexibility into the system, and it provides those parents who find themselves in this disastrous situation with some sort of hope for the future.
Why was it not good enough for you to do this in 1990 or 1991? Why was it not good enough for you to do it in 1993 or after the report in 1994? After the report was brought down in 1994, you had two full years. What did you do about non-agency payments? Nothing. What did you do about improving the rights of parents to have an appeal process? Nothing. You listened to them, but you closed your ears and your eyes and did nothing to help them. What we have done since being in government is to move this process forward. I condemn the opposition for playing politics with people's lives. I had no intention of speaking to this bill for the simple reason that what we need to do is not make this a headline issue but simply rectify it so that people can get on with lives. As the member opposite who chaired this report has said, we are dealing with the corpses of dead relationships, and they are awfully emotive. It is not in this forum or any other forum that we should be standing up here and trying to score political points when people's relationships—
—What are you doing right now?
—I am responding to your pathetic attempt to  pull yourself out of the quagmire which you put yourself in because you were unable to deal with it.
—Order! I ask members to address their remarks through the chair.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept that you would like comments to be addressed through the chair, but we get pathetic interjections like this which try to tell us that they were good enough and were going to do something. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) often says, it is always the 14th year. With this issue you never had the numbers in your party room. You did not have the backbone or the spine to do anything to help either payers or payees.
You stand condemned by your silence and your inaction when you were in government. The fact is that in opposition you hide behind the fact that you put legislation or amendments into this parliament knowing that they would not be enacted. I am very pleased that this government, the ministers and the backbenchers have worked very hard over the last two years and that the steps we have taken are going in a very positive manner to address this difficult issue. It is unfortunate that marriages do break down. It is unfortunate that children are put into these situations, but this legislation will go a long way to assisting them, and the opposition has done nothing but put condemnation on their own actions as a result of their amendments tonight.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—I do not want to go through and outline to the House what our amendments actually are. But I do need to take up some of the remarks of the member for Longman (Mr Brough), who has said that we did not deliver in relation to this.
Let us have a quick look at the history of the issue of direct payments in the child's interest. The history of this issue is as follows. The government brought forward its legislation, its amendment. It had absolutely nothing to say about direct payments in the child's interest. During the second reading debate I flagged that, to pick up this issue, the opposition would move amendments in the consideration in detail stage that would allow the Child Support Registrar the discretion to credit certain non-agency payments as child support when, in the registrar's opinion, these payments were in the interests of the child, subject to a 25 per cent limit.
Now, lo and behold, we find the government, after that second reading debate, coming into the chamber this afternoon with some amendments of its own. What do we find? We find schedule 11A, non-agency payments up to a limit of 25 per cent—picking up our suggestion in its entirety.
That is good. We welcome that. We intend to support the government's amendments, as moved. But the point is that the only reason these amendments are now coming forward from the government is that we moved them from opposition. That will be quite clear to anyone who wants to follow the history of the legislation.
I will make some remarks about the amendments we are proposing. Amendments 2, 3 and 5 relate to the issue of fringe benefits and seek to pick up recommendations 143 and 144 of the joint select committee. We are concerned about avoidance issues, as the joint select committee properly was; therefore, we propose to move these amendments.
The government has suggested that it is going to have an inquiry into these matters. An inquiry may or may not produce something of value, and we would be interested in hearing some more from the government on exactly what it is seeking to do concerning child support avoidance. But we are proposing, and will persist with, amendments 2, 3 and 5, which are directed to the issue of fringe benefits.
Amendment 4 goes to this issue of direct payments—the one we were proposing in the second reading debate, which the government has now picked up and adopted. We will be looking at the government's response closely. But, on the face of it, it is something that we would be happy to support. We think there is a case for ensuring that non-custodial parents are more directly involved in the parenting of their children.
Amendments 6 and 7 relate to the issue of changes in income and the need for more up-to-date assessments. This is a hot issue on both sides, if you like. In a situation where the non-custodial parent's income drops by less than 15 per cent of the estimated income, they end up paying child support which they are unable to recover but which does not 
 reflect their actual income—and I think people are entitled to say that that is a bit steep. Conversely, you can also get the situation where, if your income drops below 15 per cent and you put in an amended assessment later, the custodial parent finds the tax office coming to them and saying, `Well, in fact, you owe the child support agency money'—and that is very difficult where you have spent that money or made other provision for it.
This is a hot issue both ways. There is a need to have more up-to-date income assessments. We do not believe that what the government has put forward is sufficient in this regard, although it represents an improvement—they are talking about the last taxation year, rather than the last taxation year but one. We feel that joint select committee recommendations 126 and 127 may be better in terms of addressing this issue, and we are keen to see more up-to-date assessments so we do not get into the problem of sudden changes in income.
Amendment 8 refers to the need for a review and the issues of future modelling, as picked up by joint select committee recommendations 162 and 163. We want to know whether the government's review is addressing this and, if so, how. Regrettably, the task force that it set up was only for the government party; it was a secret task force. We want to find out some more about the nature of the review being proposed. Amendment 9 concerns the issue of statements being made recklessly and picks up joint select committee recommendations 128 and 129.
We feel that these are positive changes, that they would improve the operation of the child support legislation. Therefore, we do propose to support them here. Between here and another place, we had every opportunity to consider them further.

"Marek, Paul, MP",NP,1998-05-14,"—I rise to speak on this topic—and I have spoken just about every time there was an opportunity—because, after listening to comments some of the speakers have rabbled on with today, I think it is absolutely imperative that some of the points be commented on. As far as the Smith amendments are concerned, I must say 
 that they are easy to support. But, as far as I am concerned—
—Why don't you vote for them then?
—Already we have people interrupting, Mr Deputy Speaker. I demand to be heard in silence.
—Order! I would ask members to address their remarks through the chair, and then we will not have any difficulties.
—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. As far as the Smith amendments are concerned, they are easy to support. But, as far as I am concerned—and I am sure that a lot of the people in the government or the committee are concerned—the amendments, or the way his process is concerned, there are other methods to make this happen. I am sure that there are. I believe that we could try to implement a system that would probably cover what Mr Smith is trying to achieve, but I think we could try to do it without creating more bureaucracy.
That is something that the Labor Party always worked very heavily on—trying to introduce more bureaucracy. I guess that is the problem we have today. We have a Child Support Agency that is basically run by bureaucracy, and people just do not have a real opportunity in relation to fairness and equity. As far as that is concerned, that is my personal point of view.
The increasing of the discretionary amount by 10 per cent, I think, is a great initiative. It is something that a lot of the people out there, the non-custodial parents, have wanted for quite a while. I must speak to the comment we hear being made by the Labor Party that it wanted a greater increase. Why didn't you do it? Why didn't the Labor Party do it? Why don't you vote for them then?
Opposition member interjecting—
—Order!
—They ask the question, Mr Deputy Speaker, they comment; you have to give them the opportunity.
—Order! All remarks should be made through the chair.
—I did, Mr Deputy Speaker; I am just giving them the opportunity. But, as we can see, Labor had no plans. They have no clothes and they have no credibility on this issue. You don't.
Let us have a closer look at it. We have the member for Chifley (Mr Price) over here. Why doesn't the member for Chifley actually come clean and admit that Keating would not allow you to introduce the amendments that needed to happen? That is exactly what happened. You would never ever get any of this sort of stuff through; with your socialist welfare mentality, it just would not work.
As far as this is concerned, Keating would not let it happen. I give the member for Chifley credit where it is due; the man tried to have a go but Keating and his people would not let it happen. You know damn well that that is the case; you just will not admit it.
What does it say for democracy? Absolutely nothing. That is why I say to you that it is absolutely incredible that you people get up and talk about it. You have no credibility; you have no clothes on the issue and you should be condemned for what you say.
As far as the non-custodial and the custodial parents are concerned, in the last 2½ years we have delivered more for the people embroiled in this issue than the Labor Party has. It is very easy to see that. All you have to do is go out there and talk to the people who are representative of the people who are embroiled in it. There are various groups—Lone Fathers, all those sorts of people. They are genuine. They do not want to get involved in politics. They are not politically motivated or orientated. They just want a fair go. That is how I went about trying to get involved in this issue and that is what we have delivered—a fair go for all.
As far as I am concerned, there is more to be done on this topic. It is going to take some time. If people thought it was going to happen overnight, they were sadly mistaken. This is going to be a tough job to try to sort it out 
 for everybody. Ultimately people have to understand the fact that if they are your children you have a responsibility to look after them. That is where the people who are on unemployment benefits and not paying child support come in. They will now have to pay the $260 per year. I will argue with anyone that that is a good initiative. People must be responsible for their own children and their own actions. Two hundred and sixty dollars a year is not a lot to ask to support your own children. The reduction of the custodial disregard amount to bring both closer together to make it fair and equitable is a great initiative.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—It is true that there is no area of government responsibility that draws emotions like family law and the Child Support Agency. That case has just been well put by the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) in his rather emotional contribution coming on the back of the rather emotional contribution we heard from the member for Longman (Mr Brough), who said he had no intention of speaking on this bill originally but he decided that he had to get up and defend the government's honour on this issue because, as he put it, the Labor Party was trying to make some sort of political capital out of this important issue.
I have listened to this debate very intently. There are three things that we can all agree on. The first is that the child support scheme is a necessary scheme. I do not need to go over again the terrible situation we had in this country prior to the Labor Party's introduction of the scheme where fathers in particular—I do not want to single them out—were not taking any responsibility for their children.
The second thing we would agree on, I think, is that in some cases custodial parents are being disadvantaged by the system. The system is not tough enough on those non-custodial parents who seek to avoid their obligation. The third thing I think we would all agree on is the fact that the pendulum has swung a little too far. My main reason for rising to speak is to clearly put my position on the record. I think the pendulum has swung too far and the whole system is acting to the disadvantage of non-custodial parents 
 who, in the bulk of cases—at the risk of singling out males again—are non-custodial males.
We go to the question as to what we are going to do about it. This raises again the charge from the member for Longman that the Labor Party has been politicising this issue. The Labor Party was doing something about it. In the chamber at the moment we have the member for Chifley (Mr Price), who did chair the joint select committee. That committee came up with something like 163 recommendations, many of which were adopted by the former Labor government. That report was around for about 18 months before the last election. I thought the progress on those recommendations was fairly good—not good enough, I accept, but pretty good.
Around that time, or just before the last federal election, the members of the now government were roaming the width and breadth of the country screaming blue murder about the inequities contained within the Child Support Act and promising to do something about it. Let us look at what they have done. The last time I spoke on this issue was in May 1997 when I was contributing to the second reading debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996. What a weak bill, indeed, that was. It did very little to assist non-custodial parents but, when challenged back then in May 1997, what did the government tell us? They said, `Don't worry, we're going to set up a task force and all will be well.' We don't know who is on the task force. We do not know what their reference is; we do not know what recommendation is likely to come from it, but we are still waiting. We are almost to the end of a full term of this government and we still have nothing that is going to give relief to non-custodial parents.
Where is their integrity on this issue? I know this is a very sensitive gender issue but why can't the parties put the politics aside? You have the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) in here with a very strong view and with, I have to say, some amendments worthy of consideration. You have the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) in here sharing the view, I think, of the majority. You have 
 members of the National Party in here recognising that the pendulum has swung too far; so why can't we, as a parliament, get together and sort out this mess? I invite the government to widen the membership of their task force and to include the Christian Democrats, to include the Labor Party and to include the Independents in this place. Let us see whether we can work together to make a better system. (Time expired)

Omit ""or 71A"", substitute "", 71A or 71C"".
I would just like to make the following brief comments. Non-agency payments: the ar 
 rangements for direct non-agent payments in lieu of the child support liability have been changed to make them more flexible and allow payers more choice in the form in which child support is paid by them while protecting payees and meeting the basic needs of children.
The changes are the following. Certain payments can be credited towards a payer's child support liability up to a limit of 25 per cent without requiring the payee's agreement, provided the balance of child support is paid. The following items will be included in the child support regulations: fees charged to the school or preschool at which the child is enrolled; essential medical and dental fees; payee rent, including bond and body corporate charges; payee rates; payee mortgage; payee utilities; payee child-care costs; and payee motor vehicle costs, including registration, insurance, service, tyres, repairs and panel beating.
Thirdly, special circumstances will no longer be a criterion for crediting direct payments for up to 100 per cent of child support where both parents intend the payment to be for child support. Fourthly, payments in kind will also be permitted where both parents intend it to be for child support. Fifthly, payments will be able to be made this way from 1 January 1999.
This proposal is consistent with the JSC recommendation 67 that the Child Support Registrar be given discretion to credit certain payments that are made in the best interests of the child. The agreed items will provide a degree of certainty for payers making non-agency payments and they do not preclude situations where both parties intend that a payment or in-kind payment was for child support purposes, with the removal of the need to demonstrate special circumstances before payment can be credited.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—In view of the time, I certainly do not want to detain the House with an extensive debate on this matter. I simply put on the record that what has occurred is that the government has introduced in the past 24 
 hours amendments which appear to take up very much the thrust of some opposition amendments which were flagged during the second reading debate. We are pleased that the government has seen fit to take up amendments which we proposed. We note that they did this as a result of pressure from the opposition. We will seek some explanation of the detail of these between now and the Senate, but on the face of it these seem to be reasonable and supportable amendments and therefore we do not intend to oppose them.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Bradford, John, MP",IND,1998-05-14,"—I believe that these amendments are in fact supportable, and I am pleased to hear the parliamentary secretary in the remarks that he made talk about the best interests of the child. Very often it is not the best interests of the children that end up being paramount in this particular debate. I take it that everyone is keen to have dinner before the reply to the budget by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), so perhaps it would be unwise of me to go on at any length. I was disappointed that the government nevertheless saw fit to gag the debate while the opposition amendments were being debated. Some of them were supportable, in my view, but I was not able, because of the gag, to hear sufficient debate on them. I was disappointed that on balance I was, in a sense, not able to make a decision about the opposition amendments. I was pleased to hear the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) say that he now understands that the amendments that have been introduced by the government in fact do pick up some of the opposition amendments. On balance, I would like at some point to find out which of those amendments have in fact been incorporated.
I wanted to say very quickly that the member for Longman (Mr Brough), who is not in his seat and will not be able to interject, was being slightly disingenuous in the remarks that he made. He talked about balance between the custodial and non-custodial parent. I have heard him on many occasions—I will not tell too many tales out of school here—complain about the lack of balance that there is now in the system. My friend in the opposition alluded to the fact that there was, 
 despite the legislation we are dealing with today, a serious imbalance between the interests of the custodial and the non-custodial parent. The point is that this legislation does not yet go nearly far enough. Some of the amendments may have gone towards that, but that remains to be seen. I, like the member for Wills and the opposition, will watch the debate in the Senate. That seems to be, I might observe as a Senate candidate, the place where things actually get debated and seriously considered, so I am looking forward to being elected to the Senate in due course so that I can actually make a real contribution and listen carefully to what other people say.
I realise people are being very patient with me here. I asked the parliamentary secretary a question relating to that $260 a year payment. The answer really does concern me, though it will not cause me to oppose the legislation when it comes to a vote. I accept the argument that this is all about making parents responsible for their children. I totally accept that principle. But I now understand that, if someone is on the dole and they do not have an ability by virtue of that to pay child support, they will have $260 a year taken out of their dole. I am not sure that that has been spelt out by the government, because I have people who are very angry at the moment getting letters from the Child Support Agency telling them they owe money. They get them every month and every month the late fee is added. Every month they get the letter they get very angry; violent on occasions. I want to make the point because I do not think the point has been made clearly, and it slipped out, in an aside almost from the parliamentary secretary, in relation to people on the dole. They have often gone on the dole because they have given up on the system. They have been on a good income and they have just given up. They have said, `Look, I am throwing it all away. I refuse to deal with this system. I am going on the dole. I won't have anything more to do with it,' and that is where they end up. Now, if you are on the dole, you will have $260 a year taken out of your dole. I am not arguing about the principle of people being responsible for taking care of their children, but I do not think that has sunk in.
If you are in that family situation we have talked about where you are struggling to pick up the pieces and you have a new relationship with a person who has three children for whom she does not get any assistance from her former husband, you are in a mess if you are on unemployment. And the government is now going to take $260 off them. Come on! Let us make sure people know that that is what the government's intentions are. Although it probably should, it will not cause me to vote against the bill because on balance it is an improvement. Let us hope that it is further improved with the amendments.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—I want to say to the parliamentary secretary that, having had a look at the explanatory memorandum a second time, I still stand by those earlier figures, but could he just respond to a couple of issues? What was it that motivated the government to pick up the 10 per cent figure? Did they do modelling and was that the result rather than the 20 per cent recommended? What prompted the new average weekly earnings figure that is used for disregarded income as opposed to the pension cut-off point? Having commissioned the University of New South Wales study into the cost of the children, could he advise the House in what way this study has influenced the government's decisions in this bill and these amendments? In relation to the amendments, why was the additional 35 per cent by mutual agreement in terms of non-agency payments not picked up, given that, at the urging of the shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), they have picked up the 25 per cent, and I applaud them for that?",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,32,1,speech

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—One of the newspaper cartoonists yesterday gave us the ultimate `I'd like to see that' of Australian politics: the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in pigtails and a blue dress, skipping off down the yellow brick road to the sunny land of Oz, where worries melt, I am told, like lemon drops and every resident munchkin is relaxed and comfortable and raking in shares in AMP.
But there are always messages between the lines, because who can think of Dorothy without her supporting cast? I look across at this government and I find the audition hall overflowing for the parts of the lion without courage, the tin man without a heart and, perhaps most oversubscribed of all, the scarecrow without a brain. So somewhere over the rainbow, there you will find the Treasurer, far up and away and off with the bluebirds on his technicolour journey, skipping and singing, singing and skipping.
We all have our sustaining fantasies and, listening to this budget on Tuesday night, I realised that we are not in Kansas any more, because only in the Treasurer's fantasies can there be good in this budget surplus, built on a million small deficits in the lives of ordinary people. The teeth not fixed. The pills not bought. The kids in backyard care or the mother out of work. The apprenticeships not found. The holiday not taken because of the cost of a mother's nursing home. The university degree out of reach and the fulfilling career therefore not had. The shame of the young school leaver's hundredth unsuccessful job interview. The corroding despair of the long-term jobless and the alarm of their families. The grief of the parent farewelling a child leaving town for good. The factory closed. The trauma of selling up and moving. The hundred unspoken small goodbyes of ordinary people to their ordinary lives.
These are the human losses on which this accountants' surplus was built by a government that has long since ceased caring and has never learned to care. These indeed are the hard yards. These are the long hauls. The shouldered burden of battling Australians somehow fuels the happiness of a Treasurer long unacquainted with the ordinary needs of his fellow Australians. The griefs and consolations and the quiet unprotested sufferings underpin the triumph of his numbers and the failure of his government's decency.
The government will have you believe that all that pain was essential. It was not. If it was essential, why did Tuesday's budget contain spending increases of $10 billion over the next four years? If it was essential, why is it that when we look at the effect on financial year 1998-99 of the three Costello budgets we find that, in net terms, he cut $6 billion in the first budget, $1 billion in the second and then put back $2 billion in the third? Why didn't the Treasurer explain here on Tuesday why he has effectively run down two flights of stairs and back up one on fiscal policy? He did not because the admission would be too great.
In the first two budgets we had selective leaking and pre-announcement of the bad news. This one has been selective leaking and 
 admission of failure in small instalments, the only instalments a battered, unpopular and fundamentally untrustworthy political outfit can afford. He was wrong and he cannot admit it. But the net effect of this government's policy changes on financial year 1998-99—the net effect of going down two flights of stairs and up one—was $5.4 billion. Subtracting that $5.4 billion from the surplus announced by the Treasurer leaves us with an underlying `no policy change' deficit of $2.7 billion—no cuts, no surcharges, no fees and no pain.
Let me tell you something that my deputy, Gareth Evans, said about an alternative budget strategy for Australia—not this week, not last year, but two years ago after the coalition's first budget. And I quote:
We say we can get to budget balance within a reasonable time—in fact, within the lifetime of this parliament, by 1998-99—with a much less savage budget strategy . . . We can get to that by targeting savings of no more than $3 billion by that third year.
In other words, $1 billion of new savings each year in three budgets would have produced a starting point surplus this year of at least $300 million. On top of this, the higher economic growth, which Labor's budget strategy would have allowed, would have seen a 1998-99 budget surplus of similar dimensions to the one announced on Tuesday.
Our argument was then, as it is today, that fiscal consolidation in the economic climate this government faced in 1996 was necessary but did not need to be nearly as harsh as what they immediately embarked upon. We had to get that budget back into balance but we did not need to take the harsh measures you took. We need surpluses of the kind that Labor delivered four years in a row, not long after inheriting a $25 billion deficit from the then Treasurer, John Howard—surpluses built on jobs and growth. John Howard told that electorate, back in 1983, that things were fine when he had on his desk a briefing note from the Treasury of a $25 billion deficit. We put that budget into surplus and we provided universal health care and we provided tax cuts and we dramatically increased higher education. 
We need to retire public debt, but we must keep that issue in perspective too. Despite what the Jeremiahs might say, Australia's fiscal position was very good by international standards when this government came into office. That is not to say that we should become complacent—we should not—but it does seriously question why, for example, the government would sell Telstra to reduce what in our last year in government was the third lowest public sector debt in the industrialised world. That debt as a percentage of GDP was less than half Canada's and two-thirds the proportion of France, Germany, the United States and even Britain after a decade of Maggie Thatcher's budget cutting and privatisations. This government inherited the third lowest public debt in the industrialised world and they want to sell Telstra to take us to the second lowest.
Why then should we allow up to $20 billion worth of Telstra, this great national asset, to go to foreigners? After only four years we will lose more in Telstra dividends than we will save on our interest bill; dividends that would otherwise be there for generations to pay for hospitals and schools, railways and roads. This budget puts aside $580 million for the financial managers as costs and commissions for the Telstra float—$580 million to sell Australia's patrimony. That is more than half a billion dollars we could save tomorrow and keep a great national asset into the bargain.
In any budget that spends money like this one there are things to be welcomed and we should offer praise where it is due. Two praiseworthy ideas are the extension of the gold card to all World War II veterans and the extension of the health care card to more self-funded retirees. Labor was proud to establish both cards in our time in government. It is unfortunate, however, that benefits for a small number of our retirees should accompany reductions for the vast majority. Twenty times as many have experienced those reductions as have now received benefits.
Furthermore, had those self-funded retirees obtained their card under Labor, they would have had access to free dental care, lower priced prescriptions and free hearing aids. 
 Those are the benefits those self-funded retirees would have had, with the rest of the pensioners, if the system had been extended under the terms and conditions that operated under Labor. But even so, with this so-called gesture to the elderly that is supposed to be contained within this budget, 220,000 benefit, four million lose. But all of them—those who benefit and those who do not—now confront a massive expense on entry to essential care in nursing homes.
Our specific policies will be announced closer to the election, but I can say two things: we will restore capital funds cut from nursing homes in full and none of our retirees—or any other Australian, for that matter—will have to pay a GST on any of their goods or services.
But even though this budget has spent some money it leaves too many questions unanswered. It cannot answer the people who ask themselves what all the pain was for in the first place or why someone else's pain was more worthy of being reversed than was theirs. How precisely did the government make the decision not to restore Commonwealth dental funding? How did it decide it was relaxed about the situation of one woman whose letter to the Liberal member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) was submitted to a recent Senate inquiry—a woman who had been informed that all her teeth needed to be extracted? Despite living in constant pain, it will be 18 months before she can be treated. Even then, she will have to wait for each individual tooth to cause her pain before she is entitled to have that tooth extracted. What thought process, what overarching philosophy, what quality of mercy goes into that kind of decision?
How did the government decide it was relaxed about elderly Australians in their hour of greatest fragility still having to sell the family home to pay for entry into a nursing home—that after all the backflips and reversals (some 14 of them) the fees remain, the government still circles the family homes of our elderly. How did it decide that it could go right ahead and spend that money elsewhere—$150 million a year?
How did it decide there was no relief for women forced out of the work force by spiralling child-care fees? How did it decide instead to factor their despair into its employment projections? The bad employment estimates in this budget are still heroic. At a minimum they only stand up because of the thousands of women driven out of the work force by this government's decisions on child care. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) thinks that that is about family values; it is not. It is simply a collapse in the living standards of middle and low income working families.
How, after all its claims, can there not be one single dollar more for public hospitals in this budget than was on the table when the Premiers walked out on the Commonwealth's last offer in disgust? Let me say to John Hewson, who seems to have picked the impact of the Asian crisis far better than this government, that he was absolutely right when he said today that this health offer is nothing like the 15 per cent over five years touted by this government. This government deals dishonestly with the states, but in dealing dishonestly with the states it deals dishonestly with the thousands on waiting lists.
There is one large group of Australians which suffers most from these three budgets. I am speaking, of course, of the unemployed. To see why, we need to remember the level of economic growth before John Howard came into power—the level of economic growth, and the economy as a whole, that John Howard was pleased to describe to international bankers when he came into power as having inherited an economy better than good in parts. In the financial year 1993-94 Labor's growth figure was 4.6 per cent. In 1994-95 it was 4.4 per cent. In 1995-96 it was 4.1 per cent. Australia's economic growth rate for John Howard's first full financial year in office was just 2.7 per cent.
We had four per cent growth plus under Labor; not even two-thirds of that in the first year under the coalition. And we are meant to accept that this pathetic performance had nothing to do with the entire government frontbench preaching economic doom for a full five months before the first budget in 
 1996 and nothing to do with that budget which took $27 billion out of the economy over four years? Growth got above the parapet of three per cent last year, and now it has been forecast to flatline back at three per cent, with unemployment stuck around eight per cent.
But when the Treasurer was asked about the unemployment rate on Tuesday night, this is what the Treasurer of this nation said on the unemployment rate, boasting about his budget:
No, it bounces around a bit. You know, it's 7.9, it's 8, it's 8.1. We think it's around the 8 mark at the moment . . . but it will bounce. It's been bouncing for a year.
I am sick of that kind of talk. I am sick of people like the Treasurer, with a screen full of teeth, making glib analogies about real lives. These are real people, Mr Treasurer, not footballs, not Dr Kemp's rubbery statistics. They are real mums and dads with real children dependent on them trying to get a start in life. You were not elected to bounce unemployment around. You were elected to get it down.
Before March 1996 the unemployment rate had been falling for three years. This government came in and worsened the unemployment position immediately. In our last two years in government, Labor created 550,000 jobs. In his first two years, John Howard created not half as many. The difference was 315,000 people—three MCGs jam-packed full of people who would now be in work and not on the dole queue if the coalition had just managed to keep up the pace we set. And anything it has managed to do on unemployment, or might manage, has to be judged against another MCG crowd of nearly 100,000 people who have simply given up looking for work since this government came into office.
And what of those left on the dole queue longer than they ever feared because of the growth this government put on hold? The number of people unemployed for a year or more fell by over a third during Labor's last term in office. So far, during this government's term, it has actually risen. This is a stroke of true genius—it has actually 
 risen. When you started cutting into skillshare and other labour market programs in May 1996, there were 206,000 long-term unemployed Australians. Figures released this morning show that their ranks have now increased by 33,000 people as a result of this government's policies. Long-term unemployed used to be a quarter of all unemployed. Today they are a third and rising.
And they have been ill-served by a government which has wrecked the support systems and put long-term unemployed people into work—exemplary programs emulated around the world put on the scrap heap; or, worse, some of them put into the hands of people with no office, no staff, no experience, some without even a telephone! It cares more about an $8 million expenditure of public funds to boast its wares than it did about effective delivery to the long-term unemployed.
This is where we count the cost of this budget. Having counted the beans, the government has closed the book on Australian families. It is not going to redress the pain of the last two years. It is not going to tell them where it wants to take them next century. As far as this government is concerned, there are only two more stops in the journey—the GST and an election.
So let me talk about their GST—the dead heart of the hidden tax package. John Howard has built a career avoiding the unequivocal, but three years ago this month he was absolutely unequivocal. These are his words, and we remember them:
No, there's no way a GST will ever be part of our policy . . . Never, ever. It's dead. It was killed by the voters at the last election.
—That was three years ago.
—The Treasurer says to me that it was three years ago. When was three years ago? Just before the last election. Peter Costello has built a career avoiding being quiet, but his budget speech was silent on the issue of a GST. He was like Basil Fawlty: `Don't mention the war!' Don't mention the GST!
The budget papers on Tuesday included $20 million for the administration of this tax package, so we are now in the farcical situa 
 tion where the coalition will tell us what it will cost to implement the tax package but it will not tell us what is in it. But one thing is for sure: the GST has come back when no-one thought it would. This tax on jobs, this tax on the poor, this tax on families is back. As we prepare for its stealthy arrival, we need to remember that it comes back with none of the integrity that was there in its initial presentation, when John Hewson put out his fully costed package, openly and frankly, more than a year out from an election.
John Howard told his party two days ago that we could be in the last parliamentary session before an election. Just weeks to go, but the voters are not going to see the tax package yet. It is something to be dropped and then scuttled away from to the polls before anyone can get the wrapping off and find out what is underneath.
That changes where we stand as a party. Those of us who oppose a GST now have only one course of action. I want to make it quite clear tonight that the Labor Party believes that John Howard has forfeited any right ever to claim a legitimate mandate for his GST. And our opposition will be there whether we win or lose the next election. A vote for Labor is a guaranteed vote against the GST. If we are elected, you will not get one, and if we are in opposition we will oppose it in the Senate.
We do this because the lateness of the hour means we are expected to take the Prime Minister on trust. But we see nothing in this government's record to trust that the package will be fair or equitable. The Treasurer has explicitly refused in this place to rule out a GST on the following items: doctors' bills, dentists' bills, school fees, university fees, power bills, food, nursing home fees; local government and water rates; and even rent.
And we see nothing in this government's record to trust that its awesome complexity would become, in their hands, anything other than a complete disaster—a disaster for businesses, workers, and all consumers—implemented in the usual manner, with all the grace and poise of Inspector Clouseau in a ball-bearing factory. We refuse to help John 
 Howard get his agenda into place and we will not inflict his tax on the Australian people.
Modern government, as we approach a new century, is about skills, innovation, infrastructure and exports. It is not about bean counting. It is not simply about achieving a surplus by any means. It is about achieving a surplus in periods of moderate economic growth at the same time as creating a modern, successful state which rewards, advances and enhances excellence. For Australians, this means recognising something about our own country. It means recognising that many other countries have advantages we do not. We are a nation in nobody's trading bloc. We make our own way in a region where the big countries are growing by an amount equivalent to our entire population every single year, while we occupy a great proportion of that region's real estate. It also means recognising what makes us proud to be Australians—our history of innovation, our scientific endeavour and our national courage.
Too often, as we have approached issues of reform over the last 15 years or so, we have been critical of Australians' willingness to work hard, innovate and change based on their own convictions, rather than on some official view. Too often, we have underestimated how much Australians pride and value their own work and their achievements. Too few Australians, too few members of this House, know that Victoria and South Australia combined have won more Nobel Prizes in the sciences than Japan.
Government must value and enhance those great Australian characteristics. Microeconomic reform is not about depriving people of wages, depriving people of leisure, depriving people of things which make for a constructive family life. We must be about enhancing skills, building on our record of innovation and developing our outward-looking attitude to opportunities in our region. Just try to find anything substantial in these three budgets from this government which builds on any of those strengths and does not detract from them.
Instead, the vast bulk of savings made in three budgets have been at the expense of this Australia. They have come from our universi 
 ties, from labour market programs helping to keep our population permanently skilled, from research and development incentives and from assistance to exporters to gain a foothold in international markets.
The effects are clearly documented in this budget. It forecasts a drop in net export growth. It shows business investment growth slowing throughout the year. Recent figures show growth in business spending on research and development, which reached an all-time record of $4.3 billion in Labor's last year, stopped dead for the first time in a decade following the swinging cuts to R&D support in the coalition's first budget.
This is why there is no point in delivering a surplus ringed by deficits. A surplus bought from the million deficits in family budgets. A surplus sitting alongside a level of foreign debt which has worsened by $28 billion since the coalition came into power, and with a current account deficit forecast to grow by another $31 billion over the coming year—and nearly every single independent analyst thinking that is an understatement.
This is why we need a government with a broader vision, why we need a government that will restore the balance and why we need a government that sees where it can forge a partnership with the Australian people: a partnership supporting family life, supporting the unemployed, supporting industry, supporting investment and supporting exporters. We need partnership and we need to have ambitions as well.
Two years have told us all we need to know about John Howard's ambitions for Australia. He wants an Australia with him as Prime Minister, and that is where his vision ends. He wants an Australia moulded into the shape he thinks will keep him there—a nation riddled by division, neatly carved up into the few groups whose dislike of each other, encouraged by this government, he thinks, will keep him in power forever.
Labor will go into this next election believing in a different Australia. We believe in a proud, confident and intelligent Australia. Labor believes in an Australia that wants security in its workplaces, peace of mind in a strong health system and opportunity flow 
 ing from an education system which gives its citizens the best chance they can get in a global economy. We understand with absolute clarity the importance of the Asian financial crisis for the Australian economy—described last year by the Treasurer as `scarcely measurable'—and the corresponding need for fiscal restraint in that environment.
I promised back in February that Labor would deliver three underlying surpluses in our first term in government, and that promise stands as long as this government's projections for the budgetary position and economic forecasts stand. But Labor is going to look at priorities. We are going to look at where this government has spent money wastefully and at where the money could be used more intelligently and to greater benefit for greater numbers of Australians. We are not going into this election year with a fistful of dollars as a grudging apology for pain rendered over the previous three years. We are going into this election year with a vision of where we want Australia to go, what Australians want in their everyday lives and how, within the means available to us, we can go in that direction.
These three budgets have sacrificed the security and opportunity of our population to Liberal Party prejudices. This is a government that has forgotten its responsibility to govern for all Australians and is now prepared to experiment with an unfair, job destroying tax in a period of great uncertainty—an appalling time to introduce such a tax. In the last two years, over the last three budgets, the Australian people have learned what they were getting when they elected this government. I maintain that they deserved something better than what they got.
Normally, it would be hard to close the book on a government after only three budgets. Normally, it would be hard to say a government is not worth considering again, when it has only been around for two years. Normally, a first-term government just turns up in the queue for another term like it is waiting for dessert. But this isn't a normal government. This isn't the normal run of events at all. This is John Howard's government and John Howard's Australia.
We know that millions of Australians want no more to do with this government: no more of this government that loses seven ministers in just 18 months; no more of this government that puts black shirts, balaclavas and dogs on chains in our workplaces; no more of this government that defends ministers with tens of millions of dollars in their family trusts and that wants working Australians to pay a GST on their grocery bills and their clothing, their rent and their rates; and no more of this government with a quarter of a billion dollars for companies that want to sack all their workers—ignoring the legalities—and nothing for those who want to keep them on.
Well, these were your three budgets and they're over. If there was a time and a place for a government as harsh and chaotic as this, it is long past and in another, lesser country. And if there is a place for it now to go, it is out: out of our lives and out for good.

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—Monday, 4 May, was an historic day for workers and the trade union movement. The victory, emphasised by the High Court's affirmation, cannot be underestimated. Three separate court decisions in four weeks recognised fairness, decency and justice. In short, these decisions recognised the Australian way.
The decision to order the reinstatement of 2,000 illegally sacked waterfront workers was an outright repudiation of the sneaky, shallow, murky, smelly and underhand  way the workers and their statutory rights were violated by Patrick Stevedores and the National Farmers Federation.
The Howard government, particularly the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), supported and endorsed at each step the strategy of Patrick and the NFF. Ideological and pathological unsustainable hatred so wilfully practised by the Howard government is no substitute for the right to freedom of association by workers and the role of trade unions. This is the real story of the court decisions over the past four weeks.
On Friday, 8 May, I joined many workers, unionists and community members at the gateway of No. 6 jetty at Port Kembla to welcome back on the job the illegally sacked waterfront workers. It was a moment of triumph. Despite the bitter, frustrating fight, it was a moment of enormous pride to see those workers walk through the gates which had been closed to them four weeks earlier. I paid tribute to those workers on Friday, and I restate that tribute today. Through quiet, dignified resolve, each of those illegally sacked workers and their families took on a fight and won.
Throughout the dispute and for two years prior to it, the Port Kembla workers were subjected to daily ridicule, attack and abuse by the minister. To their credit, along with each of their colleagues in terminals around Australia, they stood their ground for their rights, the survival of the union they choose to belong to and for workers everywhere. They stood at the front line to defend decency and fairness, because they understood that ultimately, if they were defeated, no worker was safe.
I pay tribute to the leadership of Mark Armstrong, the secretary of the MUA at Port Kembla. I have always had a good working relationship with Mark. To see him deal with the pressures of this dispute, accepting the burden to fight for his members' rights, was incredible. He led with a cool, level head and grace under pressure.
The dispute also brought unexpected focus on the potential of Port Kembla. For the first time in 12 years Port Kembla has handled containers. In the last few weeks Port Kembla has handled more than 2,000. We also saw the establishment of Port Kembla Stevedoring cooperating with the MUA and its members—the same union and the same workers that Patrick, the NFF and Minister Reith hate so much.
Port Kembla has once again shown that it can meet expectations during a crisis. An efficient, effective port was put to the ultimate test and passed it. The Illawarra has always been a united 
 community led, without apology, by the labour movement. We are united when attacked by anyone. We will continue to be united, no matter what the attack or its source. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Industrial Relations</title>,Statements by Members,36,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1998  and the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1998  are both very straightforward and are supported by the opposition.
The  Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1998  creates an opportunity for people with vehicles registered under the Interstate Road Charge Act 1985 to register their vehicles for periods of less than one year. The opposition supports this. The value of this amendment is that there are certain groups in the community, particularly farmers, who will have vehicles that require registration that they may need to use only for a certain proportion of the year—in other words, for seasonal use. It is unduly oppressive to ask them to register 
 these vehicles for an entire year when they may only be used for three or four months of the year. This legislation creates an opportunity for the vehicles to be registered only for a portion of the year, and we support that.
The Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1998 is similarly straightforward. It provides for the recognition of ACT self-government and brings the ACT into the uniform national road transport scheme. It also provides for certain technical amendments to penalties which ensures that provisions with respect to the ACT are brought into line with the rest of the country. The opposition also supports this legislation.",REPS,<title>INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Grace, Elizabeth, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—I wish to contribute to this cognate debate on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1998  and the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1998 . Road transport reform is vital to Australia. There is little point in having highly efficient mining and agricultural industries, industries that are vital to Queensland in particular, if the product cannot be exported in the most efficient way possible, and the Howard-Fischer government is committed to transport reform to bring this about.
At this very moment we are addressing reform on the waterfront, a major impediment in the transport chain. Current waterfront practices are a barrier to efficiency and competitiveness and cost jobs and economic growth in the whole of Australia. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has said in this House many times that our government has promised to fix up the waterfront—its rorts, its inefficiencies and its archaic work practices.
We are absolutely determined to do all in our power to promote greater competition in the stevedoring industry. Our international competitiveness depends on achieving this goal. The potential benefits of road transport and waterfront reform are of vital significance to our national interests.
The government is determined to address inefficiency because delays and uncertainties are bad news for the transport industry and small business, and that is why the Howard government is acting to improve the Australian transport system. The government aims to create a productive and reliable transport sector that contributes to economic growth, job creation and greater opportunities for business. This reform process will encourage spirited and real competition across the nation.
Governments across Australia must keep up with and embrace change. For example, the road transport industry may develop a new motor or suspension system for a vehicle which is then immediately taken up by transport operators, but since federation, governments across the land have not been able to pass uniform transport legislation.
National uniform rules will give Australia world's best practice in every area of transport. The government's industrial relations reforms, supported by Cheryl Kernot, provide the necessary framework to address this important area. However, there are regulatory impediments to road transport efficiency.
Phil Russell, who owns a large transport company in my electorate of Lilley, says that despite the fact that all his vehicles are registered and licensed in Queensland and conform to all the rules and regulations of the state, when they travel 150 kilometres south into New South Wales they are then subjected to a new set of authorities, standards, licences and permissions. One minute you are operating within the law, the next minute you are acting outside it.
He says the dangerous goods licence is another example of inefficiency. Companies need a separate licence to travel into New South Wales and again another licence to use vehicles for dangerous goods in Victoria. Why is it when you cross an invisible line, a state border, you can be operating outside the law? I agree with the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, when he described this situation as a total nonsense.
These inconsistencies have been a total nightmare and a blight on Australia's transport industry. The work of the National Road Transport Commission and the passage of the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1998 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1998 will provide the greatest improvement since the 1950s when free trade across state borders was supported in the High Court.
The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1998 has provisions to include flexibility in road vehicle registration. For example, it contains a charge formula for the registration of vehicles for less than one year; it provides for shorter periods to be utilised by operators such as farmers to register vehicles seasonally to transport crops, and for smaller operators balancing cash flow by paying charges quarterly; it provides for 10 priority initiatives from the Ministerial Council on Road Transport Second Heavy Vehicle Reform Package; it returns all revenue from charges to states and territories for road maintenance; and it clarifies the inconsistencies in the treatment of short-term registrations between jurisdictions that have caused a number of constituent complaints. This last measure should limit the problems for farmers and small operators to some extent.
The  Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1998  deals with the administrative amendments related to the appointment of inspectors to take into account the ACT self-government. It also reduces penalties for excess load masses from 3,000 to 2,000 to comply with the Crimes Act of 1914, where penalty for a corporation should be five times that of an individual.
In my state of Queensland, we need to have access to a flexible transport regime. Unfortunately, the ALP supports 1950 work practices so it is doubly important that the federal government works on reforms that will produce real gains and jobs for Australians.
The challenge for Australia and the transport sector is to produce excellence. The coalition is working with industry to maximise and foster best practices and, unlike the Labor Party, we do not support the inefficient work practices of unions such as the MUA.
Regulation of industry is necessary and the coalition government has been working in participation with industries to create real gains for all Australians. However, we cannot ask industry to be innovative and competitive and accede to government regulations without removing unnecessary regulatory impediments.
The road transport industry is showing that it can and will compete in the world's best practice and the challenge is on for all Australian governments to help them meet this goal. We must produce world's best practice regulations and not tolerate the myriad of conflicting state regulatory regimes.
The  Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1998  and the  Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1998  are small steps in producing government best practice.
—But important ones.
—Very important ones. Efficiency should be at the forefront of business and governments have a responsibility to regulate because business and many people's jobs are dependent on the cooperation of all Australian governments. I must compliment the Road Transport Commission for their determination to ensure better uniform standards on the roads to the benefit of all Australians.",REPS,<title>INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is my great pleasure to sum up on behalf of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile), who is hard at work and due back shortly.
—He is always hard at work.
—He is always hard at work. Can I just say that while there has not been quantity of speakers today, there has been quality and the previous speaker summed this up very well.
I think the important part is that there are a number of people in my electorate, as indeed there will be many farmers throughout Australia, who will appreciate the fact that we have moved these provisions. By reducing times available, we will see that there will be reduced costs for farmers and others such as small operators who may wish to opt for three-monthly intervals on registration charge payments to help maintain their cash flow.
These are good measures. The government believes that its reform agenda in relation to road transport has been important. It was a matter that we came into government promising. We have delivered on that. Minister Vaile is driving this process very hard with the states and territories and it is a further example of the government's commitment to road transport reform.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
—If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail, I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—My colleague the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), may have the opportunity to participate in this debate later if he arrives. In his absence, I am very happy to take this matter for the opposition. This bill principally concerns protecting the health and safety of the public from the harmful effects of radiation.
The bill establishes the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and a licensing scheme for the regulation of nuclear installations operated by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth entities, from construction right through all stages of operation to decommissioning. The licensing scheme also extends to the regulation of ionising sources and certain non-ionising sources and establishes the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council.
These are entirely reasonable and laudable objectives and the opposition has no intention of opposing the bill. Indeed, we wish to support it. There are a number of matters though which the bill raises which I think could well be addressed by the government, either in the reply to summing up this debate or in another place. The explanatory memorandum, for example, refers to the council membership being drawn from state and territory health agencies, peak industry groups, scientific and technical experts and consumer groups, but the make-up of the council is not specified in the bill at all and is left entirely to ministerial discretion.
We would certainly raise some concerns about the way in which that is left open and the fact that it does not include any members of the public—for example, consumer interests which might be represented by those living adjacent to the established nuclear facilities like Lucas Heights. A local government council, the Sutherland Shire, would have a very substantial interest in nuclear safety and matters associated with that. It would not be at all unreasonable for groups like that to be represented in the decision making apparatus established by this bill.
There are also quite extensive powers provided for the inspectors under section 53. While the wording of this section is eminently reasonable on the face of it, these are quite extensive powers. There are few limitations on the way in which they can be exercised under the bill. The opposition would want to question the extent of those powers arising in cases, but not where there is a serious issue of nuclear safety arising because there we would want all those powers to be available. There are few limitations which restrict them. They might be available to be used under circumstances which are not as desirable as those where there is a nuclear safety question arising.
I think there are a couple of issues which we would like to see further discussed in relation to this bill. Whether that takes place at the summing up here or in another place is a matter 
 which can be left to the discretion of the government at this stage. Certainly we will be raising those issues again.
The whole question of nuclear safety and the establishment of Commonwealth nuclear facilities is the central matter behind this bill's creation. The opposition does have some concerns with regard to broader policy in respect of nuclear facilities in Australia. Australia has never been a nuclear power in the sense that we have sought nuclear weapons or sought to use the nuclear fuel cycle to generate electricity. However, we have for many years now had a nuclear facility in the form of the research reactor at Lucas Heights.
When this facility was first established, the Cold War was very much in operation and many people were concerned about issues of nuclear security from the point of view of nuclear weapons production. Australia did not have a public policy of moving into this area in the years following the war, but quite clearly it would have been in the background of government decisions at the time. Indeed, while I personally believe that that was never an option for Australia, one can understand why a government might, in the climate of the day, have those issues in its mind and want to establish a research reactor which, while ostensibly being for medical and other nuclear research purposes, could serve an alternative purpose if government thought that an urgent necessity at the time.
Those days, though, are now well past. Indeed, the world is moving against the nuclear fuel cycle and against nuclear weapons, most specifically. Events in India in the past few days have amply demonstrated the world's view about those states which move towards nuclear weapon status. That is something that we all in this parliament condemn, and I know that the government and the opposition will indeed be making their views even clearer on this in the days ahead, as will all of the other states of the world that support the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
We are left with the question of Lucas Heights. Unfortunately, the reactor there has only a limited life left to it. The current Nuclear Safety Bureau is refusing to relicense that reactor after 2003-2005. In that period, the reactor will cease to function, because it would not be  particularly safe to continue to operate it, given its age. It is a perfectly reasonable end to the reactor's life cycle: all things have a cycle in their existence, and nuclear reactors might normally be expected not to operate for quite so long.
Indeed, ANSTO has managed to extract the maximum value for the Australian dollar from that facility over the very many years in which the reactor has been in operation. ANSTO is an organisation which commands respect from both sides of the House and from the general public. It has operated the reactor very safely over a long period of time, and has ensured that Australia has been able to take from the reactor the maximum value from the science that was available. Indeed, it has done so in what is now very much a suburban part of Sydney.
However, the issue of the replacement reactor is now before us. The government has taken a firm decision to replace the reactor with a new reactor at Lucas Heights. There is an environmental impact statement now in preparation, and I understand that a report is likely in July or August, with a two-month period for public comment following that and then a final decision based on the environmental impact statement. However, in the interim, the government is certainly of the view that it wants to replace that reactor and build a new reactor at Lucas Heights.
That raises a number of questions. Firstly, there is the issue of cost. The new reactor, as a capital expense, will cost in the order of $300 million. There will be extensive costs over the 
 remaining 50 years of that reactor's life. There will be significant costs for removing and processing the spent fuel rods from the reactor. There will be substantial costs at the end of that 50-year period for decommissioning the reactor, just as there will be significant costs for decommissioning the existing reactor.
So Australia faces a choice. We can spend $300 million, plus who knows how many other tens of millions of dollars over the life of that reactor, or we can consider alternative courses of action. The previous government established the research reactor review just over five years ago, which produced a very extensive report, following a wide ranging public discussion of the subject. That reactor review reached a number of conclusions. Overall, it said that if the government of the day—which is the government we now have—were satisfied that the national interest required a new reactor to be built, then that decision should go ahead, but that it should go ahead only on the basis of the public interest argument.
If you look at the reactor review report closely, you will see that they came to that conclusion not on the basis of medical or scientific evidence but only on the basis of the national interest: in other words, our foreign affairs policy and our ability to participate in nuclear safety debates around the world. If the government felt that those interests were paramount, then it could reasonably reach the view that the reactor should be replaced and a new reactor built. But the research reactor review was not confident that one could come to those conclusions only on the basis of the medical uses of the reactor or only on the basis of the scientific uses of the reactor. It had to be the third factor of national interest that tipped the balance in favour of a new reactor.
Obviously the present government have come to that conclusion, because they have very much endorsed the establishment of the new reactor. So we can assume that they have taken into account the international questions, the national interest and national security and have decided that it is worth proceeding with that expense, based on those criteria. However, those criteria are not public. They are very much a private matter which the government takes into account and keeps its own counsel on. We can only look at the moment at the scientific and medical issues that are before the parliament, and not so much at issues of national security and national interest.
If one looks at the medical question, when Peter McGauran, the former minister, announced in parliament the decision to build the new reactor, he very much took the line that it was the medical question that was paramount. I think that was an unfortunate way to proceed because it certainly generated a strong emotional argument in relation to medical treatment. The reality is that there are many alternative mechanisms for generating radioisotopes, which the minister failed to discuss. He did not bring to our attention the very reasonable alternatives that exist and thereby allow an informed public debate to take place about what is our most substantial science expense to date.
The medical alternatives arise from a number of sources. Firstly, one can reasonably import medical radioisotopes. Some 98 per cent of these are used for diagnostic purposes and only two or three per cent are used for therapeutic purposes. So one can look at alternative diagnostic techniques as well.
In the area of medical radioisotopes, a great many countries import their medical radioisotopes. For example, the United States, the United Kingdom and many countries in Europe import a number of radioisotopes. Countries which we would compare ourselves with also use imported radioisotopes. So that is not out of the question, especially when one 
 considers that, during periods when the research reactor is closed for maintenance, Australia imports substantial quantities of radioisotopes mainly from South Africa but also from Canada and the United Kingdom, and those radioisotopes are able to work very effectively in the Australian medical context.
So that alone is not a compelling argument because we also have available to us cyclotron technology. There is a cyclotron in Sydney and a smaller one in Melbourne, and there are plans to build other units at major hospital facilities around the country. They generate a great many of the radioisotopes which are used in medicine. There is some difficulty at the moment in generating molybdenum which is then allowed to decay into technetium, which is one of the favoured medical radioisotopes. But there are alternative strategies under research at the moment in California which would allow the production of molybdenum and technetium from cyclotron technology and not only from a reactor technology.
There are also medical radioisotopes which are produced by cyclotrons but which are not able to be produced by a reactor. So the issue is not clear cut as far as the medical debate is concerned. I think it is unfortunate that the government opted for the emotive medical argument as its first-run argument rather than allowing a more informed public debate about this to take place so people could make a more rational choice as to whether or not the reactor was necessary.
There is also the question of the scientific and industrial uses of the reactor. For science, reactors are very helpful. There is no doubt that a reactor is useful for the pursuit of some areas of nuclear science. I think ANSTO has done an excellent job in recent years in ensuring that Australia was well represented in those areas. I do not discount the value of that in any way.
Of course, science can be done in a number of ways. There are particle accelerators which use electricity to accelerate particles rather than using the flux of a neutron reactor. There are other mechanisms by which one can undertake studies of materials, for example, spallation sources. Spallation technology is well established. Although that is also expensive and produces some radioactive waste, it is nothing on the scale of a new nuclear reactor. Again even in the scientific area and with the industrial questions of material science, there are a number of alternatives available. They also have not been properly assessed in a wide-ranging public debate.
While the opposition does not per se oppose a new nuclear reactor in this country, it may well be that there are arguments to be made in favour of that. ANSTO is a very creditable and reputable organisation. Their view must be taken with all due weight and significance. Of course, they do have a vested interest in pursuing a new reactor. That obviously is their raison d'etre—the whole reason for the existence of ANSTO—and they would therefore be expected to pursue that argument as strongly as they could in the public arena.
There is also the question of location. The reactor was in an isolated area of Sydney when it was first built, but housing has moved much closer to the reactor and Lucas Heights is now very much a part of suburban Sydney. There is obviously a great deal of disquiet in the area about the prospect of a new reactor and a further 50 years of a nuclear source in the middle of suburban Sydney.
The opposition is very much opposed to the question of building a new reactor in suburban Sydney. While we remain open about the issue of a new reactor in Australia—there are obviously arguments to be had on the science, the industry, the environment, the medical front; 
 all of those things must be properly discussed—we take the view that Lucas Heights is an inappropriate location for this facility. So while we are yet to be convinced by the public argument in relation to the reactor, we do not believe that Lucas Heights is an appropriate venue for it.
The government have failed ANSTO and have failed scientists in this country by not putting the arguments about the need for a new reactor more fairly in the public arena. They have not advanced those arguments in the way that they should have done. They have relied entirely on the emotional impact of the medical question, without ensuring that the public were able to take a more reasoned view. Many scientists support the new reactor but many also question it from the point of view of necessity.
There is the issue of the $300 million initial capital cost. That is a very large amount of money to spend on science and there are many other alternative scientific proposals which could have been funded by that $300 million. No priority analysis appears to have taken place. The government has not set one against the other in the public arena and allowed science and the public to debate which of the alternatives is to be preferred.
The other issue that remains is: where is the $300 million coming from? If one looks at the budget documents presented the other night, one sees that the ANSTO figure is gradually rising. Of course their figure without the reactor is actually suffering a decline, but with the reactor included their funding is rising quite dramatically. The ARC funding—which is a very important source of funding for grants to our young people, to universities, for researchers to undertake further important studies in science—is declining in the forward estimates.
ANSTO strongly put the point of view, which they say is backed by the ARC themselves, that the funding for the reactor has not come from that declining ARC grant. However, on the face of it, on the budget record itself, the government talks about the decline in ARC funding and the figures reflect a very substantial decline. In the absence of any other evidence it is reasonable for scientists and certainly for the opposition to examine the point of view that the government is funding the reactor by a declining grant to ARC.
If that is the case, it will severely impede Australian science in the years ahead and severely disadvantage our young researchers, who already have very little chance of getting an ARC grant. Only about 19 per cent of applicants for ARC grants are successful, and that means some 80 per cent are not. Under the declining allocations listed in the forward estimates, even fewer people will be successful in obtaining those grants. That is a tragedy for our scientists. It is certainly a tragedy for our young scientists, who will increasingly be forced to go offshore.
If this is not the case, if the government in fact has plans to increase ARC funding but they are plans which are not contained in the forward estimates, then the government should make that clear, and they should make it clear immediately. Otherwise, people will draw the conclusion that the declining ARC grant is funding the rising ANSTO grant and that scientists are funding the new reactor from their otherwise expected grants. ANSTO strongly dispute that. I understand that the ARC take a different position, but this is a government which is strongly motivated by the budget dollar.
The Treasurer (Mr Costello) constantly emphasises his ability to effect savings in the Australian government's operation. He constantly emphasises the need for an economic rationalist outcome. While we have had disputes in the parliament between opposition and government about the validity of the Treasurer's strategies, certainly one can understand that 
 the government might well take a decision to reduce one source of funding within a portfolio so that it could increase another. We understand that often ministers are told, `This is a zero sum game. If you want new expenditure, you must come up with savings.' That is a line which the government frequently uses.
Therefore, it is all too easy to draw the conclusion that this has been put to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) and that he has taken a decision to trade off ARC funding against ANSTO funding. If that is not the case, it is up to the minister to come forward quickly in the parliament and in the public arena to dispute that finding; otherwise the opposition and the public will be able to draw that conclusion very reasonably from the budget documents themselves.
In conclusion, while the opposition acknowledges the fine work of ANSTO over the years and accepts that there may well be a role for a research reactor in Australia's future, we believe that that case has not been properly put by the government and that the government has failed to support ANSTO in the way that it should by ensuring that that debate is had on an informed basis.
We certainly believe, though, that Lucas Heights is an inappropriate venue for a nuclear facility, given its location now as part of suburban Sydney. So we want to see a properly informed public debate take place about the need for a reactor as against the other priorities in science and as against the other alternatives in medicine, in industry and in the environmental studies which ANSTO now does. We believe that the government has not taken that view; it has traded off ARC funding against ANSTO funding. We look forward to a more informed public debate on this. I just suspect the government is not going to allow the public that luxury.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Johnston, Ricky, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—The object of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998  is to protect the health and safety of people, as well as the environment, from the harmful effect of radiation. As an extreme example of the harm radiation poses for our world, I need only refer to the tragedy that was, and still is, Chernobyl. Today, the after-effects of that dreadful event have still not been measured, nor understood in full. Exposure to high levels of radiation results in horrific sickness and destruction of human beings, as well as our environment.
In the fast changing world that we live in, the usage of radiation in the home and the workplace is becoming more and more common. It is therefore important that, at all times, the health of our people and our country be protected. This is precisely what this bill will do, especially as the Commonwealth, together with the states and territories, will establish uniform radiation controls. The specific purpose of the  Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998  is to provide a regime to regulate the operation of nuclear installations and the management of radiation sources, including ionising materials and both ionising and non-ionising apparatus, where these activities are undertaken by the Commonwealth.
Radiation can cause severe damage to humans and to the environment, yet radiation is also an invaluable tool in many areas of medicine, archaeology and the construction industry. It is used in the food industry and in scientific research and defence. There are many workers, including those in Commonwealth departments such as Customs and in Australia Post and Telstra, who in carrying out their daily work may come in contact with radiation. Many conflicting views on whether there is a safe level of exposure to ionising radiation have been stated. A report from the OECD notes:
There is a threshold level of radiation exposure (or dose) below which no acute damage is observed. However, there is now a substantial body of evidence which shows that cancers can be caused by radiation even at dose levels that are below this threshold. There is no evidence of inherited damage in humans at any dose level, but the fact that such damage is found to occur in other life forms suggests that it could also occur in humans . . . the assumption that a dose, however small, carries with it an element of risk has become a key concept in radiation protection.
Yet this assertion is not necessarily supported by other reports. The United Nations environment program report Radiation doses, effects, risks  states exactly the opposite. It says:
The damage done by high doses of radiation normally becomes evident within hours or days. Cancers, however, take many years—usually decades—to emerge. And, by definition, the hereditary malformations and diseases caused by generic damage take generations to show; it is the children, grandchildren, or remoter descendants of the people originally irradiated who will be affected.
Although there is currently a national standard for limiting occupational exposure to ionising radiation, this bill will allow the Commonwealth to impose licence conditions on Commonwealth employees and contractors dealing with controlled material or operating controlled apparatus.
This is the first time that a body—the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency—will be established in Australia. It will have a function, amongst others, to oversee and regulate activities that involve radiation and nuclear safety and to provide a mechanism where people's complaints can be heard. It is expected that ARPANSA, as I will refer to it from now on, will be set up from 1 July 1998.
This bill is needed to provide a proper legislative basis for the regulation of the nuclear installations and radiation activities of the Commonwealth, none of which are presently regulated. Indeed, it would not be incorrect to say that whilst radiation exposure was covered by state laws, there persisted a regulatory gap because the laws often did not apply to the Commonwealth or its employees, and this was stated in the 1996 report, No time to waste. Thus, the bill will provide the basis for a uniform national approach to regulation of radiation activity and it will be reflected in due course in the legislation of state and territory jurisdictions for the first time.
A major function of the bill will be to allow for the establishment of a statutory officer, a chief executive officer, who will be empowered to make regulations and set licence conditions for the health and safety of persons and for the protection of the environment. It will also be the CEO's function to ensure that all practical steps are taken to avoid conflicts between regulatory, research and service functions.
In establishing certain safety standards, ARPANSA will ensure that Commonwealth users adhere to them by requiring all the radiation sources and nuclear facilities owned by the Commonwealth to be licensed. The organisation will also be empowered to audit performance of Commonwealth operators and users so as to enforce compliance with standards and codes of practice and to impose penalties for significant deficiencies. The ability to impose charges on licences will be introduced at the same time, as will the annual charges for facility licences and for source licences.
ARPANSA will be formed by drawing together the resources and expertise of the Australian Radiation Laboratory and the Nuclear Safety Bureau, both of which are within the Department of Health and Family Services. Currently, ARL provides advice, research and services on the health and medical aspects of radiation, whilst the NSB reviews and monitors the nuclear safety of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation's nuclear operations.
Because of the specialist expertise of ARL and NSB, the amalgamation of these two bodies will provide a strong and uniform regulatory environment in line with international best practice.	At the same time, ARPANSA will fill the regulatory gap currently left by dealings involving radioactive material that are not already done by government.
It is also important to note that new functions—such as regulation of a new research reactor, X-ray apparatus used by Customs, and medical and industrial radiography by Defence and other departments—will be fully cost recovered by licence fees. Large organisations will be issued with licences that cover multiple radiation sources and will be required to pay annual licence fees based on the numbers and types of sources. However, the government will continue to provide funding at the present level for the existing functions of both ARL and NSB. Any moneys raised by ARPANSA from charges for the provision of services will be retained by the agency, as currently happens with ARL and NSB, to cover the cost of existing functions.
As I have said already, all Commonwealth bodies that use radiation which may affect the health and wellbeing of the public, employees and the environment will be regulated by ARPANSA. These include research agencies such as the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the CSIRO, and a variety of radiation users that I have already mentioned. Consultations with these bodies have taken place, and they will continue.
The Commonwealth's radiation protection and nuclear safety activities which need regulatory controls at Commonwealth level include: the operation and decommissioning of ANSTO's nuclear research reactors and the disposal of spent nuclear fuel: the siting, design, commissioning, operation and eventual decommissioning of the proposed replacement research reactor; the Maralinga rehabilitation project; the establishment of a near-surface radioactive waste repository; and the current and future radiation activities of Commonwealth entities, including the use of X-ray equipment and radioactive sources, and the use of non-ionising radiation sources such as lasers, radar and general microwave sources.
This legislation will ensure arms-length decision making responsibilities for the CEO of ARPANSA. Such decisions can therefore be made free from government and other stakeholders and ensure appropriate separation as recommended in the Senate select committee report No time to waste.
The CEO will prepare and give to the minister quarterly and annual reports on his or her functions which will be tabled in each house of parliament within 15 days of receipt. Additionally the CEO may arrange reports in the parliament at any time provided the minister has been given a copy of that report.
In keeping with this government's philosophy, public scrutiny, input and comments will be sought in the preparation of standards and codes of practice on radiation, health and nuclear safety. There will be community representation on appropriate committees and working parties responsible for advising ARPANSA and the minister through the CEO.
This bill has been prepared following extensive consultations with the states and territories whereby a template was developed which defines a common general shape, an approach to radiation protection legislation. Indeed this bill follows very closely that template and is consistent with both state and territory laws.
Let me just briefly now turn to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998. This bill will deal with matters arising from the enactment of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and for related 
 purposes. Schedule 1 repeals those parts of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987 that created the Nuclear Safety Bureau and ANSTO safety review committee. These changes are very necessary because once the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998 is passed the NSB will be incorporated into the new ARPANSA and the safety review committee will become redundant.
Schedule 2 provides for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the NSB to the Commonwealth. It also provides for the CEO of ARPANSA to have all the powers and functions conferred on the director of NSB in relation to ANSTO during the transition period, the period of six months beginning on the day on which the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 commences.
It is pleasing to know that not only has the third Howard budget delivered a surplus but it has increased nuclear research funding by more than $60 million over the next three years.
—How much?
—ANSTO has been allocated $80 million. The first sum was $60 million. ANSTO has been allocated $80 million this year towards the new research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney and the overseas shipment of spent nuclear fuel rods. By making these allocations the government demonstrates its commitment to the high standards within the industry.
Before I conclude I just want to point out that ANSTO only recently, as late as this weekend, announced that it was able to win a substantial contract to help build new nuclear facilities in Thailand. It is also pleasing to know that in doing that, they will be using mainly Australian content, which is very good for our economy and of course also for our employment situation.
I want to conclude as I started. Regulating activities that involve radiation and nuclear safety is extremely important. The setting up of ARPANSA is therefore welcomed and I am sure everybody in this parliament would agree with that, as the measures that are contained in this bill will ensure that regulation does take place. It is important that the health and safety, not only of the people who work within that industry, but indeed of the whole of our country, are protected at all levels so that we can continue to work within this industry, with certainty and safety.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—I apologise for not being able to speak earlier in this debate but there was another matter in the House of Representatives chamber at that time.
The  Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998 , the  Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998  and the  Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Bill 1998  establish the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, ARPANSA, covering all Commonwealth agencies where they involve radiation and nuclear safety. As several previous speakers have mentioned, the legislation flows from the Senate select inquiry report entitled No time to waste.
ARPANSA will be a user-pays entity. The legislation seeks to address conflicts of interest between regulatory, research and service functions. The chief executive officer of ARPANSA will regulate Commonwealth activities which involve radiation and nuclear safety. It will also work with the states and territories to develop uniform regulatory controls, will advise the government and the public about radiation protection and safety and will undertake related research. The legislation also establishes the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council to give advice to the chief executive officer.
The government claims the bill will result in a centre of excellence for regulation, advice, research and services supporting nuclear safety and radiation protection for employees, the public and the environment. This bill comes from, as I mentioned, the No time to waste report of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste. That committee was established in March 1995 and the opposition is very pleased to see the legislation now before the parliament. We note, however, that the explanatory memorandum states that the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council will include, amongst others, consumer groups. While it says that in the explanatory memorandum, it is not required under the legislation and it is, I understand, not mentioned in the second reading speech. Therefore, I move:
That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
`the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for the appointment by the Minister to the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council of a representative of local government and a representative of affected community groups.'
For the information of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth), I understand we cannot have votes in this chamber, so that ends up being determined in the House of Representatives.
—Debate may continue in this chamber, but you cannot take a vote. If you wish to have an amendment voted on, it will have to go to the parliament.
—The reason we are moving this amendment is that we believe it is very important that the community at large is represented on that advisory council. Of course, local government has been playing a very important role in the debate about what should be the future of nuclear research in Australia. I note the presence of the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) in the chamber. I am sure she is aware of the controversy about the Lucas Heights reactor in her own electorate. I will say a bit more about that later.
For her information, one of the reasons I am moving this amendment is that David Hill, the Labor candidate who will be elected the member for Hughes at the next election, has spoken to me about the community concern about the government's changes in this area. As a result of my discussions with David, we will be making sure that this amendment seeks to provide a guarantee that local government and local residents are represented on the advisory council. We think this is something that is worthy of support. We will be watching very carefully how the member for Hughes decides to cast her vote on this proposal. For the information of the member for Hughes, the proposal will come to a vote not here but in the other chamber at some time in the future.
—She hasn't seen the amendment yet.
—It has just been circulated in the Main Committee. The amendment asks the government to withdraw this bill and to redraft it so the advisory council does include a representative from local government and a representative from community groups.
I will go through some of the background as to why we think this is an issue which will be of vital importance to local residents in the Sutherland Shire area in southern Sydney and also to the local councils in that area. If anyone was listening to the AM program this morning, they would have heard that the nuclear reprocessing plant in the United Kingdom that is reprocessing some of the Lucas Heights waste has had some difficulties. There is now apparently some doubt about the manner in which the Australian nuclear waste will be reprocessed and the form in which that material might be returned to Australia. That in itself 
 means that this is a very topical issue. We do not quite know what is going to happen to waste that we thought was going to be reprocessed in the United Kingdom.
I draw the attention of the Main Committee to an article by Murray Hogarth in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 September, headed `Revealed: reactor rods corroded by water'. The article begins:
Water has breached the supposedly airtight `dry storage' tubes for the highly radioactive spent fuel rods at Lucas Heights nuclear reactor, a document obtained by the Herald  reveals.
The water became contaminated by `fission products'—produced when nuclear fuel is used—says a briefing note for Sutherland Shire Council by a member of the reactor's confidential Safety Review Committee. The only community representative on the committee, Dr Garry Smith, reported in the note this week that in the most extreme case 90 litres of water had half-flooded a 15-metre-deep sealed storage tube.
`These tubes were designed to be dry and filled with an inert gas to prevent corrosion of the highly radioactive fuel, he reported. ` A number of rods have corroded and released radioactive fission products into the water.'
Dr Smith advised that an urgent investigation was required because he feared that ground-water off the site might become contaminated, despite reactor officials having said that the leaks were caused by rainwater.
The revelation highlights fears surrounding the safety of storing old fuel rods at the 39-year-old reactor, and coincides with this week's Federal Government decision to build a new $300 million reactor at the site.
To be fair to ANSTO, the article goes on later to state:
But the executive director of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), Professor Helen Garnett, confirmed yesterday that water had infiltrated parts of the main storage system.
`It could well be that water has been there for several years.' Tests had shown that the source of the water was rain, discounting Dr Smith's ground-water concern. `I would prefer it did not happen,' Professor Garnett said. `But it is not a safety or environmental hazard to anybody.'
ANSTO and the Federal Government have said repeatedly that the crowded and aging stockpile of about 1,600 spent fuel rods is safe.
But the Mayor of Sutherland, Councillor Kevin Schreiber, said a `serious breach of safety standards' had been revealed. Dr Smith is Sutherland Council's principal environmental scientist.
`I don't see how the minister can continue to refuse a full and independent inquiry into ANSTO's nuclear fuel storage when serious breaches such as these have occurred and are still to be publicly reported by ANSTO,' Cr Schreiber said.
An article by Simon Grose in the Canberra Times on 26 September 1997 is headed `Lucas Heights exceeds own emission levels, criticised over audit methods' and it begins:
The Nuclear Safety Bureau has found that the Australia Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation's HIFAR nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights has not complied with audit criteria for the documentation of procedures and validation of monitoring methods.
In its 39th quarterly report for the three months to June 30, the bureau also reported that:
. Discharges from HIFAR of argon-41, a short-lived radioactive gas produced during the preparation of radio isotopes, exceeded levels set by ANSTO but were low compared with levels recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council.
. ANSTO had agreed to radiographically examine above-ground welds in the reactor's secondary cooling system but examination of underground welds may not be undertaken.
Despite these findings, the report concluded that the operational safety of the reactor was satisfactory during the period. 

The director of the bureau, Donald Macnab, told The Canberra Times  yesterday that it looked `at things in a far more conservative fashion than ANSTO does.'
This is very relevant to the need to have local representation on the advisory council. The next paragraph of the article is very relevant to explain the need for local council and community members to be represented on the advisory council. Mr Macnab stated about ANSTO:
Their responsibility is to operate the reactor safely; our responsibility is to look over their shoulders and make sure they do it that way.
If we needed any further evidence that this was an important issue, let me quote from an article in the Sunday Telegraph  of 23 March 1997:
Federal Liberal MP, Mrs Danna Vale, whose seat of Hughes covers the area, has written to Coalition senators urging them to support the inquiry, which will go before the Senate this week.
That is the inquiry that produced the report that has triggered the legislation.
She said that the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) had existed at Lucas Heights for 40 years and the community had accepted its existence.
`But this acceptance has only been on the basis that at some stage the facility would close and be relocated to a more appropriate site,' Mrs Vale wrote.
We will be keen to know if that is still the view of the member for Hughes, given the trouble she took to put that in writing to her Senate colleagues.
We in the Labor Party believe that it is very important that the advisory council have, by legislation, local government representation and representatives of local communities. If you were looking at all of the local councils, right across Australia, Sutherland Shire would have the greatest claim to be the representative on that nuclear advisory council, because Sutherland Shire is the only council of Australia that has contained within its area a functioning nuclear reactor. You would have to say that, if Lucas Heights continues to have a nuclear reactor operating, then Sutherland Shire Council should have that right.
Certainly, local government should be represented by law on that advisory council, and I am sure that the National Local Government Association would see the need for Sutherland Shire Council to be local government's representative on that advisory council. The very strong view that I have had from the Labor candidate and the future Labor member for Hughes, David Hill, is that he is going to fight very hard to make sure that the voice of the local residents is heard.
—No-one could fight harder than Danna Vale.
—Order! The honourable member for Dobell has the floor.
—The assistant junior whip, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) states that no-one will fight harder than Danna Vale. She has not been too successful in having the nuclear reactor shut down and moved to a more appropriate site. That was the view she expressed—
—She is a very successful local member.
—You will make your remarks through the chair. The debate is on the floor.
—She was not too successful on that one.
—Order! I call the member to order through the chair.
—As we know, since that letter was written, the government has announced that it is going to build a new reactor at Lucas Heights. This emphasises the need to make sure 
 that this amendment is carried so that local governments and local residents are represented on the advisory council. There is no point in relying on an explanatory memorandum, or assurances in this chamber, by people such as the parliamentary secretary who, with the best of intentions in the world, might be promoted on a future occasion. If Mr Howard is re-elected, this parliamentary secretary could be the person who is the next minister for health, given the comments on Lateline  last night when the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said that he wanted another job, basically. Or it might be the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) who becomes the parliamentary secretary looking after nuclear radiation matters. How do we know that any commitments given by the current parliamentary secretary would be bound by—
Government members interjecting—
—In the unlikely event that the Howard government is re-elected—
—Order! I call the member for Dobell and I call—
—In the very unlikely event that this mob gets back, what will be even more unlikely is that the member for Fisher ends up a minister in any re-elected government of the coalition. But even if the current parliamentary secretary gives us an assurance that local government and local communities will be represented on the advisory council, we have got no guarantee that that will be followed by a future minister for health, or a future parliamentary secretary, and that is why we need to make sure. There is even a possibility that this minister might give an assurance and then not keep it. But we know that would be unlikely.
The only way we can guarantee that the residents of the Sutherland Shire and local government are represented on this advisory committee is to have this amendment carried, to require the legislation to be withdrawn, and for the legislation to be amended to guarantee that these two groups are represented on the advisory council. I would be very interested to know the views of the honourable member for Hughes on the amendment.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—It just absolutely amazes me to hear the comments from the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) on this particular legislation. Would that his party had acted on it in the 13 years that they were in government, and would that they had acted on it even after their own report from the reactor research review was handed down in 1993 when they had three years to act on the recommendations in that report. Would that that had happened. There would have been a lot greater protection for me, my family and my constituents in this particular area.
This can be absolutely nothing but a political stunt. He talks about having representation from the local council and their representatives. Of course they are going to be on this committee. The regulations will cover that. As a matter of fact, the member for Dobell and his friends on the other side of the House might be interested to know that it has been the subject of some lobbying on my part since August last year, before this was before the cabinet.
I extend my gratitude to my government, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and cabinet, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth), for actually having this legislation today before the House for debate. And isn't it just typical of the member for Dobell to say that he wants this amendment put in when it is going to delay the progress of this important legislation through the House? It is important for my constituents because for the first time in 40 years, since the establishment of that facility, they are going to have an agency that will protect the people and the environment.
It will be responsible to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), not the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). It will actually operate at arms-length from the activities of ANSTO—and that is not to take anything away from the activities of ANSTO at all, not in any way whatsoever. This is in keeping with what is understood now in practice worldwide: to have an independent regulatory agency that will act for the people and for the protection of the people and the environment.
The government is to be commended because it is acting in that regard, and this is the recommendation from the review committee. It absolutely appals me that this facility has existed for 40 years without this kind of regulatory authority. It has taken this government and this member to get up there and force this through. I am grateful that they have listened. They have listened because it is important to my government, it is important to the Prime Minister and it is important to every member of cabinet that my constituents can be assured that they have the protection of this agency, and that is exactly what they are going to get.
I will now continue with my formal speech. It gives me great pleasure to rise today to welcome the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998 , together with enabling bills to cover licensing charges and consequential amendments. I have a particular and special interest in seeing this legislation come into force because Australia's only nuclear reactor is in my electorate of Hughes.
It is located in the bushland suburb of Lucas Heights and it is operated by the Australian Nuclear Scientific and Technology Organisation. I will correct something here so that the parliament understands where it is situated. While it may be in a bushland suburb, there is still a buffer zone of almost two kilometres around the facility. The house that was the closest to ANSTO, when it was first established back in 1958, is still the closest residence to the establishment. But it is located in bushland and I think that should be noted for the record.
It should also be noted that the bushland—I think the buffer zone is 1.6 to nearly two kilometres around—is a feral proofed area. Within that area, there is a population of wallabies and kangaroos which apparently grow so very well there that they are culled and used to stock national parks throughout New South Wales. That is just a bit of additional information about how well the establishment is operated.
The reactor is a research reactor, and let me explain to members here how that differs from a power reactor: this reactor operates at 10 megawatts, whereas a power reactor operates at 3,000 megawatts. By way of history, the reactor was built at Lucas Heights in the Sutherland Shire in the mid-1950s. It was completed in 1958. I was a child living in the shire at Sylvania at the time, and I can recall the excitement in the local community about the reactor being built. It was considered to be a significant scientific milestone for Australia to have such a facility, and children in schools across Sydney were encouraged and inspired to study science and to look towards science in their future careers.
The research reactor has now been operating in my neighbourhood for almost 40 years. At that time, and, most importantly, in recent years, with the significant growth in world consciousness about scientific safety and environmental protection, the facility established a sound safety record, which it scrupulously maintains in accord with community expectations. The facility employs between 800 and 900 local people, many of whom are my constituents and, with its policy of positive support for local businesses and tradespeople, it contributes over $50 million to the economy of my electorate.
In the wider Australian context, it produces nuclear isotopes which are used in the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic services to thousands of Australians. As a matter of fact, the isotopes produced at Lucas Heights save many Australian lives and are depended upon by an increasing number of Australians as medical science expands and adapts its application of nuclear medicine.
I did hear what the member for Dobell said about the use of cyclotrons. But cyclotrons, I am informed, do not, and cannot, produce the full extent and the high sophistication isotopes that are produced from a nuclear facility. That is something that I am sure the member for Dobell will learn about as he proceeds with this debate.
However, it has long been a concern of mine that, although the facility has been operating safely now for 40 years, its regulatory regime has been significantly inadequate for the operation of this kind of facility. Given the growing world consciousness regarding health and safety issues, and the heightened awareness of our responsibility to our environment over the last decade and a half, it is amazing that the previous government never had the political will to provide a proper legislative basis for the appropriate regulation of nuclear installations and radiation activities in Australia.
The facility was thought to operate under conditions laid down by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but this was dismissed by the research reactor review in 1993. So the other side has well had notice of this situation. Up to now, ANSTO has operated under authorisation issued by its board to its executive director. The Nuclear Safety Bureau had referred to this as, amongst other things, a de facto licence. Minutes from meetings of the safety review committee show that in certain areas of operation there has been regular confusion between the Nuclear Safety Bureau and ANSTO as to who has jurisdiction in certain areas of operation.
Although the International Atomic Energy Agency has set the ground rules for independent regulation of the nuclear industry by which most countries abide, the previous Labor government had allowed the situation to drift along. The research reactor review, in 1993, concluded that this state of affairs could no longer be allowed to continue, but the previous government did absolutely nothing in the next three years of its office to change this situation. Its negligence and inactivity in this regard was nothing short of a national disgrace.
As a long-time resident in the shire and neighbourhood of Australia's only nuclear research reactor, I have long been very concerned about this situation and very much aware that my family—and, since 1996, my constituents—did not have the protection of legislation to regulate such activities in the interests of health, safety and the environment. It has been of immense personal concern to me since my election as the member for Hughes to ensure that proper regulation comes to fruition. It is with immense personal satisfaction that I have been able to successfully lobby the government and the cabinet to take the actions necessary to put into legislation the recommendations of the research reactor review in this regard.
The prime object of these bills is to protect the health and safety of the people of Australia, and to protect the unique Australian environment. These bills give effect to the cabinet decision to enact legislation to provide this protection by the regulation of all the Commonwealth's radiation and nuclear activities, and to provide the statutory base for the regulatory safety agency, to be called the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, ARPANSA.
As directed by cabinet, the resources and expertise of the Australian Radiation Laboratory, ARL and the Nuclear Safety Bureau, NSB, to form the Australian Radiation Protection and 
 Nuclear Safety Agency comes within the health and family services portfolio. Both the ARL and the NSB are health and family services portfolio agencies. The Australian Radiation Laboratory currently provides advice, research and services on the health and medical aspects of radiation. The Nuclear Safety Bureau reviews and monitors the nuclear safety of ANSTO's nuclear operations. Because of the high specialist expertise of both these bodies, their amalgamation as ARPANSA will provide a strong and informed regulatory environment in line with international best practice.
ARPANSA will establish a regulatory scheme to oversee the operation of the Lucas Heights facility and the management of radiation sources, including ionising material and apparatus and non-ionising apparatus, where such activities are undertaken by the Commonwealth, Commonwealth entities and all those who do business with such entities. This legislation will provide a complete independent oversight body for the better protection and assurance of all my constituents. Most importantly for my constituents, a Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council will be established under the legislation and there will be capacity within the working groups for local representation.
It will apply to all Commonwealth departments, including the Department of Defence. It will apply to corporate bodies of the Commonwealth, like ANSTO and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and Commonwealth business enterprises, like Australian Isotopes. It will apply also to non-Commonwealth contractors working under contract to one of the aforementioned entities—for example, the public company Thiess, which is already contracted to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for the Maralinga clean-up operation.
All Commonwealth bodies that use radiation which may affect the health or wellbeing of members of the Australian public, employees or the environment will be regulated by ARPANSA. These include a variety of radiation users such as the Department of Customs, Australia Post and airport surveillance operators.
ARPANSA will also impose regulatory controls on the operation and decommissioning of ANSTO's research reactor and the disposition of spent fuel. It will regulate and license each stage of the life of the replacement research reactor. This will include the siting, design, construction, operation and eventual decommissioning of the proposed replacement research reactor, which will only be authorised to proceed by ARPANSA when the agency is totally satisfied that there will be no undue risk to the health and safety of persons or the local environment.
Many of my constituents have expressed real and justifiable concern about the storage of radioactive wastes on the site at ANSTO. This is also a matter which I have brought to the attention of this government. That we have not had a proper place to store Australia's radioactive waste is because of a lack of interest by successive federal governments, most especially the previous Labor government, whose member for the seat of Hughes then was also a minister of that government for eight years. What possible defence can be offered to the constituents of Hughes for such disinterest and neglect over 13 years in office?
Now we have the member for Dobell standing up and acting as if all of a sudden it is the most important concern in the hearts of those opposite, when they had 13 years to do something about it for my constituents. Constipated by their own inactivity and ineptitude in the face of such a challenge, and in careless disregard for the people of my electorate, the 
 previous Labor government allowed a de facto nuclear waste dump to be created in my electorate of Hughes at Lucas Heights.
In the conclusion to section 17 of the research reactor review of 1993, which was Labor's research review, one of the review's onerous conditions was the crucial issue of the `final disposal of high level wastes, which depends on identification of a site and investigation of its characteristics'. It went on to say:
A solution to this problem is essential to any future decision about a new reactor.
Since that review, the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste was convened. Part of its report was a recommendation that an above-ground dry storage repository be built on an appropriate site suitable to store all levels of radioactive waste. Such a repository would ensure that the waste was safe, secure and retrievable so that if and when permanent disposal methods are developed they can be put into action.
ARPANSA will also regulate the establishment of a national nuclear surface radioactive waste repository. This national repository will provide for low- and intermediate-level waste suitable for shallow ground burial and arrangements for the safe storage of material not suitable for disposal in this way.
Waste generated from nuclear reactor operation is a real problem and is of great concern to me and my constituents. It is with significant interest and appreciation that we welcome this government's announcement of its selection of a designated site in South Australia, near Maralinga, and its decision to set up an environmental impact statement to investigate this site's suitability as a national repository for radioactive waste, as recommended by the Senate select committee. It is this government that is doing that. This government is committed to the health and wellbeing of the Australian people and the Australian environment. Its actions in implementing the recommendations of the Senate select committee show that commitment.
ARPANSA will work to develop jointly with the states and territories guidelines for the safe management of all radioactive wastes produced in Australia. In line with this government's determination to regulate Commonwealth entities, it will prohibit those entities from dealing with radioactive materials, radiation apparatus like X-ray machines, lasers, microwave transmitters and nuclear facilities, including the nuclear research reactors and the radioactive waste repositories, unless licensed to do so.
It is important for my constituents to note that these bills will provide that compliance with licences, that conditions will be monitored, and that penalties will be imposed for breaches. It will also empower the gathering of evidence to support any prosecutions. Generally speaking, Commonwealth agencies and ANSTO have been responsible in protecting the health and safety of their employees and the public. I make the point that, rather than there being any evident need of regulation of ANSTO by the safety agency, it is not only appropriate but long overdue, in view of the contemporary world standards and public expectations, that such a body be subject to independent scrutiny by an agency with the necessary regulatory powers.
This legislation will assure my constituents and all Australians that ANSTO continues to operate at, and meets the criteria of, international best practice. ARPANSA will maintain involvement with international organisations, such as the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organisation. Best practice will be ensured by incorporating their guidance into regulations and codes of practice. My constituents can be 
 assured by this government that Australia is a party to international conventions on nuclear safety and radioactive waste management.
It is important to note that the bill will provide ARPANSA with a statutory chief executive officer who will: establish the protocol for the regulation of activities of radiation and nuclear safety; jointly with the states and territories develop uniform protection and safety controls throughout Australia to protect workers, the public and the environment; provide advice on radiation protection and nuclear safety to the government and the public; and undertake research and provide services of a high standard to ensure radiation protection and nuclear safety.
The council's functions will include advising the chief executive officer on matters of nuclear safety and radiation protection. There will also be capacity in the council's working groups to have local representation from members of the public. Furthermore, any concerns from the general public will also be able to be investigated by this agency at arm's length from the operations of ANSTO itself.
It is to be noted again that this legislation is under the portfolio of the minister for health and not the minister for science, again signalling to the constituents of Hughes that it will operate at the strictest possible level of independence from ANSTO.
I congratulate cabinet on its direction on this legislation, and I congratulate the government and the minister for health. I congratulate also the parliamentary secretary for the work she has done in bringing this important legislation to fruition. It demonstrates to my constituents and to the world not only that this government is proud of the achievements at ANSTO but that it will move also to assure the constituents of Hughes they will have the greatest possible protection. It is with pleasure I commend this legislation to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Cobb, Michael, MP",NP,1998-05-14,"—I wish to contribute to this cognate debate on the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998 , the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Bill 1998 , and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 . I particularly want to congratulate the previous speaker, the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale), for her excellent and well prepared speech. Her local constituents must be very proud to have such a diligent and energetic member. I am sure she will continue to represent them into the future.
The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998 is about establishing a scheme for the Commonwealth to oversee the operation of radiation sources in Australia that are produced by the Commonwealth or by Commonwealth entities. That can include such mundane things as Customs running X-ray machines right through to the grander nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights that the previous member spoke about.
The government has set up a regulatory framework to do this because it did not exist before—quite surprisingly, I have to say. The states and territories look after things that are produced by states and territories and private undertakings but there has been no fully comparable regulatory and oversighting body to look after Commonwealth agencies until this time. There are many departments and entities that are involved here, including the Department of Defence, CSIRO and ANSTO.
I want to join with the previous speaker in congratulating the staff of ANSTO for the tremendous work they have done for Australia in recent decades in saving lives through the medical aspects of radioisotopes, and also for the work they have done, which is not as well 
 recognised, in assisting the environment and assisting industrial safety through their necessary and very valuable work at Lucas Heights.
From 1 July this year the Nuclear Safety Bureau and the Australian Radiation Laboratory will be combined, in a sense, into this new body called ARPANSA, and it will be managed by a CEO. It will be an independent statutory office that will provide independent scrutiny of such bodies. It will apply world's best practice to these activities and it will endeavour to get uniform regulatory controls throughout Australia.
It will advise the government where appropriate about safety and protection. It will issue Commonwealth entities with licences so that you will need a licence to operate. It will monitor and enforce compliance and it will have the power where necessary to gather evidence for prosecutions if there are any transgressions.
In short, this is all being set up for the safety of the public and for the safety of the environment. I am particularly interested to see that it is being done in such a way that it is not being too prescriptive. It will be quite flexible because this is an area which is evolving and changing all the time.
For the rest of my comments I particularly want to speak about what may happen in Australia in the future and how this body will be beneficial in advising the government and ensuring the safety of the public and the environment. Thoughts that I have had in this area as to what might happen with nuclear radiation and power in this country were crystallised recently with an article I read by that eminent scientist Leslie Kemeny. He nowadays is the scientific and technical editor of the International Nuclear Energy Academy. He is a director of his own company as a consulting engineer and physician. He puts some interesting thoughts down on paper. It is relevant because we have finished within the last few weeks the Kyoto climate summit in which they talked about lowering greenhouse gas emissions around the world.
I was disturbed with the great push of the Greens and the left wing in this country in wanting, without great thought, to shut down to a large degree the coal industry in Australia which does earn $7 billion to $8 billion of export income. I am the first to admit there is going to be increasing pressure on the coal industry in the future. What those critics did not talk about is what happens if this is wound down and what alternative energy sources we will have in this country. In particular let us have a decent debate about nuclear energy.
It is interesting to look at the types of energy production sources around the world such as they exist. Hydro energy of course has been traditionally quite important. In Australia it generates about 10 per cent of our electricity. Canada is the highest. It generates about 60 per cent of its electricity there. But, generally speaking, the opportunities for expansion of this are quite limited and, even if there are good sites to build dams in the future, they are going to be increasingly difficult to do because of the environmental push.
Oil I do not think is an alternative for electricity production. It is far too expensive and far too valuable a resource. Gas does have considerable possibilities particularly in Australia that is gas rich and we should look at this more and more.
Coal has traditionally been burnt for electricity around the world particularly in Australia. The United States produces about 60 per cent of electricity from coal, Australia about 80 per cent and the rest of the world, including Europe, something of the order of 15 to 30 per cent. Coal is quite polluting. It churns out tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide as well as acid rain products like sulfur dioxide and has been known to poison literally thousands of lakes 
 across Europe including in what we think are environmentally clean countries like Sweden. We are going to have to look more and more at the damage that coal does in the future.
Solar power, while having a definite role, nevertheless is very limited in its use. It is very expensive. It is quite polluting in the sense that you have got to go out there and mine all these metals and minerals to make solar panels. If you were going to supply for example the city of Sydney with solar power, and that was to be the only source of power, you would probably want at least several hundred square kilometres of panels occupying the environment somewhere in this country. It does have its limitations, as desirable as it is. It is unreliable. I have White Cliffs in my electorate, for example. If there is a town in Australia on which the sun beats down on a regular basis, it is White Cliffs, but even there it was not successful in providing an electricity source.
The other source of energy is nuclear power. France already produces more than 70 per cent of its electricity via this source and Sweden produces a little less. What does Australia produce from this source? Absolutely zero. It is one of the very few countries in the world, particularly developed countries, that does not produce any of its electricity from nuclear power. As we move into the 21st century that is perhaps an irresponsible position to be in. I think Australia has to look more to that.
We produce about 175 terawatt hours of electricity in this country, which is a very small amount compared with the United States, which produces 3,500 terawatt hours. Nevertheless, we have to make our contribution. As more and more pressure is put on us to get down our carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions, this is something that we cannot ignore. Electricity generation is a very high energy growth area around the world, not only in the established economies of the world but also in the developing countries. Nuclear power is overall providing 17 per cent of that but that is growing rapidly indeed.
Nuclear power, despite the tragedy and the horror of Chernobyl, still has the best track record of all the energy sources. It provides extremely clean power. The emissions are almost zero. It is becoming more and more cost-competitive, and the supply of it is unlimited. Until we move to fusion power, this is something we are going to have to look more at in this country.
Australia, it can be said, has very high and cheap coal supplies close to the markets. If we switch to nuclear power, particularly in the eastern part of the country, it would be more expensive to provide electricity at this stage. However, we have just seen the Loy Yang A 2,000-megawatt plant in Victoria, which runs on brown coal, sold to Horizon Energies for $4,855 million—a considerable sum of money. That happened last year. It makes you wonder just how much longer coal is going to beat uranium as a competitive energy source in this country.
It was interesting at the Kyoto climate conference that those who were criticising Australia's contribution were sitting there in the international convention centre in that magnificent city, reading their documents from the light that was provided and enjoying the airconditioning from power at least partly supplied by 54 nuclear power stations throughout Japan.
If some of the more extreme elements of that conference had had their way and had been able to shut down nuclear power in Japan, then those 54 nuclear power stations would have had to switch to, say, coal and that would have pumped out another 287 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Think about that. Because those 54 nuclear power stations are allowed to operate, and operate as cleanly as they do, they are saving the polluting of the 
 world's atmosphere to the tune of 287 million tonnes equivalent of carbon dioxide every year. That is equivalent, in round figures, to about three-quarters of Australia's total emissions alone. So it is food for thought, indeed.
Australia mines a lot of uranium. We are very rich in uranium: we have about 30 per cent of the world's reserves, even though we only sell about 10 per cent of the world's supply, because of restrictions that we have had in this country with the two-mine and three-mine policies. Our uranium is sold to approximately 11 countries, including Japan, so that the light and the airconditioning that the delegates who were critical of our policy at Kyoto were enjoying was actually supplied by Australia's uranium. I do not know whether they ever stopped to think of that.
We mine uranium in this country in the Northern Territory and in South Australia. It is interesting to contemplate that to dig 25 tonnes of uranium out of the ground and send it to an overseas country—and we sell several thousand tonnes of it per year—saves one million tonnes of carbon dioxide belching into the atmosphere every year, when that uranium is used for electricity generation—which all of it is used for: none of it goes into nuclear weapons, of course.
During the Kyoto conference, the ABC was running opinions from every nut case and fruit loop that Australia was able to put up—some of them coming from the Senate. All I thought they were demonstrating was a lack of intellectual honesty and a pious and arrogant disloyalty to Australian workers and Australian taxpayers, let alone to the environment overall. It seemed to me that no credible alterative was ever put at any stage in terms of what was supposed to be replacing coal in the short term. No doubt, if you had mentioned nuclear energy, they would have gone into some sort of tailspin themselves.
The fact of the matter is that the world has 445 nuclear power plants operating now, and another 35 are being built. If we closed those down and switched to coal, we would be belching out another 2,300 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. On balance, they are doing the environment a service, and this should be applauded. By all means we should continue to strive for safer nuclear power plants. In former Communist countries where they have run shoddy plants—
—Chernobyl.
—Such as Chernobyl.
—You have been there, or close to it.
—I have been close to Chernobyl: Bulgaria was the closest I got to it. We have to put pressure on those countries to pull those plants into line. But, where they are run properly, we have no particular worries.
—India is a worry.
—The member for Bradfield remarks that India is a worry. India, in its recent actions, has been incredibly irresponsible. But what we are debating today is about the clean and safe production of nuclear energy to generate electricity, and not about the detonating of bombs.
The Australian Conservation Foundation in October last year proposed an $8 per tonne carbon tax in this country, which would have added about 0.22c per kilowatt hour to the cost of electricity in this country. The more pressure they put on the coal industry in this country, the more pressure there is going to be for a nuclear power plant to be established.
Until now, hydrocarbon energy production in the world has been in many ways quite wasteful, often quite expensive and, as I have said, very polluting. The only reason they are getting away with it is that often you cannot see what is being belched out. You can see a bit of smoke coming out a smokestack, but each of these smokestacks is dropping into the atmosphere what are often thousands of tonnes of pollutants, some of which are actually radioactive. Many people do not realise it, but there are radioactive elements in coal and, when it is burnt, if the filters particularly are not working well on the stacks of these plants, these radioactive elements are poured out into the atmosphere to a disturbing degree. That fact has to be considered, as well.
I believe that the hydrocarbons in this world are becoming more limited and a lot of thought has to be given to rationing them to supply the feedstock requirements of the industrial, agricultural, pharmaceutical and chemical industries of this country. These are some thoughts that I have laid out for consideration. I believe that this bill today, which sets up a regulatory mechanism, will be well placed and will have the framework to be able to regulate such industries if we get to that stage in this country. I say `if we get to that stage', though it is, of course, inevitable. Some people might deny it but, even if nuclear power generation in this country is some time off, it will come some time next century, and probably sooner than people realise.
With those closing comments I congratulate the government for setting up these regulatory mechanisms in the way that they have. It has been long overdue in this country; it is quite remarkable that it has not happened before. I congratulate the government and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for their foresight and diligence in this area.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998, as we know, introduces a regulatory control for all Commonwealth radiation and nuclear safety activities in Australia. The bill will protect the health and safety of the people and environments that are subject to radioactive practices undertaken by the Commonwealth. It will apply to Commonwealth entities, employees and those non-government entities contracted by the Commonwealth, for example, Defence, CSIRO and ANSTO. In fact, a Commonwealth entity must be licensed by this legislation in order to deal with radioactive materials, equipment and nuclear facilities. There are certain exemptions, notably for defence and national security purposes.
The origin of the bill was a recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on the Danger of Radioactive Waste which identified a regulatory deficiency in this field. State and territory governments have been particularly supportive of this reining in of unchecked Commonwealth powers. From 1 July, the functions and resources of the Nuclear Safety Bureau and the Australian Radiation Laboratory will combine to form the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency which will be part of the Department of Health and Family Services. The role of the agency will be to regulate Commonwealth activities involving radiation and nuclear safety; to work with states and territories to develop uniform regulations; to inform and advise the government and the public on radiation protection and nuclear safety, and undertake related research. This organisation will be responsible for the regulation of the proposed national radioactive waste repository and will be responsible for ensuring the safety of that facility. I will now just talk to that repository for a minute or two.
The history of the low level radioactive waste, particularly that which has been stored in the Sutherland Shire in Sydney and in other areas, has been well documented. In 1994 the 
 waste was transferred to Commonwealth land in Woomera and the government has proceeded with the repository proposal to stage 3, with stages 1 and 2 going back something like 10 or 15 years.
It is pleasing that the government has introduced this legislation to cover, as I have already said, flaws and gaps in the legislation to make sure that this important community issue is dealt with in the appropriate way. There is always a concern in the community about these issues. Nevertheless, as a community we have an equal responsibility to manage this material.
There are so many upsides to the usage. In industrial and medical areas there is a whole range of ways this material is used and now we need to have a way whereby we can store it responsibly and in the national interest. I join with the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) in congratulating the government on introducing this bill and I am sure we all wish it well in its future.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,1998-05-14,"—in reply—Mr Deputy Speaker, I will begin by thanking all members for their contributions in this debate, and especially the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) who, as we have heard today, has put her case for her constituents so well. I can inform other members that she not only puts her case well in debate, as we have heard her so eloquently do today, but also very effectively lobbies everyone from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) down—including on this issue.
I would hate to see any delay of this legislation because of amendments moved by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). As the member for Hughes has told us, there have been too many delays already. We need to be getting on with this legislation. Labor had 13 years and nothing eventuated. The bill must be seen through to fruition because of not only the constituents of Hughes and the rest of the Australian community but also our international obligations. The grandstanding of the opposition on this when this government is actually doing something positive about it does not stand up to too much scrutiny.
The member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) as well as the member for Dobell raised concerns about the membership of the council. It should be said that the council is to be an expert body. An example that easily comes to mind is the National Health and Medical Research Council. The government considers this proposed council to be important. While the detail is not in this legislation, it will be in the regulations, which are being drafted as we speak.
The regulations will spell out exactly who will be on the council and the types of representation on the council. There will be community representation, state and territory representation and, importantly, expert representation. The member for Dobell was asking questions as to the guarantees I might give that another minister or parliamentary secretary may not live up to. That is not an issue: it will be there in the regulations. The government considers these things to be very important and would not leave it hanging loose like that.
The whole framework for this legislation relies on a lot of detail in regulation and that is entirely appropriate. The member for Bonython also mentioned his concerns about the suitability of Lucas Heights. He should be reminded that a Senate inquiry is under way at the moment on the suitability of Lucas Heights as an appropriate place for the new reactor, and a number of other associated issues as well. I look forward to that report. I understand it will be available at the end of June.
He also expressed concern about the powers granted to inspectors. Most members would want adequate powers available to inspectors, when you consider that community safety and the environment are in question. This is very similar to other Commonwealth enactments where inspectors are required to look at hazardous materials or check for potential hazards. There is one example of this in the Therapeutic Goods Act.
I am sure that any concerns genuinely held by the opposition will be dealt with. I hope it is not just a question of grandstanding. I also hope that we will see this legislation through the House of Representatives and the Senate as quickly as possible, because it is particularly important legislation.
Because it is also reasonably technical I would like to put those technicalities on the record. Today we are debating a series of bills designed to protect the health and safety of persons and the environment from harm arising from radiation practices undertaken by Commonwealth entities. The first bill is the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998, which establishes for the first time a regulatory framework to enable all Commonwealth radiation and nuclear activities to be regulated. The other two bills, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 and the  Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Bill 1998 , are adjuncts to the first bill.
The ARPANS bill is a critical piece of legislation which closes a current gap in regulation where the states and territory government activities and private undertakings are regulated by state and territory radiation laws but Commonwealth agencies have operated without corresponding Commonwealth oversight and regulation. The bill applies to all Commonwealth entities and their employees and to non-Commonwealth entities when these are contracted to the Commonwealth. This includes all Commonwealth departments such as Defence, bodies corporate such as CSIRO and ANSTO, and any person who is a party to a contract with a Commonwealth entity.
Under the provisions of the bill, no Commonwealth entity can deal with radioactive materials or radiation apparatus, or any aspects of a nuclear facility, unless licensed to do so in accordance with this legislation. This means that Commonwealth activities ranging from using an X-ray machine to the safe and appropriate decommissioning of the nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights are prohibited unless a licence has been issued in accordance with this bill. The bill provides for exemptions to the general prohibition, including specific exemptions for certain defence and security activities in the national interest. Criteria for other exemptions on the basis of very low risk will be set out in regulation under this legislation.
There is very broad support for the aims of the bill. The value of legislation such as this has been recognised by all parties in this chamber. In 1996 the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste produced a report, No time to waste, with the close involvement of the Greens, the Democrats, the Australian Labor Party and the current coalition government. In that report the committee made recommendations strongly supporting:
. . . the proposal for an independent regulator of Commonwealth bodies' radiation activities, with functions of regulating, licensing, monitoring and imposing penalties for breaches of licences.
The committee also made recommendations regarding the need to resolve any potential conflict of interest between regulatory and other functions of the new agency and the need for community representation on advisory bodies. I am pleased to report that this bill incorporates 
 all of those recommendations and delivers on the government's commitment to close the regulatory gap identified by the committee.
Regulation of Commonwealth activities is also strongly supported by all state and territory governments. In August last year I presented to all health ministers a strategy for pursuing a national uniform regulatory framework. Ministers wholeheartedly supported my proposal and since then the Commonwealth and all states and territories have worked together to produce such a framework. I am pleased to note that this bill has been crafted following close consultation with states and territories and that it complies with the template for nationally uniform radiation protection legislation which was jointly developed by all jurisdictions.
The provisions of this bill have been developed in close consultation with those Commonwealth agencies and departments which will be regulated by this legislation, including ANSTO, Defence, CSIRO, Industry, Science and Tourism, Primary Industries and Energy, Foreign Affairs and Customs. As honourable members would note, the style of this bill is such that it relies heavily on details contained in regulations for its operations. The development of regulations made under this bill will be the subject of the same extensive consultation as has characterised the development of the bill itself. I am sorry that the member for Dobell is not here to hear that detail.
What does this bill do? How will the regulatory framework described in the bill be implemented? The bill provides for the establishment of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, to be known as ARPANSA, within the Department of Health and Family Services. From 1 July 1998, the functions and resources of the currently existing Nuclear Safety Bureau and the Australian Radiation Laboratory will be combined to form ARPANSA. This agency will also take responsibility for the regulatory matters detailed in the bill.
ARPANSA will be managed by a CEO, an independent statutory office which is created in the bill. The functions of the CEO will include regulating, in accordance with international best practice, activities within the Commonwealth which involve radiation and nuclear safety; working with the states and territories to develop uniform regulatory controls throughout Australia; informing and advising the government and the public on radiation protection and nuclear safety; and undertaking research and providing a service of a high standard to ensure radiation protection and nuclear safety.
It is clearly important that the CEO has access to expert advice and input from a range of sources, including the community. The bill therefore provides for the establishment of the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council. Members of this council will be appointed by the minister for health. The council will include representatives from the community, the states and territories as well as others with appropriate experience. Each member will be appointed on the basis of their standing and their expertise in fields relevant to radiation protection.
The council will oversee the work of a number of standing committees, some of which have already undertaken substantial and important work, including the Radiation Health Committee and the Nuclear Codes Committee. The standing committees will also comprise experts in the field, including community and public interest representatives.
In summary, ARPANSA, under the direction of the CEO, will serve a number of complementary functions. Before I outline those, I say again that I would hope it was not ignorance on the part of the member for Dobell in moving his amendment to this bill, because briefings are available to all shadow ministers when they are required. On something as 
 important as this, and following the Senate committee, I am sure he would have been up to date. From that, I can only conclude that he thought this might be some way to cast a red herring to in some way tarnish the best interests of the government, or perhaps it might have been just playing very local politics in the electorate of Hughes. I say again that no member could have put more effort into this issue than has the member for Hughes, as indeed she does with so many of the other issues that she takes up on behalf of her electorate. I would expect that the people of Hughes would be not pleased with little antics like this and in fact would be pleased to see that legislation is now coming before the parliament following 13 years of neglect in this area from the former government.
To get back to the detail of ARPANSA's functions, it will issue Commonwealth entities with licences in respect of radioactive material, radiation apparatus, and nuclear and other facilities. Attached to each licence will be a series of conditions. It will be an offence under the legislation for a controlled person to deal with controlled materials, apparatus or nuclear and other facilities without a licence or contrary to the licence conditions. Penalties will apply to breaches of the act, regulations and licence conditions.
As ARPANSA will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the provisions, it is important that the bill provides for appropriate powers to gather evidence to support prosecutions where necessary. It is the government's view that prosecutions would be an avenue of last resort against its own agencies, but there is no doubt that where a safety breach is significant ARPANSA will have the capacity to respond appropriately.
ARPANSA will continue, and appropriately expand, the excellent research work currently undertaken by the Nuclear Safety Bureau and the Australian Radiation Laboratory. It is essential that this regulation is underpinned by an independent research capability. This will include research associated with radiation and nuclear safety, such as public health and environmental issues. ARPANSA will also continue to be involved in international fora. It is also clearly important that Australia's interests in the international arena are well served by an authoritative, independent, expert voice.
The cost of undertaking functions specified in the bill will be recovered, as appropriate, from regulated Commonwealth agencies. In regard to this matter, I draw members' attention to the  Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Bill 1998  before you. The information on charges is represented in a separate bill because annual charges are treated as taxes and the constitution requires that taxes must be dealt with separately in purpose specific legislation. This bill enables appropriate cost recovery processes by providing for fees and charges to be levied on Commonwealth entities requiring a licence under the legislation. No private individuals or corporations will be required to obtain a licence or to pay any fees.
For the purposes of establishing appropriate annual fees, the Commonwealth will employ an independent consultant to advise on cost recovery. All Commonwealth entities to be levied under this bill will be closely consulted during the project and during the subsequent determination of appropriate charges. It will then be possible to develop regulations under this bill to reflect the fees and charges to be levied.
The third bill which is before us today is the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998. This bill details necessary changes to existing legislation to accommodate the ARPANS bill. The effect of the consequential amendments bill is threefold. Firstly, the bill details changes that are necessary to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987. As a result of the introduction of the 
 ARPANS bill the key change to the ANSTO Act is the repealing of those parts of the act which established the Nuclear Safety Bureau and the Safety Review Committee.
As I have previously mentioned, once the ARPANS bill is passed the Nuclear Safety Bureau and the Australian Radiation Laboratory will be combined to form the basis of the new Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency—ARPANSA—within the Department of Health and Family Services. The CEO and staff of the new agency will have responsibility for administering the new legislation and regulating Commonwealth entities involved in radiation and nuclear safety activities. With the establishment of ARPANSA the Safety Review Committee will become redundant.
Secondly, the bill transfers the assets and liabilities of the Nuclear Safety Bureau to the Commonwealth.
Thirdly, the bill ensures that the current powers of the director of the Nuclear Safety Bureau, as set out in the ANSTO Act, are conferred on the CEO of ARPANSA during any transitional period. This will ensure continuity between the present processes and the future regulatory regime. Consequential amendments set out in this bill will ensure the appropriate and seamless operations of the two Commonwealth acts.
In conclusion, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill and associated bills will result in a centre of excellence for regulation, advice, research and services supporting radiation protection and nuclear safety of employees, the public and the environment.
I again thank members for their contribution and commend this bill to the parliament.
—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Dobell has moved an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Those of that opinion say aye, to the contrary no. I think the ayes have it.
—The noes have it.
—As it is necessary to resolve this question to enable further questions to be considered in relation to this bill, in accordance with standing order 277, the bill will be returned to the House for further consideration.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—Can I say at the outset that I am actually continuing a debate that was brought on very quickly on 5 March of this year. It is ironic when one thinks that the report that we are talking about, the national report into local government which under the 1995 Commonwealth act requires the minister to table it in the House, should have a little bit more debate than what we seem to be doing. It was brought on very quickly at the end of the session when there were only four or five minutes left to debate the issues and now we seem to be having it again at the end of a Main Committee sitting because we have a few moments left over.
I believe it is doubly ironic that we have got this report now before us just two days after the Commonwealth has brought down its 1998 budget. Prior to that we had the Australian Local Government Association putting pressure on all representatives right across Australia requesting that they get the message over very clearly to the government about the effects of the cuts that had occurred in the 1997 budget and how that had affected local government.
The 1997 budget cuts totalled $14.7 million and in my state of New South Wales we lost $4,754,758 as a consequence. When you distribute that through local government in New South Wales it adds up to a number of services which local government has had to cut.
I believe when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in 1997 suspended that agreement there was no formal assurance that the agreement would be reinstated and the funding base restored to an appropriate level for the 1998 budget. That was despite, even then, strong representations to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) by all the premiers of all of the states and territories. In April of this year local government was again asking us as elected representatives at a Commonwealth level to put pressure on both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to make sure that those grants were restored to their original area of priority.
What we saw then following the budget on Tuesday night was that, even though the local government financial institutions funding was restored, in real terms the fact remained that the 1997 budget had permanently cut the funding base to local government by something like $15 million per year. That has not been restored following the budget on 12 May and what that really means then is that the increase that has come to local government this year of $24 million, which I am sure the government is going to get up and crow about all over Australia, really should have been $39 million.
There should have been a commitment by this government to restore those originally suspended funding cuts to local government. Our urban areas are going to suffer from that because there is going to be continual, ongoing loss to local government and, more importantly I think, regional areas very much are going to be hard hit.
I believe that local government now Australia-wide has certainly put in measures on where they expect funding to go and also what they expect to do in their own areas. But, more importantly, in a report such as this we have the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), when he tabled the report, saying that the Commonwealth has become a major contributor to the funding of local government and is providing the expertise. We are expecting overviews and we are expecting local government to get their act together. I believe what we should be doing is honouring commitments that have come about in the past and those for the restoration of that funding suspended in 1997.
I can talk more personally of only my own areas that I represent. Not only have we had cuts in financial assistance grants and not only have we had cuts in road funding grants but we have had the absolute abolition of all flood mitigation programs. That has caused a great deal of discontent in areas such as mine. I was very pleased on Saturday when I launched the flood icon that was put together by Fairfield Council and funded by them and the state government of New South Wales. We were able to bring together an education program through the combination of a school—our Fairfield High School students—and local artists and very graphically educate people in the area about flood mitigation.
I bring that up during this local government report because I am very concerned that we have now had not only general cuts not restored in the 1998 budget but we have had no flood mitigation money restored in the 1998 budget. It means areas like mine are going to be grappling with great difficulty in trying to fund what should have been ongoing programs to protect the community I represent. We also have a very difficult problem because flooding does not occur every day of the week and people seem to become immune to the fact that it has not occurred for quite a few years. That is why it was very important that last Saturday we were able to launch a very intensive education program but more importantly an icon that shows very descriptively how the flood levels of our area had been in the 1956, 1986 and 1988 floods.
I might add that in 1988 I had in my local area houses under two and three metres of water and something like 500 people had to be rescued. You do not think that happens in residential areas of an urban part of a local government but, believe me, it does and it has occurred on more than one occasion. That is what I am trying to bring in together. We cannot continue to expect local government to deliver its services while at the same time at a Commonwealth level we do not give them a guarantee of funding. Nor can we expect them to keep programs that are going to better the communities as a whole when we have a stop-start arrangement in regard to how funds are going to be allocated.
In the meantime, I can only say to local government, particularly the areas of Fairfield and Holroyd, to keep up the good work. Let us be assured that we are going to have some sensible application at a Commonwealth level on where local government is going to go in the future not only with the tabling of this report but also I believe from contributions from the Australian Local Government Association as well as local councils across Australia. We need to make sure that this government is kept on its toes and kept informed of the loss to the community and how much it suffers when governments do not meet their commitments.
This report will talk about efficiency in local government for the 1996-97 year. Because the minister is obligated to table reports in the House, it will probably be time to have another report tabled when we still have not finished the debate on the one before us. It is time to reiterate that we did have a commitment on flood mitigation programs, from Commonwealth, state and local government, when that commitment was a two to one ratio. Certainly it was something that all governments at the time were very proud of.
The Howard government abolished that urban flood mitigation program in 1996. I was hoping it would have been reinstated in 1997 and it was not. A certain amount of money was given out when cheques went missing and then came into the throw again for a very few councils in New South Wales. I think the member for Page (Mr Causley) had a small contribution made in 1996 and, because of the outcry of the state government at the time, they realised that they had to at least make contributions to a number of metropolitan councils who were well ahead in the allocation of priorities in that flood mitigation program. My council of Fairfield, in particular, got something like $700,000.
When you make contributions on a two to one basis, for every $2 it is spending the Commonwealth is getting $5 worth of work done in that community and the people overall are gaining from that type of contribution. Yet we have seen that excellent program scrapped. In my area it is going to mean that something like $33 million is still outstanding on flood mitigation works and that is in about today's dollars. Council had a program and an estimate of completing all their flood mitigation works over the next 15 years. That is certainly going to go on a lot further now. They will not be able to meet anywhere near that target.
It worries me because populations change, particularly in urban areas. People move in. We have not had a major flood there since 1988. When people have moved in they have become very blase about it. They say, `It can't happen. It won't affect me.' I can tell you it does affect people. During the last flood, we even had the Hume Highway closed off for something like two or three days. If not for the tremendous effort at local level with the state emergency services, we could have lost lives.
I appeal again to the Commonwealth government that, if you want value in programs, you have to look at involving all levels of government, particularly when you are thinking about the programs that local government becomes very much involved in and becomes very efficient in implementing on the ground. If we look at microeconomic reforms, and at the contribution that local government makes, we have to take that into account.
Another area that also worries me, as far as local government is concerned—and I probably will not have time to bring it up during this debate with the report now being tabled—is where we are going to go with the so-called tax package of the Commonwealth government. Local government has also become very aware that a GST could be on the cards for them. They are going to be suffering enormously if a GST is introduced. Some of the surveys that they have done estimate it is going to cost local government millions and billions of dollars if the type 
 of GST that is being talked about is introduced in this tax package, whenever it sees the light of day.
I would appeal that consideration be given to all of these authorities who are expected to implement certain policies that we direct at a Commonwealth level. They are expected more and more to implement them without the means or the funding with which to do it. As you know, in New South Wales we do have rate pegging. It is something that I have always supported over a long period of time, even though councils object to it and feel that they do not adequately have the means to move their programs around to meet circumstances as they come forward. When one looks at the differentiation between one council and another, and how they move their rates about, perhaps that is something that we have to have in circumstances where better estimation of budgets has to come about.
This report talks about particularly reform. I want to talk about more than just reform. I want commitment. I want commitment given through the Commonwealth through their budget and through the states through their budgets, so that the local authority can implement their programs. We always have that cliche that local governments are closest to the people. I can assure the Commonwealth members that they are. You only have to have your local residents come in at times to complain that the garbage is not picked up or of other things that are happening. People are aware of lack of services but, more importantly, they are aware that the Commonwealth government has reneged on its funding.(Time expired)",REPS,<title>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) ACT</title>,<title>Report</title>,Miscellaneous,42,1,speech

In this report, parliament recognises the legitimate roles of local government in the areas of service delivery and various other functions to which it is suited. These are crucial functions, as the third tier of government in our system—that of local shires and city councils—is essential in the provision of basic services, ranging from waste management through to planning approvals, to health and cultural services, and to roads and infrastructure work. Local government is also important in its complementary function in conjunction with state and federal services. Without healthy, properly representative and accountable local government, our overall system of government is significantly weakened.
This brings me to the state of my own local government authority, the city of Wanneroo. Members in this place will remember that, in the past, I have stood as a strong critic of corruption in the city of Wanneroo. My efforts in part forced the state government to open an inquiry, and later a royal commission, into what was known as Wanneroo Inc. As a result of the inquiries, one-time Liberal mayor Wayne Bradshaw has been imprisoned, and former perjured Liberal state member Wayde Smith is now in jail.
Accusations went deeper, however, and the then Attorney-General and her husband were alleged to have strong links to the group of people that control the Liberal Party in the district that supported and nurtured the control that Mayor Bradshaw had over the city council. They were later cleared of wrongdoing within the terms of the reference of the royal commission.
Although the matters relating to Wanneroo Inc. took place well before the last federal election, its effects continue to be felt. I believe that my stand against corruption in this matter in the northern suburbs, and the subsequent loss of tens of thousands of dollars of illegal fundraising, were an important feature of my not being endorsed as the Liberal candidate for Moore in 1996.
In 1997 and 1998, with the royal commission as a catalyst, the state coalition government decided to suspend all of the democratically elected councillors in Wanneroo and subsequently to split the council into the city of Joondalup and the shire of Wanneroo. The suspension of the councillors beggars belief. The state coalition government actually used the pretence that things had not changed since the days of Bradshaw in order to justify their actions. But the reality is that three former councillors from those days sit on the state government's benches. In other words, three of the people from the days of Wayne Bradshaw's term of office, or from the period when Wayne Bradshaw had strong influence in the city of Wanneroo, now sit on state government benches, deemed to be above suspicion—while councillors who were not even in office during the Wanneroo Inc. days have been suspended.
In fact, the only three councillors who remain from those days and have thus now been punished were in fact whistleblowers. They were people who went to make complaints against what they thought was wrongdoing in the local government authority. What kind of message is that? A cynic could be excused for thinking that they were being punished for blowing the whistle on a very cosy arrangement in the northern suburbs, an arrangement that suited the former mayor, Wayne Bradshaw, very well indeed.
The suspension of councillors allowed the state government to go ahead with its plan to split Wanneroo without serious coordinated opposition from them. The way that it has been done makes it look like a serious misuse of political power by the state government in order to achieve its ends more easily. Whether this is the case is difficult to say: throughout the process, the state government has provided scant detail on why it was necessary to split the city of Wanneroo.
This is made more difficult to understand when one knows that the same state government has made a detailed exploration of amalgamating cities and shires elsewhere, as in the case of Albany in the south-west. Their rationale is to achieve economies of scale that will significantly enhance efficiency and improve services to ratepayers there. The process mirrors a long and substantial process undertaken by the Victorian government. The member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), who is present today, will of course know about that process, whereby a number of small shires and councils have been amalgamated in order to achieve efficient operations in the third tier of government in that state.
What then is the rationale for splitting Wanneroo, which has achieved a range of efficiencies and economies by virtue of its size and corporate knowledge? Not only can it deliver services at reasonable levels of rates and charges but it also has successfully operated substantial business activity on behalf of its ratepayers, in order to subsidise its services without recourse to significant increases in rates and charges.
The neighbouring city of Stirling, also earmarked for being broken down, commissioned an independent review of the effects of a split. This showed an estimated increase in running costs, owing to losses in economy of scale, of $16 million or 22.78 per cent per year. In the current climate, this will only be offset by increased rates, reduced scope of services to residents, improvements in productivity and increased charges for use of facilities and services.
Importantly, the state government has not indicated what it believes will be the real effect on the residents of Wanneroo—

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1998-05-14,"—On Monday I am visiting the electorate of McMillan to talk about road funding issues and I would like to make some reference to one particular issue that is of considerable importance in the electorate of McMillan. Before so doing, I would like to make some comments on the context, particularly in the light of the budget of a couple of days ago.
National highway funding in Australia in the 1995 budget—the last Labor budget—was $834 million. In last year's budget that went down to $697 million. In the budget two days ago, for 1998-99, it was again slashed, to $675 million. So we have had a drop, within the space of three budgets, from $834 million to $675 million. It is also important to acknowledge that, on the basis of the government's own figures, over four years funding for the national highway maintenance program, which is roughly half of the total, is going to be reduced by half. That will obviously cause severe problems down the track for the national highway in many parts of Australia.
It is also important, as a matter of context, to point out that funding for Victoria as a proportion of total federal road funding has diminished considerably since Labor lost office. Throughout the 1990s when Labor was in office, the average percentage of total federal road funding that went to Victoria was between 20 and 21 per cent. However, that dropped to below 16 per cent last year. That percentage can be contrasted with the 22 per cent of total roadways which are in Victoria and the 25 per cent of total fuel excise receipts which Victoria contributes to the Commonwealth.
The specific matter that I wish to raise today concerns the Pakenham bypass. This is a part of the Princes Highway which I know very well for two reasons. Firstly, having lived in Orbost in my early life, I travelled many times through this particular part of what is now the outer suburbs of Melbourne. Secondly, and more particularly, I know the area well because my mother lives in Berwick and has done so for some time and so I have cause to travel in this area quite a bit now.
The road is one of the heaviest parts of the Princes Highway in terms of traffic. It currently has about 26,000 vehicles per day and it is estimated that by the year 2010 it will have about 
 37,000 vehicle movements per day. It is one of the critical growth areas of the greater Melbourne area and it currently suffers from a very high accident rate.
On 9 December 1997 the mayor, Councillor Edwin Hume, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) with respect to the Pakenham bypass, seeking road funding for that project, and I have a copy of the letter here with me today. I should add that Councillor Hume is the Mayor of the Cardinia Shire which has the greatest interest in this bypass proposal. Unfortunately, it took the Prime Minister four months to organise any response to his letter. Finally, on 3 April this year his parliamentary secretary, the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), wrote back stating amongst other things `the delay in replying is regretted' and stating that the Pakenham bypass is a Victorian government responsibility.
It is interesting to note that the government was refusing to provide any roads of national importance funding for the Pakenham bypass yet it seems able to provide roads of national importance funding—it has announced that it will—for Main Road 92 in New South Wales in the marginal coalition electorate of Gilmore, and parts of that road currently are gravel.
We have therefore a situation where the government seems unable to provide roads of national importance funding for a road which currently has 26,000 cars and trucks per day, and it is anticipated that within barely a decade it will have 37,000 vehicles a day, but it can provide funding for a relatively minor road, parts of which are only gravel at the moment, because it happens to be in an electorate where the Prime Minister obviously wants to assist the cause of the incumbent member.
What does this tell us about the member for McMillan (Mr Broadbent)? Obviously, he is not a very good lobbyist for his electorate. Obviously, he does not have the ear of the Prime Minister. He does not have the ability to get the Prime Minister to respond to the needs of his electorate. He could not get an answer out of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister took four months to even respond to the correspondence. And whereas the Prime Minister is prepared to provide funding for a relatively minor road in the electorate of Gilmore, he seems unable to do that for the member for McMillan in what is obviously a very important case, the Pakenham bypass.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Roads</title>,Adjournment,43,1,speech
