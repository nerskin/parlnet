"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-05-10,"—Labor opposes the Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004, for the reasons I will now outline. The principles underpinning any right of entry regime need to be about rights and responsibilities, the implementation of which are fair for both employees and employers. The bill does not meet this basic requirement. The principal objectives of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 are found in section 3. They include:
providing a framework of rights and responsibilities for employers and employees, and their organisations, which supports fair and effective agreement-making and ensures that they abide by awards and agreements applying to them; and
ensuring freedom of association, including the rights of employees and employers to join an organisation or association of their choice, or not to join an organisation or association …
Freedom of association is a fundamental right. To have genuine freedom of association requires that an employee has a personal choice to access his or her union at the workplace. As a consequence of this general principle, the ILO’s tripartite committee has, for example, determined that unions should have access to workplaces to meet with employees. In Australia there has long been a tradition of allowing unions reasonable access to workplaces. In this bill, the government is seeking to severely and unfairly restrict employees’ access to their representatives and restrict the representatives of employees from being able to properly and effectively represent their members in industrial matters.
Another fundamental right infringed upon by this bill is the right of an individual employee to decide to collectively bargain with other employees. Collective bargaining is only able to be effectively exercised when employees have access to a level of skills, advice, support and information comparable to that of employers. Without such access, employees do not have access to a fair collective-bargaining environment. The according of a right to an individual brings with it the obligation on an individual to exercise that right with responsibility and to not unreasonably impinge upon the rights, dignity or civil liberty of others. That is why a right of entry regime has to be fair and balanced. The regime created by this bill is simply not.
A legislative right of entry was described in the former Industrial Relations Act 1988. Pursuant to section 286 an officer of an organisation was allowed to inspect premises ‘for the purposes of ensuring the observance of an award or order of the commission’. Those premises which could be inspected by the officer of an organisation were those occupied by an employer bound by the award or order, or those at which work to which the award or order applied was being carried out. An inspection under section 286 could be authorised by the secretary of the organisation, or the secretary of a branch. If required, the officer was obliged to produce evidence of this authority. Inspection could only be permitted during working hours, and the right to inspect was subject to conditions provided by the award itself. The section also authorised the interviewing of any member or person eligible for membership of the organisation. This regime was amended in 1996.
The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Act 1996 made a number of amendments to the Commonwealth’s then legislative right of entry regime. Since 1996, right of entry has been provided for through division 11A of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Right of entry is now allowed only for the purposes of investigating a suspected breach of an award, agreement or relevant legislation rather than for the general purpose of ensuring the compliance of an award or commission order.
The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Act 1996 abolished award based right of entry. Section 127AA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 provides that any award or order giving union officers or employees the right to enter premises or inspect records and other things and interview employees is unenforceable. Award based right of entry was replaced with a right to enter to hold discussions with employees who wish to participate in these discussions, provided that discussions with employees are held only during breaks. As well, a requirement that a union give at least 24 hours notice to the employer of their intention to enter premises was introduced.
The Workplace Relations Act 1996 does not at present limit the inclusion of right of entry provisions in certified agreements. It is common for agreements to include such provisions, although this is now being tested as a result of Electrolux and other cases in the High Court. Right of entry has been considered by relevant Senate committees on a number of occasions since these changes were made in 1996. A coalition majority of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee recommended in 1999 that ‘changes to right of Entry in the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 should be passed, including requiring a written invitation from an employee and allowing the employer to choose the place where discussions take place.
The report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills on entry and search provisions in Commonwealth legislation unanimously concluded in 2000 that no evidence was put before the committee suggesting that unions should not have a right to enter. The committee found that, while dissatisfaction was expressed about the way that the provisions operated in certain circumstances, a voluntary code of practice developed between employers and employees, as opposed to legislation, was a more appropriate remedy.
The bill was introduced in the House on 2 December 2004. It was referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee on 8 December 2004. The committee will report today, 10 May 2005. The bill will further restrict the ability of union representatives to enter the workplace. It seeks to limit the scope of state law by using a range of constitutional powers to allow the Commonwealth to exclude the operation of state right of entry laws. The bill introduces a raft of more stringent criteria before a union employee or official can be deemed a fit and proper person to be granted an entry permit. The bill also expands the grounds for suspension and revocation of permits.
The government argues that the bill would continue to allow unions to represent their members in the workplace, to hold discussions with potential members and to investigate suspected breaches of industrial laws and instruments, but that this would be balanced against the rights of employers and occupiers of premises to conduct their business without undue interference or harassment. Labor believes that employers already have significant protections in the current act to enable them to conduct their businesses without undue interference.
This bill will severely impact upon employees’ access to their representatives. The restrictions to right of entry proposed in the bill would prevent employees from being able to choose to be effectively represented by a union in collective-bargaining processes and would limit unions’ capacity to ensure that employers abide by awards and agreements applying to them. The bill would prevent unions from being able to effectively represent employees who choose to be members of a union and from being able to recruit members. Restricting union entry to once every six months per work site for recruitment purposes assumes that the employer would have knowledge of the content of the conversations between an employee and a union. Further, the size of most workplaces would mean that many employees—especially shift workers, part-time employees and those in industries with high staff turnover—would not see a union representative at all. It amounts to a practical banning of recruitment at the workplace. There is no explanation for choosing this time limit in the bill.
As a part of the rights both to freely associate and to collectively bargain, employees should be able to choose to have conversations with their representatives without fear of retaliation from their employer. An employee should have the right to join a union and have discussions with their union representative without any undue interference from their employer. In practical terms this means that an employer does not need to know which employees are meeting with a union. Further, an employer should not know without the employee’s consent whether the employee is or is not a member of a union. And it is a breach of the employee’s privacy for the employer to know the content of discussions between an employee and the union.
Because of the nature of Australia’s industrial relations system, unions are the only properly resourced enforcement mechanism for awards and agreements. The level of enforcement able to be provided from the government departments’ inspectors is massively underresourced and certainly has no capacity to systematically ensure compliance with awards and agreements. This bill erodes an employee’s rights to freedom of association by effectively conferring upon employers a right to oversee interactions between employees and unions. The bill offends an employees’ right to privacy and potentially allows discrimination against an employee on the basis of union membership through the requirements for unions to access only members’ employment records.
The bill proposes that permit holders comply with a reasonable request from the employer to conduct interviews in a particular room or area of the premises and to take a particular route to reach that room or area. The bill will restrict the capacity of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to exercise discretion to resolve disputes in this area and again may place employees’ privacy and freedom of association at risk. Genuine freedom of association and an effective right to bargain collectively depend upon employees having ready, practical access to advice, information and representation by trade unions in their workplace.
The rights of workers to organise are articulated in ILO convention 87, on freedom of association and protection of the right to organise. ILO convention 98, on the right to organise and collectively bargain, is undermined by the proposed prohibition of right of entry as a legitimate subject about which the parties to an agreement may bargain. It is also inconsistent with the scheme of the Workplace Relations Act 1996—which seeks to encourage employees and employers to determine matters affecting the relationship between them at the workplace or enterprise level, subject to appropriate and fair minimum standards—to impose this limitation about what may or may not be the subject of bargaining, especially where both parties agree.
The bill is not balanced. It does not address any existing problem with the right of entry provisions. For example, employees covered by AWAs currently have no rights to visits from a union at their workplace. This is discriminatory as these employees have lesser rights to access assistance and information than employees on other industrial instruments. The issue is only partially addressed in this bill.
There is no compelling evidence of widespread difficulties for employers associated with the operation of the current right of entry provisions. Indeed, even the current right of entry provisions in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 make it difficult in practice for unions to operate effectively. The proposed more stringent requirements for granting a right of entry permit are unnecessary, onerous and discriminatory. The commission and the registrar have already shown an ability to deal with inappropriate behaviour by permit holders, including by the revocation of permits.
Finally, the bill does not create a single statutory scheme; it creates confusion. It replaces simple, well-understood state laws with a highly restrictive federal scheme for the sake of the 35 per cent of corporate employers who are currently covered by state systems. The bill adds to this confusion by proposing to retain different laws for small businesses that are not incorporated.
The bill was referred to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee for inquiry. The New South Wales, Queensland and ACT governments each made submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill. Key points made in these submissions included: there has been no consultation with state governments, employees, employers or industrial organisations in the development of the bill; there is no policy case for change; there is no legal case for change; the bill seeks to impose a centralised ‘one size fits all’ approach on employers and unions; the bill aims to replace simple, effective and non-controversial state legislation; the bill would create contradictions with existing state and federal legislation; the bill will hamper unions’ ability to monitor effectiveness of state laws and otherwise carry out statutory duties; the bill unnecessarily and arbitrarily restricts employees’ rights to collectively organise using representatives of their own choosing, contrary to international obligations; and, finally, the bill will facilitate the identification of employees on the basis of their union membership, contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
A number of employer groups, including the Master Builders Association of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Mines and Metals Association and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, made submissions to the Senate inquiry. The views of the employer groups can be summarised as being in support of the bill as they believe it will provide a more balanced framework for right of entry. The employer groups are particularly supportive of measures designed to produce a more uniform or unitary national system of right of entry provisions. The employer groups believe that the bill will assist in preventing and addressing abuse of right of entry provisions. Employer groups maintain that right of entry should only be exercised where employees choose to be represented by trade unions in respect of a particular workplace matter and that such an approach is consistent with freedom of association principles.
Submissions were received from a wide range of unions and trade union councils. Key aspects of the unions’ submissions include the views that: the bill would impose unreasonable restrictions on employees’ access to unions at their workplace; the bill would place Australian law in further breach of international obligations in respect of freedom of association and collective bargaining; the bill ignores unions’ role as parties principal to awards and agreements; there is no evidence that there is widespread abuse of union right of entry and that the basis of the current scheme is in need of major change; and, under current laws, both state and federal tribunals have a wide discretion to revoke right of entry permits if they are found to have been misused.
The Senate committee was due to report its findings on Monday, 7 March 2005. This has been delayed until 10 May 2005 by request of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations as they are considering possible amendments to the bill. The department indicated to the Senate committee:
Following a number of concerns raised by submissions to this inquiry, the minister has decided to consider some possible amendments to aspects of the bill. These aspects are the limitation in the bill on a permit holder being able to engage in recruitment conduct only once every six months; the maintenance of the existing rights of union officials to enter premises, pursuant to the Victorian Outworkers (Improved Protection) Act 2003—
the Labor Party will be moving amendments in the committee stage in that respect—
and the requirement that notice of entry must be provided during working hours. The department is not yet in a position to provide any details of the precise nature of these amendments.
That is what Mr James Smyth, Chief Counsel of DEWR, said in the committee Hansard of 18 February 2005. The possible amendments, while welcome, would not appear to be significant enough to warrant Labor’s support of the bill overall. The bill is deficient because it does not meet the basic tests. It does not prescribe fair and reasonable right of entry provisions that meet the needs of both employers and employees, and their representatives. In addition, the bill will override state laws and in this respect create gaps and uncertainty in its application. The states have not been consulted in the development of this bill.
The bill will undermine the role played by unions in ensuring compliance with the various awards and agreements they are party to, thus further eroding the rights and entitlements of Australia’s working people. Unions are party to awards and certified agreements. Their role is not confined to merely representing their members. As a party to a type of contract, unions have a direct interest in ensuring that the provisions of the award or agreement are adhered to, that breaches are investigated and that the award or agreement continues to meet the needs of the employees whose employment is subject to it. This principle underpins the current provisions permitting unions to enter premises for the purposes of inspecting wage records as well as other documents and things and to interview employees in order to investigate any suspected breaches and ensure the enforcement of the award or agreement.
The bill infringes on basic rights: the right to freely associate and the right to collectively bargain. Freedom of association is a fundamental right. Genuine freedom of association requires that employees have a choice to access their unions at their workplace. An effective right to bargain collectively can only exist when employees choose to have ready, practical access to advice, information and representation by trade unions in their workplace. In these respects the bill breaches our international obligations to abide by ILO conventions. Neither of these rights is anything other than undermined by this legislation. In summary, this bill undermines union members’ right to privacy, it undermines rights to representation and it undermines freedom of association and rights to organise. It compromises both individual and collective rights, and as such undermines the most basic principles of our democracy. Labor will oppose this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (RIGHT OF ENTRY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-05-10,"—I stand in strong support of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004 for the fundamental reason that boosting productivity in Australia through a combination of workplace relations reform and sound economic management is the most generous gift that a government can bestow upon, firstly, its work force and, secondly, their families. This is a fundamental policy understanding. The government are committed to continuing a program of workplace relations reform that started in 1996. We are still doing it and we will continue to do it in the months and years ahead. We are doing this because it will improve living standards, it will increase jobs and, as I said, it will boost productivity and, indeed, enhance international competitiveness.
The good thing about this bill is that it commits to and locks in an election commitment right on the head. That election commitment was to reform the union right-of-entry laws and to exclude the operation of state right-of-entry laws where federal right-of-entry laws also apply. The right-of-entry provisions in the Workplace Relations Act confer significant rights and privileges on unions to enter workplaces to represent their members, but the government believe—and I want to emphasise this—that these significant rights must be carefully balanced with the rights of employers, such as small businesses and the occupiers of those premises, to conduct their business without undue interference or harassment.
The government also consider that as far as possible a single statutory scheme should apply across Australia. In workplaces where both federal and state right-of-entry laws apply, confusion about rights and responsibilities may arise. In fact we had an inquiry of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee and that confusion was made clear to the members of that committee. Such confusion and uncertainty can leave employers—small businesses, big businesses—vulnerable to abuse by the unions of their statutory right to enter the workplace.
Senator Marshall made it clear in the Senate today that he believes there is no legal case for this legislation. He believes there is no business or economic case for this legislation and for this reform. I would like to draw his attention and the Senate’s attention to the Federal Court case of BGC Contracting Pty Ltd and the CFMEU. The Federal Court found that unions could gain entry to sites under state right-of-entry law, despite the fact that all workers on the site were working under the federal law. This is clearly unsatisfactory. It is clearly in breach, in my view, of the intent of the federal law. It imposes an unnecessary extra layer of regulation and paperwork on businesses. So, in workplaces where federal and state right-of-entry laws apply, confusion about rights and responsibilities clearly exists at the moment. This uncertainty, as I said earlier, can leave employers vulnerable to the abuse by unions of their statutory right to enter the workplace and, importantly, can subject employers to inconsistency with respect to the law: whether they are a big or small business, exactly what law does apply to them?
The government believe very strongly that workplaces operating under the federal system should not be subject to inconsistent elements of the state system. Workplaces under the federal system should be free to operate under a single system of workplace regulation without having to also contend with aspects of the state system. That is why this bill uses the corporations power under our Constitution to enact a single system for right of entry, to the extent possible within the limits of this power. Where an employer operating under a federal system is a constitutional corporation, unions will be able to exercise their right of entry only under the federal act.
The bill will restore certainty. It will ensure a secure understanding by businesses and employers across the country of what law applies, whereas at the moment there is inconsistency and there are potential loopholes and complex duplications that the BGC Federal Court case has created—and this is the legislative response to that Federal Court case. So there is a legal impediment to enact the legislation to ensure consistency and there is also a business and economic case in favour of workplace relations reform. The Workplace Relations Act should be able to provide a single system of regulation for a workplace in which all employees are employed under the federal act. It was never intended that state law would be able to be used in this way to create a backdoor right of entry where none exists under federal law.
If the act is not amended in this way, it is conceivable that state governments could widen their state right-of-entry powers so much that unions could gain entry wherever they liked, even if they were denied the right under the act. This is a fundamental reason why we are proceeding with this workplace relations reform as quickly as possible to ensure that consistency is injected back into the economic and business environment in this country. It is also important to note that the bill will not restrict the rights of entry that unions currently have under state occupational health and safety legislation.
I want to make a few comments about our government’s past performance in terms of workplace relations reform. I advise the Senate that, since the Howard government came to office, average wages have increased in real terms from $811.80 a week to $961 a week. We have delivered historically low unemployment and historically low inflation. We have delivered high growth in real wages and we have delivered more than 1.3 million new jobs—that is, jobs that have been created. We are looking forward to seeing that locked in and bedded down again tonight with the Treasurer’s delivery of the federal budget, which will lock in the benefits that have flowed through to Australian workers and their families.
It is disappointing, in my view, that some in the union movement and other critics of the Howard government’s foreshadowed workplace relations reform are still saying that it is an attack on workers’ rights. What is good for the worker is the increase in real wages. The Howard government is a friend of employees because we have delivered—the runs are on the board—and we will continue to deliver, and we are confident about that. Sadly, the opposition in the Senate has already blocked 28 separate pieces of workplace relations legislation since 1996. The opposition parties have blocked unfair dismissal reform legislation, for example, over 41 times.
—That’s because Mr Beazley said that it’s all done—there’s nothing to do.
—That is right. That is exactly the point.
—Reform fatigue.
—It is reform fatigue from Mr Beazley. He expressed a view at the Australian newspapers’ sustainable development summit in Melbourne not so long ago and essentially said: ‘I’ve got reform fatigue. I believe that enough has been done in terms of workplace relations reform and we don’t need to do any more.’ The Australian public will make that decision with respect to whether or not Mr Beazley is spot-on. We believe he is entirely wrong with his small target policy and his view that nothing further is required in terms of workplace relations. I know the views of the business community and I am sure that the employees, particularly of small business, would have a different view.
—He should take up a chair at the John F Kennedy School of Government on how to govern without governing.
—He could do exactly that—learn how to govern the country without actually governing. The Hon. Senator Ian Campbell has made it quite clear that that is an option for Mr Beazley, perhaps in his next chapter. In terms of bargaining at the workplace relations level, this encourages wage increases to be linked to productivity improvements. That is a fundamental understanding ensuring flexibility. Higher productivity, of course, leads to higher wages, higher employment and higher living standards—the runs are on the board, as I said. Workplace relations reform is, in my view, no magic pudding but it does produce a bigger pie for all of us to share—the employees, their families and the like—and the benefits spread. We have come so far, so why not keep going? Mr Beazley says: ‘Stop. Everything has been done. We don’t want to go any further.’ There is no reason to believe that, in another eight years, sensible reform cannot deliver an extra $100, $150 or whatever a week more for the work force in real terms.
I have long supported a single national industrial relations system to supersede the cumbersome spread of six separate federal and state jurisdictions and a jumble of awards. This legislation is part of the tapestry, although it is a comprehensive tapestry, of workplace relations reform. What it will do is simplify the arrangements for business. It will ensure certainty and security for business across this nation instead of having the hotchpotch approach that we have, which is our current 100-year-old system, which is indeed antiquated.
Let us have a look. Why do we need to clutter the system with costly myriad federal and state awards? The recent count of awards in Australia showed that there were over 2,200 federal awards and over 1,700 state awards—nearly 4,000 awards across this country. We have businesses operating across state borders. Of course they operate across state borders. They are operating in a federal jurisdiction and in state jurisdictions. In different states they are operating under different terms and conditions. It is that simple. So a single jurisdiction is the way to go. This was so eloquently put by the Hon. Kevin Andrews just last week in Adelaide to a business forum which was very well attended and well appreciated. If you read his speech—it is on the minister’s web site—it gives very clear arguments in favour of a single workplace relations system. It makes it clear that the constitutional powers are there, under the Corporations Law, to cover 85- to 90-odd per cent or thereabouts of the businesses across this country. And, of course, the constitutional corporations are covered.
In the last count that I had a squiz at, there were 857 state awards in New South Wales, more than 300 in Queensland, 80 in South Australia, 354 in Western Australia and, in my home state of Tasmania, 129-odd. Most large and small business employers in the states have to deal with this complex nightmare of both federal and state awards, particularly if they are operating across borders, as many do. We have many home based businesses operating across state borders as well, via the internet. In the 21st century this is happening more commonly. We are asking the Labor Party and the other opposition parties to come on board and to get with it to ensure the benefits flow through to the employees and their families.
Senator Marshall referred to the Senate committee hearings. Indeed, I was there with Senator Marshall. We had hearings, including here in Canberra. We had business groups—including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Mines and Metals Association and, indeed, others—who expressed their views. The employers, the businesses, expressed their strong support for this legislation to be passed—and not only to be passed but to be passed as soon as possible. That is why we are debating this bill today as the first agenda item on the Senate list. I hope that the Senate will see the merit of this bill and have it passed quickly.
In terms of the Senate committee hearings, I was told of the different provisions applying in different states regarding the unions’ right of entry to the workplace. Why shouldn’t the same provisions apply across the country in the different states when you are operating under one system? Of course they should. Let us look at it from a business perspective, from the employers’ perspective. Let us not just see it from our perspective or the unions’ perspective. That is wrong. What is in the public interest? We know what it is: it is to ensure that this reform is passed. Legal experts have looked at the single-jurisdiction option. Minister Kevin Andrews made it very clear that the constitutional corporations will be covered. The large, overwhelming majority will be covered by this legislation and by similar legislation that has been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister and by Minister Kevin Andrews. It will remove the duplication and streamline the arrangements, and it will, of course, have a guaranteed safety net and minimum conditions.
I also want to mention that, in addition to the awards I have referred to—129-odd in Tassie—the business lobby say that employers in Tasmania have to navigate their way through 2,000 pages of laws, regulations and amendments, often covering dual federal and state awards. While large companies have an industrial or human resources department to deal with this—and, to give them their due, that is their right and entitlement, and indeed it is entirely appropriate—let us think of the small businesses that have to find their way through this myriad complex regulation and red tape. Let us make it easier for small businesses—and remember that over 80 per cent of small businesses are microbusinesses of five employees or fewer and small businesses of 20 employees or fewer. We have to be out there helping them.
Remember as well that, with regard to employment, small businesses employ on average 50 per cent of the private sector work force. That is where the work force is—in small business. In Tasmania, my home state, over 50 per cent of the private sector work force is in small business. We lead the country; we are a small business state. I want to support these small businesses by ensuring that there is reform of the workplace relations agenda and these arrangements, which, quite honestly, are antiquated. They are 100 years old and in desperate need of reform.
This is one of the reasons why the Labor Minister for Industrial Relations in Victoria, Rob Hulls, supports this approach of a single jurisdiction. That should be noted. Thank you for that encouragement, Minister Robert Hulls.
—That’s not what he said.
—Indeed, he did say it. He did put reservations on it, Senator Marshall. He said, ‘As long as it’s fair and robust and protects the rights of workers and employers’—and be assured that that is exactly what will happen; that is our approach. Our approach will be to cut back the quagmire of award red tape.
I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the February 2003 Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee report, Small business employment. Some people might think that this is new or revolutionary, but page 152 of the government senators’ part of the report of that committee, of which I was a government member, clearly says:
Government senators also believe that moving to a single jurisdiction for industrial relations could do much to remove complexity and uncertainty from the employment framework and that this would be of significant benefit to small business.
Too right it will! We recognised that in February 2003 and indeed over the course of that inquiry, which took nearly 12 months. And here we are in 2005 and people would think that the sky is about to fall in. That is the way the Labor Party would like to see it.
In the few moments I have left, let us have a look at the Labor Party’s platform and views with regard to right of entry. Let us see what they say about it. The Labor Party’s current platform—the policy they took to the last election—proposes an enormous widening of the right of entry powers for unions. They have not said that yet here in the Senate. Let them speak about their own policy and actually own up to the fact that they wanted to widen the right of entry powers for unions. The ALP’s policy would have given unions unfettered rights of entry by abolishing this requirement and replacing it with the requirement that an industrial award need only have the potential to apply to a workplace, regardless of whether it actually does and regardless of whether there are any union members on the site. So under the ALP’s policy there would be nothing to stop union right of entry to a family home if an employer were running a home based business. Bear that in mind. So the legitimate role of unions in the workplace is still preserved. This is Labor policy. We have expounded on our policy. Let us hear from the Labor Party and the opposition parties.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (RIGHT OF ENTRY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2005-05-10,"—Labor are opposing the Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004, as we rightly should do as people who have respect for workers and respect for those who play an integral part in the industrial development and progress of Australia’s industry—that is, the union movement. I make no apology for saying that I am a proud union member and former proud union official who took part in many industrial campaigns and of course was a regular right-of-entry operative within the bounds of the branch that I was secretary of.
This piece of legislation before the Senate is just one of many that the government will of course be pursuing. It is part of the broader attack on workers and the union movement. It really shows, I think, the hatred of workers that the government have. The very mention of unions for this government reminds them of Darth Vader and the evil empire. They think something strange is going to happen because a union is going to be involved in a workplace. Workers do have rights and workers do have rights to be members of unions. This bill will take away the freedom of association that is enjoyed by workers in Australia today. Workers depend on unions to represent them, and to take away the access of a union official to visit members in their workplace—

Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—

—You would not know, Minister, would you? You have never been out there to talk to workers in the real sense.
—You wouldn’t know, Comrade.
—I wouldn’t know? I think I might know, Comrade—if we are using that term across the chamber. It is nice to have you on board, and I expect you to get up and speak in favour of the rights of workers to have access to unions and the rights of unions to represent their members in the workplace—
—And the right not to join a union too.
—And the right to not join unions also. If you want to debate that, Comrade, let us debate that at the right time, because you are not making much of a contribution now.

Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—

—I take exception if the minister was suggesting for one moment that I or the union I represented was involved in corruption. I take exception to that and ask him to repeat it outside, where it can be developed a little bit further.
—I’ve said it outside, a hundred times.
—Just make the comment regarding myself outside, Comrade, and we will see what develops from that.
This bill severely restricts the representation that unions can give their members. To suggest that they have to be a right and proper person to enter a workplace is farcical. Union officials are elected by their members—

Senator Eggleston interjecting—

—In secret ballots as it might turn out. I see Comrade Eggleston is joining the fray.
Government senators interjecting—
—In secret ballots, postal ballots—find out for yourself how it works and you will see. They are elected because it is believed that they are right and proper people to represent that workplace. It is suggested that you have to apply to enter a workplace to talk to members, whose problems could be associated with many things. It could be the manner in which the employer is operating under the award or the agreement. It could be something to do with superannuation. It could be something to do with workers compensation. There are a range of issues. To suggest that union officials be restricted in their access to workers is something that this government really need to reconsider.
—Can they be restricted from hurting them? Victimising them?
—Victimisation! Get in the real world.
Government senators interjecting—

Senator Marshall interjecting—

—It is union bashing. You are right, Senator Marshall. They will take every opportunity to do it. But the worm turns. They will have their time on this side, and they will see what they have done to this nation when workers revolt against the unscrupulous methods of the government. That will happen. It is bound to happen because history does repeat itself and it will repeat itself against the government for the way they treat workers. To suggest that right of entry should be restricted to, say, once every six months or a set period of time is a nonsense.

Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—

 (Senator Cherry)—Order! Senator Campbell, you have been repeatedly interjecting. Senator Buckland has the floor.
—I do not mind a bit. If I have only got 10 minutes, this will go for 20 minutes without any disruption. It is nice to hear this minister trying to be one of the workers! I think he is a long way from being that.
The bill will prevent unions from being able to recruit members, and recruitment is an important part of the exercise. But, as the minister pointed out, workers have a right to say no, they do not want to be a member. That is the way it is. It seems terribly difficult for employers to say, ‘You do not have to be a member.’ What about the pressure that is put on companies by the employer organisations to ensure that they have all of the companies in their organisations to represent them? Are they going to be restricted from entering workplaces? If a union official goes to talk to a worker in the workplace, there is good reason for it. Quite often the worker has said, ‘I want to see you about an issue.’ It could be—

Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—

—Again, Comrade, you point to an instance of where I stopped someone entering a workplace because they were not a member.
 (Senator Cherry)—Senator Buckland, could you address the senator by his appropriate title.
—Yes, I will try to do that. He is so excited over there I thought he was one of those on the shop floor at a mass meeting. Anyway, we will press on. When a person wants to see a representative, it could be about a range of issues. That range of issues could include, as I said before, workers compensation or superannuation. It could be an issue that they have at home that is affecting their attendance at work. It could be a range of things, and it could be something that is private and that they want advice on. They do not want to be hampered by an employer standing around or stopping the representative going to talk to them at a time that is convenient to them. To say, ‘You can only see them in a lunchroom or in a special room that we have set aside,’ is a nonsense. It just shows that this government does not understand what the workplace is all about. How many times do you go to a plant or a workplace where there are shift workers and where there is a continuous process going on? The workers do not actually go to a crib room. They do not have that privilege. They eat at their workplace. They take their lunch or their morning tea break when it fits in with what is going on at work. So if you go and make your right of entry to comply with that and you go to the workplace, some may be working and some can usually stop to talk to you while you are there. It is not a way of disrupting and stopping productivity.
I took note of the comment made earlier by Senator Barnett that this bill will boost productivity. That comes out of fairyland; it is a nonsense. This bill has nothing to do with productivity. All it will do is restrict that ability of unions to carry out their proper and legal business. I find it difficult to understand why this government is trying to erode the rights and freedoms of any people. We fight wars to protect people’s freedoms and rights and to ensure that democracy reigns. I believe in democracy. I believe that we should protect democracy as much as we can, and democracy even goes down to the workplace. But that does not seem to apply to this government. It seems to think that it stops before you get to the worker and that the employer has a democratic right to prevent their employees from being members of associations.
If you look at the great developments that occurred during the late 1980s and 1990s, there were revolutions in industry, there were massive changes to productivity and there were massive changes to workplace structures and to how people went about their work. There was multiskilling and upskilling and cross-skilling of people so that they were not tied to one job; they could do a multitude of things. Workers were allowed for the very first time to take their brains to work. I point out that all that was brought in under a Labor government. That process has been hampered ever since. Those things were brought in so that workers have opportunities to do things. They have the ability to do a lot more than what they are given credit for.
All of those changes during the 1980s and the 1990s—and I was very proud to be involved in much of the restructuring of industry and workplaces—took place because the unions and the companies cooperated. It was not company led; it was not union led. It was a matter of companies and unions assisting each other in the workplace. I will point out, because it is so close to home for me, the now OneSteel plant at Whyalla. Look at the structure they have there. That could never have happened without the involvement of the union. The reason it did happen was that the union was prepared to work with the company and got credit and praise from the company for its actions. That was repeated all over the country. Workers, their unions and companies worked together. In workplaces where they were stifled—where the employer wanted to have the upper hand at all times—progress and development did not happen. Some of those companies are not in existence now.
Other companies came knocking on union doors to see how they could do it. They did not go to their chamber of commerce or their employer organisation; they came to the unions first. They said, ‘We don’t have a unionised workplace. We have only a few people employed. But can you help us make our company more productive and more competitive in the industry?’ And we did it. The unions did not hesitate. They went in there and they helped, taking the role of the employer organisation as well. They do not get any credit for that from this government because this government is too interested in knocking workers on the head.
I am particularly offended by the government’s approach to this bill—one of many that they will seek to introduce and force through the Senate when they get control in July. We come back all the time when we are talking about workers’ rights to the fundamental right they have to freedom of association. In essence, what this bill is going to do is prevent them having the right to freedom of association. That is what is behind all of this: stopping them being union members. If the union cannot freely go and visit their membership in the workplace then the membership will say, ‘We don’t need the union,’ despite the fact that behind the scenes everything is happening because of their actions. This bill will take away a right that is given to every worker. They will fight back eventually and we will have another revolution against the employers and the government for their meanness. The present government will not be there all the time. I look forward to them exiting the treasury bench at the next election.
This is something that is a personal choice of the employee. I agree that if someone says, ‘I don’t want to be a member of the union,’ then that person has made a choice. I have never argued against that. It does not mean that I do not support the idea of bargaining fees applying, because you are doing the work for them anyway. But as I said to the minister earlier, if you can find an instance where that occurred where I was involved you must be looking in the wrong books, because it never occurred. And I would say that I speak for most union officials. That was the way it was.
The bill also seeks to severely and unfairly restrict employees’ access to their representatives in that their representatives will not be able to go down and talk to them at the workplace and find out what the problems are. I was very fortunate as a union official because my branch was, on the whole, in a small area. Everyone knew where I lived. If they could not get to the office, they could come to the house in the evening or I could visit them. But many of our outlying members, such as those in Alice Springs or in Woomera or Roxby Downs, did not have as much access and we would go to them. We could not always say, ‘We’ll be here on Thursday’; we would go when we could. This government does not understand that that is the way things happen.
The other thing is that if we are talking about an agreement to operate in the workplace, and if we are looking at an industrial agreement concerning wages and conditions, we will see there has always been an insistence by the employer and by the commission that the union determine whether its members agree with it. The easiest way to find that out is to call a stop-work meeting and all get outside the gate and have a meeting about it to go through, clause by clause and line by line, the agreement.
I have done that many times. Over a period of two or three hours, union officials and members can go through the agreement so that everyone is clear about what they are voting on and everyone is asked, ‘Do you agree with what we have negotiated?’ If they do, we are all happy. If they do not, we go back and do more work and have another stop-work meeting until agreement is reached, because the employer insists on all of his work force agreeing.
To avoid that, a system of workplace meetings based on the right of entry is used by union officials to go and talk to members and explain what they have been doing. It might mean going to six or eight work sites in a particular plant over a period of the day. It should not always be at lunchtime when they stop for lunch—if they do stop for lunch—but should be when officials can see them on the job. This should not be by invitation but should still be at the convenience of the workers and the union and it should cause least disruption to the workplace so that productivity continues and the goods come out the other end of the factory, unaffected by union involvement. There are good reasons why union officials should continually be going down to see what the problems are. One is so that in drafting, redrafting and negotiating agreements officials will continually have the ear of the worker and understand what they want and the workers will understand why the union is doing what it is doing. Inevitably, what we want does not always come out. We cannot get everything we ask for. That is understood but, if union officials are continually down there talking to their members, they understand what their members really want to have and do in the workplace.
My concern about the idea that union officials would be restricted to visiting work sites to perhaps once every six months—and it might be agreed that they would visit every two months or whatever—is that there is a real danger where workers do not have easy access to the officials, as they did in my branch. If you are in a capital city or a large regional centre, it is often a long way to go at the end of the day to see a union official. The unions, like any other office or business, do not stay open 24 hours a day. I know most union officials see people after hours by going to their house or have them come to the office late at night to try to get that business done. To restrict them to going to a workplace perhaps only once every six months means that members do not have access to the union official. The problems within the business get worse. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (RIGHT OF ENTRY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-05-10,"—I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this debate about the right of entry of union officials to a workplace to represent the interests of their union members. In making this presentation on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004 this afternoon, I want to talk about the right of a union member to seek representation from their union in an industrial sense. The other thing that comes out of that, especially in the human services sector, is the flow-on effect of the benefit of the right of entry to the service that is being provided.
In a former life I was a schoolteacher. I was a very proud and active member of the Queensland Teachers Union. I valued very much the experience that I had in that union. I want to share with the Senate an experience of mine when I was a teacher at a one-teacher school. I contacted my union because of my concern about the workplace environment in which I was teaching. That environment was a very beautiful one, but the construction company that was building a resort, as it was in this case, had a road that went past the school that I was the principal of. It was a coral road, and I was concerned about the dust that was billowing into my school. I was concerned not only for my health and that of my teacher aide but also for the health of the 13 children who lived there. Upon ringing my Queensland Teachers Union organiser, he said that, because of his budget, he would find it hard to justify to the union a trip to Hayman Island where I was the teacher. I said to the organiser: ‘You really do need to come. This is potentially an unsafe environment.’ Fortunately, that union organiser had a background in chemistry. When he finally came, he expressed his concern about the potential carcinogenic effects of the dust from the coral not only on me as a union member but also on the 13 children that I had in my charge. The right of entry for a union organiser not only supports the rights—in this case, the occupational workplace health and safety rights—of a union member but also supports the rights of those in the broader community. For that reason, I will not be supporting this bill, and I urge people on the other side of this chamber to consider its potential effects not only on union members but also on others.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (RIGHT OF ENTRY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2005-05-10,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Right of Entry) Bill 2004 is one of many in a long line of attempts by this government to undermine the rights of workers in Australian workplaces and no doubt take a sledgehammer to the trade union movement. It specifically relates to the rights of entry for trade union officials in workplaces to conduct what is not only rightfully their business under the Workplace Relations Act but also rightfully their business under international law and having regard to the rights of workers around the world.
As a former union official I can say with absolute certainty and knowledge that the ability to access your members or even potential members and to quickly respond to their requests is a vital function of the union, and the right of entry is a necessary key to undertake this role. Workers who are experiencing problems and difficulties in their workplace come to rely on this fact and come to know with some confidence that you will be able to enter their workplace and seek to talk either to them or to their fellow workers and respond to their requests as soon as possible without the restrictions that this bill attempts to put in place. If you are not able to access those members or those potential members then the capacity to recruit, represent or just be there to deal with the concerns of members in a timely manner is severely limited. This has a tremendous impact on the capacity of unions to represent their members. But of course that is what this government wants—to limit the effectiveness of the trade union movement in this country.
It has always been patently clear that the Howard government have real problems with the concept of unions insofar as Australian workers go. They do not like them. They want to try to blame unions for everything that is wrong in the Australian economy, and they do not like any united or collective voice that might criticise their mindless, unrealistically ideologically driven policies. This is another malicious attack on Australian workers by the Howard government—no doubt one of many to come in this country in the following months. It is not surprising that Labor will be opposing this bill.
The right of entry is about the rights and responsibilities of both sides: the right of entry needs of the worker and also the needs of the employer. The rules need to truly represent a balance which is fair to both sides. This bill does not meet those requirements—far from it. It is extremely skewed to represent the interests of the employers. But this is a government that is devoid of any original workplace relations policy. It has to rely on the work of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry or the Business Council of Australia to push its industrial relations agenda in this parliament. It does not provide a balanced framework which would support fair and effective agreement making. It does not ensure freedom of association. Instead, this bill seeks to severely and unfairly restrict employees’ access to their representatives. It infringes on the rights of individual employees to decide to collectively bargain with other employees.
I am a member of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. We had a hearing into this bill in Canberra, in which we took evidence from a whole range of representatives from both the employer side and the trade union movement. We tabled a report in our last sittings. During the Senate committee hearing on this matter, the President of the ACTU, Ms Sharan Burrow, said:
As a member of the ILO governing body, I can assure you that the cases I watch and participate in ... in terms of breach of freedom of association and the capacity to organise, would absolutely provide a similar context into which this bill would fit. Fundamental rights under ILO convention 87 and its capacity to support ILO convention 98 would be breached by the nature of this bill.
Ms Burrow went on to say that, by its nature, this bill ‘absolutely fetters’ the right of employees to access union support, advice and information about a wide range of matters relevant to employees. Furthermore, she said that, as the bill will make access to union officials more difficult—and make it a potentially very lengthy and unnecessarily complicated process, I believe—many matters which are now able to be solved quickly will develop into much larger disputes.
I would like to summarise, albeit briefly, the background to the right of entry legislation that is before us today. It was first included in the Industrial Relations Act 1988, when an officer of an organisation was allowed to inspect premises to ensure observance of awards or an order of the commission. That officer could be obliged to provide evidence of his or her authority to do so. Access to premises was during work hours only and subject to conditions contained within the award itself. This provision was amended in 1996 under the Workplace Relations Act, which started to restrict the rights of access to investigate only suspected breaches of awards or agreements—not just general compliance, as was previously the case. The 1996 act abolished the award based right of entry provision, further restricted the timing of any meetings to break times only and introduced the requirement that 24 hours notice of the intention of the trade union official to enter the premises be given to the employer. Of course, many will know that the trade union officials were forced to go to the commission to get a right of entry permit.
Right of entry has been considered by Senate committees on a number of occasions since 1996. For instance, in 2000 the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills concluded on entry and search provisions that there was no evidence suggesting that unions should not have a right to enter. I was a member of the committee at that time. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee further found that there was a voluntary code which had been developed between employers and employees and that it would in fact have been a more appropriate way to go if this code were to have been subject to some formal agreement between the ACCI and the ACTU rather than amending further legislation.
The bill now being debated further and severely restricts the right of entry by union officials and officers, introducing a raft of more stringent criteria before an officer can be deemed a fit and proper person to be granted an entry permit. It also expands the grounds on which permits can be revoked or suspended. For these, among other reasons, the Labor Party believes this bill is far from a balanced approach to right of entry. Indeed, we can only wonder how any fair-minded person could even attempt to justify the bill as balanced.
As well as requiring employees to put in a request for a union officer to visit, their reason and identity must be stated openly. This bill will leave such an employee open to harassment and retribution and make reporting of complaints less likely. It will leave employers able to get away with breaches of agreements and awards and ignore workplace bullying and occupational health and safety problems in the workplace. During the committee hearing, the ACTU stated:
Finally, there is a real issue about the creation of a workplace based on fear and intimidation and potential invasion of privacy. For an employee who might already be concerned about the security of their employment, who might not have the confidence to actually approach the CEO or the appropriate human resources or industrial relations manager about an issue concerning them to have to put their name potentially to a request for an investigation … or simply to be seen by the employer to approach the union … is something we would be very concerned about.
That in itself will limit employees’ rights of access to their representative, even without the other measures which will be imposed—for example, an employer having the right to determine the location for a meeting and the route to be taken in order to get to that meeting. These are extreme measures that are unnecessary and unwarranted in this day and age.
During the hearing we heard of one instance, from the financial services union, where a major bank in Melbourne—in abuse even of existing law—was able to drag out the time between an initial request for access to a trade union official to investigate a problem and the union official actually getting there to 18 months. It did this by saying that interviews with employees, which should have been confidential, had to take place in a room open to other common use. Let there be absolutely no doubt: this bill will severely impact on employee access to their representatives and vice versa. It will also severely limit the opportunity for unions to recruit. It will severely weaken the rights of both workers and unions, but this is what the Howard government has always dreamed of, wished for and now planned for.
Because of the nature of our industrial relations system, the unions are the only real, properly resourced bodies to enforce mechanisms for awards and agreements. We all know that, under this government, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations have had their ability to enforce mechanisms for awards and pay conditions taken right away from them, out of their hands. The Howard government have, lo and behold, hacked away at this ability. They are determined to move Australian workers towards the conditions of our Asian competitors—working in sweatshop conditions with minimal rights of protest or action. But, of course, they will sell this as being in the national interest. This morning, I heard people on the government side saying that this measure would lead to improved productivity and keep us globally competitive. Smash the trade union movement, smash the rights of workers to access international rights and conventions, and that will make us globally competitive!
During the committee hearing, the highly experienced Ms Burrow was asked if she had any reports of problems on right of entry from peak employer organisations. She had this to say:
Prior to the discussion at the workplace relations consultative committee with the minister where it was in fact raised by us, I cannot recall an incident where a peak body has actually raised an issue with me.
If it is of such concern to the employer groups in this country, why hasn’t it been raised with the ACTU? Why is it not an issue that is foremost in the mind of a peak trade union body like the ACTU? It is because no-one has actually picked up the phone and said that it is an issue. We heard evidence during the Senate committee hearing about that very fact. In fact, all the submissions made to the committee lacked any substantial evidence of systemic misuse of the rights of entry. Figures provided by the ACTU show that only 15 cases have occurred since 2000. The ACTU have examples of being called by employers to come in and help solve problems—again showing that informal, voluntary codes of conduct have been perfectly adequate.
I can see no evidence of the need for this bill. There was no evidence put before us during the committee hearing that showed that there is any need for this bill. It does not address, in a fair way, the right of entry provisions. There can be no doubt that this bill is being put forward by the Howard government as an ongoing part of its blinkered, ideological, confrontational approach to trade unions.
I will now turn to the report produced by the committee in order to further emphasise this point. Even the government senators on the committee had some sympathy for concerns about various aspects of the bill which were raised during the public hearing. These concerns were mainly about the imprecise terminology used in several clauses. I refer, for example, to clauses 280F, 280J and 280M of the bill, which cover, respectively, when permits are not to be issued, orders by the commission for abuse of the system, and the use of right of entry to investigate suspected breaches of awards. A majority of committee members accepted the view that a number of terms covered by these provisions appear to be neither properly thought out nor defined with due regard to how they might conflict with other areas of the law.
Notwithstanding the government’s stated objectives, opposition senators are concerned that the intention and practical effect of this bill will make it harder for employees to join a union and participate in legitimate union activities. Evidence given in written submissions and at the public hearing demonstrated that the bill places unreasonable impediments to the rights of trade union officials by further restricting the grounds for entry, the number of workplaces that can be visited, the locations of meeting places, and the route that a union official can take to access a meeting place. Opposition senators agreed with the assessment of the Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union that the provisions of the bill—and I quote:
... establish a kind of labyrinthine structure of bureaucracy and regulation to undermine the capacity of a union to simply speak to his or her members or potential members, and vice versa.
The claim made by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Andrews, and DEWR, that the bill strikes a balance between the rights of unions and the rights of employers, does not wash with the trade union movement, with most workers in this country, and certainly not with opposition senators. Evidence before the committee from various unions demonstrated that the relatively uniform state right of entry laws work effectively and have done so for some time. This was acknowledged by government senators at the public hearing.
The government’s so-called policy justification for the bill amounts to unfounded paranoia about fictitious unions flouting the law and exploiting, or potentially exploiting, vulnerable employers by pressuring and harassing employees at their workplaces. Apart from isolated cases in one or two industries, there is absolutely no evidence to back up this proposition.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-10,"—My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, and it concerns recent findings by Justice Paul Finn of the Federal Court. Is the minister aware of the court’s recent finding that the treatment of two detainees was negligent and that for one of them it amounted to ‘culpable neglect’? Minister, why is it that both detainees spent 12 months and 21 months respectively without seeing a psychiatrist? Why didn’t they receive help or treatment earlier? Is the minister satisfied with her own running of a detention system which puts detainees at serious risk of becoming mentally ill, as the Federal Court has found?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Treatment of Detainees</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-10,"—I ask a supplementary question, Mr President. I thank the minister for her response. However, we are talking about the Federal Court case and I think the minister is going to take that part on notice. Can the minister inform the Senate as to why her department has spent more than $13,000 in eight court hearings defending the denial of proper psychiatric care to another detainee? That is what the minister needs to be able to provide. Why do we now have the situation where detainees suffering from mental illness need to go to court to try to get proper medical treatment? Minister, how many more tales of suffering do we have to hear before you will admit you were wrong, that there is a need for a royal commission and that you will call for one?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Treatment of Detainees</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-05-10,"—Yes, I am aware of the decision to which you refer. In relation to the detail of that case, I will take it on notice. You do invite me to comment on whether I am satisfied with the detention system, which you assert—roughly using the senator’s words, Mr President—‘puts patients at serious risk of mental illness’. I am not prepared to come to that conclusion, but I am prepared to say that I think we can do better—we can do much better. I would not get too excited about that. For Senator Ludwig’s benefit, my basic approach to life is that everyone can do better. But it is clear, to me at least, that in relation to care we can do better. I am in the process of ascertaining what precisely we can do in the short term.
The senator will be aware that there are a number of things that were changed in the department as a consequence of the Rau matter. I indicated at the time of making those changes that the department were happy, willing and desperate to be looking for more changes to see what we could do to make these exceptional cases not fall through the cracks, as they have apparently done. The department have not stopped there. I have made sure of that. I have asked them to come up with further things and see what else they can do to make sure these things do not happen again.
To put it in perspective, Mr President, because I think that is fair, over the period we are looking at, which is roughly a three-year period, I have received advice that there are a number of cases of people who were detained and who were subsequently found to be lawful. It would be a mistake to assume that all of those cases were people who had been lawful all along. That category refers—for Senator Ludwig’s benefit, because I know he has a genuine interest in this—to people who may not have been able to identify themselves at the time but whose identity we were subsequently able to get and who were then released. That would mean that they were lawfully detained at the time because a reasonable suspicion was held that they were an unlawful noncitizen. But within a relatively short period of time that suspicion, having been checked, was cleared and removed and the person was released. One cannot infer that, because a number of cases have been referred to Mr Palmer, they are all cases of people who should not in the first instance have been detained.
I might indicate to you, Mr President, that some people might be detained for a number of hours—for example, in a raid late at night—and released early the next day. That would show as a day in detention, because that is done on a daily basis. Some people will have been detained for longer periods than that, some will have become lawful while they were in detention and some will have been lawful in the very beginning but have presented identification problems. Ms Rau is a classic example of that: someone who gives another name. The expectation is that somehow the department can easily find someone who gives us another name. That is of course the case with Ms Alvarez.
The short answer is that I think the department do an excellent job. We are talking about 0.2 per cent of the cases. Nonetheless, it is not satisfactory and we can do a better job and we should. (Time expired)

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-05-10,"—I remind the senator that his question did go specifically to one case, but he did add a general question at the end and that is the question that I answered. As he rightly indicated, I said I would take it on notice. In relation to the case he refers to, I will come back with a detailed answer as to the reason the department defended the particular matter. It may not be fairly categorised as Senator Ludwig chose to categorise it. I am not going to agree with that, but I will come back to him with an answer with respect to that.
The immigration area is a very litigious area. The senator will understand that many people have tried continuous litigation as a means of hoping, I think against all hope, that the department would simply give up. The department and the government are certainly determined to ensure that people are offered appropriate health care. There have been some examples that have been unsatisfactory.

Will the minister provide the Senate with an update on the deployment of Australian Defence Force troops to southern Iraq as part of the Al Muthanna Task Group?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2005-05-10,"—I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that the first main body of Australian Defence Force troops that make up the Al Muthanna Task Group has arrived in southern Iraq and has commenced operations in the Al Muthanna province. The balance of the force will be joining them in the near future.
I can also inform the Senate that I recently met the governor of Al Muthanna, Mohammed Al Hassani, and reinforced to him the fact that Australian forces are there in his province to assist the people of Iraq, particularly in helping to train Iraqi armed forces and ensuring the security environment within which the Japanese Self Defence Force can continue their important humanitarian work.
The job of training the Al Muthanna provincial security force is an important contribution to help prepare Iraq to take on the task of providing its own security in the future. The governor indicated to me that the Australian forces were welcome, and that certainly seems to also be the early response of the Iraqi people from within the province.
It is also encouraging to note the further progress being made in the formation of the new Iraqi government, the transitional government. The Iraqi constitutional assembly has now approved the cabinet, which includes representatives of the key ethnic and community groupings, including those who boycotted the elections. A willingness to be inclusive is going to be very important in building public confidence in a very fragile environment.
During a meeting with the Iraqi Prime Minister, Ibrahim al-Jafari, I passed on the Australian government’s congratulations on the formation of the new government and restated the Australian government’s commitment to help build a peaceful and democratic Iraq. The Prime Minister, in turn, indicated to me how much he valued Australia’s role in providing training to help the Iraqi people take responsibility for their own security.
Unfortunately, Iraq remains a dangerous and violent place, as witnessed by the kidnapping of the Australian Douglas Wood. It has distressed us all, but for his family, in particular, it is clearly a terrible experience. The government, through all possible avenues, continues intense efforts to achieve his safe recovery. We pray that his kidnappers will exercise compassion and release him.
In this difficult environment, Australian forces continue to perform superbly in providing medical aid, in the training of a new security force, in supporting the new ministries, in providing security for our diplomats and in so many other ways.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-05-10,"—I wish to add briefly to an answer that I gave today to a question from Senator Jacinta Collins. I had not been focusing on the time and therefore did not get to make the point concisely. In relation to Ms Alvarez, there have been media reports that she was removed within three days of coming to Immigration’s attention. The answer is more like 3½ months to four months, as I indicated to Senator Collins. She first came to Immigration’s attention in early April. As I am advised, she was first interviewed in early May. She was then on a number of bridging visas and was in fact removed towards late July. That is a very long way from three days. That may give senators opposite and senators on this side of the chamber some indication of how careful they have to be about relying on media reports.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,7,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-05-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked by Senators Bishop and Forshaw today relating to road works at ANZAC Cove, Gallipoli.
Predictably, the minister’s answers to the questions concerning the construction of the new road at Anzac Cove were inadequate; in fact, they are probably best described as waffle, all things being considered. That is understandable, as these are not questions the government wishes to respond to meaningfully in any way at all. What we have seen in this debate is the Prime Minister at his evasive best. What is crystal clear is that neither the government nor the Prime Minister had any idea as to what has been happening at Gallipoli for some time.
What the Prime Minister expected was a 90th anniversary commemoration of the 1915 landing, starring him. What he received was a stormy controversy about the destruction of Anzac Cove by roadworks which his minister had sought by letter. First, he proudly accepted responsibility through the confession of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Now the Prime Minister has sought to evade responsibility by denying that the letter to the Turks requested any such thing. He must have been reading a different letter to the one that was released on 22 April. That letter quite specifically asked the government of Turkey—under cover of diplomatic note, as I understand it—to fix the road at Anzac Cove. Specifically, the letter and the attachment seek improved bus turnaround facilities. Further, such facilities, as we now know, were designed to improve VIP access. It is there in black and white in the correspondence released.
The request by the Howard government to destroy Anzac Cove is undeniable. Neither can the Prime Minister or his hapless Minister for Veterans’ Affairs deny that they had any knowledge of this sequence of events. The minister has read to me excerpts from a detailed briefing he has been given, presumably via the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, on this matter. That brief, from the director of the Office of Australian War Graves, clearly set out the problems being encountered with the roadworks sought. The need to construct a rock retaining wall to prevent further erosion of the cliff face was a key issue identified by the minister in her letter written to the Turkish government and pursued by our government. Yet it is with respect to that rock wall that the Prime Minister has requested that construction cease. The Prime Minister and those briefing him seem to be completely ignorant of the fact that the Office of Australian War Graves has been consulting with the Turks on this exact and particular issue for a long time—indeed, over many years. The government not only requested this work but has had full knowledge of the detail of it from the very beginning until the present time.
The result, as we know and as has been reported by the press, is one that can only be described as disastrous. What we have as a direct result of the Australian government’s urging is the complete destruction of significant portions of Anzac Cove. The cliff faces scaled by the Anzacs in the dark of 25 April 1915 have been bulldozed into oblivion; they are now sheer. The beach across which they ran and died has been covered with spoil and because of erosion will continue to be covered by spoil. The sites of valuable headquarters no longer exist. The Prime Minister cannot wriggle his way out of this mess that he has been responsible for creating. No matter what spin is tried, the government remains culpable in this matter. The Prime Minister tried to throw money at this issue to solve the problem—in his typical fashion—but it is too late. The damage has been done and that cannot be changed in the future.
Moreover, it is not unfair to say that arising out of this the government has a diplomatic incident on its hands. Not only has the Prime Minister seriously breached diplomatic protocol in releasing the letter of August 2004 as part of his desperate bid for self-preservation; he has also had the gall to blame the Turks for his own mistake. The Turkish Ambassador to Australia has properly directly repudiated this claim in the press. One asks the obvious question: is it any wonder that the Turks have refused his heritage listing proposal and the Prime Minister’s bid for them to cease work on the rock wall? Is that any surprise at all? Sadly, and more importantly for the future, they might also ignore the Prime Minister’s other request and proceed with the new road from Lone Pine to Chunuk Bair. In those circumstances, we have a very serious problem indeed. (Time expired)

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-05-10,"—What a disgraceful display of politicking about a sacred time and a sacred place in our nation’s history! I recently had the honour and privilege of attending the 90th anniversary celebrations at Anzac Cove as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. I say that it was an honour and a privilege, and I know that those feelings are shared by many other colleagues from this place and the other place who also attended. I want to say to you, Mr Deputy President, and to honourable senators here and listening elsewhere that nowhere in Turkey—nowhere at Anzac Cove and nowhere at Gallipoli—did we pick up any of the political static that those senators opposite are perpetrating within the Australian community.
We just heard Senator Bishop talking about diplomatic issues that have arisen and which he says are to Australia’s detriment. I spoke to hundreds of Turks who regard Australians as the closest of friends politically, socially and economically. At no time during any of those discussions did any of them talk about the diplomatic issues and incidents that the senator opposite has talked about and which other senators opposite have alluded to during question time. Our diplomatic and political position in relation to Turkey is unchallenged and unquestioned by the Turks themselves. Let me also list the others with whom I and many of my other colleagues spoke. We spoke to the labourers; we spoke to the transport people that carried us to Anzac Cove in buses; we spoke to the porters; and we spoke to many other people of Turkish birth and Turkish nationality who work at, around and in relation to Anzac Cove. Not one of them was able to tell us from their knowledge, their insights or their permanent residency in Turkey that they had heard of, seen or had any evidence that suggested that war graves had been disturbed or that any were going to be disturbed.
I will tell you what else I saw there. I saw thousands and thousands of Australians, mainly young Australians, who were able to make their way in their thousands, to that sacred piece of Australian soil at Anzac Cove in far greater comfort and with far greater ease than people previously had been able to enjoy. The claim by the senator opposite about the Prime Minister wanting to create a facility to accommodate VIPs is just an outright untruth. That road—the construction of which I totally support as a result of first-hand experience from only a week or so ago—caters for all Australians who want to get closer to their history, to their heritage and to the spirit that spawned this nation. That is what we are all about in this debate. To hear senators opposite belittle the sanctity of the 90th anniversary celebrations—
—That is what Minister Kelly requested—the term was ‘official vehicles’.
—Senator Bishop, you were heard in silence. Give Senator Santoro the same respect.
—I know why they are objecting: it is because they know that they have been caught out, because only a week ago we were there and were able to repudiate through first-hand knowledge, first-hand inquiries and first-hand witnesses the arguments that have been put forward by those opposite. That road is not a road for VIPs; it is a road for all Australians—present and future—who want to access a sacred Australian site and pay respect to the memory and the sacrifice of the Australians buried there, Australians who made it possible for people like us to stand in a place like this as free citizens exercising and enjoying our democracy. I cannot understand how senators opposite have lost the plot in such a comprehensive way and in such an unpatriotic manner. I suggest that next year they should go over to Anzac Cove like thousands of other Australians and make their own direct inquiries. They will be inspired. (Time expired)

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2005-05-10,"—It was once said that patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. We have just seen a perfect example of that. For Senator Santoro to stand up here and accuse us of belittling the Anzac heritage and memory is a disgrace. Senator Santoro has supposedly just given us the benefit of his on-site research because he was there.
—I am going to talk a lot more about it.
—Actually, Senator Santoro, I would prefer to take the word of Senator Bishop on this. There is a very good reason why: last year Senator Bishop and I were in attendance at the Anzac ceremonies in Gallipoli. Senator Hill was there too. This year, Senator Bishop was back there and, as such, has had the first-hand experience of seeing what the situation was prior to the roadworks at Anzac Cove being undertaken and seeing the impact since. On this score, I think Senator Bishop talks with far greater experience than you do, Senator Santoro.
Gallipoli is a very special place. We know that. That is why thousands and thousands of Australians go there in increasing numbers each year. As I said, I had the great benefit and privilege of being there last year and participating in the ceremonies. It was estimated that 15,000 people attended last year, despite warnings from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that, due to terrorism concerns, Australians should not attend. This year, it was reported that there were over 20,000 in attendance at the 90th anniversary.
As we all know, Gallipoli is not Australian land, despite what Senator Santoro said a moment ago. He seems to have forgotten that fundamental fact. It is Turkish land. However, the memory of that conflict is as important to the Turkish people and to the Turkish government as it is to the Australian public and the Australian government, and has been since 1915. That is why there has always been this close relationship and spirit of cooperation between Australia and Turkey in looking after that site and in sitting down and looking at what improvements and maintenance need to be done, particularly in those parts of the Gallipoli peninsula which are so special for the Anzac tradition and for the tradition of other nations who fought there.
It has been kept as a park. The Turkish government honoured Australia and honoured the memory of our soldiers who fought and died there by naming the beach Anzac Cove. We are all aware of the pressures that occur on the entire peninsula, but particularly at Anzac Cove, on Anzac Day—we are all aware of that—with the increasing numbers and the difficulties of access. But the problem with this situation is that the government, having made a request to the Turkish government to undertake roadworks and other works in that area, then dropped the ball. The then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Mrs Vale—who is fortunately no longer the minister—basically stuffed this up. She made the request on behalf of the Australian government. Apparently that request was unbeknown to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time. Then there was a failure to oversee and report in full.
We do know that briefings were given to various ministers on the roadworks that were being undertaken, but along the line nobody was focusing on what was really happening. Those of us who were not there this year have seen the photos and the coverage. Those of you who were there, like Senator Bishop, Mr Beazley and others, have seen first hand the destruction that occurred. It is an incredible tragedy. It is a terrible disaster, really, to have seen that happen. What is even worse is that today Minister Hill stood up and essentially repeated the line of the Prime Minister, which was to say, ‘It’s really the responsibility of the Turks.’ Somehow it was their fault. But it was not their fault.
—I didn’t say it was their fault.
—You said it was the responsibility of the Turks—that somehow we had no influence. The Prime Minister basically put the blame for this on the Turkish government, and it is totally inappropriate. (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2005-05-10,"—It is a great privilege to stand here and respond to the grubby accusations made by the senators opposite, because I had the immense honour and privilege of attending the Anzac dawn service at Gallipoli and spending several days there around Anzac Day this year. It was at that dawn service that young people wept and mourned their personal loss. You anticipate this emotion when you go to Gallipoli—it was the first time for me—but it still hits you like a thunderbolt when you are there. That is what happened to me and indeed to many thousands of other Australians—predominantly young Australians. You simply cannot visit Gallipoli without being gripped by this loss, but you are also gripped by a pride in your Australian heritage.
I start by saying that because I believe the opposition’s tactics today are going to be seen for what they are: grubby political tactics to gain a media headline. It is a cheap political shot. It is undeserved. You are trying to gain a media headline, and it is demeaning to your position in the Senate. Senator Forshaw should know better. He has been to Anzac Cove.
Senator Santoro, Mrs Bishop, Mark Baker MHR and Stewart McArthur MHR were there, as were members of the Labor Party, who I will mention because they were there: Harry Quick, Kim Beazley, Senator Mark Bishop and Senator Chris Evans. Of course the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. John Howard, was there. How proud I felt to be not only an Australian but a part of Mr Howard’s government at that Anzac Day commemorative service.
—We all know this—get on with the real issues.
—This is the real issue. This is the crux of it: you are making a cheap political shot. You are undermining the work of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. I want to commend the department for the work they did. This is a logistical nightmare. You know it, because you have been there, Senator Forshaw. This year we had record crowds again. I want to comment on that. The increasing relevance and resilience of Anzac Day has brought with it record attendances at commemorative services both here in Australia and at Gallipoli. It has also brought challenges and problems—of course it has. Gaining access, catering and caring for a growing number of visitors in a Turkish national park is not easy. Members opposite are trying to gain media attention on this issue. That is what you have done in recent weeks, and now you are doing it again, to no avail.
An estimated 20,000 patriotic, passionate Australians attended the 90-year anniversary. In my view they have been sadly misrepresented by people in the media and by people on the other side of the Senate chamber, because the overwhelming majority of those people travelled over 14,000 kilometres at their own expense and in their own time. They made this investment because they want to show respect and honour for their forebears and for those Anzacs. They were motivated to do that because they love Australia and they love the qualities demonstrated by our Anzac diggers. What is happening today is a cheap political shot.
I want to speak about the Turkish government. I want to commend them and thank them, because this is an Australian event, an Anzac event, happening on foreign soil. How gracious of our Turkish hosts to work with the Australian government, the New Zealand government and the other countries involved in hosting such an event. I want to pay tribute to them, because I cannot conceive of an occasion when the Japanese would be doing this on US soil—or the Germans in London. That is inconceivable to me.
I also want to acknowledge President Ataturk. He was involved in the Anzac battle and was successful. He became the President of Turkey, and he was the one who said that the Gallipoli peninsula is now the home of the Australian, New Zealand and allied men who died and that they are now in the bosom of Turkey. He said to the mothers of the Anzac diggers, ‘Do not be saddened.’ (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-05-10,"—It is regrettable that the government speakers today want to turn this debate into a contest about who is the most patriotic and try to avoid the real issues about the vandalism that is taking place over in Gallipoli at the moment. It is well known that 8,709 Australians were killed at the Gallipoli site. It is well known that 4,223 Australians were never recovered from the Gallipoli site. It is also well known that there are more unrecovered bodies at the Gallipoli site than there are bodies buried there. These are important facts to Australians, and these facts should be well known by the government. They should be well aware of these facts. But when we asked the government, in question time today, when we would see a properly considered plan for the protection of the heritage of Gallipoli and when the government would put a halt to the vandalism of the road building, what did we get in answer? We got hypotheticals. We got a hypothetical proposition about an accident involving a bus and an elderly person who was injured or killed, and we were asked what we would say about that. It completely avoids the responsibility that this government have to ensure that this site which is very sacred to all Australians is properly protected and monitored.
We then got the accusation that we were having a cheap shot, as if we wanted to make some political gain out of this. This is something the government seeks to hide behind. Accusations about hypothetical accidents and cheap shots do not say anything about the competence of this government. They do not in any way defend the competence of this government. Their actions throughout this very sorry tale have simply been those of incompetence and misrepresentation.
Senator Hill told us how difficult it is to construct a road over there. I probably accept that. I do not know how difficult it might be. But that does not mean that it is impossible to construct a road, having due regard to the burial ground and the sacred nature of Anzac Cove and Gallipoli. He told us that there is a great deal of effort going into this—but obviously not enough. He made the very firm statement, which this government likes to rely upon, that this government will not apologise for what has happened over there. We are all owed an apology for this incompetence, and the minister should apologise.
Then we saw, in defence of this proposition, Senator Santoro wrapping himself in the flag—as if that is a defence of the vandalism that is taking place over in Gallipoli, with this government’s consent, with the road building. He wants to avoid the whole issue of competence and responsibility and talk about who is more patriotic than anyone else. That is not the issue, because the opposition are just as patriotic about what happened at Gallipoli. We care about it just as much as they do, and I do not want to cheapen this debate by trying to say that we care more than they do. It is something that all Australians care very deeply about. There is no dignity in this government trying to lower this very important debate, which is a public issue, by trying to wrap themselves in the flag as if that is some sort of defence of the incompetence that is going on at Gallipoli.
Let us look at the sequence of events as they have unfolded. After listening to Senator Barnett and Senator Santoro, I do not think that they could have read a newspaper and followed this issue at all. I do not understand why they were asked to get up and defend the government’s position—or maybe their ignorance is the reason why they were asked. The Howard government asked the Turkish government in August 2004 for the extensive roadworks at Anzac Cove to be carried out in time for the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing. I do not think that is disputed by anyone. Dr David Cameron, an Australian archaeologist from Sydney University, found human remains in early 2003 at the site where the roadworks were to be done. Dr Cameron told the Office of Australian War Graves and the Australian Ambassador to Turkey what he had found. He also briefed Environment Australia before he began his archaeological survey. In April 2003, Dr Cameron reported directly, and in detail, to Air Vice Marshal Gary Beck, the head of the Office of Australian War Graves. Dr Cameron gave Air Vice Marshal Beck photos of a human thighbone and other wartime artefacts that he had found at Anzac Cove. The Turkish government began work at Anzac Cove, following the request from the Australian government. Dr Cameron emailed Air Vice Marshal Beck on 13 March this year, reminding him of their discussion two years ago. Dr Cameron says that he was condescendingly dismissed. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-10,"—The matters I raise go to the hours of sitting and the available hours that we have. Today we have heard a motion to vary the hours of sitting, which is one of those areas where it is usual for discussion to take place between the government, the opposition and minor parties about how these matters are progressed. In the past, there has been reasonable discourse, discussion and consultation between the managers of business about both the hours and other matters that surround the hours and the use of the available time within the Senate. I would like to take a couple of moments now to set down a few issues that I think are important to ensure that there is management within this chamber to allow what will be quite a compressed period as we run up to 1 July. There are two weeks effectively remaining. We have Senate estimates, and then we go into the last two weeks before the end of the winter sittings.
I must say that there is usually more consultation leading up to these three days than I have experienced so far. One example is the condolence motions that we have here today. Of course Labor were aware that there would be a need for a condolence motion for Mr Grassby, for instance. We were aware that there were probably other matters such as the Sea King tragedy that should be reported or at least dealt with in this house. There was also the death of His Holiness. If you go back to precedent, that also looks like a matter that is dealt with by condolence motion. Having looked at those, we contacted the government about how we might proceed.
For whatever reason, and I do not really want to put blame here, it took quite a long time—I suspect right up to some time this morning—for the government to finalise its position. We also did not have a red. We had a draft red, but even then it was quite late in the process, for whatever reason. We finally had a red that we could follow to understand the position that the government had adopted in relation to the work but, for whatever reason, that was still quite late in the process.
We think that there are lessons to be learnt from this. If we are going to utilise the last two weeks of the sitting pattern in winter to deal with legislation, then we have to talk a little bit more and a little bit earlier as well about how we are going to manage the time. The condolence motions are one example. If they could have been discussed a little bit earlier, we would have made a number of other suggestions about how to deal with them in order to ensure that time management could be applied whilst ensuring that everyone could still deal with the issues they wanted to deal with. At the moment, not only do we have me speaking now for five minutes but also the government is eating up government time in dealing with condolences which would otherwise be spent in dealing with legislation. I understand that it is budget night, but we still can consider legislation or utilise government time. Instead, we are dealing with condolence motions. I do not have a problem with that if that is the government’s wish. The issue will come in the next two weeks when we will also have valedictories to deal with—quite a number, I suspect—which will also need to be time managed, so we will need to discuss those.
The condolence motions that have been put today could have been put in alternative ways to utilise time that was otherwise not government time. That would have been our preference. It is not the case that we are disappointed that this is the way the government want to deal with them. If the government want to eat up government time, that is a matter for them, really. Some of these issues could have been dealt with in an adjournment debate. There might have been ways to ensure that everyone who wanted to had an opportunity to deal with them. But that was not to be.
We need to look at how we are going to program the government legislation, valedictories and any condolence motions that come forward. There are usually side winds that turn up to take valuable time in the last two weeks. If the government decide not to engage and consult now when they do not have the numbers, my concern is that post 1 July they will act like an arrogant government and not consult. That will invariably eat up government time. Maybe I am giving them a warning that they do not need. But all they have done by managing the business in this way is eat up government time.
Notwithstanding all that, the other issue is the precedent that might be set by dealing with motions in this way—particularly condolence motions. My examination of the record indicates that this is not the way this place would normally deal with condolence motions, so there is a precedent being set here by these condolence motions. They will obviously be set down as markers for the future. Notwithstanding that, it seems to be the government’s will to deal with them in this way. So be it.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2005-05-10,"—In the absence of the Manager of Government Business, I will very briefly respond to remind the Senate that this is a very consultative government. We seek to cooperate with the opposition party and the other parties in the Senate, firstly, because it is the right thing to do and, secondly, because it saves time in the long run. The only issue that is a little out of the norm here is the decision to move the condolence motion in relation to the late Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in the condolence section rather than perhaps in the general business section or alternatively in the adjournment debate. That is justified in the circumstance of his very close relationship, through his wife, with the Senate and by the fact that a like decision was taken in the House of Representatives and we would not have wished there to be any misinterpretation. That is why we made that decision. That the program for the day was settled somewhat late is always to be regretted but it is quite often the case on a first day back and when we seek to work in close liaison with the other house.
Looking at the number of opposition members who are retiring, we will be asked a little later in the session to help the opposition with some government time in relation to valedictories. In a spirit of cooperation, we would want to do that. That does require a bit of give and take on both sides. I note what Senator Ludwig has said; I take it in a spirit of goodwill.

Here we have a recollection of and a memoriam to the possibly more than 50 million people who died in extraordinary circumstances from which the world has not learnt. I am aghast that the world is still divided and is spending more on arms than it ever has before and that the tragic loss of so many millions in the last century—some 200 million people—to wars has still not been learnt from. We must honour those lives that were lost because of human disputes not being settled in a better way. We must also honour those people who survived—no-one returns from war uninjured. We must honour the service they gave to great ideals and indeed to this country. The matter ought not be submerged on a day like this by other immediate matters.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2005-05-10,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate notes the death on 2 April 2005 of His Holiness Pope John Paul II and expresses its profound regret at his passing.
The unprecedented outpouring of grief at the passing of Pope John Paul II stands as testament to his impact on many millions of people around the globe. In many ways, Pope John Paul II was the first entirely modern pope. It is said that his extensive travel meant that he was seen in person by more people than any other human being in history. This, plus his command of the modern media, made him one of the most widely recognised figures of the 20th century.
All people of goodwill, whether Catholic or not, will recognise Karol Wojtyla as a tireless advocate for world peace. In troubled times the world needs peacemakers. There is no doubt that John Paul was such a person. As a young man in Poland he witnessed first hand the ravages of Nazism and Communism. It was probably for his role in the downfall of the latter evil that he will most obviously be remembered. It was John Paul’s instinctive support for the cause of freedom embodied by Lech Walesa and the Solidarity movement which was instrumental in the downfall of Communism in Poland. This set off waves that were felt across Europe.
In later years and at great personal risk during the height of the Balkans war he visited Sarajevo, with its divided orthodox and Muslim communities. In February 2000 he reached out to Jews and Muslims with a hugely important visit to the Holy Land. In days following the September 11 terrorist attacks, he again ignored concerns for his safety by travelling to Kazakhstan.
There is no doubt that Pope John Paul II was a controversial figure to many. But, whatever judgments people may make about individual positions taken by the Pope, few could fail to acknowledge the grandeur of his life story, the courage of his convictions, the strength and humility of his personality and the compassion of his ministry. All people of goodwill will be saddened by the passing of a man who was one of the giants of the 20th century. I commend the motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>His Holiness Pope John Paul II</title>,CONDOLENCES,13,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-10,"—On behalf of the opposition I support the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill following the death of Pope John Paul II. John Paul was loved by millions of Catholics around the world and here in Australia. His loss was felt deeply by many and his contribution to the Catholic Church will continue to bear fruit in the years to come. I would also like to welcome the election of Pope Benedict XVI, formerly Joseph, Cardinal Ratzinger of Germany. I am sure he will continue the good work done by his predecessor and set his own mark on the life of the Catholic Church.
John Paul II was born in 1920 in Wadowice, Poland, and named Karol Jozef Wojtyla. His father had been in the military and his mother, who died when Karol was eight years old, encouraged him into the church from a very early age. He was also passionately interested in theatre and sports. By accident of birth, John Paul was born into perhaps the most turbulent period in European history. The Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 was the start of a reign of terror directed against the Polish population in general and Polish Jewry in particular. The wholesale destruction of the Polish nation was an aim of the occupation.
Recently we remembered the 60th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe and the liberation of the Nazi death camps. It is hard, 60 years on, to fully comprehend the scale of savagery that was inflicted on the Poles and other nations and peoples by the Nazis. John Paul was a survivor of these terrible times. During the war John Paul was involved with underground theatre in Krakow, an activity that put him at some personal risk. He was arrested by Nazi officials at one point but was freed due to the fact that he was a labourer in a quarry.
After the war he began his training for the priesthood. He served as a parish priest and later a professor of ethics at the Catholic University of Lubin. He was created Archbishop of Krakow in 1964 and a cardinal in 1967. John Paul’s election to the papacy in 1978 was quite unexpected. He was the first non-Italian pope in many hundreds of years. Although it has been suggested that he was seen as a compromise candidate, his papacy has been recognised as one of the most significant. His early actions set the tone of his period in office. He refused a papal coronation and was instead installed in a papal mass. In his first year as pontiff he travelled to more than 100 countries, a trend which he was to maintain for the rest of his life. He visited Australia for the Eucharistic Congress in 1973 and later as pontiff in 1986 and 1995.
He is, of course, remembered for his impact on Polish national sentiment during the early period of his office. Through his visits to his homeland he raised the Polish spirit and was an inspiration to many Poles during another traumatic period of Polish history. Throughout his papacy he would continue to travel widely and communicate the Catholic message, both to the faithful and in ecumenical terms, building links with other denominations and faiths. Many people around the world were captivated by his personal charisma and his efforts to reach out to the poor, the powerless and the oppressed.
He was outspoken in his criticism of both communism and capitalism while taking a somewhat conservative line in his repudiation of liberation theology. For the limits he placed upon political action by the church he was criticised by some, as he was for his views on certain moral concerns, the place of women in the church and other issues. At the same time he recognised the past failings of the church. In the year 2000 he made an apology and a plea for forgiveness for the wrongs done by the Catholic Church over its 2,000-year history.
It is a testament to the power of his work and his message that his papacy saw a huge growth in the Catholic Church internationally from 750 million believers to more than one billion today. The growth was in large part a result of his evangelism in the developing world as well as his more formal work within the church and in the wider world. John Paul II was a figure whom many felt they could come to know personally.
He came close to death following an assassination attempt in Saint Peter’s Square in 1981 by Mehmet Ali Agca, a member of the far right Turkish Grey Wolves. Following John Paul II’s death, there were many television tributes to the pontiff. There was a particularly touching scene of his visit to Agca in prison following the assassination attempt, where he offered him his forgiveness and an embrace. You can see on John Paul’s face the depth of emotion and pain that he is experiencing in his reconciliation with his would-be assassin. It was truly an inspiring display. In later years he kept in contact with the Agca family and met Mehmet Ali Agca’s mother in 1987.
Just as we came to know him through his travels and the response to the attempt on his life, so too did many people share the experiences of his ill health in old age. He fought Parkinson’s disease publicly and stoically. Even in his final days he continued, as far as possible, his public work. I think his ability to share that part of himself with the world endeared him to many both within and outside the church.
His passing was a time of great sadness to members of the Catholic faith and to many outside it. He will be remembered not only for his contribution to the church but for his deeply personal story so closely tied to the turmoil of the 20th century. He will be remembered for both and also, at a very human level, as a man. In closing, I would like to refer back to some footage that was shown following his death. In early days John Paul had been a passionate skier. In one documentary he was shown in his later years, dressed in white papal robes, walking across the snow covered slopes of the Italian alps, beneath clear, clean blue skies. He stops and looks around him at the snow and the sky. His joy in life is apparent, as he marvels at the purity and freshness of that amazing landscape. On behalf of the opposition, I offer our sincere condolences on his passing.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>His Holiness Pope John Paul II</title>,CONDOLENCES,13,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2005-05-10,"—I too would like to speak to the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill on behalf the government and spoken to by Senator Ludwig on behalf of the opposition. The Polish 263rd successor of Saint Peter died on 3 April this year aged 84, leaving his mark on the world as one of the most influential popes in the church’s 2,000-year history and opening up the church to people all over the world. He is the most travelled pontiff in history, visiting around 100 countries in his first year alone. He encountered more individuals than any other pope, as he spread the word of God.
Many things to many people, Karol Jozef Wojtyla commenced his spiritual journey from a humble quarry worker, poet and actor to a much-lauded pontiff. He was the first pope to travel to England, the first to preach in a Lutheran Church and the first to enter a mosque. Revered as an heroic visionary and attacked as a remnant of a bygone era, the Pope remained true to the opinions he held since his youth. His faith and deep spirituality was shaped by the loss early in his life of his mother and brother and later by that of his father and strengthened during the Nazi occupation, when he became aware of his call to the priesthood. He is credited as giving the Polish people hope and direction after decades of communist rule, inspiring the Solidarity movement which would eventually lead Poland to abandon communism and establish its own identity away from the Soviet Union. Ordained after the war in 1946, he pursued studies in philosophy and theology before being nominated Archbishop of Krakow in the early 1960s and a cardinal in 1967.
His pontificate started in 1978 when, after eight rounds of voting in a secret concave, the cardinals chose the first non-Italian pope since the 16th century. It is reported that during his reign the number of Catholics in the world has risen to about 1.1 billion. As a conservative pope, John Paul II held the line against trendy Catholicism and firmly stood his ground on issues such as women’s ordination, stem cell research and abortion. He became known as an opponent of communism, a champion of human rights and liberty, a powerful preacher and a sophisticated intellectual. He warned of the dangers of secularism, materialism and selfishness, urging people to be tolerant and to help the less fortunate. He was committed to bringing together the churches and faiths of the world, with his theme of forgiveness and harmony.
Such was his faith and character that following an attempt on his life by a Turk in 1981 the Pope famously visited him in prison, offering his forgiveness. In 1984 the Pope approved the first revision in Catholic canon law to make the church more accessible by increasing the power of the bishops, widening the role of laypeople and expanding the role of women in the church. Despite several health scares during the 1990s, his travel and writing continued, culminating in a publication in 1995 in which he spoke of the modern world as a ‘culture of death’, citing violence, poverty, murder, suicide, human suffering, abortion and euthanasia. In 1998, the Vatican made a step towards repairing the relationship between Jews and the Vatican by apologising for the church’s past positions regarding Jews and anti-Semitism.
In his later years, the Pope’s tremendous spiritual strength overcame the limitations of his ailing body, until last month when he returned to his maker. An inspirational leader, he has touched the lives and hearts of many millions of people. This was demonstrated by the many tributes to him from people from all walks of life, following his passing. He will be sadly missed.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>His Holiness Pope John Paul II</title>,CONDOLENCES,13,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-05-10,"—I place on the record my support for this motion in recognition of the work and the life of Pope John Paul II. It is appropriate to acknowledge his contribution as not just a leader of his church but also, in the real sense of the word, a world leader. He was not just a head of state—albeit the state is a fairly unusual one, being very small—but a world figure in terms of the broader things he spoke about. In that sense, it is appropriate to consider and acknowledge his contribution, despite many members of the chamber not being of the Catholic faith. In the same way, for example, the Dalai Lama makes a significant impact as a world figure and many of us speak of the importance of that, even though, as far as I know, many of us are not practising Tibetan Buddhists.
Speaking personally, I do not think it is for me to comment at all on the debates within the Catholic Church about the rights and wrongs of the approach of the Pope on a whole range of issues. That should be very much an issue for those who see themselves as part of that church. I was brought up a Catholic and went to a Christian Brothers school, but I am not part of that faith anymore. I am an interested observer. Certainly, if people want to sign up to that faith, they can have those debates within that organisation, the same as you can have them within a political party or anything else. It is not for me to particularly comment on that.
In the sense that the Pope was a world leader—a role much wider than simply his role within his own church—he clearly had a very significant impact on the world, much more than most other people have had. It is hard to think of too many other people who have had such an impact on the globe over the last quarter of a century. It is easy to overstate things and say that he was the sole person responsible or the primary person responsible for the disintegration of the communist bloc and the Iron Curtain, but there is no doubt that he played a significant role. To have played a significant role in the collapse of a totalitarian regime as comprehensive and far-reaching as the communist regime was, is a contribution that is not too shabby at all. I think you would have to be pretty pleased with that.
It is important to acknowledge the Pope’s consistent voice, standing up against not only human rights abuses in what might be termed the left of the communist regime but all human rights abuses regardless of the political flavour of the nation. Unlike many people in the US who like to see themselves as religious crusaders for the right to life, for example, he was anti-abortion and anti-capital punishment—a system which has logical consistencies which do not seem to apply to many others in the religious right in the US. It is that consistency that I admired. Even when I strongly disagree with their views, I admire people who follow a consistent line of argument rather than just tilt it to suit the particular political or ideological needs of the moment.
The Pope spoke out consistently and strongly against the injustices of capitalism. I hope that all those coalition members who today are speaking about the wisdom and strength of Pope John Paul II look at the comments in the encyclical he made on the 90th anniversary of Rerum Novarum when he spoke about the rights and dignity of workers. When we are looking at industrial relations legislation over the next six to 12 months, we should look at some of the words he said there. He spoke strongly about some of the injustices of capitalism as well as communism. He spoke strongly against the evil of poverty and he spoke consistently and strongly against war—including of course the decision to go to war in Iraq. He worked to build bridges with other religions. All those actions must be strongly acknowledged.
I have spoken publicly on my personal views about areas where I think the Pope did not do so well. Some of those are issues more for the church to decide. I think the role of women within the church, for example, is pretty poor, but it is not my church so it is not my business. But I do think that there are broader issues, because of the role that he played as a world leader and an influential leader, where his failures should be acknowledged. In the same way as he was a straight-talking person, I think it is appropriate to note those failures here. I also believe it is important that there is action on those failures.
None of those failures was stronger than the failure to act on the widespread abuse of young people by Catholic priests and people holding Catholic ministry. That was a significant failure and it sent a very bad signal not only within the church. It is obviously an issue much wider than within the church, and that failure must be tackled because it sends an appalling signal across the wider community. I have spoken on this before—as have others—because I believe it is such an important issue. It is an issue nobody can afford to turn a blind eye to, however uncomfortable it can be to confront those types of issues. There is no doubt that there were significant failures in that regard, and there is still a challenge for the church. It is appropriate for people outside the church to point to that failure.
In the same way, I should note that the church specifically sees for itself a role of speaking beyond those who adhere to the Catholic faith. The area where I do have concerns for the broader social impact, wider than just those people who choose to be part of the Catholic faith, is the church’s statements and attitudes towards homosexual people. One of the documents—it was not a full encyclical—put out by the Pope during his reign was Considerations regarding proposals to give legal recognition to unions between homosexual persons. That document specifically said:
... the arguments that follow are addressed not only to those who believe in Christ, but to all persons committed to promoting and defending the common good of society.
If they seek to engage with the wider society about those issues, that is fine, but they should be open to critique on the impact of those views. That document specifically directed Catholic politicians to vote against particular laws, which I think is going a bit far, frankly. It said that Catholic politicians are obliged to oppose specific legislation regarding homosexual unions.
The plea I make—a plea I have made before in this place—is that we acknowledge the damage that language coming from people in major leadership positions can have on human beings when their innate sense of their own humanity is spoken about in a way that fundamentally devalues it at its core. I know that people have different views about that—theological, philosophical, social and the like—but I am simply talking about the impact I know that sort of language has on some people. Given the Pope’s own words about how his views and statements go beyond those who are Catholics or even those who believe in Christ, I think that, in making such statements, there should be an acknowledgment of the impact those statements have on people.
Having said that—because I believe it needed to be said in a debate such as this—clearly, this was a man who had an enormous impact on the world. Anybody who is in a position where they have such an enormous impact—even if they are a saint, which for all I know he may well be deemed to be in some years time—will have failings and areas where they fall short, but that does not negate the significant impact that the Pope had or the appropriateness of acknowledging his contribution.
It was interesting to examine the way in which he carried on in the face of his very debilitating illness over the last period of his life, and it has been commented on. The Pope set an interesting example by going through that in the way that he did and staying in the position as he did. Being Pope is a bit different to being in other leadership positions, that is for sure; it has a certain unique character. There is too much talk here at the moment about how long people should stay in certain leadership positions, and that is not what I am talking about; I am simply talking about the example that he set. His display of that aspect of the ministry set an interesting example and one that is worth people reflecting on further when they look at some of the very difficult debates that we have about illness, old age, infirmity and disability and how we react to people in those circumstances. The simple reality is that despite their infirmities people can still be enormously effective. They can be effective in different ways, perhaps—obviously, he was not as good at certain things as he was in his younger days, but he could still be very effective at sending messages and playing a role. In some ways, that was because of the infirmities that he had and the illnesses that he was going through. That certainly provides a cause for reflection.
Overall, I wish to indicate support for the motion. As always with these motions, that should not be seen as blanket approval for every action, statement or inaction by the person concerned but rather as recognition of their significant contribution as well as an indication of what I believe are some legitimate issues that his successor should consider tackling. The document I quoted from earlier regarding homosexuality was issued through the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which was headed by the now Pope Benedict XVI. Obviously, he has been intimately involved in some of those issues which I think need a rethink. I would certainly urge those of you that are engaged in the church to get onto that Pope of yours and tell him what he should do next time you get a chance! More seriously, I urge people to contribute to that debate within the church. I know there are difficult issues, but they do have an impact in society more widely and they are issues that need to be given some stronger thought.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>His Holiness Pope John Paul II</title>,CONDOLENCES,13,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2005-05-10,"—I rise to support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In doing so, I want to focus briefly on some words that Pope John Paul II wrote in a couple of encyclicals. Before doing so, it is important to acknowledge that he was a man of great social justice. If one just observed him casually from the outside, as I have—I have no intimate knowledge of the man—it was obvious that he was meek, humble, very caring, very peace loving and very peacemaking. He was a man of determination, energy and endurance. That was encapsulated in the way he lived his life both publicly and privately, although we knew of the latter to a lesser extent.
One of the things that probably stood out the most for me was the impact that he had on the situation in Poland with the rising of Solidarnosc, the Solidarity union. At the time of the emergence of Solidarity, my union in Australia, the SDA—the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association—was one of many international unions that were supporting Solidarity and its emergence within Poland in response to the regime that was governing Poland at that time. Pope John Paul II was a man who in his own mild-mannered way influenced world events far beyond even his anticipation and expectation of what could be achieved. Others have referred to that here today. I suppose I gained some appreciation of the man and the influence that he had over people through my association with that movement at that time. It is interesting that the word they chose to use for that union—‘solidarity’—just so happened to be used in some of his encyclicals, and quite pointedly at that.
As a member of parliament I was proud to be part of a delegation presented to him at a public audience on a bilateral visit to Italy in 1999. One could see the effects, even at that time, of the very rigorous program that he obviously set himself. But, nonetheless, he was always giving of his time and only too pleased to meet with the young, the old, the infirm, those who were poor, those who were advantaged and those who were disadvantaged. He was a man of the people.
I think the real nature of the person could be summed up if one looked at his funeral. He lay outside on the stairs of the basilica in a coffin that was not ornate—it was very simple in nature—and I think it reflected the simplicity of the man himself. The service itself was simple. Of course, even though it was a simple service with a simple coffin, the person who was being acknowledged during the funeral was a man of great stature and a man who was certainly admired by many throughout the world, including those who had congregated to say their farewell to him.
He left a legacy to us all, in my view. Some of that legacy will be ignored by some, some will be unnoticed and some will be cherished, depending on one’s view of the man and the way in which he pursued his papacy. He no doubt had a caring, selfless nature and that, in my view, was reflected in the encyclicals that he put out during his 25-plus years as Pope. Some of those encyclicals of course were controversial and some were very thought-provoking, but I have no doubt that the man himself had great intellectual rigour in his approach to the proclamations that he brought forward.
I do not want his passing to go by in the Parliament of Australia without recording some of the views he had on issues that are close to my heart and the hearts of a number of the Australian public. I will refer to two of his encyclicals. The first is Laborem Exercens, which is on human work and was promulgated on 14 September 1981. He reflected on the 90th anniversary of that great encyclical of Leo XIII’s Rerum Novarum. The second I am going to look briefly at is Sollicitudo Rei Socialis on social concerns that was promulgated on 30 December 1987. Whilst that was promulgated some substantial time ago, his words in one sense are as true today as ever and I think reflect the forward-looking nature of the man. In ‘Laborem exercens’ he referred to the priority of labour and said at page 49:
In view of this situation we must first of all recall a principle that has always been taught by the Church: the principle of the priority of labour over capital. This principle directly concerns the process of production: in this process labour is always a primary efficient cause, while capital, the whole collection of means of production, remains a mere instrument or instrumental cause.
Those words of course ring as true today as when they were promulgated back in 1981. He went further in ‘Laborem exercens’ at page 81 to refer to the importance of unions, again a much maligned group of people by some people in our society today. He said:
All these rights, together with the need for the workers themselves to secure them, give rise to yet another right: the right of association, that is to form associations for the purpose of defending the vital interests of those employed in the various professions.
Interestingly enough in the same encyclical he then gave a mini historical version of the evolution of the trade union movement. He said:
In a sense, unions go back to the mediaeval guilds of artisans, insofar as those organizations brought together people belonging to the same craft and thus on the basis of their work. However, unions differ from the guilds on this essential point: the modern unions grew up from the struggle of the workers—workers in general but especially the industrial workers—to protect their ... rights vis-a-vis the entrepreneurs and the owners of the means of production.
Prophetic words indeed. He said in the same section:
The experience of history teaches that organizations of this type are an indispensable element of social life, especially in modern industrialized societies.
                         …                   …                   …
They are indeed a mouthpiece for the struggle for social justice, for the just rights of working people in accordance with their individual professions.
He did not particularise the professions or the nature of the work undertaken there, but he gave a very detailed analysis of human work, the problems associated with human work and even referred in some parts to the issue of peace itself.
In the encyclical on social concerns one sees some of his ability to provoke thought and provoke discussion. On page 32 of that encyclical he talked about other forms of poverty and he said:
We should add here that in today’s world there are many other forms of poverty. For are there not certain privations or deprivations which deserve this name? The denial or the limitation of human rights—as for example the right to religious freedom, the right to share in the building of society, the freedom to organize and to form unions, or to take initiatives in economic matters—do these not impoverish the human person as much as, if not more than, the deprivation of material goods? And is development which does not take into account the full affirmation of these rights really development on the human level?
In brief, modern underdevelopment is not only economic but also cultural, political and simply human ...
In the encyclical he challenges our society. He does not challenge just those who claim to be of the Catholic persuasion; he is challenging society. Later in the encyclical, at page 85, he comes to the issue of solidarity—not that it has not been mentioned previously in the encyclical, but I particularly want to mention this reference, where he says:

Solidarity helps us to see the “other”—whether a person, people or nation—not just as some kind of instrument, with a work capacity and physical strength to be exploited at low cost and then discarded when no longer useful, but as our “neighbour”, a “helper” ... to be made a sharer, on a par with ourselves, in the banquet of life to which all are equally invited by God.
I think that is very telling of the nature of the person and the way in which he perceived the world. Last, but not least, I refer to page 93. If anyone reads my first speech—and they are not generally read over and over—they will find that I made reference to a preferential option for the poor, and that is the basis on which my life has been founded fairly much. It was probably through this encyclical that he tied that issue up for me and put it all into perspective. He talks about his teachings in recent years, and goes on to say:
Here I would like to indicate one of them: the option or love of preference for the poor. This is an option, or a special form of primacy in the exercise of Christian charity, to which the whole tradition of the Church bears witness.
This is something we should all bear in mind in our daily lives. There is no doubt that Pope John Paul had a profound effect on our society. You did not have to be a Catholic or a Christian to embrace the thrust of his philosophy or even to listen to the points of view that he was expressing, not only through the many encyclicals that he released but also through the various media outlets that published his works.
He challenged the community and—whilst not everyone might have agreed with the words he challenged us with—he did so in a humble way. As I said, he did it with determination, he did it with sincerity and he did it with a love of his fellow human beings. I trust that his great concern for the poor, the weak, the oppressed, the lonely and the sick will not be lost in the turmoil of our society today and that an opportunity such as speaking in this condolence motion will place on record the work, energy, effort and love that he has shown for his fellow human beings.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>His Holiness Pope John Paul II</title>,CONDOLENCES,13,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-05-10,"—On a late July afternoon in 1982, I stood on the platform of the central railway station in Cracow. To this day, I remember being struck by the thought that four years earlier, in June 1978, the Cardinal Archbishop of that city, Karol Wojtyla, had embarked from that very place to attend, for the second time in only a few weeks, the conclave of cardinals—little expecting, no doubt, that he would not return. His departure was, I dare say, little noticed. It was certainly unremarked by the world’s media. Yet it was the beginning of a journey which would change the world forever.
Over the 26 years that followed, Karol Wojtyla became, as Pope John Paul II, one of the undeniably greatest figures of the 20th century. In a century in which most of the titanic figures had been monsters—Lenin, Hitler, Stalin, Mao Tse Tung—we can take some comfort from the fact that the last of the titanic figures of the century was a man of overpowering goodness and simple virtue.
Pope John Paul II was, obviously, a great religious leader: the third-longest serving head of the church whose adherents comprise most of Christianity. He was also an important political leader. Yet when the news of the Pope’s death broke in Australia on the morning of Sunday, 3 April, the common theme of so many of the tributes which flowed was that John Paul had been a great moral leader. His life and work so transcended even his role as the leader of the world’s 1.1 billion Catholics that people of all faiths—and of no faith—felt a sense of loss. His passing was lamented with sincere regret by political leaders of every sort. It united leaders of the democratic world with political figures as diverse as Fidel Castro, Hu Jintao and Vladimir Putin.
Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union—that inhuman political system which John Paul did so much to bring to ruins—called him ‘the No. 1 humanist on the planet’. Many of the tributes evoked the bond of family. Thus, to Lech Walesa, Poland had ‘lost its mother’, while President Ciampi of Italy said that Italians were ‘mourning the loss of a father’. By the time he died, one can fairly claim that John Paul II had become the most respected figure on the planet, with a moral authority which transcended that of any other global leader—political, religious or otherwise.
On 7 April, the Archbishop of Brisbane, John Bathersby, led a concelebrated memorial mass at St Stephen’s Cathedral. In his homily, Archbishop Bathersby described Pope John Paul in these words:
‘He had a deep relationship with God where life and religion mingled easily ... There was his total detachment from the material things of life, and his deep love of the poor. There was a discipline of life that he expected equally of others. But above all there was his genuine love of people, especially young people, his sheer enjoyment of life, and his mischievous sense of humour, not always as apparent in later years, as he grappled with the ... demands of world and Church, and the slow, debilitating pain of sickness.
... he was driven utterly by his love of God and life, from which he learned to love people in all their incredible variety. ... He had a ... remarkable intellect ... linguistic brilliance ... mystic faith and ... remarkable capacity to endure discomfort and suffering. ... With an unshakeable faith and trust in God, inherited from his own parents, his Church, his culture, his study and his experience of life, he reached out to all people. ...
His mission drove the Pope beyond the previous narrow boundaries of Roman Catholicism to embrace all Christians, all religions, and all peoples, an action not always greeted with enthusiasm by certain sections of the Catholic Church. His Christian ecumenism, sprung from a love of God, was based upon the supreme importance and dignity of each and every person, underpinned by an exalted vision of the importance of human life in Jesus Christ. ... More than others he spoke with authority, not the authority of Christ which is utterly unique, but with an authority built upon years of prayer, study and experience, and forged in a furnace of suffering.
              …         …         …
... he preached the dignity and freedom of the human person with such strength and vitality that his voice was eventually ... heard by every citizen and leader on this planet. The message is strong, simple, and powerful. Respect the human person because the human person is made in the image of God. Preach the gospel so that this may become a reality for all.’
Theologians tell us that John Paul II made a profound doctrinal impact upon the Catholic Church. I am in no position to comment on that. But I do want to spend a few moments to reflect on the Pope as an historical figure—for there is simply no doubt that, but for the moral and political influence of this one man, the events which resulted in the liberation of eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet leviathan would not have occurred as they did. No doubt it would have happened one day, but it happened when it did and how it did because of the extraordinary conjunction of events which placed the moral leader of the Polish people in a position of unique authority at one of history’s authentic turning points, and so gave an emphatic answer to Stalin’s famous jibe, ‘How many divisions has the Pope?’
I remember travelling in Poland in that northern summer of 1982, about six months after martial law had been declared by the military dictator, General Jaruzelski. There were military helicopters in the skies and armed militias on the street corners. There was much talk of an imminent Soviet military occupation—not, like Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, to dislodge a liberalising regime, but to prop up a decaying one. I remember, in particular, a conversation I had with some Polish students in Warsaw. I asked one of them what they had done when martial law had been declared. He replied, ‘We all went to the cathedral,’ and he described a scene of thousands upon thousands of Poles converging upon the cathedrals and churches of their cities and towns, apprehensive and afraid, and instinctively recognising the church as their place of refuge, of comfort, of solidarity and of strength.
The events which began in Poland in 1981 framed a world-changing confrontation between the military power of the state and the moral power of the church, between ideology and religious faith, between what another great Pole, Czeslaw Milosz, called the captive mind and the free conscience, between the transient and the everlasting, between the secular and the spiritual.
There is no doubt about the centrality of Pope John Paul II in the resolution of that apocalyptic conflict. This single man, whose childhood was forged in the furnace of one of the most evil regimes of the 20th century—Nazism—who grew to manhood in southern Poland literally a few miles from Auschwitz, whose middle years were spent in confrontation with the other of the most evil tyrannies of the twentieth century—communism—came at the culmination of his life and work to be the principal agent by which that tyranny was brought crashing down. Religious people will see God’s hand in Karol Wojtyla’s life and work. Others, taking a more secular view, will see him as a great nationalist and a great liberator. He was, in my view, a man whose role and place in history was of such a mighty scale that he transcends easy classification. As Archbishop Bathersby said in his homily:
Neither conservative nor liberal, Pope John Paul II defies simple definition or shallow analysis.
On any view, he was a very great man—perhaps the greatest we will see in our lifetimes.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>His Holiness Pope John Paul II</title>,CONDOLENCES,13,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2005-05-10,"—I would like to join in speaking to the condolence motion this evening on Pope John Paul II. I normally go to mass at 7.30 on Sunday mornings at St Finbar’s in Glenbrook in the lower Blue Mountains. Normally, the church is probably about half full because of the hour and, I suppose, it reflects the population in that area. As we know, around 6 o’clock the ABC news bulletin was broadcasting the fact that Pope John Paul II had finally passed away. When I went to my usual mass at 7.30 the church was packed out. In the space of that 1½ hours from the announcement of His Holiness’s death, people—who no doubt were born and raised Catholics, probably not practising—went to mass that day, probably for the first time in some time to join in the widespread grief and sadness that was enveloping the world at his passing.
Indeed, it is probably for historians to come up with some analysis of why in the week or so after his death there was that widespread grief and sadness at his passing. In fact, one of the last communist dictatorships in the world, headed by Fidel Castro, announced that there would be three days of mourning in Cuba. As a number of the previous speakers have said, a number of world leaders commented on the passing of this colossal man. As I said, it will be for historians and others to come up with the final analysis of the impact that this man had on our world in our lifetime.
Plenty has already been written about His Holiness and about his contribution to the 20th century, to Catholicism and Christianity. If you look up ‘John Paul II’ on Google, as I did today, there are 73,800,000 references to him. I did not seek to look up anybody else or any other pope, but I thought he had made a tremendous contribution to have himself so regularly mentioned. Not all mentions were favourable, I might add, but many of them were. When we look back on the contribution this man made to the church and to the 20th century, as Senator Brandis has said, there are significant aspects of his life that stand out.
He lived through the seeing off of two forms of totalitarianism—one on the right, when he was a young man and lived through it in Poland, and one on the left, where he was a significant key in its downfall in his support of the independent trade union movement in Poland known as ‘Solidarity’. A number of trade union leaders were imprisoned and they were able to have priests visit them. The priests used to secretly smuggle messages of support and encouragement to those independent trade union leaders, while they were being persecuted by the communist regime. In fact, when Pope John Paul II visited his home country after he was made Pope in 1978, he addressed a crowd of over one million people. He exalted them and reminded his fellow Poles:

You are men. You have dignity. Don’t crawl on your bellies.
And that is what he stood for most of his life. An American cardinal said of the Pope that his great hope was to awaken the entire world to the dignity and the responsibility of defending human rights, and that is what John Paul II sought to do throughout his whole life. It never worried him to go and pursue dictatorships, whether of the left or the right. He was very active in criticising the dictatorships of Stroessner in Paraguay, Pinochet in Chile and Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines. But, as I said, his greatest support was for solidarity, which has been mentioned in the last few contributions.
He was not afraid at all either of commenting on what he saw as the other great evil in our time—that is, materialism. On his first visit to the United States he warned the Americans of the dangers of materialism, selfishness and secularism, and that warning was not welcomed by the Americans at that stage and probably still would not be. But he told them that that was what he stood for and that was what he saw as a danger.
He was the one Pope who said that it is up to priests to look after the spiritual side of their flock, not necessarily to get involved in spreading guns and revolution throughout Latin America. He said that the so-called liberation theology had to end. He supported the Palestinians in their quest for a homeland. But his greatest fear, as I said earlier, was the denigration of the dignity of human rights.
Senator Hogg has mentioned a number of encyclicals that John Paul II promoted in the areas of unions, the workplace, poverty and social justice. I add briefly some of the things that Pope John Paul II said in those encyclicals. In the first one that Senator Hogg mentioned, Laborem Exercens, Pope John Paul II said that governments must legislate to block shameful forms of exploitation, especially to the disadvantage of the most vulnerable workers. He railed against considering work as a form of merchandise, according to economic theory, to which the price of labour could be applied. He also said, ‘As work is the expression of human potential, then solidarity’—once again, that word—‘is the expression of how humans collectively realise that potential.’
He believed that we should confirm our conviction of the priority of human labour over what we have grown accustomed to calling capital and noted that all capital was the product of human work at one stage or another. In every case he said that ‘a just wage is the concrete means of verifying the justice of the whole socioeconomic system—it is the key means’ and ‘unions are an indispensable element of social life’. They are not part of ‘a struggle against others’.
In another encyclical, Solicitudo Rei Socialis, he talked of the denial of human freedom and potential as a form of poverty and commented on the need once again to form free trade unions. He said the state must ensure suitable employment for all who are capable of working and act against unemployment. In his 1991 encyclical, Centesimus Annus, he commented on how society and the state must ensure wage levels are adequate for the maintenance of the worker and his family, including a certain amount of savings.
He was a man who was consumed by the view of social justice and that it must be progressed. He commented on the need for Christians to take decisive and honest stands on the issues of social justice, especially in response to the intrusion of the market into public life. Once again he talked about the principle of solidarity by defending the weakest by placing certain limits on the autonomy of the parties that determine working conditions.
It is with great sadness that I comment on the passing of such a great historical figure. Already there are moves within the Catholic Church to canonise Pope John Paul II. He canonised a number of people. In fact, I think he canonised more people in his period as Pope than all the popes put together. He saw the need for us to have heroes. I hope that, with his passing and with his life to be reflected on in time, we will have again, as we knew when we buried him, a great hero and a hero for our people in the future.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>His Holiness Pope John Paul II</title>,CONDOLENCES,13,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-05-10,"—Pope John Paul II died having run his race fair to the line. He was a good example to all who cared to look at the dignity and worth of man to his last breath. It was said that his last word was ‘amen’—probably the most powerful word in the Christian lexicon. It is a single word, yet full of prayer and meaning. By this he used his last second on earth to reaffirm his faith and acknowledge the end of his mission.
John Paul was destined to be Pope. He was marked even beyond his own comprehension. The story was even told that the previous Pope, John Paul I, whose time as pontiff lasted some 30 days, told his closest advisers that they had chosen the wrong man—‘They should have chosen the man across from me.’ The conclave seating confirmed that that was Cardinal Wojtyla from Poland. His life’s experiences prepared him comprehensively for the physical and spiritual rigours and judgments needed to follow in the footsteps of the Fisherman. Like any of us, he could never have anticipated or comprehended why certain extreme events in his life were pitched at him as he grew up in Poland but, as we can all see now, his life in Poland was to shape his life as the pontiff and it gave him the talents to carry out his mission.
Born in 1920, he lost his mother at an early age and brother and father later. By the age of 21 he was alone in the world. It was a hole in his heart forever. He was a very physical and athletic man. He loved the theatre and acting, and that is how he lived his life, virtually until he joined to train for the priesthood in 1942. From his priestly training days to his cardinalship, he was a noteworthy and relied upon intellect of the church. As is well known, incredibly he lived under the two most brutal, merciless and atheistic regimes in the 20th century, if not history. Firstly, in 1940 there was Poland’s occupation by the Nazis and, secondly, Poland’s occupation by the communists. This was the character chosen to be the church’s 264th Pope, and this is what made up the character of the 264th Pope.
It was this character who visited over 130 separate countries at breakneck pace. He visited some of those countries two or three times—Poland nine times and Australia twice. This was the man who took three bullets at point-blank range from a trained assassin, yet lived, but what is less known is that the wounds plagued him all his life with constant pain. It is also interesting to note that the assassin, who is now repentant, of course, was bewildered at how he could possibly have missed what he had in his sights. This was the man who, as a pope, bridged relationships with his brothers, being the first pope to visit a mosque and a synagogue. This was the pope who had audiences of sometimes two million people—one million regularly, and that was a small crowd—and held their respect to his death, where many millions attended and watched his funeral. As a young actor fielding the small audiences in Poland, how could he have known that the world stage awaited him? He played it well, like a pro.
This is the man history acknowledges as the key turner to bringing down communism without firing a shot. Well may the communists’ worst, Stalin, once mockingly have asked, ‘How many legions has the Pope?’ The story is told that when it first started to look like an uprising was occurring in Poland, the United States government, the then Reagan government, dispatched a somewhat secretive delegation to the Vatican—I think Alexander Haig was party to that delegation—to meet Vatican officials and the Pope. They wanted to know how they could help Poland, via the Vatican. The rather stony reply that met them was: ‘Nothing. Leave it to us. We’ve been doing this for thousands of years.’ It has never been doubted by any historian that the Vatican brought down what no-one believed could collapse, let alone saw coming. Each country within the new map of Europe owes its freedom to what happened in Poland in the early eighties.
This is the man who, as Pope, wrote encyclical after encyclical and publication after publication reaffirming the teachings and direction of his church, cementing the faith for generations to come. Yet through his reign anyone and everyone who knew him deemed him humble. John Paul II was a man for the times. In a church that looks at time in centuries, not years or even decades, his time will be known as great.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>His Holiness Pope John Paul II</title>,CONDOLENCES,13,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-05-10,"—In supporting this condolence motion I thank the previous speakers for their contributions today to honour this very holy man. We have heard reflections this afternoon on a very different perspective of the Pope from that which has been expressed in other venues and at other opportunities. I think a very important record has been established here this afternoon.
In honouring the life of the Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, can I say that his papacy was marked by his steadfast faith in the human spirit and its ultimate capacity to do good. Our most recent images of him as a frail and suffering man at the end of his life reminded us of his belief in the value of every life, especially the elderly and the infirm. He carried on, enduring his afflictions, as Senator McGauran said, not asking for relief because he believed that:
It is suffering, more than anything else, which clears the way for the grace which transforms human souls.
He also said:
In suffering, a man discovers himself—his own humanity, his own dignity, his own mission.
Certainly John Paul II did that.
His concern with the dignity of man was behind his unswerving advocacy of social justice—and we have heard about that this afternoon—and his support for oppressed people everywhere. His strength of character was evident throughout his life. As many speakers have said this afternoon, he faced the Nazi occupation in Poland and later challenged the communist regime. In June 1979, less than a year after his election as Pope, he travelled to Poland, as Senator Hutchins reflected, telling his countrymen and countrywomen not to be afraid, triggering a wave of resistance to communism and having a decisive and material impact on the end of the Cold War. His promotion of democratic hopes extended well beyond eastern Europe. We have heard how he influenced the democratic transitions in the Philippines, Chile, Argentina and Central America.
As the spiritual leader of 1.1 billion followers, Pope John Paul II spoke out forcefully on issues of war and peace, claiming that ‘in our time every war is unjust’. In January 2003 he gave an address to the Vatican, stating:
I say: No to war! War is not always inevitable. It is always a defeat for humanity.
                         …           …             …
faced with the constant degeneration of the crisis in the Middle East, I say to you that the solution will never be imposed by recourse to terrorism or armed conflict, as if military victories could be the solution.
Such was his unstinting condemnation of war that no nation could automatically rely on his approval, whatever their political or religious allegiances. As a man of peace, he established diplomatic relations with Israel but he also supported the aspirations of the Palestinian people to statehood.
Through his experience of Catholicism, as well as his intellectual grasp of world history, he understood what it meant to be a victim of prejudice and discrimination. One of the important things Pope John Paul II will be remembered for is his commitment to Catholic-Jewish reconciliation. We heard several senators speak about that this afternoon. He was, as Senator McGauran reminded us, the first pope since apostolic times to visit a synagogue and the first ever to visit a mosque. His apology for evils done in the name of the church broke new ground as he begged forgiveness for Catholic anti-Semitism down the ages.
In his 2001 apostolic letter, entitled At the Beginning of the New Millennium, Pope John Paul II described a world entering a new era burdened by contradictions, where the affluent few enjoyed immense possibilities while millions of others lived on the margins of progress. His conviction that we pursued our attachment to material things to the detriment of our spiritual nourishment caused discomfort, debate and even, at times, outright ridicule. But Pope John Paul II was completely unafraid of controversy and truly had the courage of his convictions, never wavering or flinching in his struggle for what he believed was good and right.
We have heard today of the Holy Father’s compassion, his intellect and his absolute commitment to human dignity and all humanity. But I would like to speak this afternoon about his commitment to the environment and his call for an ecological conversion. Pope John Paul II was highly educated. He had two doctorates and he was a university professor. So it is not surprising that he loved ideas and intellectual argument. He was particularly interested in philosophy, including the philosophy of science. Because of his unflinching integrity, his public image sometimes suggested a conservative, even closed, mind but his thinking was much more complex and layered than that image would ever suggest.
Many people would be surprised to know that he agreed with most modern scientific thinking on the big bang and the expansion of the universe, the age of the earth and Darwinian evolution. And he was convinced of the interrelationship of all living things. In 1990, he observed:
... we cannot interfere in one area of the ecosystem without paying due attention both to the consequences of such interference in other areas and to the well-being of future generations.
A decade later, he was still preoccupied with that theme. He wrote:
... if one casts a gaze over the regions of our planet, one notices immediately that humanity has not fulfilled the divine expectation ... Especially in our times, man has devastated without hesitation plains and wooded valleys, polluted the waters, deformed the earth’s habitats, made the air unbreathable, disturbed the hydro-geological and atmospheric systems [and] turned green spaces into deserts ...
He went on to argue that the people of the world need to undergo an ‘ecological conversion’ to protect the environment and to make the earth a place where all life is valued and can grow in harmony.
Of course, he understood the undeniable benefits that recent discoveries have brought to humanity. What made him remarkable was the way his thinking moved beyond that realisation to the idea that such discoveries actually demonstrate the nobility of the human vocation to participate responsibly in God’s creative action in the world. It was in the light of this idea that he argued:
... ecological awareness ... ought to be encouraged to develop into concrete programs and initiatives.
One of Pope John Paul II’s convictions was that the domination which, according to Genesis, human beings were given over creation is one not of exploitation but of service and ministry—a responsibility to continue, as he said, ‘the work of the Creator, a work of life and of peace’. His ideas had a contagious effect on those who read his scholarly and provocative works. He was a prolific writer, an extraordinary thinker, and he stimulated intellectual debate both within and beyond the Catholic hierarchy. He worked to bring the world closer to God’s ‘vision of beauty and harmony’, and his life as a man of extraordinary faith, intellect, kindness and courage remains an inspiration to us all. May he rest in peace.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-05-10,"—This is the ninth speech on the continuing issue of child abuse that I have made in this place since I entered the Senate in November 2002. Child abuse in all of its forms is a pervasive and sickening presence in our national life. Its reduction must be a constant focus of governments at all levels in this country. To achieve this, we need to ensure a sharp focus is kept on it. In some measure, part of the problem lies in the fact that we have yet to achieve an effective division of responsibilities in our federal system—and that is another topic I keep talking about—that ensures that effort expended results in desired outcomes.
Of course, in the area of child abuse, we are often dealing with subjective points of view as well as subjects. We are talking about the children concerned, who may not for all sorts of reasons, among them very young age, be the most reliable of witnesses to their own abuse. We must also deal with the increased incidence of reporting of abuse, which, unless analysed carefully and understood completely, can lead to claims that the epidemic—and it is an epidemic—is getting sharply worse. Even a single instance of child abuse, sexual or otherwise, is appalling. That must surely be the starting point of every attack on the problem.
Some figures that came to hand earlier this year show that nationally the number of suspected cases of child abuse, neglect or harm referred to authorities had more than doubled in the previous five years. In spite of the many advances made in recent times in relation to better managing the prevention of child abuse in Queensland—and it is important to recognise those advances and applaud them, even though they are horribly belated—it is plain that many problems remain. Only very recently it was revealed that child safety resources in the Ipswich and Toowoomba regions were not keeping pace with notifications. This was revealed in an article in the Courier-Mail newspaper. That article, which was published on 26 April, also reported that the Queensland Minister for Child Safety had asked his department for an urgent review of resources in Toowoomba. Yet again we see the Queensland government, flusher than ever with discretionary spending dollars from the state’s GST allocations, failing at the administrative level.
We need to recognise that case loads are increasing in terms of the number of notifications. To some extent, this increased workload will represent cases that would not perhaps have been notified in earlier times. But the fundamentally important point is to get on top of the case load. According to the Courier-Mail, the number of abuse notifications awaiting investigation in Toowoomba has doubled in four months. It is reported that, as of mid-April, the Toowoomba child safety centre had 432 unallocated initial assessments awaiting action. Last November the reported figure was 220. In Ipswich, the five-person child safety office team is reported to have 100 new notifications a month. In April there were 376 cases backed up, with 137 not even allocated to an officer. Apparently, five of these unallocated cases were priority 1 cases. Priority 1 covers cases where the child or children are considered to be at extremely high risk of sexual or violent abuse, torture or suicide. Nineteen were so-called ‘high 2’ cases—those needing urgent attention. Under the rules, priority 1 cases must be dealt with within 24 hours. The Queensland government admits that, in one recent week in Toowoomba, two such cases were not dealt with in that time frame.
This is the very nub of the problem: the inability of the child safety infrastructure to deliver because of lack of resources to actually do the jobs required. This is something the Queensland government must look at very seriously and very urgently. What the Queensland government must do—and it must do; no more excuses—is make a substantial allocation for more staff in child safety in the 2005-06 state budget, which will be brought down on 7 June. As I said at the beginning of this address, it certainly has a lot of GST money to apply to that task. The Beattie Labor government must make a definitive commitment to sufficient funding and recruiting to achieve the staffing levels at the sharp end in child safety that are clearly required.
The Beattie government simply must deliver in this area. The minister says that staffing levels are being addressed and that by 2007 the number of child safety officers in Toowoomba will have doubled. He says that, by that year, staff in the Ipswich office will have increased by 65 per cent. I have a message for that minister: ‘You’ll have to work a lot faster than that.’ In relation to Ipswich, he is obviously talking about full-time equivalent staff, since increasing a staff of five by 65 per cent will give them 3¼ new people.
There have been many announcements from the state government of strategies and plans to deal with Queensland’s child abuse and child safety problems. We certainly need to recognise that extra resources have been allocated in the past to combat child abuse and secure child safety in Queensland. And it is not only the Queensland system that is failing to work adequately; it is a national issue. At the same time, it is on Queensland that a large measure of the focus should lie, since the Beattie Labor government’s management and budgetary allocation record was plainly inadequate for far too long. It knew there were horrendous problems as far back as 1999, when the Forde commission reported. But it effectively swept it all under the carpet until 2003, when it was forced by further evidence of burgeoning child abuse notifications to do something more than just talk about things.
We remember with profound distaste that following further inquiries by the Crime and Misconduct Commission in 2003—it reported in January 2004—Premier Beattie made the empty claim that the February 2004 state election campaign he then immediately called was ‘for the kids’. Nearly 18 months later, many of those kids are still waiting. That is simply not good enough. Part of the problem seems to be that the projected expansion of calls on the system on which the Crime and Misconduct Commission based its recommendations has substantially outstripped the 15 per cent growth rate on which future staffing requirements were based. In fact, there was a 39 per cent increase in notifications and a 43 per cent increase in the number of children coming into contact with the Department of Child Safety between December 2003 and December 2004. Yet again, we see the triumph of illusion over substance that is the hallmark of the Beattie state government in Queensland.
We hear the rhetoric. We see the sound and light show. The Premier performs his Houdini tricks for the crowd. And, once he has everyone’s attention focused on the frippery, he steals away and no-one derives any benefit, or precious little. It is the same situation in relation to child labour laws as they relate to children under 13, which the state Liberals have been pressing the Beattie Labor government to enact since 1999, when it repealed the existing provisions. Last November the state Liberals introduced private legislation into the Queensland parliament to protect children from workplace and sexual exploitation. It is only now, as state Liberal health spokesman Bruce Flegg pointed out last week, that the state government is finally moving to produce a child labour law for Queensland, after leaving loopholes open for six years that allowed children to work in adult entertainment and risk suffering workplace exploitation. The scope and extent of Labor’s proposed laws are unclear at present. But it is certainly the case that they should not be used to unreasonably interfere with the working hours of older teenagers in part-time employment. The goal is protection of children from potential harm, not to proscribe individual initiative or to disadvantage employers.
Doing the right thing is important in relation to child safety nationally and doing the right thing by adult victims of abuse as children is also vital. We need to send a strong message that child abuse in any of its terrible forms will not be tolerated in our society. That is the message of White Balloon Day, which is held each year to focus community attention on an ongoing problem of the most concerning dimensions. This year it was held in April. It is a valuable occasion, and it is pleasing that it sprang from the initiative of a group of Queenslanders in 1999 and has gone from strength to strength ever since.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Child Abuse</title>,ADJOURNMENT,18,1,speech

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2005-05-10,"—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:
Departmental systems indicate that as at 30 June 2004, there were 22 Protection visa (PV) applicants in immigration detention and 666 applicants not in immigration detention, who were awaiting a primary decision from the Department. 
        Given the nature of information sought in parts (1) to (14) of the question, these figures and subsequent answers exclude applications for Further Protection Visas (FPVs) lodged by holders of Temporary Protection visas (TPVs) and offshore Temporary Humanitarian visas.
Of the non-detainee PV caseload 33 persons do not at present have a reportable residential address postcode.  Of the remainder, the State and Territory breakdown is as follows:

The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) systems do not enable the statistical reporting requested on the numbers of PV applicants who have Bridging Visas in effect.   
For reasons stated in (2) above, DIMIA systems cannot provide the statistical reporting requested on Bridging Visa holders. (a) The ASAS is administered by the Australian Red Cross (ARC) under an agreement with the Commonwealth.  ARC systems do not provide consolidated reports on the number of persons who have applied for ASAS income support. (b) The total number of persons in receipt of ASAS income support as at 30 June 2004 was:
