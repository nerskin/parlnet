"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-08-30,"—I move:
Clause 3, page 2 (line 31), omit `indigenous'.
In speaking to the amendment circulated in my name, I do not believe we should legislate to give indigenous culture primacy over European culture or heritage, or any other culture or heritage. This is the reason why I oppose clause 3(a)(ii) of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . In its current form, the bill speaks to environmental values, old-growth values, wilderness endangered species values, national estate values and world heritage values. It also speaks to economic values and social values. The bill then goes on to speak to indigenous heritage values. In listing all of the previous values, if the bill excludes indigenous heritage values, then it is reasonable to assume that it also excludes non-indigenous values.
In forest areas which are subject to regional forest agreements, there are examples of non-indigenous heritage values that should be assessable under the RFA process. For example, there are buildings, camp sites of historical significance, graves, ruins and sites of historical importance. I am sure there are other values that I have not listed here. I believe that all heritage is valuable to the people it relates to. Regardless of whether or not it happens to be indigenous, such heritage is worthy of assessment and protection if necessary. 
If we look around the New South Wales and Victorian high alps, we find cabins from the cattlemen in the pastoral industry. If we go into some of the historic camping areas, there are holiday shacks. These all form part of our cultural heritage and are of value to the person they relate to. There are old ruins of pioneer cottages. There are examples of old steam driven sawmills in the Brindabella Mountains. Some of the national heritage bush tracks down the eastern coast travel in close proximity to where the Chinese and the Australian miners mined in the latter part of last century and the early part of this century. There are examples of tunnels which they blasted during that process. There are examples of races that they dug and stone pitching which the Chinese carried out in their mining industry. All of these are examples of non-indigenous heritage values and are worthy of assessment in the RFAs.
If the government and the opposition really believe that people should not be afforded special treatment on the basis of race, then they should practise what they preach and support the amendment that will ensure equality for both indigenous and non-indigenous heritage and refrain from making laws that give preference to one group based on race.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-30,"—The government will not be supporting this amendment. The proposed amendment is to overcome some perceived bias in the RFA process to the protection of indigenous heritage values over the protection of other values. This clearly is not so because the RFA process is designed to take into account, as fully as possible, all values relevant to the region. In all the regions that have been the subject of the RFA process to date, assessment of indigenous heritage values has been a relevant consideration and we need to take that into consideration when assessing what an RFA should be. We find it appropriate therefore that indigenous heritage values be as much a part of the definition of an RFA in the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  as the other values of environmental values, 
 economic values and social values. The government does not support this amendment",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-30,"—Likewise, the opposition will not be supporting this amendment. Frankly, I have never heard so much rubbish in all my life as has just been put forward in support of the amendment. One has to understand what protection of heritage and culture is all about. I was not aware that the European cultural heritage of this nation, which is some 200 years old—a fairly insignificant length of time in world history—was in any danger of disappearing. If anything, it is the reverse. European heritage and culture in this country is alive and well, and thriving. It is recognised daily. It is also recognised in this particular industry. I am sure that Senator Harris has heard of Timbertown, near Wauchope, a cultural heritage tourist centre that has been constructed to recognise that particular history—short as it may be against the standards of civilisation; short as it may be in this country. There you can go and see examples of what took place in what was a thriving industry in northern New South Wales. There are many other examples of the recognition of Australia's European cultural heritage.
I also have some difficulty with the concept of heritage being applied equally to both cultures, in the manner that Senator Harris put forward. It is false to suggest that it is unequal and somehow wrong to promote the protection and recognition of this country's indigenous heritage. After all, throughout the world, it is the indigenous culture and heritage of many nations that is specifically recognised because that is always what is in danger of being lost. The other point that Senator Harris made was that, by including this, we are somehow not treating all people equally. I do not accept that argument, because the maintenance of a timber industry is something that we support and promote. This legislation, together with our amendments, which dramatically improve it, and the RFA process itself are all about maintaining and promoting the timber industry in an ecologically, environmentally and economically sustainable form.
If that is not recognising the past 200 years of heritage in this industry, then I cannot think of anything else that would be. This legislation is very much about sustaining and promoting that industry, and I make no apology for having included in it the important objective of recognising that, hand in hand with promoting our great environmental heritage—the protection of old-growth forest, wilderness, endangered species, national estate values—we are promoting the maintenance of a sustainable timber industry while ensuring that indigenous heritage values are protected and promoted. Therefore, I cannot support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-30,"—I am pleased to put it on the record that the Australian Democrats cannot and will not support this argument by Senator Harris. We believe that Aboriginal sensitivities and, in particular, heritage are a crucial and important part of the RFA process—if we are to have an RFA process—and, further, that this is yet another small step in working towards recognition and Aboriginal reconciliation.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—Through you, Madam Temporary Chairman, to Senator Harris: I have some sympathy for this amendment, but not in the way in which it is drafted. I do think indigenous heritage values stand alone and ought not be removed as a specific item. There is an argument that non-indigenous heritage values—the ones that Senator Harris has adverted to—ought to have been written in as part of the assessment preceding an agreement being reached. I am quite surprised that Forestry Tasmania, which makes a big issue of many of the things that Senator Harris spoke about, has failed to get such a subclause inserted in the bill, requiring the assessment of the non-indigenous heritage values to be part of an agreement before it is acceptable. I would suggest to Senator Harris that some other form of approaching this might be the best way to go.
Indigenous heritage values are incredibly important. They should not be muddled up with post-invasion values. They are right through the forests. The committee will remember I asked Senator Troeth last week 
 about heritage values and the concern that the Deloraine Aboriginal community had about impending logging on Quamby Bluff.
It is bad enough that Senator Troeth has been unable to give the committee any information on that logging—which would include, of course, were she to give it, indigenous values—which must be assessed, according to this document, before we can proceed to accept the Tasmanian RFA, for one. But one must presume from this—and Senator Harris is pointing this out quite rightly—that there has not been an assessment of the non-indigenous heritage values either. And that is pretty poor considering that this legislation seeks to lock down current regional forest agreements based on the presumption that all the work has been done. From Senator Troeth's inability to respond as far as Quamby Bluff is concerned, I think we can see that that work has not been done. I think Senator Harris is probably quite rightly concerned that other heritage values which are not listed here are even less likely to have been looked at.
It might help us and engender some confidence in the committee if the government was able to talk about the heritage values that have been assessed—both indigenous and non-indigenous—so that we can get an assessment of what degree of coverage there has been of these values. I think Senator Harris ought not be ignored on the matter. He and I are on different sides of the fence when it comes to this whole legislation, but what he is saying is commonsense, and maybe Senator Troeth could help him by giving an account to the committee of the assessments that have been made in any one area—or generally around Australia—of non-indigenous heritage values. When we discuss this clause I will be asking Senator Troeth to give us more information on the specific case in Tasmania which I have adverted to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-08-30,"—I would first of all like to address the comment by the minister that these values are actually protected in the legislation. We are talking about a Commonwealth bill; we are not talking about the state based RFAs. In the bill itself I go back to the definitions. In the 
 definition for RFA, under (a), it very clearly says:
. . . the agreement was entered into having regard to assessments of the following matters that are relevant to the region or regions . . . 
In her answer, the minister said that these issues were to be addressed within the region or regions. Again I put my question. The act clearly sets out the environmental values, old-growth values, wilderness values, endangered species values, national estate values, world heritage values, economic values and social values. I do not in any way say that they will not be assessed. But, if the head of power of this act is such that, after having listed all of those values, it then clearly needs to add indigenous heritage values as a separate, specific item, it is very explicit that non-indigenous values do not come under any of those preceding values.
Senator Forshaw said that if we want to look at European culture and heritage we can go to a tourist park. I can do the same thing in Cairns at Tjapukai. I do not see the relevance of the statement. What I am clearly saying is this. Can the senator clearly show me how having something represented in a tourist park will actually preserve the value in the forest—say, for argument's sake, an old steam engine in its place in the forest, a mining race or a cabin in the high country? If those tourist parks and their examples can actually protect the physical objects that are in the forestry area I would be very pleased if the senator could indicate to me how it can be achieved.
I have not at any point in time said anything that would diminish the value of indigenous heritage, and I would like it to be very clearly put on the record that it is not my intention to do so. My intention was, and still is, to recognise both, and not detract from either.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—Senator Harris deserves a response to that. He obviously feels keenly about the matter, and it is an important one. I have just looked at the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement. As far as I can see, there is no mention of the non-indigenous heritage values that you refer to, Senator Harris. This is pretty 
 unusual because, as I said earlier, the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, now called Forestry Tasmania, have put enormous amounts of effort into trying to prevent areas being protected, particularly with national park status, because they have said that this would infringe on cultural values. One would have thought that there would be a sizeable contribution in their own agreement—signed by the Prime Minister—enumerating those cultural values to ensure that they are not also damaged by logging practices.
I do not mean here your small sawmiller. We are looking at the big operators who move into forest areas and bulldoze sites of past logging activities of the steam age. There is bush machinery such as Senator Harris has spoken about. There are old steam engines, haulage ways and tram tracks. In places horse power was being used pre-steam. There are remnants of those logging activities, including snigging tracks, harness and even sites of stables and so on. These sites, although they are protected in the incident I am about to refer to, were numerous along the Gordon and Franklin rivers, for example, because the piners who went in there simply could not take machinery up to those sites, even this century. There are sites like this all over the Great Western Tiers in Tasmania, through into the nearer parts of the southern forest, the Tasman Peninsula, where Senator Troeth has been and studied the matter, and other parts of Tasmania where, pre-woodchipping, the logging industry was close to towns. It was not right back in the hinterland; it was close in. The sites where this took place are now few and far between.
Woodchipping arrived in Tasmania in 1970. The first mill was set up at Triabunna on the east coast, following the earlier establishment of the Harris Daishowa mill at Eden, in New South Wales just north of the border with Victoria, in 1969. Since that time, more than 120 small sawmills have been closed in Tasmania without a conservationist in sight. These have been closed by the big corporations like North and Boral, and Amcor in a different way—their predecessors. They wanted essentially to get the small sawmillers out of the way and take over the public 
 forests—the Crown forests, as they were then called. They were very successful in doing that through successive Labor and Liberal governments in Tasmania and they are still successful at doing that.
But there is a heritage of timber-getting which you will see displayed at Dorrigo, Geeveston, Orbost and other timber community towns, including no doubt south-west Western Australia as well.
—You can see it in the mills that are still operating in the forests.
—Yes, in some of them you can.
—But you want to shut them all down.
—Senator Forshaw is making the big mistake that I just referred to. In history, it is the big woodchippers that have shut these people down. In Tasmania, over 90 per cent of the forest currently coming out of places like the Tarkine Wilderness is not going to end up as cut timber. It ends up as woodchips.
—That is the name you use.
—Senator Calvert interjected there. I am sure he will get up and give different figures.
—No; I am just saying the Tarkine does not exist. It is a name that you made up.
—He says now that the Tarkine Wilderness does not exist. Here we are in a case of reality. He will be telling us next that the planet does not exist and nor does the Senate. I do not know what goes on in the senator's mind, but maybe he can get up and explain that a little bit more in a moment. The reality is that we are talking here about heritage of the post-invasion kind. Logging of the forests began all around Australia to establish the settlements. Then it became a major export industry in terms of sawn timber. Most of the docks in London, for example, came out of our forests, using Tasmanian blue gum and other durable species. That was accompanied by Huon pining, which I think goes back to 1807, the 
 same year as the first Tasmanian tiger was described in these forests. That was a very rapid destruction of a unique species because the whole world wanted the most durable building timber species you could get.
It is important, if we are going to be sure that the regional forest agreement over the next 20 years does not lead to erosion of these sites, because the woodchipping companies could not care two hoots about anybody's heritage. After all, the boards of these woodchipping corporations have not been into the forests where their clear-fell logging is occurring at the moment. So how could they know or care about the sawmills that Senator Forshaw was talking about? They do not. They care about getting the sawlog allocation for themselves as well and setting up large in-city sawmills which are fitted with the latest high-tech machinery and computers and do away with the jobs of the people traditionally in the industry. That is why, despite all the talk about jobs, the shedding of jobs in this industry is going on in those states where RFAs are not signed and the shedding of jobs is going on in those states where RFAs are signed, because the woodchip corporations, with their takeover of the sawn timber industry, are calling the shots.
There is a pre-woodchip corporation heritage, and Senator Harris has quite rightly drawn our attention to it. That heritage is disappearing fast, and it has been swept aside—certainly by the clear-fell logging practices in Tasmania. I can show Senator Forshaw sites of mills not too far from my place at Liffey that are now lost under industrial forestry—fast growing plantation trees. Forestry Tasmania has moved in with the woodchip corporations and swept the whole lot aside. Forestry Tasmania could not care two hoots. It will trot it out when it suits its case to try to give more power to the woodchippers, as in this legislation, but once again it is a case of simply manipulating the real concern of the people, which is that we protect this heritage, to get a different end—to get a bigger slice of the action for the woodchip corporations.
It is not good enough for us to simply say, `Let's ignore this; it may have been assessed 
 somewhere.' It is very important for Senator Troeth to tell the committee just where the European heritage—and the Chinese heritage and the heritage of other non-indigenous people associated with the forest—is dealt with. Where is that dealt with in any single regional forest agreement signed or unsigned? I have here the Tasmanian document, which is 133 pages long if you do not count the map at the end. There is no index, which is typical of anything to do with Forestry Tasmania, because that would help an inquirer get the information, and they are in the business of trying to stop any inquirer getting any information at all—it suits their politics. In the absence of that index I may not have looked in all the right places, but the parliamentary secretary knows because she says the assessments have been done. Here is the clear challenge to see if she is right: could the parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, please point out to me, or to Senator Harris if she prefers, where non-indigenous heritage is dealt with in this lengthy document? I do not believe it is there.
I believe that, once again, the homework has not been done. The government could not care less about European heritage. Mr Howard did not have the foggiest idea what he was doing, as far as matters like this are concerned, when he flew to Tasmania and signed this agreement. Nor did Premier Rundle, and certainly Premier Bacon does not have the foggiest idea now. Deputy Premier Lennon in Tasmania is very ebullient about his support for the regional forest agreement, but apparently he could not care less about the non-indigenous, let alone the indigenous, cultural values of this document.
Indigenous issues are dealt with in two paragraphs on page 24 of this 133-page document. Let me acquaint you with those. Clause 83 says:
The State undertakes that it will introduce into the State Parliament legislation to replace the Aboriginal Relics Act 1975 (Tas.). This will occur following formal consultation with the Tasmanian Aboriginal community to ensure the appropriate management of Aboriginal heritage, including the maintenance of traditional and historic sites, uses and values in Tasmania.
It goes on to clause 84:
This Agreement is not intended to influence either current or future Native Title claims in any way.
That is true: it is about woodchip corporation claims and land rights. It gives nothing to the indigenous people. It goes on:
Where any government action to implement this Agreement could affect Native Title, that action will be taken in accordance with the Native Title Act 1993.
There you have it: this regional forest agreement, even as regards indigenous values, has not involved an assessment—at least, it does not mention it if it did. It says that it will bring an act into the Tasmanian parliament, unspecified, and that this will occur following `consultation with the Aboriginal community to ensure the appropriate management', et cetera. When? Senator Troeth will be able to tell the committee when, I am sure. Has that been brought in in the last two years or is it going to come in?
But what we are talking about here is the assessment of those values before we agree to the regional forest agreement. We are dealing here with clause 3 of the bill which says:
RFA or Regional Forest Agreement means an agreement that is in force between the Commonwealth and a State in respect of a region or regions, being an agreement that satisfies all the following conditions:
And part (ii) is:
indigenous heritage values. . . 
This agreement does not do that. It does not satisfy any values at all. It says that something will be done at some future time—left to the Tasmanian government, and we all know about them. So it is a fraud. We are being asked to sign off on something which is clearly fraudulent in that it says one thing but does another. It purports to say that there is an assessment of indigenous heritage values in Tasmania, but in fact no assessment whatsoever has been done. What an appalling state of affairs.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Harris be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—Neither Senator Harris nor I have had a response from the government representative 
 on this matter. Madam Temporary Chair Knowles, I am sure you would agree with me, but let me not put you in an invidious position. I just say that any reasonable person would agree, and I would class you as a reasonable person, that that is a totally unacceptable situation.
—Senator Brown, it would be wise if you did not attribute remarks to me that I have not made. Continue your remarks.
—I will change that and say `any reasonable person', Chair, if you do not want to be included in my terminology. Any reasonable person would say that this is not good enough. A reasonable person would say that the job of the person at the table, in this case Senator Troeth, when an amendment is brought up from the One Nation senator, Senator Harris, calling for non-indigenous heritage values to be, in his terms, treated equally but at least to be recognised, would be to give a rejoinder. I suggest to Senator Harris that, if this is not acceptable, he does move to add a new subclause 3 with the words `non-indigenous heritage values'. That would at least satisfy the clear wish he stated that we have acknowledgment of those heritage values and have them assessed.
There is one problem, and I have been through this as far as indigenous values are concerned. The bill says that those values will be assessed in the formulation of a regional forest agreement:
. . . being an agreement that satisfies all the following conditions:
(a)	 the agreement was entered into having regard to assessments of the following matters that are relevant to the region or regions:
. . .              . . .             . . .
		 (ii)	 indigenous heritage values . . .
I have established here that there have been no such assessments done. So the problem for Senator Harris and any other fair-minded person, I would say, is: firstly, getting the intent that he wishes expressed in the bill; but, secondly, believing that anything would be done about it, because this bill is a have. This bill is a farrago of failed promises. This bill is a steal when it comes to being fair-minded and aboveboard. This bill does not do 
 what we are told it does. You only have to look at a regional forest agreement document like this to see that.
It is not just the case in indigenous heritage, seeing we are on the matter. If you look at the clause, Chair, you will see that it also calls for environmental values—including old-growth wilderness, endangered species, national estate values and world heritage values—to be assessed. One would think when it comes to world heritage values that this would mean that there is not only an assessment but also an intention to take action. You see, Senator Harris, there is no point to a parliament which says it is going to sum up things but then fails to act on them. When it comes to world heritage in Tasmania, as Senator Troeth might be able to tell you—I do not want to be too certain about this—assessments were done of the world heritage values in Tasmania. There was a thing called a balanced panel of experts. That might have attracted Senator Troeth's attention, because she is keen on the word `balanced'. This panel had a long look at world heritage values in Tasmania and it found that they existed in places like the Huon Valley, the Picton Valley and the Weld Valley.
I will tell you a few things about those places, Chair. The Picton and Weld are tributaries of the Huon, which rises above Lake Pedder and flows generally south and east to come out into the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. The Picton comes in from the south, from Precipitous Bluff on the southern edge of Tasmania, and the Weld comes down from the north, draining the Mount Anne Massif, rising in Lake Kemp. These valleys have between them some of the most stupendous forest in the world. Conservationists in Tasmania for quite some time had a sticker saying `Save the Weld', because they were drawing on the potential for that to lead to better things, and people see the world environment being rapidly eroded. Due to their actions, quite a large part of the upper catchment and middle catchment, but not the lower catchment, of the Weld has in fact been put into world heritage. Similarly with the Picton: some of the very upper catchment, which is not forested in terms of commercial forest, 
 was in the world heritage area. Some more was added during the Green-Labor accord period of 1989-92 at the insistence of the Greens, representing the conservation community, which is quite large in Tasmania. It was a similar situation with the headwaters of the Huon.
Unfortunately, Forestry Tasmania, working on the two big political parties in Tasmania, has been able to keep the wilderness areas upstream of the Picton-Huon junction out of protected status. This is the rafting part of the Huon River. It is particularly spectacular. It has Mount Weld rising to well over 1,200 metres on the north side and Mount Picton, snow-capped at the moment, with its sub-peak or double peak of Mount Riveau, overlooking it to the south. In terms of the cultural heritage that you talk about, Senator Harris, there is an ancient track up this valley called Mackay's Track. It was cut about the turn of the century through the forests, then through the button grass plains, across the Arthur Plains to the west and on to Port Davey, because of the concern that more people would die in shipwrecks because they starved to death after being washed up on the rugged west coast of Tasmania, far away from Hobart or Launceston. This was an access track. I guess it was also an access track to the scattered Huon pining settlements and for people prospecting at that time.
The problem is that this balanced panel of experts looked at this country and said, `This is of world heritage value.' This panel included local university professors. Consequent upon that, international world heritage authorities looked at it and said, `Yes, this is of world heritage value.' Indeed, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, now called the World Conservation Union, wrote to the Prime Minister of the day and to the Premier of Tasmania and said, `These are world heritage value forests. Moreover, part of their value lies in the important role they have of protecting the wilderness values in the existing world heritage region'—the Federation Peak region to the immediate west, which is a mecca for bushwalkers, adventurers and lovers of scenery from Australia and beyond. 
So we had it established that these were world heritage values—that is what the assessment of the regional forest agreement process came up with—and therefore it would have been expected that a world heritage nomination would be forthcoming. What has happened since the regional forest agreement was signed? I note that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill, is now in the chamber. I know that he is riveted by the importance of world heritage and will be able to answer this himself, so Senator Troeth can relax a little.
—I am relaxed.
—There you are: Senator Hill brings relaxation into lots of hearts and souls as he approaches. So we had an area of world heritage values, as Senator Hill knows because he went and stood in the middle of it, in the Huon Valley, an area of clear-felled forest that was part of this world heritage suite. He stood right smack in the middle of it and looked out on it and proclaimed about it. But what has happened? Instead of it getting world heritage value, it has been fed to the woodchippers. The plan is that these forests, which are of immense value not just to Tasmania and Australia but to the whole world, are to be logged under the regional forest agreement.
If you look at the map attached to that agreement, you will see that is so. The very places that I have just been talking about, the Picton Valley, the Huon Valley and the Weld Valley, and indeed a lot more—I am just using these as examples here—of world heritage value significance are coloured a death-bringing green. Green in Tasmania means `to be logged'. Once again the whole system is shown up for the fake and the fraud that it is.
Senator Hill would defend this if he could. He has not taken part in this debate because he cannot. He is, after all, the environment minister charged with the responsibility of not only assessing world heritage values but also protecting them! He is also charged, under an international covenant, with ensuring that we protect our world heritage forests in return for other people protecting theirs.
What is Australia doing in this situation? It is defaulting. But Senator Hill waves regional forest agreements around wherever he might be when questions are brought up and says, `We have in Australia the best system in the world. We have ecologically sustainable logging. We are looking after conservation values, whoever might use those. Let me assume somebody else is proclaiming that those goals have been achieved.' But that other person is a fraud, because those aims are patently not being achieved.
If they are, let us hear from that other person. If they are, let us hear from Senator Hill. If they are, let us hear from Senator Troeth. The reality is that they are not. I find the whole process contemptible because we have government saying one thing to the nation, which is much more high-minded about the value of forests, including world heritage value forests, and doing another. We have a Prime Minister who signed a document which purports to protect world heritage but in fact feeds it to the woodchippers. What can you think of a Prime Minister who does that? What can you think of a country which is led by a philosophy which allows that?
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Harris be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-30,"—I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 1294 revised:
(1)	 Clause 3, page 3 (after line 3), at the end of paragraph (a) of the definition of  RFA , add:
			 (vi)	 national competition policy;
This amendment deals with national competition policy. This amendment aims to add in the concept of RFAs being subject to national competition policy. This amendment aims to ensure that the hardwood plantation and farm forestry sectors can compete on a commercial footing with state forestry agencies. Some 23 types of subsidy to hardwood native forest logging have been identified. This is not a level playing field in anyone's language. The need for price and competition reforms in the state forestry agencies has long been recog 
 nised as a major impediment to plantation investment.
There are a number of reports which have identified this as a problem, such as the National Plantations Advisory Council report in 1991; a Victorian Auditor-General's report in 1993; two Industry Commission reports in 1993 and 1998; and KPMG's competition policy review of the Victorian Forests Act 1958, conducted in 1999. As competition policy is an act brought in by the Labor Party last time they were in government and it is a process and legislation supported by the current coalition government, we Democrats move this amendment and look forward to its support by all parties in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-30,"—The government will not be supporting this amendment, as we consider that any reference to national competition policy is inappropriate in the context of this bill. While I am on my feet, I would like to point out to Senator Brown that I did make some statements on Quamby Bluff last week, but I suspect Senator Brown may have missed them in one of his frequent absences from the chamber. It is worth remarking that Senator Brown attends the chamber when he can make political mileage out of some subjects but he chooses not to attend the chamber when he has nothing to add to the chamber. I suggest that if he wants to find out the information that he requires on Quamby Bluff he should carefully read Hansard  of last Thursday.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—Well, is that so? What Senator Troeth said—because I was here in the chamber and she has misrepresented me, but I do not care; at least we have got a statement out of her—was that she did not know anything about what was happening on Quamby Bluff at all and that one should go and look for a Mersey management plan. She obviously does not have it, does not know anything about it and cares even less. When I asked her specifically and repeatedly—and you will remember this, Chair—about the concerns of the Deloraine Aboriginal community as far as the imminent logging on Quamby Bluff in particular was 
 concerned, as the representative at the table dealing with this issue here and now in effect she said, `I don't know. I can give you no information. Go and ask Forestry Tasmania,' which essentially means `Go and ask North', the woodchip corporation which makes donations to the coalition and is being handed control here by this process. That is not good enough.
If all that Senator Troeth can do is fall back on the hoary old one about `Senator Brown wasn't in the chamber' when in fact he was—she was taking a guess at that, and came out wrong—what else are we to believe from her? She cannot even see what is happening in front of her face. So how are we to have any reliance on what she thinks might or might not be going on in the forests? I have never heard or seen anything like this failure to be at the table in a responsible and informative manner.
Let us go back to the amendment. I will be supporting it. Senator Greig is quite right. Competition policy is the flavour of the decade, I suppose—certainly the flavour of the age; the level playing field is what we have to have. But, as is implied in Senator Greig's sensible amendment, it is not in this document. If the government wants it to apply to newsagents, hairdressers, grocers, telecommunications and everything else, why not to the way in which public assets are used? It does really. It says, `We have to have competition policy in the bureaucracy these days. That will downsize and get rid of a lot of people working in the bureaucracy.' The government has been effective, as was the previous Labor government, in achieving that end. So why not competition policy with the woodchip corporations? I will tell you why: because the big government handouts they get at state and federal levels would come under scrutiny. In fact, they would be stopped, and this rapacious woodchip industry would be instantly non-viable.
Let us look at some of the things relating, firstly, to Tasmania as far as the regional forest agreements process is concerned. The senator at the table might be able to comment on this, but I am not holding my breath. Forestry Tasmania was given $76 million for 
 new roads in new plantations, and this has led to huge destruction of forests in Tasmania, like the ones I have just been talking about. There are mountains of woodchips on the Burnie wharf, and next to them there are piles of plantation logs for export and job creation overseas. Could the government justify that? Has there been any sort of similar amount going to shore up the plantation based industry in Tasmania? I would be interested to know if the government is in the business of ensuring that the plantation industry is given the same benefits as the native forest destruction industry.
One would think, in this age of competition policy, that neither industry would be getting handouts from government. We are in the marketplace, we are told, and it is survival of the fittest. Of course, there are big players in both sectors. But you only have to look at the way things are structured in Tasmania—and I am sure you will be acquainted with these figures, Chair—to see how unfair the whole process is and how oriented towards destruction of forests it is.
Let me give you an example. If you want to cut down a native forest tree—it could be a giant in the world heritage value Huon River catchment that I was just talking about—and convert it into sawlogs, it will cost you in excess of $20 a tonne in royalty. If you want to cut it down and take it to the woodchip mill, it will cost you $12 a tonne in royalty. In other words, the government has built in an advantage for those who want to do the least value-adding, have the quickest forest rip-off for profit and have the least downstream processing. In other words, they are the least committed to creating jobs and keeping the profitability in-state, let alone in the region. Could Senator Troeth explain why that should be happening? Why is it that, in this world of competition, under this agreement, the Commonwealth is endorsing this process of giving the advantage to Harris Daishowa with its boardroom in Tokyo and the disadvantage to the small sawmills? It is a shocking state of affairs.
Senator Troeth will tell us that she is in favour of regional Australia and the people who work in the bush. Well, is that true? 
 Who is getting the advantage here—the small sawmill owner and worker? Or could it be that this is a massive golden handshake to corporations like North and Bunnings and Boral, with their boardrooms in the big cities? That is exactly what it is. No wonder they have $1 million, $2 million or $3 million a year to slip across to the Forest Protection Society to create this total myth that it is an independent organisation fighting for the rights and livelihoods of people in the bush. It is a highly subsidised front for the big woodchip corporations. They in turn are getting much more than that in de facto subsidies through the royalty structure, if you do not go on to looking at such things as $76 million for new roads and new plantations in Tasmania.
I would like the committee to hear from the government how much it has committed or already spent of the $6 million allocated to new roads, and on which roads. What you will find, if we were to get into a debate of substance here and get information instead of obfuscation, is that in fact these roads are subsidising the woodchippers. That is pure and simple—$6 million worth here. It is not going to the plantation industry; it is going to the big woodchip corporations so they can push further and harder into remote areas that have never been logged to rip out the forests and to fatten their profit lines. I might add that, as far as that is concerned, the flow-on does not even seep back to Tasmania. You would have to have a pretty wide definition of the trickle-down effect to imagine that because 97 per cent or so of the shareholders—if you take it on a fair average equivalent of population—are outside Tasmania. So all these government subsidies float across Bass Strait to improve the profit line for the already wealthy against the interests of the small home-grown industry, which Senator Troeth says she is interested in looking after. We will get no answer on the $6 million, Mr Temporary Chairman. You know how this process works.
With respect to the $57 million committed to so-called intensive forest management, how much of that will be spent on replacing native forests with plantations? That is what the big 
 woodchippers are in the business of doing. Is there a breakdown of this proposed expenditure of $57 million? This is taxpayers' money. This is the time when we as elected representatives have to scrutinise the spending of taxpayers' money, and this is no pittance—it is $57 million. Mr Howard signed on the dotted line to give this to the big woodchippers. I might add that I suppose it comes out of a different cupboard—I do not know, but I would like to see the books. On the other hand, you will find that a quarter of a million or half a million dollars as each election comes round goes to the Liberal Party, from guess who—North Pty Ltd or Bunnings Pty Ltd or Boral Pty Ltd, one way or another. I ask you, Mr Temporary Chairman: what is a fair-minded person to think of that? I asked visiting American economist Hazel Henderson about that over dinner here at Parliament House some months ago. She described it as `corruption'. I think she went on to make that point.
—Who paid for the dinner?
—I did. But there you go, I am telling you what happened. You will not find out what happens with the $57 million, Senator Forshaw. I ask: can the parliamentary secretary provide a progress report on the expenditure of the $13 million provided for employment and industry development? That would be interesting because, as the parliamentary secretary knows, despite the $13 million going in that direction to create jobs, 400-plus jobs have already been lost. So where is the money going? Who is getting the advantage there? Are we to allow this to simply float by—$13 million worth of public money to create jobs when so far we are at, I think, minus 480 jobs? What is going on here? How dare this government simply stare into space and refuse to give answers to this committee on this matter. Worse, how dare it say it is not going to support Senator Greig's amendment. Its philosophy is competition policy. It is not mine, and I dare say it possibly is not even Senator Greig's—I do not know; he can speak for himself. But that is the government policy, so why not put it in here? I well tell you why not: because the big 
 woodchip corporations have lines of communication with this government, to the detriment of almost everybody else in the industry, and they want to be excluded from the treatment that everybody else gets.
They will expound it from the rooftops, but when it comes down to their getting tens of millions of dollars through this deal, indirectly if you like, with no ostensible public benefit and no answer from the government, it fits into place that the government wants to oppose this amendment too. There is an enormous hypocrisy in the situation we see unfolding here, and that is being kind about it. It is a total failure of public accountability in even the broadest sense of that word.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be supporting the amendment moved by Democrat Senator Greig. The other day, when we dealt with an amendment from Senator Greig which proposed to put into the objects clause of the bill a reference to national competition policy principles, we opposed that and we outlined our reasons in some detail then. Our position is the same here.
This amendment seeks to put a reference in the definition clause of the bill with respect to adherence to competition policy principles. I will add a few remarks to what I said the other day. In my previous remarks, I quoted from Senator Bartlett's first speech. It was a very good speech, in which he put forward some reasons as to why one should not slavishly follow the principles of national competition policy. On this occasion I will add some additional remarks of other Democrat senators. Firstly, in a speech given on 26 June 1995 in respect of the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995, Senator Lees, quoting the Australian Consumers Association, said:
Competition policy must be set against the backdrop of the society in which it operates and be in harmony with other social policies. The overall public interest includes such factors as social equity and the natural environment.
Senator Lees went on to say:
The Democrats wholeheartedly support that premise.  

At the conclusion of her speech, Senator Lees said:
Of course, looking through the Hilmer rose-tinted glasses we are supposed to believe that competition will ensure that markets do not fail. Of course, only an ideologue would believe in that.
In a further speech on 19 November 1997 on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill, Senator Woodley said:
In fact, I think that globalisation and competition policy, which we often laud as the answer to all of our problems, is really proving—to me, at least, and I think to many other people—to be simply not working. We keep on projecting globalisation and competition policy as though we were all playing on a level playing field. I know that the rhetoric says we agree there isn't one.
In a further speech on 27 June 1995, again in respect of the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995, Senator Lees said in her concluding remarks:
We say that competition does not matter or is a secondary consideration because our first concern is to see that low income earners or people with disabilities, for example, get priority access to a particular service or that a particular service is shared out equally amongst all of us. That is what communities do. That is why we have governments. We have priorities beyond competition—priorities which we look to the government to uphold. If competition becomes the be-all and end-all, not only do consumers lose out but we also abrogate those community priorities and responsibilities.
Having professed those sentiments, I would have thought the last thing the Democrats would do would be to jump onto the national competition policy bandwagon and apply it in an absolute manner to the situation in the forestry industry and to forests generally.
You have to ask: what is the motivation? Why would they do this? Why would they put forward this amendment? They are not putting it forward because they believe inherently in national competition policy; they do not. They actually say the opposite. They say that social considerations, community considerations and environmental considerations have to be taken into account and be pre-eminent against purely market competition considerations. One has to ask why this amendment has been put forward. Clearly, it has been done to try to nobble the RFA 
 process, because the Democrats themselves know—and Senator Brown knows, and we concede—that you cannot sit the principles of national competition policy straight over the top of the forest and timber industry in this country and have total adherence. It is not going to happen.
If this legislation were to require that to be done in respect of all aspects of the negotiation of RFAs, then it would cripple the industry virtually overnight, and that is the ultimate objective of the Democrats and of the Greens in this regard. For that reason we oppose the proposition. It is inflexible; it seeks to apply a straightjacket to the timber industry into the negotiation of RFAs.
But it is not as if the issues that are relevant to national competition policy are not considered in the context of RFAs—they are. They are considered in the very way in which the Democrats have in the past said they should be considered; that is, they are considered alongside and in harmony with environmental issues, the needs of communities, social needs and so on. The way in which they are to be considered is in accordance with the principles and goals outlined in the national forest policy statement.
It is because of the amendments that we moved, which were carried by the Senate—and I appreciate the support of the Democrats and the Greens on that—to put into this bill this primary object to have adherence to the principles of the national forest policy statement that we will actually get these issues recognised in a proper context, not in some narrow, strict and, as I said, straitjacket approach. In reference to wood pricing and allocation, page 10 of the national forest policy statement says:
Wood pricing and allocation
The pricing and allocation system for wood from public native forests has a major bearing on the structure and efficiency of the wood products industry and on the return to the community from use of a publicly owned resource. The State Governments will encourage the use of logs for their highest net value-added end use. Accordingly, they will adopt the following principles as the general basis for pricing and allocation arrangements for wood from public native forests: 

- Prices will be market based, at least cover the full cost of efficient management (including regeneration) attributable to wood production, include a fair return on capital, and provide an adequate return to the community from the use of a public resource.
- Harvesting rights will reflect security of supply for wood users, will be clearly defined, and will be transferable when this does not result in the creation of excessive market power.
- The allocation system will be flexible and will involve competitive bidding arrangements for appropriate amounts of the resource, thus enabling the entry of new processors and allowing small operators to compete for niche markets.
Forest services have made significant changes to their pricing and allocation systems. They will continue to develop their systems to reflect the foregoing principles, including approaches involving competitive bidding systems where regional wood markets exist. Where competitive markets are not achievable, prices set through administratively determined allocation systems should at least cover the efficient costs of wood production and provide an adequate return to the community.
. Forest services will, where feasible, allocate a substantial proportion of harvesting rights through competitive bidding, with varying time frames and varying wood volumes, to allow opportunities for the entry of new processors and niche operators.
. Following the current review of competition policy, the State Governments will consider options for increasing the public accountability of their commercial forest operations, including through the possible application of the principles and provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974.
. The pricing and allocation policies for public plantations will be determined on the basis of commercial criteria, although the Governments acknowledge that some plantations established in the past for other than purely commercial reasons may not meet these criteria.
It is clear that, in the negotiation and the establishment of RFAs, issues such as pricing, value of resource, et cetera are to be considered—obviously, they have to be considered—and, as is indicated in what I have just read out, there is a recognition that strictly applied competition principles will not always be able to be applied.
Therefore, we believe that the appropriate way in which this issue is to be addressed is as we have done, and that is  to ensure through this legislation that there is recognition in the Commonwealth legislation of the goals and principles of the national forest 
 policy statement. We moved that amendment. It was carried by the Senate, and it will be part of the act. That is sufficient. In our view, it is not appropriate to simply try to frustrate, nobble and, indeed, destroy the process of negotiating and managing RFAs by doing what the Democrats seek to do in their amendment. On that basis, and for all the reasons that I have advanced earlier, we cannot support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—I heard nothing there that stands up to the principle of consistency. The national competition policy is, as I said earlier, something that is being pushed on all fronts in the public and the private sector with great hardships for many people, including closure of business and loss of jobs. But when it comes to the logging industries, we get a different standard from both the government and the opposition. As you know, Mr Temporary Chairman, I asked Senator Troeth, who is stonewalling—I guess, brickwalling—for the government about the $76 million of taxpayers' money that is being handed across ostensibly for the service of the big woodchip corporations in Tasmania.
—What?
—That is exactly what I would like to know, Senator Kemp. The problem is that your colleague has no answer to that question of yours—no answer at all. She is glued to the chair. When I asked about $76 million of taxpayers' money in new roads, plantation establishment and so-called intensive forestry management, she was unable to account for a cent of it. She does not know. Can you imagine going to other sectors of competitive industry and a government being mute about why the advantage is being given to a particular section as against everybody else? We are not talking about small amounts.
I was in the Tasmanian parliament in 1990 when the then Labor Premier, Michael Field, took over a quarter of a billion dollars of debt by Forestry Tasmania and transferred it into the public debt. Far from being competitive, what that said was that this was an industry which was costing the taxpayer millions. The taxpayers of Tasmania were actually paying 
 to have their forests cut down, carted to the woodchip mills, and sent to the profit-makers in Japan. And what did Labor do in that state? It hid this debt in the public debt. If you take five per cent, as a rule of thumb, interest to be paid on that debt each year, you come up with a figure of $25 million. If it is $250 million, you come up with a figure of $12½ million a year. That is $12½ million a year in little Tasmania that is not available for hospitals, for police and security, for education, for national parks, for developing clean, green industries, or for creating job programs.
Under the Greens' local employment initiatives in Tasmania, for each $1,000 you spend, you have created a job. As a rule of thumb, that is 12,500 jobs a year going down the gurgler because of Labor's secrecy and complicity with the woodchip industry in Tasmania at that time, and nothing has changed under the current Premier, Jim Bacon.
I want to ask the parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, if it is so that the regional forest agreement in Western Australia has handed 50,000 hectares of forest in approved reserves to the logging industry as part of the regional forest agreement signed over there by Prime Minister Howard. At the same time, our Prime Minister is handing out $20 million to prop up the big woodchip corporations by paying for infrastructure out of the public purse, which enables them to get in and chop down the forests of Western Australia. Is that the figure that is agreed to here? What is it for, what is the accountability, and why isn't it going to the competitive plantation industries?
If we look at East Gippsland—as Senator Troeth will know if she is an avid reader of the Age—her colleague down there, Premier Kennett, allowed one government contract to be signed which gave a woodchipper East Gippsland forests at nine cents a tonne, hugely subsidised by the public purse under this arrangement. We are talking about East Gippsland, where Mr Howard has signed the regional forest agreement but has shown total inability to follow that through to ensure that those forests, if they have to be cut down, 
 give a proper return to the people of Victoria—let alone create jobs in Victoria.
Here we have got not millions of dollars, not tens of millions of dollars, but hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money going into an industry which is already not paying its way and is not competitive, except by the largesse of taxpayers. It is a sleight of hand. It is not just the profit line you look at, and it is not just how this industry's  shares are going; it is what is put into the industry from the taxpayers' purse to build the roads for them, to establish the plantations, and to carry out so-called intensive forest management—which, as you will know from my earlier contributions, means, in the case of Tasmania where clear-felling occurs, wholesale chainsawing of ancient forest ecosystems, firebombing them and then poisoning them. And that is subsidised.
—Come on, wind it up.
—Senator Kemp interjects, but he of all people should know better. He has a responsibility to the public, hasn't he? Senator Troeth has been unable to answer; maybe he can answer about this total dereliction of responsibility. Senator Greig comes along and says, `Let's expose them to competition policy,' and both Labor and the Liberals say, `No, we won't expose to competition policy the woodchip corporations'—which, I add, are putting hundreds of thousands of dollars into their electoral coffers.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—This is the amendment by Senator Greig to add national competition policy as a matter for assessment, as far as the forest industry is concerned, before a regional forest agreement is ratified. I ask Senator Greig whether he is aware of attachment 12 of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement, which says under `Generic Industries Development Actions':
The Parties—
that is, the state and the Commonwealth: Mr Howard and the Tasmanian Premier—
agree to jointly implement the following generic actions:
The first one of those is:
Microeconomic reforms, including those in the National Competition Policy and reforms for both land and sea transport, aimed at improving the competitiveness of Australian industry.
So there it is in black and white. Because Senator Troeth is unable to answer any of these questions even though she is hosting the bill for the government, I ask Senator Greig whether he is aware that national competition policy is actually written into the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement, even though the government and, interestingly enough, the opposition are both trying to keep it out—the government being the strongest advocate of national competition policy you could possibly have.
I am also aware that Senator Greig, like me, has a country upbringing and is concerned about the interests of regional people and would be particularly aware of the impact that competition policy can have for the good and for the bad of people in rural areas. On this occasion Senator Troeth is opposing the use of national competition policy. It is in the Tasmanian RFA, and I ask Senator Troeth: is it also in regional forest agreements affecting other parts of Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia? If so, why on earth not allow Senator Greig's amendment? It is in the agreement. Why would the government want to oppose in the parliament something already written into the agreement?
—The question is that Democrat amendment No. 1 on sheet 1294 revised be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—I move Greens amendment No. 4 on sheet 1265:
(4)	 Clause 3, page 3 (line 3), at the end of paragraph (a) of the definition of  RFA  or  Regional Forest Agreement , add ""provided that those assessments have been completed and published;"".
I would like to take this amendment separately from No. 6. This amendment would insert into definitions in the bill a degree of certainty about the environmental, indigenous, economic and other assessments that have to be done before a regional forest agreement can sensibly be completed.
What we have in this process, which has been slowly evolving since 1992, is the stated intention that regional forest agreements will come out of enormous enlightenment. There has been a huge amount of homework; in fact, the Commonwealth has put some $200 million into ensuring that that homework is done before regional forest agreements are signed, so that they will not be signed in the dark or on the run, and to ensure that there has been plenty of time for them.
My amendment would add the words `provided that those assessments have been completed and published'. Let me put this into context. On page 2 of the bill, there is a definition of a regional forest agreement. It says:
RFA or Regional Forest Agreement means an agreement that is in force between the Commonwealth and a State in respect of a region or regions, being an agreement that satisfies all the following conditions:
(a)	 the agreement was entered into having regard to assessments of the following matters . . . 
It goes on to mention assessments of environmental values; assessments of old-growth forests; assessments of wilderness; assessments of endangered species; assessments of national estate values; assessments of world heritage values, which we were talking about 
 this morning; and assessments of indigenous heritage values. It goes on to include, importantly,  assessments of economic values of forested areas and forest industries; assessments of social values, which include community needs, a matter of enormous importance to Senator Troeth, who, like me, comes from the bush; and assessments of the principles of ecologically sustainable management—and we have seen silence from Senator Troeth when it comes to getting a definition of what that really means.
My amendment would make sure that a regional forest agreement is legitimate only when these assessments have been completed and published; in other words, everybody knows what they are. In a way, it is put in for emphasis, because this legislation already says that a regional forest agreement means an agreement that has had regard to such assessments. So there can be little argument, from the government or anybody else, that the words `provided that those assessments have been completed and published' should go in. It would be a nonsense if we were to believe that a bill could say, `A regional forest agreement is one which has regard to assessments' and the assessments had not been completed, because it could not have had regard to those assessments. What I am doing here is tightening up the legislation in the time-honoured belief that legislation should be clear and concise and that it should say what it means and not leave any room for doubt.
I am sure, under those circumstances, that Senator Troeth and the government—and, indeed, the opposition and everybody else—will want to support this amendment, but I have some reservations that Senator Troeth will be positive about this matter. I think she might be negative about it. Even though in western Victoria she is concerned about community needs, I think she is not going to support an amendment which ensures that community needs have been assessed before a regional forest agreement is signed. We will see soon, because she will have her opportunity to speak.
I predict, because there has been no exception to this rule so far, that Senator Troeth will let the bush down, will not stick to her 
 guns and will not require that assessments of the impact on bush communities, regional economies and community needs are done. She can cavil with this, but it may well be that community needs come a very long last in this government's estimation when lined up against woodchip corporations.
Let me look at the Central Highlands Regional Forest Agreement in Victoria, which was signed in March 1998. Do you know that the mapping of the cool temperate mixed forest there, which was supposed to be part of the assessment upon which that regional forest agreement was based, has not yet been done? And do you know that that mapping process will not even begin before the year 2000? So here we have a situation in Senator Troeth's home state where, according to this bill, a regional forest agreement has to have regard to assessments of environmental values as well as economic values and so on, but one was signed more than a year ago for the Central Highlands of Victoria without an assessment of an important component being done—the mapping of the cool temperate mixed forest. So in effect, a whole ecosystem is missing from the reserve system and is being logged. What do you think of that? I am sure Senator Troeth will break from her previous silence and tell us.
—Don't hold your breath.
—I am always optimistic that even Senator Troeth will come out of the dumbfounded mode, realise that she is being questioned about these matters, get up to speed and answer some of the questions that are critical if this committee is not going to continue to vote for a document which is not worth the paper it is written on, which is a have.
Let me look at Senator Troeth's home territory, the west of Victoria. Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, when she gets up, she will tell you that there is a regional forest agreement coming up for western Victoria. It has not been signed yet but, like all of these agreements, it is based on a comprehensive regional assessment. The  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  says that before the regional forest agreement is signed the assessment should be done. I have already pointed 
 out that that does not happen, but you have to live in hope that this shonky process is not going to keep up until every last tree in these threatened areas is cut to the ground by the woodchip corporations. Let us look at that comprehensive regional assessment.
Here is an assessment that has been done for an upcoming regional forest agreement. I ask the committee to consider this. On page 45 of that assessment, you will find an item called `The timber industry'—relevant enough to a regional forest agreement—and under that, in section 5(1), `Current position and outlook'. So we have to base our feeling about regional forest agreements on this assessment. We have a table entitled `Gross volume of logs harvested from the west region in 1997-98' and the table is in cubic metres. It has a list of grades of logs and then the sorts of trees. It takes you through each sort of tree to tell you how much of grades A, B, C, D and D-plus of logs, for each of those species, was harvested in the west region in 1997-98. The first area is the Otway, which you will know, Mr Temporary Chairman. Senator Troeth—who lives a mighty lot closer to the Otways than you do—will be as familiar with it as the back of her hand.
The first species here is ash. When you look across and add up the volume harvested in ash in the west region in 1997-98 and get to the total of all grades put together, you find it is 11,938 cubic metres. But when you add up the columns, you find that the total is wrong, that it is 23,876 cubic metres—twice as much as the table shows.
You move to the next one—mixed species—a bit more hopefully. Any list could have a mistake in it, an error, a typo. Computers do things even in the logging industry arena, things that human beings cannot prevent. For mixed species, it says that a total of 32,556 cubic metres were cut in that year in Senator Troeth's own west region. But when you add up the columns, you find that, in fact, that is wrong. It is a total of 55,191 tonnes. And so on. These huge inaccuracies go right down the column. This is an assessment upon which we—as parliamentarians, not just the public—have to make vital decisions about a regional forest agreement 
 which is coming up. Yet the figures are wrong in this table. They are not just minor aberrations; they are almost consistently wrong by up to a factor of 100 per cent.
If that is an assessment on which a regional forest agreement was made in Senator Troeth's own region, what hope is there? I know that, with her familiarity with that region and her community, she will have been through this table and picked up these mistakes—and with the whole ability of the Commonwealth department, of which she is the parliamentary secretary—and will be able to tell the committee how such enormous mistakes, which could make a 100 per cent error in cutting rates if we were to take notice of them, could be incorporated into an assessment that will lead to the Prime Minister's signature on a regional forest agreement before the end of December this year.
I am told that much of the critical assessment work for this very region has not been done. If the pattern for Western Australia, eastern and central Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania holds true, a regional forest agreement is about to be signed in Senator Troeth's own region, which has not had the assessment work done on it. We have a bill that says that such regional forest agreements will have regard to assessments, but how can they have regard to assessments that do not exist? Moreover, how can they have regard to assessments, like the one I have just referred to, that are grossly wrong? How can they have regard to assessments which are going to be done, as in the case of the Central Highlands, years after the regional forest agreement has been signed? What an appalling situation this is administratively. Where is the responsibility in it? I would like to ask Senator Troeth what her explanation is—for her home town region; maybe she cannot answer for everyone else in the country—in regard to these gross errors in that assessment and the assessments missing from the regional forest agreements that have already been signed.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be supporting this amendment. We do not believe it is necessary. 
 Indeed, it introduces to the legislation a further restrictive requirement that we would submit is intended as just one more of a whole series of proposals that could be designed to frustrate the process. The definition of a regional forest agreement requires that it be an agreement that satisfies the conditions that are laid out. One of those is that the agreement was entered into having regard to assessments of a range of matters. Those assessments would need to be done and could take a variety of forms. The proposal by Senator Brown is one which we believe is unnecessary, given that we have already proposed—indeed, this chamber has passed—an amendment to the legislation which requires that, before an RFA comes into operation, it will be the subject of both public and parliamentary scrutiny. There are certain requirements upon the Commonwealth minister to ensure that that process occurs. That is sufficient, in our view, and certainly provides opportunities, through that process, for raising concerns that people may have about the efficacy of an RFA. On that basis, we do not see a need to take the requirement as far as Senator Brown would propose.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-30,"—I also welcome you to the position of chair, Mr Temporary Chairman. The government will not be supporting this amendment. We cannot see what practical value this proposed amendment would have. For example, how could an RFA have regard to certain assessments if they were not completed? Further, while most RFA assessments have been released publicly, it may be that certain information contained in those assessments, say, on social and economic impacts, might be provided in confidence and therefore not have been published, or provided in such a way as to protect that confidentiality. So we do not see a need for this particular amendment.
I say to Senator Brown that I am aware of the agreements that have been signed and are being signed in my own state of Victoria. In my experience, those agreements have been greeted with acclaim because they have provided an extremely comprehensive assess 
 ment of community needs at every level. There has been acclaim for the signing of the North-East Regional Forest Agreement, which was reported in today's press. I also say to Senator Brown that my silence is not one of dumbfoundedness. On the contrary, it is one of contempt for the way in which he is trying to derail this process—a process which is intended to provide industry development, job security and environmental sustainability. That is why I cannot reply to some of the remarks he is making.
I return to some of the questions you have asked. With a further development of your questions on Quamby Bluff, it has been confirmed that Forestry Tasmania are not conducting forestry operations in the area at this time. The last time they conducted operations in the area was approximately between March and May in 1998 in compartment Huntsman 307. At that time some indigenous concerns were raised by the local community, and local timber harvesting plans were subsequently modified. It is not planned to conduct logging operations in the area for at least 12 months, and in any case they will not occur in the area in which sensitivity has been indicated. Communication with the local indigenous groups remains open, and since that time they have not brought any indigenous issues forward.
I also say to Senator Brown, in response to some of his earlier questions, that comprehensive regional assessments are conducted for all RFA areas, and they cover both indigenous and non-indigenous heritage values. These are also covered by the assessment of national estate values conducted by the Australian Heritage Commission prior to any RFA being signed.
Senator Brown also raised a series of questions last week regarding progress on the various actions agreed under the RFA, and he has asked a similar question today. Again, I draw to his attention my answer on Thursday in which I indicated that the first annual report on the Tasmanian RFA is publicly available and that the next report is due at the end of 1999. These reports are there for the specific purpose of providing the type of information which he is seeking. I table the 
 relevant extract for Senator Brown's information.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—The problem for the government in this matter is this. I raised the issue of world heritage value forests as an example. Forests in Tasmania that have been assessed to be of world heritage value by the balanced panel of experts set up to do that job are being logged under this regional forest agreement. If you look in a report coming out of the logging authorities such as the one that Senator Troeth just referred to, of course they are not going to have a world heritage item, because they are logging it. There is no answer to a regional forest agreement that says it is taking note of world heritage values—and indeed will protect them—but has had the assessment of the experts in that process totally overrun. Those world heritage value forests—which earlier on I described at length to the committee, so I am not going to delay the committee by doing it again—are being chainsawed down. As I said on the very brief occasion on which Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, was in this committee earlier in the day, he has been to this area; he has not only seen the forest of world heritage value standing but also seen the forest of world heritage value knocked down.
We have a situation where the minister knows about it, the assessment says these forests are of world heritage value, and we know that logging these forests is not only logging forests of world heritage value but also damaging the existing world heritage's wilderness values in particular. But rather than action being taken, or any amount of sincerity being brought to the matter, they have been sent to the bulldozers, and there is nothing that can be done about it for 20 years under this legislation, except that should some more honest and enlightened process come to the surface further down the line and some future minister decide to act to protect the world heritage value of forests—and we will come to this a little later—the woodchip corporations can demand massive amounts of public compensation, taxpayer funded compensation, in return for not logging world 
 heritage value forests. It is a totally unethical and inappropriate situation.
Senator Troeth said that forestry is not being conducted at this time on Quamby Bluff but that it will be in 12 months time. The process fails when the indigenous community at Deloraine did not know that but now has 12 months warning and has no ability whatsoever to alter the approach of the bulldozers in 12 months to this region.
—But they have not brought any issues forward.
—Senator Troeth says they have not brought any issues forward. That is the problem here. Committees are places for communication. In earlier submissions to this committee—and again I am not going to delay the committee although Senator Troeth tempts me—I brought forward, at length, the concerns of the indigenous community of Deloraine directly to Senator Troeth. Now she says they have not brought forward any concerns. If you are dealing with that sort of mind-set you have to expect that the rights and concerns of indigenous people elsewhere are similarly going to be overrun and ignored.
Senator Troeth got right to the heart of this matter in her response when she said, `How could an RFA have regard to assessments if they are not completed?' Good question. The question that really begs is: how can an RFA be legitimate if an assessment has not been completed? How can it be based on knowledge? I have moved an amendment to say that the assessments on economics, the environment, the social impact and the community concerns will be completed and published before an RFA is signed. That would solve Senator Troeth's problem, but she is going to vote against it. She sets up the question, which is `How could an RFA have regard to assessments if they are not completed,' but when I say, `Let us complete the assessments,' she says, `I am going to vote against that.'
Can you credit that? Can you credit it that this is the Howard government's approach to making decisions based on information, let alone information it itself says in this bill will be available. It is a shonk. This process is 
 tawdry. This process is not honest, it is not sincere, it is not consistent and it is not dinkum. Almost every clause that we get to—I do not know if there is an exception—points that out.
Labor says that this amendment of ours would be a further restrictive requirement designed to frustrate the process. Getting information that the Labor and Liberal parties themselves have said should be obtained—and they say it here in this bill in black and white—`before an RFA is signed'—is now being claimed to be a process that is designed to frustrate the process. How do you—
—Don't distort what we are saying, Bob. It is part of the process.
—Oh, it is now part of the process! So now the assessment on these environmental, indigenous, economic and other values does not have to be until after the RFA is signed. In other words, it does not matter to either the government or the opposition what the assessment is. It does not matter what the economic ramifications are. It does not matter what the environmental ramifications are. It does not matter what the impacts on indigenous people are, much less—or more—the social values, including community needs in the widest sense. It does not matter what the information is. These regional forest agreements are being brought into place to suit the woodchip corporations. I think Senator Troeth shook her head.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I have been very patient in listening to Senator Brown. It is clear what he is doing: he is taking every opportunity to take as long as he likes in the committee.
—Your point of order, Senator Forshaw?
—I am coming to my point of order. He is taking as long as he likes to just basically talk it out and filibuster. The point of order is this: he should actually address the specific amendment that is before the chair. Senator Brown is continually going off on longwinded rhetorical diatribes, much of which is repetitive. We hear the same thing 
 over and over again. In doing so he is distorting the position of the opposition in particular, as he has just done. I understand that to speak for a certain amount of time is a tactic that may be available to him under the standing orders, but I would have thought that in doing so he should address the specific amendment that is before the chair, not just give his umpteenth version of his second reading debate speech.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. There is no point of order, because it is available to me in this committee stage on a matter which I consider supremely important.
—I will decide, with advice, whether that is a point of order or not. What is your point of order?
—Yes, but to do that you have to listen to my reasoning, and I am maintaining that there is—
—I will rule on the point of order. I do not have to listen to your reason. Do you have a point of order, Senator Brown?
—On the point of order: you do have to listen to my reasoning, Chair. My reasoning is that there is no point of order because—
—If there is no point of order, Senator Brown, you do not have a point of order. Are you speaking to another point of order? I am ready to rule: there is no point of order.
—Thank you. That is a very wise first ruling. I agree with you entirely. The Senate has heard from the Labor Party that the assessments would need to be done.
—I never said that at all. I did not say that. This amendment is about publication of the assessment. I have never said anything about the assessments not having to be done. That is the problem, Bob. Tell the truth. Don't distort what other people say.
—Senator Forshaw, you are out of order.
—Yes, and a little emotional, Chair. Let me say that he is being dissected on this point.
—But don't you be deflected, Senator Brown. You can address the chair on your amendment.
—Yes. I am not reflecting on anybody. I am just saying what I am doing.
—I said not to be deflected. You can address the chair on your amendment, Senator Brown.
—I see, thank you. I agree with you. Senator Forshaw said that this amendment was to frustrate the process. But the bill says these assessments will be done before an RFA is signed. Senator Forshaw is saying, presumably with Labor's backing, that where an assessment is done—and they always have to be done—the only alternative to not wanting them published and made available to the public is that they will be kept secret. That has happened. Let us look at Tasmania. The world heritage panel of experts report on world heritage values in Tasmania was kept secret. Senator Forshaw will know this. Why was it kept secret? Because it said that the regional forest agreement, if signed as proposed, would destroy forests of world heritage value.
Let me talk about the Styx River valley in this situation. It is part of the Derwent River system. The Styx runs into the Derwent from the west, between Mt Field and the Snowy Range, just south of the Maydena Range. In that valley are the tallest standing trees in the Southern Hemisphere. These include trees that are much over 90 metres tall. One tree was assessed at the start of the last decade as 97 metres tall. If you have not been there, Chair, one of these days when you come to Tasmania I would delight in showing you them. To be with these trees is to be with the largest, tallest hardwood trees in the world, the second largest living entities on the face of the planet, next to the Californian redwoods.
The assessments which showed that there are supreme natural values in this region were repressed. The outcome of that is that the state and federal governments—and Mr 
 Howard signed this—have given a death warrant to much of the forest in the valley containing the tallest hardwood forests in the world, the tallest flowering plants in the world. Senator Forshaw says that I am trying to labour the point in here. I want to make this clear to the committee and I will back it up by my commitment to this in the past. As I see it, nothing could be more important than defending entities like the tallest living hardwood forests on the planet and all the wildlife that is in them and the ancient ecosystems that they maintain.
I am not alone in this. Many other MPs have been involved in protecting forests. I can name the intervention for forests of former New South Wales Premier Neville Wran, for one. Many have said at the end of their time that their achievements in protecting forests are amongst the things that they value most in their whole political career. I can also say that those who follow us, the future generations, will be glad for every last hectare of these monumental forests that we protect, but we have here a document for their destruction. That is why I feel strongly about it. I may be the only one who speaks at length, but why should I not? It is an area I know extremely well—by that I mean forest regions. They mean an enormous amount to me and the people who vote for me and for the Australian Greens in general. Other people might debate taxation bills, industry assistance bills or competition policy bills at greater length than me, although I will contribute to all of those debates, but they do not have a valid point in trying to cut me short as the debate on these vital matters unfolds.
Let me go straight back to the point made by Senator Forshaw that, before an RFA comes into operation, it will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. He said that. That is not so.
—Can be.
—You said `Will be.' That is a substantial change. The problem is that, in the unfolding of this debate, we are going to see that Labor is not going to defend that for Tasmania or East Gippsland. It specifically cuts the RFAs, once brought into operation, from being available for parlia 
 mentary scrutiny. It specifically cuts them out because of the influence of the woodchip industry, I submit, on the Labor Party, particularly in Tasmania, to ensure that it gets worse treatment than other places. You will note, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the Greens moved to fix this up and to make sure parliamentary scrutiny can take place as far as the Tasmanian and East Gippsland regional forest agreements are concerned, and we did not get the opposition support required to ensure that would happen.
I also want to draw the committee's attention to a report on Astacopsis gouldi, and the government may be able to respond to this. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-30,"—Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, I too welcome you to your new position of responsibility. The Democrats will support this amendment of Senator Brown's because it seems eminently sensible to us. The argument that RFAs ought not to be valid until assessments have been completed and published is perfectly reasonable. As a Western Australian, Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, you would know, as I do, that the debate on RFAs in our state takes on at this time two very strong points of focus. The first is the overwhelming community hostility towards the notion of continuing to log our native forests. Secondly, there is the anger towards the government which, in my state, still refuses to release the details of the RFAs and the assessments to the public, who have been demanding them.
Senator Forshaw is arguing here that, in his opinion, Senator Brown is simply trying to frustrate the process by allowing for what I see as this point of accountability in the RFA. If that is the case, he is then at odds with state Labor leader Geoff Gallop, who with his colleagues in that state continues to call for the explanation of the assessment process which took place in that state, most particularly the alleged 400 scientists who, we are told, worked together in putting together the Western Australian RFA. But they appear to be shadows in the night at this time because they remain faceless and nameless. The hostility in Western Australia over the argu 
 ment surrounding the RFAs is not simply the implacable opposition to the destruction of our native forests; it is also opposition to the conspiracy of silence that surrounds that in relation to the signing off of that agreement between the Court government and the coalition federal government. For that reason, we support Senator Brown's amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I know that Senator Brown is going to get another opportunity to speak, so I would like to make a couple of comments in response to what he has said. I also belatedly welcome you, Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot. You have already demonstrated how admirably you occupy the position.
—I value your judgment, Senator Forshaw.
—Thank you. I hope I get further opportunities to express it. What I was saying to Senator Brown in the earlier interjection is that it is quite wrong to suggest that, because we oppose this amendment, we do not believe the assessments should be done or need to be done. Senator Brown is trying to suggest that, because we would not support his amendment, which is that they be completed and published, we were somehow walking away from the process of undertaking those assessments. That is totally incorrect. The requirement is this: part of the overall process of developing, negotiating and reaching a regional forest agreement between the Commonwealth and a state involves conducting assessments on those various matters that are listed in clause 3.
But of course those matters have their genesis in the national forest policy statement, in the inter-governmental agreements reached between the Commonwealth and the states. The RFA process is one that takes a considerable amount of time. We have seen that. We have reached the position at the moment where, depending on whether or not you regard the RFA in Western Australia as a completed one, there are at least five or six RFAs now finalised and there are a number more to come for the total of nine to be finalised by the end of this year. Those 
 agreements have taken varying lengths of time.
What I am putting to the Senate, and I do not resile from it at all, is that Senator Brown's amendment and the range of his proposals are intended to insert another impediment into the process. Let me paint you this picture: state government and Commonwealth government agencies are negotiating an RFA. The assessment work is being undertaken. The effect of Senator Brown's amendment is that, before that RFA could be entered into, that assessment, whether it includes confidential information or not, would have to be published. That would introduce a new step into the process as a requirement of this parliament. One can quite clearly see what is likely to occur from Senator Brown's perspective.
—Public debate.
—No. Listening to all of Senator Brown's arguments today, Senator Brown will never accept that any assessment that has ever been done that he does not agree with is an appropriate assessment. His view is that, unless the assessments produce the result that there is no logging whatsoever in a particular area of, say, old-growth forest, or indeed probably any forest, then in his view the assessment would be invalid, incomplete, based upon false scientific evidence or whatever other reason he put up. That is his argument, and that is the argument he has been advancing all through this debate. He is saying that that is the situation with respect to the Tasmanian RFA. He is saying that in respect of the Victorian RFAs. He has already judged those assessments and found them incomplete, invalid, non-existent or whatever term he cares to use—he has used all of them—in order to support his own argument. So what then transpires in this process that Senator Brown wants to implement? A legal challenge. That is what this is about: to set up a criterion whereby further frustration, delay and challenge can be mounted against the RFA through the legal system. Frankly, we are not going to have a bar of that, if it is based upon that sort of tactical manoeuvring simply to try and support his political views on this issue.
What do we have? We have a system that the opposition has put forward and has been passed by the Senate which will allow proper and appropriate scrutiny. Firstly, there is a requirement upon the minister to make the draft RFA available for public scrutiny by having it laid on the table here and having it published in the Gazette. Secondly, it is open to any senator or any member of the House of Representatives to move for disallowance of that RFA. For instance, if a senator or a member of the House of Representatives believes that the regional forest agreement between a particular state and the Commonwealth was not based upon proper assessments, that those procedures had not been carried out properly and that regard was not given to them—and I emphasise the words that are in the definition, `having regard to the assessment'—then it is open to them to bring that matter before this chamber or before the other place by way of a notice of motion, as contained in our procedures. They will have the opportunity to undertake parliamentary scrutiny of that RFA. That presumably raises the opportunity to seek to go behind the document, the RFA itself, and examine whatever one felt needed to be examined. We believe that that is the appropriate process that should be available.
Whilst the proposed amendment by Senator Brown is dressed up as being about providing information to the public, that is not, in our view, its real intent. Its real intent is clearly to be seen in the fact that it would provide a trigger for constant legal challenge to frustrate the process. I leave my remarks there.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—The problem for Senator Forshaw's argument is that this is already open to legal challenge, as is any piece of legislation. This particular section that the Australian Greens are wishing to amend says that a regional forest agreement means an agreement that was entered into having regard to assessments of the environment and indigenous heritage values, and even principles of ecologically sustainable management. If the assessments have not been done, the agreement has not been entered into in a way which satisfies this clause. I am sure that the government has already got legal 
 advice on that, because so often it is provided with legal advice by its mentors in the woodchip industry. But I am saying that I want to protect the government from that.
—That is very kind of you, Senator.
—I am a kind person, Senator Troeth, particularly when I am thinking about the life of the forests. I am trying to protect the government by making sure that there is no doubt in this piece of legislation, that we make it clear. As I said earlier, these things should be absolutely clear, so I have moved that the words `provided that those assessments have been completed and published' be added at the end of paragraph (a).
I have heard Senator Forshaw's argument. I have heard his concern about these matters being published, that we would—through this amendment—be making sure that all the documents are available to the public. I am doing this because I believe in open government. But I have heard the concern the opposition has about all the documents being open to the public. I want to get around that problem so, with the leave of the chamber, I will ask that the amendment be shortened by taking off the words `and published'. I now seek leave to do so.
Leave not granted.
—We will stick with the `and published' and, depending on the outcome of this, I will come forward later with another amendment doing exactly the same thing. I did not see who refused leave. Are we able to know such a thing? I think it was the government anyway, wasn't it, Mr Temporary Chairman? Anyway, I will come back to that in another way.
Senator Troeth provided the committee with a report on the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement—the Commonwealth implementation report for 1998. If you look at that report, you will see in the left-hand column clause No. 39, which says that the state and the Commonwealth are `to jointly participate' in further world heritage assessment of the relevant themes by 30 June 1998. This is even after the regional forest agreement for Tas 
 mania has been signed. Here we are still working out world heritage values. The forests had been handed across to the woodchippers but we are still going through this charade of working it out; it will be done nevertheless by 30 June 1998.
Over in the right-hand column, Senator Troeth's own document says `action in 1998' to achieve that aim. Let me read what the action is:
The Commonwealth proposed by letter on 22 June 1998 the process for further assessment of the eucalypt dominated vegetation subtheme using expert workshops. Tasmania—
that is, the Tasmanian government—
agreed to the proposed approach and nominated experts and participants.
So here we have, eight days before the deadline—the umpteenth deadline—failure and a further process put in train.
It does not say who the supposed experts nominated on both sides are. But we do know that at the outset the balanced panel of experts which was set up to look at this very matter, including world authorities in the field, had its report quashed because it did not suit the woodchip industry and it did not suit Prime Minister Howard—it was banned from publication. Here we have, with a regional forest agreement that was based on suppressing and banning documents—it was not an honest process, an open process—the state and Commonwealth, the Bacon government and the Howard government, getting together to let that process down again. That is written up in Senator Troeth's own document.
If you move down to clause 14(2)(5), you will see under the column `1998 milestone action'—that is very fine sounding terminology!—the statement that the latest versions of all jointly owned data listed in schedule 1 of attachment No. 14 are to be exchanged. This is the action on looking into the environmental concerns that we are dealing with here under proposed section 3(a)(i).
Under the `target date for this action to take place', it says `within three months of the commencement of the regional forest agreement in March 1998,' so that would be March, April, May and June of 1998 to see this action in exchanging data undertaken. 
 When you move across in Senator Troeth's tabled document to see if that action was taken in 1998, here is what you get:
Data had been exchanged for the National Estate but delays were experienced for wilderness data and CRA-RFA reports and associated maps. The remaining data exchange is expected to be completed by early 1999—
That is, the year after—or this year. I am sure Senator Troeth and her minions can tell us about this action to get vital data on the wilderness in Tasmania.
Remember that more than 95 per cent of forest wilderness is going to be protected under the regional forest agreement. Here we find out that the work done in assessing wilderness areas was not done before the regional forest agreement was signed by Prime Minister Howard and it was not done before the then Liberal Premier Rundle put his signature on it. We move into the period of the now Labor government in Tasmania of Jim Bacon and a period of delays being experienced for assessing wilderness data. You know that wilderness in Tasmania has arguably been the most studied of any wilderness quotient of any state or territory—maybe with the exception of the ACT—in Australia.
—The forest has been cut down to write all the reports.
—There is a constructive interjection. We have the senator opposite, who would not know that all Australia's reports can be made from plantation timbers, saying that we have to cut down native forest. He is somewhere back in the 1950s. I know him pretty well and we have to accept that. I do not think we will see him on his feet. We will hear the interjection now and then, but to go further than that would be a fair test for Senator Abetz.
What I was saying before he interjected was that Tasmania has the best wilderness assessment data of any of the Australian states. The information was available before the regional forest agreement was signed—not least, the Australian Heritage Commission was doing very detailed studies on wilderness in Tasmania back in the mid-1980s, and the first wilderness assessments in Tasmania go right back to the 1970s.
But here it says that there has not been an exchange of information even between the two governments, because delays have been experienced in getting that data and in getting maps. It is entirely unbelievable. I do not believe that for one moment. It says then that the remaining data is expected to be completed—and exchanged, presumably—by early 1999. So that date has passed, and I ask Senator Troeth, months and months after the signing of the regional forest agreement in Tasmania and after a then consequent deadline which she presented to this committee has been passed, whether in fact either of those things is being carried through.
There are pages of this stuff, and I have looked at just one page. But does that not prove the point that what we need here is some assurance that these assessments will be completed before a regional forest agreement is signed? I maintain, unlike Labor, that they also ought to be published. How is the public going to take part in a debate if this information is not available? Being a Western Australian, Mr Temporary Chairman, you will know that one of the great criticisms of the Conservation and Land Management organisation in your state has been its proclivity for secrecy and not giving the public information, even when it does have information available, and therefore making people suspicious of the whole process.
So this is an important amendment. I think it helps get round the problem that Senator Forshaw brought up of a possible legal challenge because, if you pass this, at least with future regional forest agreements—and we have them coming down the line for Senator Troeth's own home district of western Victoria as well as south-east Queensland and elsewhere—we will make sure that assessments have been completed and published to comply with the bill as it stands. This will be an act in law if it goes through, and we should make sure that it is bomb proof. I agree with Senator Forshaw: let us make it bomb proof, let us make it beyond legal challenge, let us not leave it confused and full of holes that you could drive a bus through. That is what good legislation should not be and that is what a good committee should be safeguarding legislation against. So if we are going to get that outcome, there will be 
 support for this amendment, not just from our friends on the opposition benches but from the government itself. It is very important. It is crucial stuff.
If we put that requirement into the legislation, at least with future regional forest agreements, it is going to save legal challenge; it is going to make sure the homework is done and the information is in before the Prime Minister is put in the invidious position, to say the least, of signing a document about which it could be said, `You did not know', because it would be in Hansard. For example, in western Victoria folk are saying assessments have not been done on the Wombat Forest—a place that Senator Troeth will know very well—and that sustainable yield is not assured there. Goodness gracious—the Minister for Forestry and Conservation that Senator Troeth represents has said a reassessment should be done. If the minister says an assessment is required to work out what sustainable yield is, who is going to countermand that? But surely it should be done before a regional forest agreement is signed.
—I put the question that the amendment No. 4 moved by Senator Brown be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—I would just like to put on the record that it is not good enough for Senator Troeth, representing a minister in this place, to not be able to account for the minister's own assurances given on the public record. I was saying that Minister Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, has publicly said that there should be a reassessment of sustained yield values in the Wombat Forest area in Victoria for which there is an upcoming regional forest agreement.
Is Senator Troeth going to get up and say that Minister Tuckey is wrong, that we don't need that assessment? Because that is what her silence gives assent to. Is she going to say that Minister Tuckey is not wise enough to reckon that you should know what a sustainable yield from a forest is going to be before you sign a document which sets the sustainable yield? That is common sense. But there isn't any common sense in this process. What we are hearing in this enormous silence is 
 that, even when the minister says an assessment should be done to get to the facts, there is not going to be a follow through to ensure that those facts are available—and these are fundamental facts—before a regional forest agreement is signed. Page 2 of the legislation, under the clause we are dealing with, clause 3, says:
Regional Forest Agreement  means an agreement . . . that satisfies all the following conditions:
(a) the agreement was entered into having regard to assessments of the following matters that are relevant to the region or regions:
Subclause (c) says that the assessment should ensure that:
the agreement provides for the ecologically sustainable management and use of forested areas in the region . . . 
that are under study. In the section I am dealing with it says that there will have been an assessment of the `principles' of ecologically sustainable management. This is what I am moving to have published. It is impossible for subclause (c) to be fulfilled if subclause (a)(v) hasn't already been done—in other words, if you haven't got an assessment of the principles of ecologically sustainable management for an area. It is not possible to have principles of ecologically sustainable management even in the government's terms—which means how much logging can be sustained to maximise output—if you haven't got a sustainable yield worked out. Minister Tuckey says there has to be a review for Western Victoria of sustainable yield.
The whole thing is a pack of cards which falls down at the minister's own indication. A regional forest agreement signing is imminent and so far as we know—and Senator Troeth is agreeing with this, I take it, from her silence—there hasn't been a sustainable yield assessment review, as Minister Tuckey has called for. I am sure, Mr Temporary Chairman Watson, that you will give Senator Troeth ample opportunity to give us a progress report on her colleague's work in reassessing a sustainable yield in the Wombat Forest. That is pretty critical to our deliberations here today.
I want to come back to the impossibility of what Labor is suggesting, that the assessments 
 don't have to be done, or would not need to be done, or might not necessarily be done because the RFAs will be brought back here before parliament. I want to make this point clear. I come from Tasmania and, like you, sir, love the place and value very much that it is not made second-rate. But Labor is making it second-rate because it says: `Yes, assessments for the mainland but not for Tasmania.' Labor's amendment says that the regional forest agreement can be brought back here to parliament for review, unless it is in Tasmania or East Gippsland. So there is an impossible-to-fathom duality here, a difference of treatment, unless you understand the politics of it and the work of the Bacon government and the Labor Party in Tasmania to ensure that Tasmania doesn't get fair treatment in this matter and that a regional forest agreement is not brought up for review in the interests of the wider public. That is the problem.
This is a very important amendment. I will be moving a reassessment for it. In view of the government's refusal of leave to shorten this amendment I will try again a little later. However, I would prefer this amendment to pass in the form in which it is printed.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—That was defeated because I couldn't get Democrat support for it, obviously. I move amendment No. (6):
(6)	 Page 3 (after line 30), after clause 4, insert:
4A  Minister to be satisfied of certain criteria before entering into an RFA
		 The Minister must not enter into an RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth unless the Minister is satisfied that:
		 (a)	 having examined the capacity of existing plantations and recycling activities to supply wood for processing in Australia and published a report of that examination—there is no feasible and prudent alternative; and
		 (b)	 the agreement provides that further clearing of public native forests for non-forest use or plantation establishment will be avoided;
		 (c)	 there will be no detrimental effect on the quantity and quality of water in the 
 region as a result of actions taken under the RFA; and
		 (d)	 there will not be an increase in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of actions taken under the RFA; and
		 (e)	 the State which is a party to the RFA has a wood products industry plan in place for further processing of wood sourced from existing plantations.
I know that that last one in particular will appeal to the opposition. I want to take them in order because this particularly important amendment brings this bill in line with the national forest policy, which was begun under the Hawke government, developed further under the Keating government and finalised under the Howard government. So we have unison of support here.
One of the important things about the regional forest agreement process is that prudent and feasible alternatives to logging native forests have not been looked at. Those who were on the Senate inquiry will remember that this was a major shortcoming pointed out by experts in the field. In other words, we have a wood products industry in Australia, with those wood products coming from native forests and, on the other hand, wood products coming from plantations and recycling, but this process of regional forest agreements looks at native forests to the total exclusion of plantations and recycling.
Those of us who attended the Parliamentary Library forum last Wednesday will remember that forest analyst Judy Clarke told that forum that, these days, 75 per cent of wood products come from plantations and recycling and 25 per cent from the native forests. We have this extraordinary oversight. The move out of native forests into plantation for the production of all Australia's wood needs is happening rapidly anyway. It has been postulated by Ms Judy Clarke and others that there is already enough wood available in plantations to meet all our needs. Senator Quirke will know that in South Australia, which is not big on forests, the plantation allocation or availability there is already providing well over 90 per cent, if not 95 per cent, of that state's needs as far as wood products are concerned. That could apply and can apply right now in the other states. So there is a feasible and 
 prudent alternative to logging native forests. We do not have to go through this tortuous business of trying to zip up and close the public concern for protecting native forests. With expeditious use of government moneys, we could be moving to facilitate its moving immediately across to the plantation basis.
I also am very aware that in this matter the words `feasible' and `prudent' have not just been plucked out of the air. They are in the current government legislation when it comes to drawing up environmental impact assessments whereby, under the federal law, the minister is required to look at feasible and prudent alternatives where he or she is involved in a project that involves the Commonwealth. My concern here, and the reason for this amendment, is that that is being done away with in this legislation. `Feasible' and `prudent' go out the window. Commonwealth assessment of forests goes out the window. It is all handed back to state governments, which are under no such impulsion. So this extremely important and reasonable provision, if we do not build it into this legislation, will be thrown out the window.
Part (b) of my amendment says that the minister should be satisfied that:
. . . the agreement—
the regional forest agreement—
provides that further clearing of public native forests for non-forest use or plantation establishment will be avoided.
I will not delay the committee by going over that ground again. But what we have found—and Senator Troeth has, as far as I have heard, agreed—is that establishing plantations in places like the Tarkine in Tasmania and in the southern forests that we were just talking about involves destruction of world heritage and national estate forests because it is a cut down, burn and poison process. Because this bill says that regional forest agreements have to involve ecologically sustainable forests, this amendment makes sure that it does not involve clearing public native forests for non-forest use because we know that that destroys the ecosystems of those native forests.
Section (c) of my amendment says that the minister should be satisfied that there will be no detrimental effect on the quantity and 
 quality of water in the region as a result of actions taken under the regional forest agreement. Senator Troeth—and, I am sure, you, Mr Temporary Chairman—will know that the quality of water is a matter of supreme and growing importance to all Australians. People are concerned that there is a deterioration of the water that is going into water dispensing systems for all manner of uses. But if you look at the minister's own area of Western Victoria, you find that, under the regional assessment there, there has been no discussion of the value of water versus timber in the Otways, even though under this legislation, the minister—in her own region—would be caught in the process of allowing logging in the catchments, for example, of the Otways. I can tell you one thing that is surer than the prospect of us getting dinner tonight—
Senator Troeth interjecting—
—And that is that logging of those catchments will sully the water systems, and that worries people in the region. I did not quite catch Senator Troeth's comment on that, but I know she will give it to us in full later. What I want to ensure is that we will be true to the tenet of meeting community concerns—`community needs' is the exact term under the `Social Values' section—by doing an assessment of those community needs before a regional forest agreement is signed and by making sure that the water quality and quantity will not be sullied by logging operations carried out under that regional forest agreement. That is simple and plain—and popular as well, I can tell you, Mr Temporary Chairman.
Under section (d) of my amendment there is a requirement that the minister be satisfied that there will not be an increase in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of actions taken under the regional forest agreement. That is very important because—as Parliamentary Secretary Troeth could tell you, Mr Temporary Chairman—logging of old-growth forests involves a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. That is because old-growth forests are carbon banks. One expert in the field told me—and I will come to this a little bit later because this is a very important part of our upcoming debate—that the amount of 
 carbon stored in forests is equivalent to the square of the diameter of the tree. So as you get bigger forests, older forests, the amount of carbon in those forests goes up pretty well exponentially. When you cut down those forests, particularly in the burning process that occurs in Tasmania, much of that carbon escapes into the atmosphere. That which does not goes through the woodchip stream into the making of new paper in Japan. That paper goes to landfills where, due to the rotting of the landfills, much of the matter escapes into the atmosphere as greenhouse gas anyway.
It is interesting to note that the sheer cheapness of woodchips in Australia is undermining the recycling business in Japan. That is a sensible alternative to this, but the rug is being cut from under it. The chair of the recyclers combination in Japan told me that himself when he visited Tasmania a few years back. So not only are we creating a problem by cutting down native forests and releasing otherwise stored and stable greenhouse gases into the atmosphere but, at the other end of the line, we are creating a problem whereby we see massive amounts of recycled paper that would otherwise be brought into use being dumped to create further greenhouse gas emissions.
The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill—as Senator Troeth will aver—has been very strong on greenhouse gases and feels very proud of Australia's achievements in this field. So he would not, I am sure, want Senator Troeth to turn down an amendment to make sure that a minister involved did not increase the greenhouse gas emissions that result from actions taken in cutting down Australia's native forests.
Finally, part (e) of the amendment says:
. . . the State which is a party to the RFA has a wood products industry plan in place for further processing of wood sourced from existing plantations.
I wish my colleague Senator Murphy were here because I am sure he would support this. I am sure his colleagues will want to. It is a good amendment, and I think you would agree with that as well, Mr Temporary Chairman. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-30,"—This amendment prohibits the minister from entering into an RFA unless he is satisfied that various criteria have been met. This proposed new clause is an absolute recipe for ongoing litigation, as opponents of RFAs could continually question whether the minister properly considered all the issues proposed under this clause. As we have just heard from Senator Brown's exhaustive description, anything and everything could be taken into account. Potentially, this proposed clause could bring the RFA process to a grinding halt; and let's face it, that is the real aim of the Australian Greens. This is one way in which they are trying to destroy and derail this proposed legislation, as we have seen from Senator Brown's activities over the last few days.
Under current Commonwealth legislation under which the RFA process operates, the minister signing the RFA has to ensure that all environmental and heritage legislative obligations are first met. As Senator Brown well knows, that includes consideration of effects on water quantity and water quality. So in this regard the proposed clause is, at best, duplicating what is already in existence. At worst, it opens up the minister for double jeopardy.
Some of the other considerations which are proposed in this amendment, such as avoidance of further public native forest clearing for non-forest use or plantation establishment and the prohibition on any increase in greenhouse gas emissions, are not, even if they were practical, the primary focus of RFAs, and therefore they may not be pertinent considerations for all RFAs. For those reasons, the government will be opposing this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-30,"—The opposition is also unable to support this amendment. Whilst I take note of Senator Brown's supporting remarks that it is based upon the national forest policy statement objectives, we submit that it actually takes those objectives much further. In particular, it turns a number of them into absolute and immediate requirements. Of course 
 the underlying basis of the national forest policy statement is that the agreement between the states and the Commonwealth in developing RFAs is to bring about change and improvements—some of those are identified in Senator Brown's amendment—and to do so in a balanced and progressive way. It is not possible that each of those requirements would or could be immediately met, such as the proposal that the minister must not enter into an RFA unless the minister is satisfied that there would not be an increase in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of actions taken under the RFA.
We believe that the intention is to bring about improvements over time, but, given that RFAs are in the process of being negotiated and are to be finalised before the end of this year, it is not possible in each case to guarantee that every one of those requirements would be met. If this amendment were to be passed and those absolute tests that Senator Brown seeks to put into this legislation were applied, it would mean that the federal minister could not sign an RFA, notwithstanding that it may well comply with all of the requirements of the national forest policy statement.
We believe that our amendment—which has been passed by the Senate—to reflect the goals and the requirements of the national forest policy statement in the objects of the act is the appropriate approach to be taken in regard to these matters. Each of the issues that Senator Brown's amendment is directed towards is picked up in one way or another in the objects clause. For instance, issues in respect of water quality, promoting further processing of timber from plantations and the development of industry plans are picked up in the first object in the clause, which is to develop:
an internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable wood production and wood product industries, maximising value-adding opportunities and efficient use of wood resources . . . 
We would suggest that, while some, if not all, of the objectives that Senator Brown has directed his attention to here are noble ones, they are reflected in the national forest policy statement and they are reflected in our objects 
 clause. To put them into the bill in the way Senator Brown proposes, whereby they become absolute requirements that must be met immediately or there can be no RFA, is to distort the purpose of the national forest policy statement and unduly frustrate the process of developing and finalising regional forest agreements.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—As I was saying before the dinner adjournment, one of the very important components of this amendment is to ensure that the minister who is involved with the regional forest agreements in any area of Australia looks at prudent and feasible alternatives to the logging of native forests. The obvious prudent and feasible alternative is the plantations of this nation which can supply our legitimate needs for wood and paper. Australia has well over a million hectares of plantations. Plantations and recycling already provide 75 per cent of the wood and paper based employment in the country.
When Senator Quirke was in the chamber before, I was referring to the example of South Australia which has no native forest logging industry at all but its plantation industry employs six times as many people as the entire Australian native forest export woodchip industry, although it uses only one-tenth as much wood. So on an employment to wood ratio, that is a 60 to one advantage from the South Australian plantation industry, with its downstream processing, compared to the woodchip industry in native forests which does its downstream processing overseas.
Ten years ago, Tasmania had four pulp or paper mills consuming old-growth native forests. Now there is none. We have heard from other members of the committee how Amcor's mill at Burnie imports material from Indonesia. The newsprint mill at Boyer—that is at New Norfolk, just upriver on the Derwent from Hobart—consumes some regrowth native forest, as does the Wesley Vale mill up near Devonport. Plantations provide the bulk of the input to these mills nowadays—things have changed. Meanwhile, two of the four 
 pulp mills have closed altogether due to international market forces.
ABARE's forest product statistics show that in the last year sawn timber produced from native forests has decreased by seven per cent, while sawn timber produced from plantations has increased by 14 per cent. Australia's native forest sawn timber production in plantations is now 2.230 million cubic metres per annum, whereas native forest is not much more than half that at 1.418 million cubic metres per annum, a fall of seven per cent. Despite these trends, the unimaginative old-growth destroyers of the native forest industry are still trying to compete directly with the plantation industry for products such as scantlings, palings and pallets. They are cutting their own throats and dooming their own workers to unemployment queues.
As we were discussing earlier, the only way in which this can continue is for the people who are cutting down native forest timbers to get more and more public subsidy. We see attendant on this legislation and the regional forest agreements tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money being poured into a non-competitive industry. It is not going into the established plantation industry; primarily, it is going into the native forest industry to help them compete when they are not competitive.
What would be helpful to the committee—to underscore what I am saying—is for Senator Troeth to give us the government's figures on how many people are employed around Australia, with a breakdown for each state—that would be better still—in the plantation sector I have been talking about, and then how many people are employed around the country in each state in the native forest sector of the wood and wood products industries. What other figures? My amendment, I maintain, says, `Let's make sure that we get this industry across to the prudent, feasible and employment rich alternative of a plantation industry based on downstream processing.' The government wants to lock in for 20 years the imprudent and, of itself, unfeasible—it needs propping up with public money—and destructive alternative of the logging of the forests.
The national forest policy statement, which both the government and industry say is the basis for the legislation before us, said that native forests were not to be cleared for plantations. But the government, in this legislation, has totally jettisoned that commitment—one of many. There is a fundamental commitment that gets thrown out because, as we know, for example in Tasmania's wild forests, the logging operations lead from mature, ancient rainforest and tall eucalypt forest ecosystems to cultures of genetically modified, fast growing plantation species, bereft of the richness of the original ecosystem.
The figures I have show that in Tasmania last year, on public land alone, over 7,000 hectares of native forest were slated for replacement by plantations—that is, 45 per cent of all the forest logged was leading to plantation establishment. So much for the national forest policy statement and its commitment. That 45 per cent included old-growth forest and rainforest. At least a similar amount was cleared on private land in Tasmania. About 15,000 hectares of native forests are destroyed every year in Tasmania to make way for plantations, paid for by the Commonwealth taxpayer. This is totally unnecessary because we already have the plantation base for our wood needs in this country. This is a profit driven industry, and I submit that it would not even be that if it were not for the transfer—indirectly and directly—of taxpayers' money through governments into the industry which gives it the profit line required for sustenance.
The figures I have just given are backed up by the Tasmanian Forest Practices Board annual report of 1997-98. That report stated that the proportion of logged state forests in Tasmania converted to plantation rose from 14 per cent in 1996-97 to 42 per cent in 1997. On private land, it rose from 45 per cent to 53 per cent. The government is thumbing its nose at the national forest policy statement and, far from reversing the replacement of wild ecosystems and native forest ecosystems—of whatever quality—and keeping those in what Senator Troeth tells us are sustainable forestry operations, in an ecologi 
 cal sense we are getting an acceleration of the destruction. It is actually being accelerated.
Once again, we see that this bill is not worth the paper it is written on. It is doing the exact opposite of its promise. The Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement says that a minimum of 80 per cent of the state's forest has to be managed as native forest in perpetuity. That means that 20 per cent of Tasmania's forest had been written off for total destruction at the outset to be replaced by plantations and other non-forest uses. But on North Forest Products' private land in the north-west of the state, in areas fringing the Tarkine and elsewhere, the state government—and this was endorsed by the federal Howard government—licensed the destruction of 6,800  hectares of pure rainforest for plantations in 1997. How far backwards we have gone. Ten years ago, this was banned. You could not log such rainforests for woodchip and export.
However, instead of improving forest management, while we hear the term `ecologically sustainable logging' squeaked all over the place, it in fact turns out to be a determined lie. The rainforests off that 6,800 hectares now sit on squalid piles of woodchips at the Burnie wharf. They are the dark coloured ones against the lighter coloured eucalypt pile. These are not little piles that you might imagine a sand pile to be; these are piles where bulldozers drive up one side, across the top and down the other. They are huge. You can imagine those 6,800 hectares of rainforest that I want to save through this amendment because it is unnecessary that they are destroyed for this pursuit. They are amazing; they are beautiful. I have distributed pictures of them in this chamber showing how they end up as windrows and rubbish tips to be burnt at the end of this so-called ecologically sustainable process. All the wildlife in them will be dead; all the ecosystems, we are told, will be ruined, and it is all totally unnecessary because the plantation establishment is there to provide our needs.
It is a pity that Senator Murphy is not here because I think he has spoken on the matter in this place. But if he has not done so, I will outline it to the committee anyway. North, 
 which owns these forests, advertised for a component of them to be used as sawlogs. We are told that it is a sawlog driven industry. A couple of people applied and said, `We will come and take some of the sawlogs before you woodchip them.' That is how, we are told, the healthy industry works. Their applications were not accepted. Every stick of those rainforests is in that woodchip pile at Burnie under the tenets of this government's forest policies. Who can justify that? Certainly not Senator Troeth; certainly not Minister Tuckey, were he here; definitely not Senator Hill, whose record on the forest environment in this country will be counted against him forever.
The government is exporting this mentality to other states through its 2020 Vision of 1996, which aims to treble the area of Australia's plantations by the year 2020. Much of this will be at the expense of native forests, woodlands and grasslands—the very things that we are told will be protected in this regional forest agreement. People might think that I should go quietly on this. I will not. Let it be on the record. That is all I can do; I do not have the numbers here. But let it be stated at least that no member of this chamber votes for this bill with their eyes shut—votes for the inherent duplicity and destructiveness of this legislation. Here I am moving for a feasible and prudent alternative which is available to this government, and the test is whether either the government or the opposition will support it.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-30,"—The Democrats support this amendment by Senator Brown. We do so because the amendment seeks—and it is the core of this issue—to take the notion of the environment and put it smack bang in the centre of the regional forestry debate, which is so lacking on the question of the environment. Earlier Senator Abetz was in the chamber and Senator Brown was speaking on the need for completing and then publishing the results of assessments on RFAs. From across the chamber, Senator Abetz interjected that that would require the felling of further trees to print the paper. There is no greater illustration than that comment as to how wrong both the govern 
 ment and opposition are in approaching the issue of wood and paper.
As has been said time and time again—though it has fallen on deaf ears, I fear—we do not have to log our native forests to produce paper. It is that simple. There are alternatives. We must look seriously at plantation timbers, we must look seriously at hemp production and I am learning of late about the exciting prospects of a new African development called kenaf. The double benefit of that is that it contributes in terms of the carbon sink. One of the points Senator Brown is making with item (d) of his amendment is that there ought to be no increase in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of actions taken under the RFA. If we get away from the notion of logging and destroying our native forests and towards the production of alternatives, we have the potential, the opportunity, to produce thousands of hectares of hemp, for example, not only grown to be harvested and then processed into paper, saving the destruction of our native forests from woodchipping, but in the process acting as an immense carbon sink and contributing towards the reduction of greenhouse gases.
As I said, this amendment at its core forces people to take a position on the notion of `Environment'—with a capital E—in this entire debate and takes us away from this relentless mantra that the forests are there simply to be a kind of factory, to be plundered in the name of jobs, when in fact we know that there is much greater potential for labour-intensive programs under production timbers. For those reasons principally, we Democrats support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—I think the government members here are alert to what is going on and I am surprised that there has been no comment on this. There has been a deafening silence. It is quite irresponsible. This is the debate the destroyers of native forest do not want to have. They do not want to face the fact that what they are doing is unnecessary. The whole point of this legislation is to enforce an industry which has no legitimacy. It has no legitimacy because it is not necessary and the people of Australia 
 do not want it. There is a prudent and feasible alternative.
I would have thought that we would have Senator Troeth and the government well versed on this and putting forward the usual counterarguments. But at least she has had the sense to recognise that those arguments cannot be justified. They do not hold water. She is not going to get caught trying to defend the indefensible; I will give her that. She is not going to get caught trying to say that the plantations do not exist, that they are not in volumes enough to supply all our wood needs, that every bit of framing timber that is required for housing, for example, can come out of plantations these days. We do not need to cut a further native forest tree down. The minister also, by her silence, is acceding to the fact that the plantation base is there for paper making in this country and we do not need to maraud our forests any more. I thank her for that acknowledgment.
It has been said earlier in the debate, by the way—and I am sure you are a bit puzzled by this, Chair—that we have to fix up our balance of payments because we are paying twice as much for imports of forest products as we pay for exports. But that is not facing the reality that we export twice as much wood as we import. What we are importing, if you look at those figures, is worth four times as much per tonne as what we are exporting. Why is that? That is because the downstream processing is done overseas. They are not as silly as this government and the people behind this RFA. They know that is where both the profitability and the job creation are.
But what are we doing in Australia under an RFA that exists in Tasmania? Filling up the wharves with piles of woodchips out of native forests, including rainforests, as I have just said. Next to them are the huge, bigger than a house, plantation timber log piles going to South Korea for processing. Is this industry prudent and feasible? No wonder the government opposes those two words being endorsed. There is nothing prudent in the way in which this government is locking in the fate of the native forests in this country for the next 20 years and everything feasible in better alternatives. I am so sorry that we 
 cannot get a debate on this issue in this chamber at this time and that, with all the might and weight of the Howard government behind these regional forest agreements, this government is not even prepared to debate the central win-win situation put forward in this chamber tonight.
We have repeatedly seen today how this RFA does not hold up. It is a colossal fraud and illegitimate—and unarguably so, otherwise we would have the government up here arguing the position. Of course it cannot. It does not serve regional Australia, because if that were the case we would be promoting plantations and downstream processing where the job creation is. Let me give you an example. Twenty-four months ago I visited a native plantation sawmill at Scottsdale in north-east Tasmania. It was highly automated. The Greens had a proposal there for moderate investment in downstream processing and assistance to the plantation based industry in north-east Tasmania. It was much less investment than the colossal amount being handed across to the woodchip industries. What we were proposing there would have created 800 jobs for regional Australia.
We should be debating that here tonight, but instead we have a silent minister and an absent government that knows it cannot take on this debate against one or two senators who feel strongly about forests. It has capitulated because it knows it is wrong. That was highlighted by today's brief visit in here by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill, who should be sitting at Senator Troeth's side now. He is the one who assured us about ecologically sustainable logging. His absence, in particular, from this chamber throughout this debate speaks of the failure of the government to honour those words `ecologically sustainable logging'. If the government did honour those words it would be supporting this amendment. This amendment calls on the minister to make sure that ecologically sustainable logging occurs and that the logging that occurs in this country is the most prudent, within feasibility, logging that the nation can have. But the government sits bolted to its seats for the debate itself—though not when it comes time 
 for a vote on this, because they will move to the other side of the chamber if I get the Democrats' support for a division. I think it is culpable. All we can do is get that set down on the record.
 One only has to look at the furore at the moment in Western Australia over governments that do that sort of thing to be able to sound a warning here in this heartland debate we are having at the moment. The government, like the Court government in Western Australia, cannot put its head in the sand and hope that nothing will happen as a result of this intransigence and deliberate effort to fool itself, because it cannot fool the populace at large. We are going to get out of this a campaign against native forest logging for the next 20 years, if that is how long it takes. We are going to get pressure all the way down the line for the government to turn around, come back to this night and undo what it is doing tonight by turning down this amendment which would make sure that the minister not necessarily goes across to the plantation alternative but assesses it before regional forest agreements proceed. That is what this amendment says. The government is not prepared to do that. It says, `No, we deliberately refuse to look at the alternatives that are available.' When it does that, it turns its back on a very informed and earnest public opinion out there.
When this issue continues to blow up in the coming years and the concern that is in Western Australia at the moment reignites in the eastern states in the wake of this legislation, it will be because tonight, when Senator Troeth was challenged to get up and argue the case against plantations being the source of Australia's wood based products immediately and into the future, she sat bolted to her seat yet again. It is irresponsible and it is to be condemned. It is quite clear that this amendment will not proceed, but let it go on the record that we tried. Let it go on the record that the government—and the opposition with it—not only voted it down but also refused to get up and debate it.
I cannot say how strongly I feel about that matter, how strongly the people who support the Australian Greens feel about that matter 
 or how strongly an even bigger number of people who do not vote for the Australian Greens feel about that matter. This is a failure of responsibility in a democratic system of government. It is a failure of information, it is a failure of debate, it is a failure to respond to public opinion, and it is all on the altar of a handful of woodchip corporations that make big donations to the government's election coffers. What could be worse than that?
There we are. We have a lot more amendments to get on with and I am in favour of expediting this debate as best we can. It would be faster if the government were giving answers and responses, but in the wake of that we are left to disclaim about the government and to move on to the next amendment hoping that we will get a better response, but the form of the last two days shows that that is not so. However, I commend this amendment. It is a central amendment. It is a challenge to the government's commitment to the national forest policy which it says underwrites the regional forest agreement. I conclude by saying that the government's actions show that that is a lie. That is a deliberate and carefully thought out subterfuge. I feel sorry for the parliamentary secretary, who has to try to defend that situation. As I said earlier, I know that her silence means she agrees with the argument I am putting. That is how I assess the situation.
—Don't be ridiculous.
—The parliamentary secretary says that that is ridiculous. That being the case she can get up and put her point of view. Otherwise I simply say that she is not up to it. The government has left her stranded because it is not up to it either. Behind all this are the hands of some big and influential corporations pulling the rug from under the national interest and, through weak-kneed politicians, getting their way.
	 Question put:
	 That the amendment (Senator Brown's ) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—I move the Australian Greens amendment on sheet 1527:
Clause 3, page 3 (after line 3), at the end of paragraph (a) of the definition of  RFA  or  Regional Forest Agreement , add ""provided that those assessments have been completed"".
I would be pleased if the committee would give consideration to this new amendment. It comes about, as you will be aware, Mr Temporary Chairman, because the government blocked my seeking of leave to give this very amendment before dinner. Just so the committee knows what this means, we are back to the definitions on page 3 of the bill, in particular the central definition of a regional forest agreement. The bill reads that a regional forest agreement means an agreement that is enforced between the Commonwealth and a state in respect of a region or regions and 
 that satisfies a number of conditions, the first of those being that an agreement was entered into having regard to assessments on matters which it lists. They are environmental values, old growth, wilderness, endangered species, national estate values and world heritage values. Then under a separate category there is indigenous heritage values. The third one is economic values of forested areas and forest industries, the fourth one is social values, including community needs, and the fifth one is the principles of ecologically sustainable management. I would add after that the words `provided that those assessments have been completed'.
Firstly, let me reiterate that I believe the government is getting itself into a mess here if it does not get rid of the internal contradiction of defining regional forest agreements as having needed to have regard to the assessments on those matters but then not requiring that the assessments have been done at all. It is crazy. What this amendment does is simply confirm that the assessments will be done so that they can be considered, before the regional forest agreement is signed, on the basis of the information coming out of those assessments. That is what the national forest policy said will happen. That is what Senator Troeth says will happen. That is what all parties agree is going to happen. But I have been able to inform the committee comprehensively today about how there is a massive across-the-board failure of the very commitment to see that the assessments are done and the information is in before the regional forest agreements are signed. This is no light matter. Mr Temporary Chairman, I am just having a little bit of trouble with the conversation and concentrating on the procedure at the moment.
—I do not think you should let the conversation bother you, Senator Brown.
—But it is bothering me, Mr Temporary Chairman. Thank you.
—I think you contributed more toward bringing about order than I did, Senator Brown.
—This is very important to me and I do want to concentrate on it, and 
 I want the committee to concentrate on it. The problem is that we have heard how with existing regional forest agreements the assessments are not done. In fact, Senator Troeth provided the committee with a progress report, if you like, on the Tasmanian agreement. I just looked at page 1 and was able to immediately spot, in the government's own assessment, two cases where it not only had not done the assessment before the regional forest agreement was signed by the Prime Minister but also then set a date afterwards for the assessment to be completed and failed to do that. Ridiculous indeed, to use Senator Troeth's word. I am trying to help the government to get this process at least onto the track that it was always promised to be on.
Earlier, before dinner, Senator Forshaw said, `Senator Brown is trying to make this legally challengeable by setting conditions that are not met.' That gave the game away. I am just making it clear and indisputable that the bill means what it says: that there will be assessments done in those matters listed in the run-up to a regional forest agreement. But earlier when I tried to make that clear and defined, the government and opposition said no. The jury is out on that, and that is why this amendment is here.
If I understood Senator Forshaw correctly, the particular concern of the opposition was that my original amendments had provided that the assessments be completed and published. There was some concern that that would simply lead to the information becoming available to the public and therefore the public being armed with information which would make it difficult, supposedly, for those in this industry to defend themselves against. That is their time-honoured tactic; there is nothing new in that. I did not want to endorse it but Senator Forshaw is concerned about it, so I have taken the words `and published' off the end of this.
You will remember, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the committee turned down my original amendment—I could not even get a person to help call a division on that one—but now we have this pure and simple. The government should be supporting this. The amendment makes it abundantly clear that the 
 assessment comes in, regard is given to the assessment by both parties—that is, the Commonwealth and the state involved—and then, on the basis of that, an agreement is reached which is in effect the regional forest agreement. In that way we do not have the Prime Minister flying to Perth, Brisbane, Hobart, Sydney or Melbourne signing documents that are misleading or misuse the promise to the Australian people that this work would be done and that, based on it, there would be assurances that there would be ecologically sustainable logging. I maintain that I am here preventing—at least for future regional forest agreements, because I think the horses have bolted in the ones that have been signed in recent times—the government from getting itself in a position where there could be a legal challenge.
By the way, Mr Temporary Chairman, I would encourage Senator Troeth to inform the committee of any legal advice the government might have that would help throw light on this matter. If the government has not got legal advice on this, I can assure you that the woodchip corporations have. They provide their legal advice to the government; they have done that in drawing up this legislation. They advised the government, for example, to put in clause 7 on compensation and the government said, `Please give it to us and we will put it in.' So that information is there and it would be very helpful to the committee to have that information, which would encourage us all to vote for this amendment.
The assessments were to be done in Western Australia as well as in Tasmania. I have outlined the Tasmanian ones and I do not want to delay the committee by going over that territory again, so let us move to Western Australia and have a little look at the outcome of the assessments there. Some of the things that had to be assured in that assessment were the principles of ecologically sustainable management, as well as environmental values for wilderness, old-growth forests, endangered species and so on.
The outcome as of 1 June this year—there have been some adjustments since—was that for old-growth forests 55,000 hectares of `new' old-growth reservation was announced 
 but, secretly, 9,300 hectares of already approved old-growth reservation under the then forest management plan had been revoked. So up front the government is saying it is doing this but out the back it is whittling away the very promise of the plan being revealed to the public. We are left with a net increase of just 45,700 hectares or 13 per cent of the conservation and land management authority's figure for total remaining old-growth forest to be protected. More than half of that—26,300 hectares—is woodland or non-commercial old-growth forest that industry would not have wanted and could not have logged commercially anyway. Industry get in the main, on average, the big, most majestic and inspiring forests of the lot to destroy.
The total old-growth forest in genuine conservation reserves, according to a Western Australian Forest Alliance analysis, goes from 46 to 60 per cent, or from 4.6 per cent to six per cent of the original old-growth forest—six per cent of what was there in the first place. That is called a `comprehensive and adequate reserve system'. The West Australian Forest Alliance is not a favourite of the government, and I think even Minister Tuckey has said some disparaging things about arguments and the need for science and facts in Western Australia. Well, I have a lot more here. But, just on the ones that I have read out, it is clear that the homework has been done. Representing Minister Tuckey tonight is Senator Troeth, and her silence after I sit down will be testament to the fact that these figures are correct and that the national forest policy, in terms of it being carried into an honest fulfilment in this document, has been abandoned.
Ten per cent of remaining old-growth forest will be in so-called informal reserves in Western Australia and their narrow strips of degraded forest remnants left along streams and roads after the bulk of the forest is clear-felled. That is the leftovers syndrome, which is central to the sleight of hand that occurs when governments announce they are conserving forests but really they are not. The other 30 per cent of old-growth forest is now available for wholesale clear-felling and woodchipping, which gives industry a grand 
 total of 56 per cent of the original old-growth forests in Western Australia and genuine conservation six per cent.
Early in this debate, Senator Troeth spoke about balance. You see that that is where we end up. The people who put funds into the government election coffers and their associates get 56 per cent of the forests and the patch in the pants conservation groups—which represent 87 per cent of the feeling of the people of Western Australia, according to the last opinion poll I saw—get six per cent. There is something rotten in a process which leads to an outcome like that and there is something disdainful about a government advocate who says that that is balance.
Genuine reservation in the karri main belt forest type in Western Australia is up by just 1,515 hectares under the failure of the assessment system which I am trying to fix up through this amendment. It has gone up by that amount to 28,838 hectares, which is 54 per cent of current old growth—that is what is left—but it is only 14½ per cent of the original old growth. Of the total of 295,000 hectares of new reserves, which the regional forest agreement in Western Australia proclaims on page 32, 27 per cent is old growth and 43 per cent is regrowth. The total forest reserves are just 144,000 hectares and 30 per cent is non-forest. So on it goes. You need these assessments to come in. There needs to be honesty brought back into this, and the government needs to be rescued from the duplicity of this situation by ensuring that these assessments have been completed and assessed and that only then the Prime Minister is asked to put his signature on them at the end of an honest and proper process. So I recommend this amendment to the government and to the committee.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-30,"—Just very briefly and simply, I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting Senator Brown's amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-30,"—The government will not be supporting this amendment for the reasons I outlined before. I would like to refer back, while I am on my 
 feet, to Senator Brown's claim earlier that Minister Tuckey had said that a reassessment of the sustained yield figure for the Wombat state forest was necessary. In fact, Mr Tuckey said that an independent assessment of the sustained yield calculation should be conducted so that the community could have absolute confidence that the Wombat forest is being sustainably managed. Mr Tuckey is confident that this will in fact confirm the reliability of the Victorian system but believed, following representations from the Wombat Forest Society and the agreement of the Victorian minister, that an independent assessment was appropriate. The results are expected to be available for inclusion in the directions report for the West Victorian RFA. I should report that a similar process was used in Western Australia when similar concerns were raised.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—If that is the case, for reasons I have just been enumerating, we have to worry, don't we? So Minister Tuckey has confirmed, through Senator Troeth, that I was right—that he has called for a reassessment and that he wants that to be independent. The question that immediately arises is: who is the independent reassessor? Is this not just another agent of the woodchip or the logging industry? Senator Troeth is amused by that, but I feel it is a very serious inquiry, and my concerns on behalf of the people who think the Wombat forest is being cut unsustainably—and remember that this is in Senator Troeth's own home area—deserve to get a truly independent arbiter in this matter.
We who are conservation advocates and believe in the alternative plantations I was speaking about earlier are sick to death of governments getting in people from the logging industry to assess the logging industry. I explained earlier that, when somebody does break away from that system and reports come out that do not favour the industry, they get squelched, they get sat on, they are refused public exhibition and they are shredded. I would think the same situation applies to the Wombat forest. I do not know whether the government is going to support my amendment. I was speaking about the Western 
 Australian situation. I could go on at great length about the areas of Western Australia where there was promise of protection under the process outlined in this section of the bill, the definition of the regional forest agreement, but that promise has been broken. Here I have an amendment which simply says, `Let's stop the promise breaking. Let's make this an honest process.' Can you believe that the government is not even prepared to comment on that? I will make a prediction: it is going to vote against it, but the Labor Party will not.
—You're no genius. I just said we were.
—I might not be a genius, but I did say earlier that I was an optimist, and my optimism has taken a battering during the day. While I give the government plaudits for its consistently negative attitude to any constructive proposal brought up in this place, I am always optimistic that it will support an amendment which helps its own case and defends its very assailable position.
But if this does end up in the courts, as Senator Forshaw thinks it might, this debate will be at least read by those people on either side who want to find out why the government put forward such a sloppy definition and who, on the basis of RFAs already signed, had no intention of keeping within it anyway. On every regional forest agreement signed it has broken the promise in this definition that assessments and regional forest agreements would be done on the basis of knowledge. There is no exception to that rule. Senator Forshaw said that Labor was concerned about the information getting into public hands.
—I did not say that. Why don't you tell the truth. Check the Hansard . I never said that. Come on!
—We will both have a read of the Hansard . The fact is that Senator Forshaw voted down my amendment.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. It concerns the necessity for Senator Brown to at least try to stick to the amendment. While I am on my feet, I did indicate to Senator Brown that our amendment provides for the matter to be laid 
 on the table. Draft copies are available. If that is not providing information to the public, I do not know what is.
—There is no point of order. Senator Forshaw, I ask you to not go into debate when you are on a point of order in future. There is a time to do that, and it is not when you are taking a point of order.
—I was just making the point that the Labor Party voted down my amendment to have these assessments made public. However, I felt the debate left open room for voting for the fact that at least the assessment should be completed, hence this amendment. The amendment comes about because I did hold a hope that Labor would support it. If that happened and the Democrats supported it, we would get breakthrough support for an amendment.
—But you won't.
—But we won't, says Labor. They know that Labor governments, like the one in Tasmania, which is not even threatened by this amendment because it has ensured second-rate treatment for Tasmania, would not have a bar of having this process put on the rails. So there it is.
—The question is that Greens amendment No. 1 on sheet 1527 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-30,"—I move Democrats amendment No. 2 on sheet 1294, revised:
(2)	 Clause 3, page 3 (after line 3), after paragraph (a) of the definition of  RFA , insert:
		 (aa)	 the agreement was entered into only after having been made available for public comment;
Democrat amendment No. 2 relates to public comment. We feel that this is largely self-explanatory. We believe strongly that there should be a public comment process on the use of our forests. In Western Australia the opportunity for public comment was promised but was not given. This then set up a climate of secrecy and suspicion, which advantages no-one but those who benefit from the secrecy of government decisions.
As I said earlier in relation to another amendment, there are two core aspects to the reaction to the RFA in Western Australia. On the one part, there is hostility towards it because of the overwhelming rejection by the general community towards the whole notion of logging our native forests. The second part is the way in which the state government went about it, in conjunction with the federal government, and the secrecy that was inherent in both aspects of that. Given that both the Labor Party and the coalition have made many comments about this issue when they 
 have been in opposition, and both claim to aspire to public accountability with every election, it stands to reason that they ought to support this amendment, and we look forward to their support on it.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-30,"—The government is perfectly satisfied that the amount of public comment which is able to be used on the regional forest agreements is more than adequate to enable everyone who wishes to say anything or to make any sort of submission on the regional forest agreements to do so. Those people have every opportunity to make their views known, and therefore the government will not be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I indicate that the opposition does not see the need for the amendment. Accordingly, we will not support it. But, in saying that, I think that it needs to be put clearly on the record that we believe that there is a substantial opportunity for the public to be involved in the process. If nothing else, what has occurred in Western Australia in recent times demonstrates that that opportunity has been available.
We understand, of course, that governments or ministers may not necessarily always take notice of that public view. That is why we have sought to amend the legislation in the manner in which we have. Such things as the insertion of the objects clause, recognising the detailed national goals of the national forest policy statement, and, more particularly, our amendments to provide for a process of public and parliamentary scrutiny are the means by which public comment and public involvement can occur. Of course, ultimately, that can be taken up in this parliament in the manner that we have proposed. Consequently, we do not see the need for the particularly restrictive proposal from the Democrats.
Frankly, the debate has already been had. There has been a lot said about this whole issue. As I said earlier in an interjection, there has also been a lot of misinterpretation—in fact, a lot of deliberate misrepresentation—particularly by Senator Brown, of the position 
 of the opposition; and the record will show what. We do not see the need for this amendment, particularly bearing in mind the amendments that we proposed, which have already been passed by the Senate and which we believe are adequate.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—Let me assure the opposition that I do not engage in deliberate misrepresentation. But as you will know, Mr Temporary Chairman, in the interpretation of what people say in this chamber there will be differences of opinion, and that is all that has occurred here. I did not mean to upset the good senator in my interpretation of what I thought I heard him say earlier in the day. I am sorry if he feels that way about it.
I support this amendment because it is just plain commonsense. Would it not have saved the Court government in Western Australia a heck of a lot of trauma if this amendment had been in place? What Senator Greig is saying is that, when a regional forest agreement is ready for the Prime Minister's signature with whichever state leader is involved, it should be put out for public comment. The public should have a look at it before the Prime Minister signs it. Remember that as things stand in this committee and as this legislation came to us from the House of Representatives, there is no opportunity for parliamentary review. Even under the foreshadowed Labor amendments there will be no opportunity for parliamentary review for Victorians in East Gippsland or for Tasmanians—none at all. Even if there were, one thing that is much better and more essential than parliamentary review is public review, because—and let us get this absolutely clear, Mr Temporary Chairman—the forests do not belong to us in this chamber and they do not belong to the government ministry or the bureaucracy; they belong to the people of this country.
So is it not right and proper that, for an agreement which for 20 years locks destructive woodchipping and other logging practices into those forests—and there is no getting them back once the forest ecosystems have been destroyed—the public have a say on what the government says is the end to that destruction because we are going to get 
 ecologically sustainable logging? Senator Troeth could not tell us what that meant. There is no definition in this legislation of what that means. So where do you have to go to see what ecologically sustainable logging—the bulwark of this promise to the public—is? You have to go to the regional forest agreement itself. The definition varies from state to state, and Senator Troeth agrees with that. I tried to get an amendment through so that ecologically sustainable logging would be the same around the country, but the government wants it to be different from place to place and, in that sense, hints already at the duplicity in the use of those terms, because we have established that ecologically sustainable logging is excluded by clear-fell woodchipping practices. But the promise is there. That is what we are dealing with in the definition of the regional forest agreement. It says:
. . . the agreement provides for the ecologically sustainable management and use of forested areas in the region.
Senator Greig has referred to Western Australia. What happened in Western Australia was that the regional forest agreement came out and Mr Howard and Premier Court said, `This is ecologically sustainable forestry here,' and the people of Western Australia, in their wisdom, threw that out of court. They knew that that was bunkum. They knew that that was absolutely inconsistent with the regional forest agreement, with its wholesale destruction of the magnificent forests in south-west Western Australia over the next 20 years.
So great was the furore after the signatures went on the paper that the government in Western Australia started fracturing itself. And so great was the furore that thousands upon thousands of people turned out in the streets and in the halls of Perth—and indeed elsewhere in Western Australia—to protest about this failure of the promise of ecologically sustainable logging in Western Australia. And there are continuing protests in the other states—in my home state of Tasmania, in Victoria and in New South Wales—where regional forest agreements have been entered into. How much more sensible it would be, once the regional forest agreements come out, to let the people see them and respond before 
 trapping the Prime Minister in the situation of putting his signature to a document, the promise of which is found to be not in the substance. I do not know whether the Prime Minister wants to be put in that position or not. He has done it repeatedly, so I suspect that, if he does, he is a repeat offender in that sense.
We have here a government that is scared of public opinion in this matter. It does not want to face up to the Australian public and those consistent opinion polls showing that the government is wrong, wrong, wrong on this matter. No amount of deception will change that, but I think the government inherently agrees with you, Senator Greig—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—that the public exercise brought forward in this amendment, of allowing comment on a regional forest agreement before it is signed, will uncover its shortcomings, and that is the last thing the government wants. That is the last thing the government's bullying allies in the woodchip industry want, and the last thing that thugs who beat up conservationists or their equipment or threaten their lives in the forests want is for the public to have a fair go. What a situation.
Senator Greig says, `Let's learn from that experience' and, at least with future regional forest agreements—and there are more coming down the line—make them available for public comment before some other government gets into this Court government mess and this Howard government mess. This government has become recidivist. It says, `We owe too much to our woodchip corporation sponsors to allow ourselves to be opened up to public opinion.' That is why it is not going to support this amendment.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-30,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos R4 and 6:
(R4)	 Clause 3, page 3 (after line 8), after paragraph (c) of the definition of  RFA  or  Regional Forest Agreement , insert:
		 (ca)	 if the agreement is made after 1 March 1999, it was made in accordance with the public and parliamentary scrutiny provisions of this Act; 

(6)	 Clause 3, page 3 (after line 10) after paragraph (d) of the definition of  RFA  or  Regional Forest Agreement , insert:
		 (da)	 the agreement provides for structural adjustment packages, including relocation and retraining for affected workers and their families;
Amendment No. R4 proposes to vary clause 3 to insert a new paragraph (ca). Just about everything that needs to be said has been said in earlier debates with regard to this issue. The amendment gives effect to other proposals which have already been endorsed by the Senate, whereby regional forest agreements made after 1 March 1999 are open to the processes of public and parliamentary scrutiny that are outlined primarily in amendment No. 7, which was carried earlier.
I can anticipate some of the arguments that will be put by Senator Brown in particular, because he has said on a number of occasions that this proposal applies to RFAs entered into after 1 March and, by virtue of that, three existing RFAs would not be subject to the processes of scrutiny that any subsequent RFAs would be.
There are two points I wish to address here. Since this bill was introduced into the parliament in June 1998, we have consistently expressed the concern that the government was seeking a blank cheque from the parliament for legislative backing for agreements that, at that stage, had not been finalised and whose terms and conditions were as yet unknown. That is still the case.
There has been a significant passage of time since the bill was first introduced, since the report of the Senate committee, and indeed before the debate has come on in the committee stage. In that time, only three further RFAs have been finalised. One of those is the RFA in Western Australia which has been the subject of substantial public debate and concern and has also been the subject of political—I don't want to use Wilson Tuckey's word `warfare'—disagreement. There has been another RFA finalised only recently in Victoria and another one in recent days in the south-east of New South Wales.
That still leaves some three or more RFAs to be negotiated and finalised before the end 
 of this year. In at least one of those cases—the WA RFA—there is substantial disquiet and concern, particularly with regard to the decision of the Western Australian government, subsequent to the signing of the RFA, to unilaterally change conditions in the future for logging in old-growth forests. That has led to a situation where it is questionable as to whether or not there really is any agreement in total between the Western Australian government and the federal government and the federal minister as to a precise and permanent RFA for Western Australia.
The two other RFAs that I referred to in Victoria and in New South Wales, whilst they have been signed, have only recently been signed and would be subject to the proposed public and parliamentary scrutiny provisions that we have put before the Senate, which have indeed been passed. That is because they have been signed after 1 March 1999.
The principle really is this: the first three RFAs—that is, in Tasmania, East Gippsland and the Central Highlands of Victoria—certainly at the time of the introduction of this legislation and certainly at the time the legislation came before, firstly, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for consideration and, subsequently, before this chamber, have been in operation for a substantial period. Implementation of those RFAs was well under way. They enjoyed bipartisan support from the relevant state governments and parliaments. Indeed, they had been signed off by the state government and the federal government well in advance of the debate commencing on this legislation in this chamber.
We have taken the view that it would be totally unfair, and would frustrate and possibly seriously impede the operation of those agreements, to have subjected them to the processes that we have put forward in this legislation for parliamentary scrutiny. No doubt some will argue that this is inequitable treatment, but it is not, the reason being that those three RFAs—the Tasmanian RFA and the two in Victoria—had been implemented, were well under way, had been in operation for some time and had been subject to a substantial amount of not only public scrutiny 
 but also parliamentary scrutiny, at least certainly in debates. If nothing else, one can point to the evidence that was put before the Senate committee in relation to the number of inquiries that had been conducted in respect of the Tasmanian RFA and the whole issue of forestry in Tasmania.
 We have a different situation to confront when we deal with those RFAs that are still remaining to be finalised or those that have only just been finalised. We believe it is appropriate that the provisions we have put forward would apply to those RFAs and to any others that are to be entered into between now and the proposed cut-off date of 31 December this year. It really is about the question of the integrity of the RFA processes and providing an opportunity for them to be subject to the scrutiny that we have outlined.
Our amendment gives effect to the requirement that, if the agreement is made after 1 March 1999, it is made in accordance with the public and parliamentary scrutiny provisions of this act. The revised amendment that is proposed here picks up the proposition or suggestion that was actually contained in the legal advice obtained by the government, which Mr Tuckey sought to rely on to suggest that the proposals were unconstitutional. We have rejected those arguments but, further, it was made clear in that advice that terminology along these lines would clearly be constitutional.
The other amendment, amendment No. 6, proposes to add to the definition of an RFA or a regional forest agreement the following words:
. . . the agreement provides for structural adjustment packages, including relocation and retraining for affected workers and their families . . . 
This gives effect to a recognition in the legislation that an essential part of this whole process is the structural adjustment that will occur, that will have to be funded and that will include appropriate relocation and retraining for affected workers and their families and be consistent with our objective and the objectives of the national forest policy statement with respect to the future development and restructuring of this industry. I would urge senators to support these amendments. 
 They are integral to the key amendments that we have moved: firstly, a provision for public and parliamentary scrutiny; and, secondly, recognition of the need to develop and enhance our forest product industries through bodies such as the wood and paper industry council.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-30,"—On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I move amendment No. 8 to opposition amendment No. R4 as shown on sheet 1290:
(8)	 Amendment (R4), paragraph (ca) of the definition of  RFA  or  Regional Forest Agreement , omit ""if the agreement is made after 1 March 1999, it"", substitute ""the agreement"".
Quite simply, our amendment seeks to go further. It seems to us that there are no logical or rational reasons why 1 March should be the cut-off date for reviewing signed RFAs and allowing for a future disallowance other than the political reasons, which have not been articulated. Our theory is that what we have before us is not so much a sociological or environmental proposal as a political one.
Taking the review process back to 1 March would, I suspect, very much advantage the Labor Party because of the simple fact that it would mean reopening the thorny issue of the RFA in my home state of Western Australia, where the issue continues to be a millstone around the neck of the government and where community outrage is as strong as it has ever been. The RFA in Western Australia has been a debacle from start to finish. It would clearly be to the advantage of the Labor Party to capitalise on that, and setting the date of 1 March to go back and review it would allow that to happen. But then we must ask the question: why stop there? Why not look at all RFAs? The answer, I suggest, is that that would mean we would have to look at some other thorny RFAs, most particularly in Tasmania, where there is a state Labor government. We believe that all RFAs, not just some, should be subject to this part of the definition, and we stand by that.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-30,"—May I add, for the benefit of Senator Greig, that when the proposal was first mooted the date of 1 March was chosen as a date in the future. Indeed, the opposi 
 tion's position was clearly enunciated in the Senate committee report and subsequently developed in the draft amendments. That position was that future RFAs should be subject to a process of parliamentary scrutiny. At that time—and I have already commented on this—the legislation was due to come before the parliament in February. It did not do so and it has been on the Notice Paper  virtually since that time. When we drafted our amendments we did so on the basis that future RFAs should be subject to the process. However, one had to specify a date and the date 1 March was set because it was a date considered appropriate at that time. Prior to that, there were only three RFAs in operation and they had been negotiated and signed off much earlier.
The fact that time has elapsed beyond the date of 1 March is not a reason, in our view, to bring the date further forward. Our position has always been that there were special circumstances as to why the three existing RFAs that have been in operation for some time, and indeed before this legislation came before the chamber, should not be subject to those provisions but all other RFAs should be. That is the explanation. There is nothing magical about the date of 1 March other than that those are the circumstances in which that date was chosen at the time. It would still be applicable, in our view, because it would allow for those that have been signed off since that time, only in recent weeks, to come within the purview of the amendments that we have proposed in respect of parliamentary scrutiny.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-30,"—I wish to indicate that the government will be voting against both opposition amendment No. 4 and opposition amendment No. 6. Opposition amendment No. 4 is an attempt to retrospectively discriminate against the RFA for the South-West forest region in Western Australia signed on 4 March 1999 and, inadvertently or otherwise, any other RFA signed after that date, such as the RFA for the North-East region of Victoria, which was signed on 23 August 1999, and the RFA for the Eden 
 region in New South Wales, signed on 25 August 1999.
—WA was 4 May, not 4 March.
—Thank you, Senator Forshaw. My point still stands. As it currently stands, the Western Australian, North-East Victorian and Eden RFAs have not been made in accordance with parliamentary and public scrutiny provisions contained in the opposition's proposed amendments; nor have the three other RFAs signed prior to 1 March 1999. However, at this time it is only the Western Australian, North-East Victorian and Eden RFAs that would not receive the protection of the bill if it were to come into force today.
How are those three RFAs different from the Tasmanian RFA, the East Gippsland RFA or the Central Highlands RFA? The only difference appears to be a political one, not one that goes to the substance of the agreement or to the process undertaken in its development. The situation foreshadows the political football that the future RFAs will become if the parliamentary scrutiny process adopted by the Senate ever comes into operation. Indeed, I have legal advice from the Office of General Counsel that raises serious doubts that such a provision is enforceable in any case. I quote from advice given on 10 August 1999, page 5, paragraph 10, and pages 6 to 7, paragraphs 13, 14, 15 and 17:
At the outset it should be stressed that the operation of the proposed amendment to the definition of ""RFA or Regional Forest Agreement"" and a number of other provisions of the Bill is not clear . . . I think that a court may have difficulty in giving the proposed amendment of the definition of ""RFA or Regional Forest Agreement"" . . . any effect.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Another problem is the logical inconsistency of requirements relating to parliamentary and public scrutiny purporting to apply at a time before any RFA is in place. Since the RFA has not been concluded at that point, it cannot impose any such requirement.
. . .              . . .             . . .
In addition, the requirements in the Act relating to parliamentary and public scrutiny are preconditions to an RFA being made—once the RFA is made those provisions can have no effect. 

Also once an agreement has been made, the public and parliamentary scrutiny provisions of the Act cannot be complied with. Even with the proposed operation of draft paragraph (ca) of the definition, as that provision is in the form of a requirement for an RFA rather than actions that need to have been taken for an RFA to be valid, a court may well hold that the provision cannot be complied with. Therefore, in my opinion, the provision is so uncertain in its operation that it is very difficult to say what approach a court may take.
So the government will be voting against amendment No. 4.
With regard to opposition amendment No. 6, there is no indication in the proposed amendment as to what benchmark an RFA would have to meet to qualify as providing for such structural adjustment packages. If we look at the RFAs that have been entered into to date, there is no single approach taken to this issue. This is due to the fact that, firstly, the impact of an RFA on industry structure in each region is different, requiring different approaches to structural adjustment. For example, there is no structural adjustment package for Tasmania, although there is a package related to industry development initiatives. Secondly, in states with multiple RFAs, such as Victoria and New South Wales, structural adjustment packages are constructed on a state-wide basis, so there is likely to be only passing reference to them in individual RFAs.
This proposed amendment will also serve to create confusion. For example, there are similar concerns to those expressed previously as to whether existing RFAs would be able to comply with these definitional requirements, thus requiring amendment and subsequent parliamentary scrutiny. For those reasons, we do not support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—The government says that bringing regional forest agreements—so far understrapped by $200 million of taxpayers' money—before the parliament involves retrospective discrimination and that it will be a political football. I put it to you, Chair, that the Prime Minister of this country, the Rt Hon. John Howard, flying to Tasmania to sign a regional forest agreement—with minimal forewarning, with his then Liberal colleague in Tasmania, and 
 running into immediate protest from the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities and having to leave the signing ceremony over a cornfield—is a farce. It was not a political football but an absolute farce. It is a dereliction of the Prime Minister's responsibility to ensure that parliament is the scrutineer when it comes to not only the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money but also the exploitation of Australia's forests, which belong to the Australian people.
Senator Troeth said it will end in confusion, variously also saying en route that it will not stand up in the court. I do not think there is much confidence in that assessment by the government or it would not be opposing this amendment so vehemently. But it will end up in confusion. Is that not what we have got in Western Australia? And who is most confused there? It is the Liberal Party, split all over the place and caught out by a public that will not put up with this process, because there was not a review process by either the people or the parliament. When the government says there are legal questions about this Labor Party amendment and presumably therefore the worthy amendment from the Democrats of that amendment, it begs the question of why the government does not want these regional forest agreements vetted by the parliament. What does the government want to hide? I can tell you: it is huge public opposition to these regional forest agreements and it is a tremendous commitment to the companies I have spoken about a number of times today who visit the halls of power, and who find it so easy to connect with the political power base in this place and to have their way against massive public opposition.
If the process will not stand up in court, then let the government put forward the process that will stand up in court. There is no doubt that the court will read the intent of this amendment, see that the parliament meant for there to be scrutiny and proceed from that base. I think probably the advisers to the government think, `Well, we have to give the advice that the government wants to hear so, for the sake of this public debate, we will say the court might not accept this as a legitimate 
 amendment to the legislation.' Well, it is at least as good as the shoddy piece of legislation that the government has brought in here which, as I said earlier, you can drive a bus through in all directions. When I tried to amend it to help the government, to at least mend a few holes in this leaking sieve, the government turned down the help. It does not want it.
Of course that is all nonsense. The government here does not want the people to be able to review the regional forest agreements or have a say in them after they are formulated and it does not want the parliament, on behalf of the people, to do that either. It is a thoroughly undemocratic attitude—with its face against the people, its subservience to the big end of town against the interests of the people of Australia. I want to make it clear that, as a Tasmanian, I am appalled that there would be any senator in this place who might vote against Senator Greig's amendment. Why should we—or, for that matter, why should the people of East Gippsland or the Central Highlands of Victoria—get second-class treatment under the Labor amendment as it stands? Senator Forshaw gave us an argument about when the decision was made to proceed with this policy. I have given the political analysis which is behind that.
Let me just talk a little bit about Tasmania. In Tasmania we have a government which is brutal and which has seen no peer when it comes to its proclivity to destroy the world heritage, national heritage and eternal values of the great forests of Tasmania. You would have thought that a Labor government could not be worse than a Liberal government, but it could be and it is. The Liberal government, which then had a dependency, to some degree, on the Greens led by Christine Milne in the House of Assembly—before Labor and Liberal got together to change the electoral system as their only means of being able to reduce the number of Greens in the parliament—decided that a minimal 50,000 hectares or so of Tasmania's great forests should be protected, including the Valley of the Giants in the Counsel River area. All members have seen these majestic trees towering out of 
 picture and as stunning as anything you would see in California.
What did the Labor government want in Tasmania? The Labor government wanted those woodchipped as well. I am no fool when it comes to the reality that that government has had the influence in the national caucus to use a device like this to get around the Tasmanian RFA coming under the same scrutiny as the Western Australian or the New South Wales RFAs. To use a time device is precious, to say the least. That will not stand up in court. I will agree with Senator Troeth on that. No independent tribunal would say that there is any reasonable argument for having parliamentary scrutiny of all the RFAs in Australia except the Tasmanian, East Gippsland and Central Highlands of Victoria RFAs. What nonsense! I will not expand on that, because the case is absurd. We are left with the next best option of going with the Labor agreement.
I think it does raise some questions. It could be argued that it treats some states differently from others. I do not know who is going to challenge on it or what the basis of standing for a challenge would be, but it does raise the spectre of one state being treated differently from another or one region being treated differently from another. One would have to go and read the Constitution, particularly section 99, carefully to feel absolutely sure that we are not being discourteous to that particular provision in the way Labor has brought this amendment forward. Senator Greig has, amongst other things, fixed up the concern about that. His amendment would make sure we give equal treatment to all the regions and all the states. As a stickler for the Constitution as it stands, until it is altered, I would want to support him on that. I will be supporting this important amendment to the amendment, brought forward by the Democrats.
—The question is that the Democrat amendment to opposition amendment No. R4 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-30,"—There are a few people I can see through here on occasions, Madam Chairman, but I know what the trouble is and I thank you very much for clearing the way. We now go back to the Labor amendment and I ask this simple question of a government that may not want the New South Wales regional forest agreements brought before this place for scrutiny: is it true that, under the regional forest agree 
 ment in south-east New South Wales, 10,000 hectares of breeding koala habitat is up to be logged? If that is bolted down in the regional forest agreement, let Senator Troeth tell the chamber and let us hear why it is that this chamber should not debate that matter. Here we have the nation's emblem; here we have the disgusting outcome in south-east New South Wales where logging of some form—I will allow the government spokesperson to describe it—is going to occur in 10,000 hectares of breeding koala habitat near Bermagui. Could anybody think that that matter ought not be discussed in this place?
If we do not take that as a matter for discussion, we have the provisions coming down the line—we will be debating those tomorrow—for compensation for the big woodchip players, including Harris Daishowa, the wholly Japanese owned company at the Eden woodchip mill, which, by the way, in breach of Premier Bob Carr's assurance before the last election in New South Wales, is going to continue to woodchip after the year 2000, with I think 130,000-plus tonnes per annum coming out of New South Wales forests. Isn't it right and proper that this chamber be able to look at that commitment made to the people of New South Wales which is breached by the regional forest agreement? I think it is. After all, the Prime Minister is to put his signature to this agreement. Isn't it fair that we be able to look at whether the Prime Minister has upheld his promise to ecologically sustainable logging, which we now find is invading koala habitat?
There is no limit to the elasticity of the abuse of that term, and there ought to be no limit to the way in which the parliament can scrutinise an outcome which promises one thing and not only fails to deliver but also gives the exact opposite, which is devastation of the habitat of koalas, for goodness sake. Even if you do not see that as the main game in these regional forest agreements, surely you would think that the outcomes of the spending of $200 million ought to be a matter for review by this chamber, let alone the fact that we have just knocked Tasmania, East Gippsland and the central highlands of Victoria out of the prospect.
Labor's second amendment proposes that the regional forest agreement provide for structural adjustment packages, including relocation and retraining for affected workers and their families. Ought we not be agreeing with that? After all, Senator Troeth herself says on behalf of the government that this is about jobs. Patently it is not, because in Tasmania, for one, 400 jobs have been lost, not gained, since the Prime Minister put his signature on the document, having spent tens of millions of dollars which is going into the profit lines of the big woodchip companies. I agree with Senator Troeth to some degree that it is a bit vague, but at least it is an effort to find some succour and reparation for the very people the woodchip corporations put out of work. There are 20,000 people lost out of the industry since those corporations first arrived here and set up their mills in 1969. I think this is the first time, by the way, in parliamentary history anywhere in this country that either of the big parties has moved to help in some way assuage the damage done to people kicked out of an industry which they have supported through thick and thin. More will be kicked out in their thousands, regardless of whether or not regional forest agreements come before this parliament and regardless of how well they are set up.
There is massive compensation in here for the woodchip corporations but nothing for the workers. What a sham. What an abuse of those workers. I have spoken to some of the union representatives who picket conservationists. I have also spoken to owners of boutiques and abusive sportspeople who have a difference of opinion with conservationists. I have said, `Hey, where is your compensation package in these regional forest agreements?' They had no answer to it. What they are doing in effect is fighting for million dollar backup packages for the big corporations and nothing for the workers. But here at least is an effort in that direction by the Labor Party.
I am not sure, by the way, who should fund these structural adjustment packages. In my book, the industry should do it, much the same as I believe the mining industry in general should fund, at the end of the day, those people who have given it good service. 
 I do not think there should be any further impost on the public purse, but maybe Senator Forshaw could clear the air on that one. Either way, however, I agree with that particular amendment; I think it is absolutely essential.
I will be moving later to remove this unseemly largesse to the big woodchip corporations. But, if we are going to give backup insurance to anybody, surely it has to be to the workers—those very people in regional Australia whose interests Senator Troeth says she is defending. I am not quite sure why the two amendments have been moved together but I support them. It is absolutely essential that the regional forest agreements do get scrutiny before the parliament.
We had a group of lobbyists from north-east New South Wales visit this place a bit over a week ago. Many members would have heard from them. They are extremely anxious about the outcome of the regional forest agreement up there. They have seen the pattern around the rest of the country, they believe that their interests in terms of protecting forests are being secretly undermined, and they absolutely want parliament to be able to review the outcome. As far as the environment is concerned, I agree with them but I add—as Labor does here—that as far as the workers are concerned we should be able to review it.
I will tell you one thing we cannot review, and that is the money that is going to be handed to the woodchip corporations. If we do not support this, when the big compensation payouts come because some future minister for the environment in Canberra wants to protect a koala habitat, are we going to be able to review that situation? Are we going to be able to say, `A better option is to review the regional forest agreement and not have the people of New South Wales—or of Australia—paying hundreds of millions of dollars to protect trees that do not need protecting; they can stand up perfectly well themselves'? Of course, we should be saying to corporations, `Stay out of that habitat.'
Where in all of this are the reparations to the industries which lose out: the job-rich tourism industries based on things like koala 
 habitats and forest scenery? There is no reference to them at all; there is no opportunity for loss reparation in here at all. That is another reason why we should be scrutinising these agreements to fix them up. They are full of holes; they are unfair; they are weighted to the big end of town against regional and rural Australia; to industries which are downsizing against industries which are job rich; and they are absolutely weighted against the environment.
When you see—as I do from my perspective—the horrendous situations that these put the interests of the people of Australia in, you have to demand that parliament scrutinise these arrangements. How dare the Howard government, let alone state governments, sign agreements for the use of the nation's resources and taxpayers' millions and say, `But we don't want parliament to scrutinise them.' That is unconscionable.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-08-30,"—Much has been said in the last week or so about young people, given the arrangement reached on entrenching junior wage rates. Indeed, the coalition has done much to put into place a comprehensive range of measures to provide young people, including indigenous Australians, with increased access to education and training and increased opportunities to find employment. The coalition has successfully introduced the Work for the Dole scheme, based on the principle of mutual obligation. This scheme is conclusively showing that it can reunite unemployed young Australians with their communities and build the self-esteem of the young, unemployed participants.
With the commitment of over $340 million over four years for its Work for the Dole program, the coalition has demonstrated that 
 it really means what it says with this commitment. However, the government alone cannot solve youth unemployment. Community groups, individuals and the youths themselves have a fundamental role to play.
I am pleased to report to the Senate that such a community initiative to stem youth unemployment is occurring within Wyong Shire. While recently on a fact-finding mission visiting rural and regional communities in my home state of New South Wales, it was my pleasure to meet with members of Wyong Shire Council to discuss issues facing the youth of the Central Coast, in particular youth unemployment. My visit to the area was the culmination of a two-week visit to community and industry groups in a number of regional centres and the Central Coast. I was invited to the Central Coast by my colleague Jim Lloyd, the member for Robertson, and I was specifically invited to visit Wyong Council, in the neighbouring electorate of Dobell, by the Mayor of Wyong, Cliff Russell.
Of particular interest was an innovative youth project aimed at targeting youth unemployment and other youth issues. Whilst youth unemployment in the Wyong-Gosford region is below the national and state averages, it is still an unacceptably high 20 per cent. It is of concern that the Wyong region needs 2,000 new jobs a year just to meet the current demands of the population. Population growth in the region is 3.5 to four per cent. Currently, 33 per cent of the population have to commute to Sydney for employment and the area is crying out for an injection of industry that will bring local jobs. It certainly gives new meaning to the term `dormitory suburb'.
The Wyong Shire Council has seen youth unemployment as a problem for the region for an extended period, with youth rates, as I said, hovering around the 20 per cent mark. In May 1997, the council implemented a community plan that set forth the aspirations of the Wyong community to help the youth of the region find employment and directions for its implementation. One of the key objectives of the document was to provide young people with opportunities to put forward their own ideas and to generate their own solutions. 
 After extensive community consultation, the council concluded that the youth of the Wyong district needed better facilities to accommodate their need in terms of youth specific health services, support services, and recreation and entertainment facilities.
In keeping with this objective, in December 1997 the council purchased a site at Hely Street, Wyong for a purpose-built youth facility. In April 1998 the Wyong council established a joint venture project with the Salvation Army to establish and operate the youth service on the Hely Street site. High unemployment, family breakdown and a lack of educational opportunities on the Central Coast led the Salvation Army to join the project which has become known as the Youth 2000 project.
The project will provide invaluable services for the region, including employment related courses to enhance numeracy, literacy, self-esteem and conflict resolution;  facilities to job match youth with hopeful employers; chaplaincy and counselling; support for pregnant teenage girls and young mothers; and counselling for drug, alcohol and other addictions. The centre will also provide music and recording facilities, a skate park, basketball courts, a performing arts area and a youth cafe.
What is most unique about this project is the level of youth inclusion, from the initial design phase that included representatives from high schools across the shire to the appointment of six youth representatives to the permanent advisory board in charge of the project. Those involved have shown great commitment to the project, meeting out of school hours and rising to the challenge of responsibility that involvement with such a project entails. It was rewarding to see local youth playing such an active part in projects that will play a role in helping them to realise their potential.
What is also significant is that the development of the site has been partly constructed by Work for the Dole participants who work side by side with skilled labour hired by the Salvation Army. The coalition's Work for the Dole scheme aims to increase participants' 
 work ethic and restore their links with the community, which certainly can help when seeking work. The Work for the Dole participants are not only gaining skills such as carpentry, concreting and bricklaying but are helping to contribute to facilities that will help them and other youth in the Wyong district in the future. The coalition's initiative in Work for the Dole allows community groups, local councils and other non-profit organisations to be involved in developing projects and running them. This is a fine example of the benefits of the Work for the Dole scheme, both for the participants and for the community in which they reside. Ruth Moncrieff, the managing director of the program, said:
After only one month, the participants were starting to regain their self-esteem and self worth. They are also making friends and learning new skills and have a reason to get out of bed two days a week.
What made this particular project stick in my mind is the positive way that the Wyong council and other groups and individuals in the community are attempting to address the problems in their regions. This is really assistance from the bottom up rather than the top down. In particular, I was impressed with how the council is seeking to redress what is an unacceptably high rate of youth unemployment in the Gosford-Wyong region, with all its attendant problems.
The project will give youth skills and self-esteem to bring about a lowering of youth unemployment rates in the region and, consequently, lower youth suicide rates—also a problem—and drug dependency within younger sections of the Central Coast community. The Youth 2000 project also has the potential to be a fantastic model for other similar projects across the country. Prior to completion, the project has already won an award at the International City/County Management Association awards in Washington. Wyong council won the award for the best program that enhances the quality of life for disadvantaged youth.
It was indeed a pleasure for me to see not only such an innovative project but one that has involved so many sections of the Wyong community. From local companies and com 
 munity groups to schools and individuals, support across the community has been both significant and outstanding. Community response has been generous and heartfelt, with donations coming from the state government, BBC Hardware, Mitre 10, local registered clubs, the Wyong Rotary Club, local schools and, of course, the Wyong Shire Council. Of the $1 million needed to fund construction of the project, $750,000 has already been raised and donated through community support. Potentially this model youth project could be developed around the country to involve the community in youth programs. The centre encourages visitors and is an excellent example of what a committed community can do to work in tandem with government initiatives to provide long-term solutions. It gives young people not only job skills but a sense of purpose so that they really are fit for life.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Youth Unemployment: Wyong Youth 2000 Project</title>,Adjournment,13,1
