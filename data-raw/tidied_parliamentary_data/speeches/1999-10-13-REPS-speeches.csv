"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I would like to thank the members of the House who have spoken in this debate on the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme (Administration and Compliance) Bill 1999  including the members for Hotham, Mitchell, Batman, New England, Paterson, Cook, Calare, Dawson and Rankin. With respect to the issues raised I make the following comment that, predictably, the opposition members have a number of misconceptions concerning the scheme. The member for Paterson queried the need for the commission 
 er to take samples. He said that diesel fuel in Sydney is the same as diesel fuel in the bush. He failed to appreciate that this bill deals with not only diesel fuel but also alternative types of fuel which attract a different level of grant. Therefore, there may be a need to take samples, particularly when fuel blends are used.
The opposition has ignored the fact that key determinations made by the Commissioner of Taxation, such as the definition of a journey, will be a disallowable instrument and therefore subject to the scrutiny of parliament. Similarly, the definition of metropolitan areas will be defined by regulation—again subject to the scrutiny of parliament. With respect to the uncertainty and record keeping requirements, the government is not going to impose logbooks or particular record keeping systems where existing records can substantiate a claim. The record keeping requirements for most claimants will be no more than fuel receipts and eligible kilometres travelled. We acknowledge that small truck operators working across metropolitan country areas will have to maintain more detailed records to access the grant. The grant will more than compensate these operators for the effort required. The honourable member for Calare said that the AT0 will specify where a metropolitan area will start and finish. I reiterate that this will be defined by regulation.
To sum up, the bill contains the necessary administrative arrangements including the compliance mechanisms to operate the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. The bill ensures that the Commissioner of Taxation has adequate powers to administer the grants scheme and introduces rigorous enforcement measures to protect public funds and prevent abuse of the scheme. Claimants will be able to register for the grants scheme from 1 March 2000 and develop record keeping arrangements for the introduction of the grants scheme from 1 July 2000. Overall, the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme will reduce the cost of our major transport fuel and, in turn, reduce consumer prices, especially in regional, rural and remote areas.
Finally, I make this point: the Labor Party dealt itself out of this debate because it dealt 
 itself out of the debate on the new tax package. It dealt itself out of the debate on the GST. This grants scheme is directly linked to the introduction of a GST that starts on 1 July next year and brings substantial personal income tax cuts, abolishes FID, abolishes debits, abolishes stamp duty on the transfer of shares and, most importantly, abolishes wholesale sales taxes. That is good for Australia; that is great for Australian consumers and Australian businesses.
When the Labor Party come in here in their own unctuous way and want to play kitty-cat games on a bill such as this, I can only suggest to them that, if they want to be the real opposition party, the real coercive force in this parliament, they need to deal themselves into the business tax debate. I say to them: don't muck around with not having a position, which is the traditional, weak Labor approach to date. Don't deal yourselves out of the debate by simply opposing everything that we do—you opposed the GST, personal income tax cuts, the abolition of wholesale sales tax, industrial relations reform, the sale of Telstra, corporate law reform, every single initiative that tries to repair the black hole that the Leader of the Opposition left us when we came to government in 1996—and remind yourselves that Australia has the most successful developed economy in the world at the moment, with seven out of our top 10 trading partners in recession or depression. Our success has had nothing to do with the Labor Party because the Labor Party have this phobia about supporting anything that is good for Australia. I commend the bill to the House.
Question put:
That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Crean's  amendment) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I move:
That the amendment be disagreed to.
The ACIS Administration Bill 1999  is part of a package of legislation which introduces the ACIS scheme. This $2 billion scheme is designed to assist the industry adjust to a more liberal world trading environment from the year 2005. In the meantime, the tariff applying to passenger motor vehicles will be frozen at 15 per cent and then reduced to 10 per cent on 1 January 2005. The government has made it very clear to the opposition that this scheme and tariff reduction are part of an integrated package. Any amendments such as the opposition's proposal to make the reduction to 10 per cent conditional on a further inquiry are completely unacceptable to the government.
Since ACIS was designed to help the industry make their transition to a more liberalised trade environment, if there are no tariff reductions in 2005 the policy rationale for ACIS simply ceases to exist. We have already had an inquiry into this scheme. The extensive Industry Commission inquiry conducted in 1996-97 covered the issues of tariff settings and other industry support measures through to the end of 2005. Investment decisions in the automotive industry have long lead times and the industry requires clarity and certainty about the medium-term policy environment.
The industry strongly supports passage of the legislation in its entirety as a matter of urgency. The Federation of Automotive Product Manufacturers wrote to Mr McMullan yesterday stating:
In our view, the legislation presently before the Senate will be important in driving investment and creating a more competitive automotive industry. 

We are concerned that any delay in the Senate's consideration of the matter will disrupt this industry's plans to invest.
We therefore seek your support in ensuring a timely passage of this legislation through the Parliament.
The government absolutely agrees with this view. On that basis, the government has rejected the Senate's amendment and will return the bill to the Senate today. We would be very disappointed if the opposition does not come to its senses and stop blocking a plan that will attract $4 billion of investment in Australian industry and, of course, in Australian jobs.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,2,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I do not hold the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources responsible for that load of hogwash because I know someone else wrote it for him. But it is really appalling that we have here a problem of the government's own making and then it turns up and says, `This is urgent and the opposition's got to solve it because the government can't.' The second part of that is true. The government cannot solve this question, but the opposition can and will. But he pretends that it is urgent—let us deal with that first—when the government sat on this bill for five months. It was introduced into the House on 13 May. It was not delayed in the Senate by us. It passed the day after it was introduced after a brief debate. There was no extended committee hearing. There was not even reference to a legislation committee. We did not delay this bill one day. The government sat on it for five months and then comes into this place in October and says that it is urgent. So let us firstly get rid of that.
As I say, I do not hold the parliamentary secretary responsible. He could not possibly know that, but the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources knows that. The minister sat on it for five months and discovered two days ago that perhaps he had a problem. How many times did he have discussions with the opposition or the Democrats about these motions until two days ago, after five months? None—not one phone call, one approach, one representation, one expression of view.
Did he know we were going to move an amendment? Yes, we moved it in the House in exactly the same terms. So let us not pretend that somehow or other there has been a late expression of view by the opposition which has held this up. The government sat on it for five months. The minister spent five months campaigning to save the Queen and two days ago found out that there might be something he needed to do to save the car industry. That is not us; that is him. It is absolutely typical of the way this minister approaches industry policy. It is an unpleasant distraction to his campaign for the monarchy. It is not an issue which he takes seriously. So let us get rid of that.
We will facilitate the government introducing this scheme because we know that it has no other way of getting the $2 billion assistance to the industry. It is the government's responsibility. It is the executive government. It is its responsibility to solve this problem, but it cannot; so we will. If it had been a bill about the republic, it would not have waited five months. It would have been in here the first day. It would have been on the top of the Senate Notice Paper, but because it is a bill about the car industry we had five months. It is that sort of stand around and then rush mentality that causes problems which leads to maladministration and those sorts of issues of bad policy—that is, stand around for five months and then try to solve everything in 48 hours.
The government have themselves hooked on a silly point of conflict that they cannot get off. They need us to get them off. We will, but they should. If the minister knows anything about the issues before this industry and what the industry would really like, he would know the industry would like what we are proposing. They would like the review we are proposing, but they know that the minister is not going to give enough of his attention to working a way through to find it.
What is our amendment? Our amendment has a complex number of parts to it, but the effect of each of those parts is the same. That is, before this scheme or this set of arrangements concludes in 2005, there should be a review to determine whether they should 
 continue. What is the government's alternative proposal? That, after the scheme concludes, we should have an inquiry—`first the punishment, then the trial'. Do you know why the minister is attracted to that? It was a monarch who said that; it was the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland. Any monarch will do in a storm. He thinks he might be losing one and he desperately wants to pick up another. This is just appalling policy.
We do not think this is a perfect scheme. It leaves out some people who had benefits under the Export Facilitation Scheme; they will not be able to get anything under ACIS. We have been seeking some explanation from the minister and the department about the rationale for this. (Extension of time granted) We want to know why the people who miss out do so. These are people who produce substantially for what is called in the trade the `after market'—what we would call in the vernacular spare parts. But we are not talking about small producers; we are talking about people who produce at the scale that would get them over the threshold for this scheme—that is, more than 30,000 units—but who produce not a sufficient proportion of their product for original equipment manufacture such that they get over the 30,000 threshold for OEM itself.
There are a number of these people, and this scheme does not catch them. We are not going to hold the scheme up for that; we simply point out that inadequacy. Our concern is that this fundamental set of changes for the industry, which takes it in a direction which we support, will be implemented in six years time. Yet between now and then the government does not believe we need to monitor whether it is a good idea or not. This is the key question.
We are dealing here with an industry that has a sense of impending crisis—crisis because of the GST transition, and the stand-downs that are occurring as a consequence of it. Two of my colleagues here, the members for Kingston and Stirling, have employees and businesses in their constituencies that are affected. They want to raise certain issues about those stand-downs in this industry. My colleague the member for Corio, who has a 
 very big Ford plant in his electorate, is also particularly concerned and has made representations to me about this. There is also the question of increasing imports of second-hand vehicles and the impact of those on the industry, about which representations have been made in the Senate on behalf of the members for Capricornia and Lalor. In all those circumstances, we have a complacent minister who stands idly by saying, `Well, we might look at it.' The government might have a review even of the GST, but we cannot get a review of this scheme.
With this the government is on the horns of a dilemma, but it has put itself there. It only worked out it had this dilemma two days ago, when everybody else has known for five months. All that the government can do now is bluster and get the industry associations to send their form letters—and I do not blame them; they want this scheme because it is the only scheme they can get out of the government. They wrote us a letter; it does not make any difference. I do not object to it, but nobody will be moved by it. We knew that those letters would be coming. I could have written them myself.
But this is our objective: we want a review in 2003 before the tariff changes come in and, more particularly, before the scheme terminates. We want the facts determined before the action, not after. What if we find in 2005 that the timing of these changes was appalling, that there could not have been a worse time to do it? We will have an inquiry in 2005 and we will find that and we will say, `Whoops, that's a bit of a problem. It's a pity we didn't look at it before we did it.' Nobody can suggest that this is other than a government that is pig-headedly not having a review because we thought of it. The only thing I feel bad about is that, perhaps if we had not suggested it quite so stridently, the government might have adopted it, but it feels that it cannot do it because it was our idea. That is our objective. It is an objective by which we stand.
But we will not hold up the $2 billion of assistance to the industry. We tried to get to the circumstance where the parliament would be able to ensure that the government holds 
 an inquiry. There is now only one way for the workers in the car industry to get the inquiry they want, and that is to change the government at the next election. I give this unequivocal commitment: if a Labor government is elected in 2001, there will be an inquiry in 2003 before these changes come in. So we do have a stark differentiation. If at the next election the government is re-elected, there will not be a review before these changes come in; if we are elected, there will be.
We will get the government off of the hook on which it has impaled itself and from which it cannot escape. We will allow this bill to pass because we want to see the $2 billion flow to the industry. But we will make sure that, if a Labor government is elected, there will be an inquiry, as everybody knows there should be.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,2,1
"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I rise to speak today on an amendment, sent to this House by the Senate, to the ACIS—Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme—Administration Bill 1999. I have come to understand very personally the importance of an inquiry into the automotive industry, so the amendment to insert part 14, independent inquiry, into the bill has my wholehearted support. I am surprised by the government's rejection of this proposal to have a review before 1 July 2003 in preference to the government's model of seeking a review after 2005, especially given that the bill has enjoyed until now cross-party support.
We all understand that the automotive industry is an important part of this country's manufacturing base, but the government must think beyond this and reflect on the thousands of down-the-line businesses and jobs that depend on a vibrant and profitable car industry for their survival. It is very hard to hear on the news and read in the papers about massive stand-downs at the Ford plant in September—3,500 workers at that time—and have confidence that everything is all right with the industry. As my colleague the member for Kingston highlighted in a speech to this House on Monday night, since the beginning of this financial year, passenger vehicle 
 sales have fallen a seasonally adjusted 13 per cent compared with the same period last year.
Does the government not hear the warning bells? In the context of a downturn in sales, stand-downs at car plants and the arrival of a new tax system, it is clear that a thorough independent review of the industry which debates amongst other things the appropriate customs duty is needed in the very near future. I cannot see why the government wants to wait until some time after 2005 to conduct a review. What good would that do anyone?
I remind the government that the bill was established to `promote competitiveness and encourage investment in the automotive industry'. I could be forgiven for thinking that this meant the government was committed to ensuring the car industry and all those associated businesses I have spoken of remain competitive, profitable and contributing to a growing economy in Australia. But its actions speak the loudest of all and, by rejecting this proposed early review, it is saying that it is not genuinely interested in coming to grips with the realities facing people and businesses in this industry.
Let me put on record some of those cold, hard realities and let us hope that someone in the government is prepared to listen. In my electorate of Stirling I have several new and used car yards and, as you would expect, the businesses associated with those yards. Last week a couple who run a car repair type of small business in my electorate came to see me and they were quietly distraught. After years of slog, their small business was turning a healthy profit and the family was comfortable. Then the goods and services tax happened and it has brought disaster to their door. Whether this government wants to acknowledge it or not, there is a very strong perception in the marketplace that new passenger vehicles will become significantly cheaper with the introduction of a goods and services tax next July. We know this is not true; it is yet another government sleight of hand, but it is what people believe and, as indicated earlier, it has led to a massive downturn in new passenger vehicle sales.
There has been a flow-on effect to the used car market. When people stop buying cars—both new and old—car yards do not need repair work done to present their cars. The struggle to sell results in tighter margins and profits are cut to the bone. Then there is a flow-on impact on the viability of subsidiary industries such as car repairs. As a result, in my electorate two honest, hard-working, committed people with family responsibilities go to work every day in their business and wonder how long before the end comes. Tragically they are realists. They have met with their accountant and they are facing a reality that would shake anyone. If things do not change, they will be bankrupt by Christmas.
I have to say that, since spending some time with this couple last week, I have carried with me a deep sense of the injustice of it all. I have become a little bit angry, particularly with this government that has the absolute hide to stand in this House day after day promulgating the view that it is the business person's government. It is not. It has betrayed the small business people associated with the vehicle industry by its callous refusal to acknowledge and act on the very real phenomenon of a buyers' strike in a key section of the automotive industry after the passage of the GST legislation.
The government was able to implement transitional arrangements for the white goods industry but not for the automotive industry. The industry and the Labor Party want the government to implement the same types of transitional arrangements now to stop the slide in the automotive industry. Unless it acts now, it will have betrayed my constituents who face ruin through no fault of their own. If it does not take seriously the concerns of the Labor Party and minor parties about the need for an urgent independent review of the automotive industry, particularly in relation to customs duty, it will continue that betrayal and more businesses and workers will lose out.
I will take no comfort in the government's eventual downfall as the business people of Australia realise that the government does not want to hear their problems or work with 
 them to address issues of concern as they arise. People are depending on you; don't continue to let them down. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Firstly, the car industry in my electorate regards the proposal by the Labor Party to have a review of the ACIS arrangements and tariffs before the tariff freeze finishes, and certainly before the ACIS assistance arrangements cease in 2005, as entirely beneficial to the industry. In the last two days the government has sought to crank up a campaign saying that the opposition, by proposing that review and supporting it, is holding up the provision of assistance arrangements under ACIS to the car industry. That is clearly not the case.
The  ACIS Administration Bill 1999  was first debated in this place on 23 June and it went through the consideration in detail stage where our amendment was originally put and lost the following day on 24 June. Now it is 13 October before the government has brought it back here and is asking us to abandon the amendment which, when it was moved again in the Senate, was in fact passed. Because we are not in the business of holding up this important assistance to the car industry, we are not going to press this amendment, even though we believe that it is a very good amendment and a very wise piece of policy.
One has to ask why the government has sought to crank up this campaign in the last two days, because it was pretty obvious that we were going to allow this bill to go through in an unamended form. The reason for that is that the government now realises that it has a very serious problem with the transitional arrangements for the GST on cars and that there has been a buyers' strike. There have already been stand-downs at Ford of 3,500 workers. The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, has been asked questions in the Senate for several days this week and he is giving clear indications, as we saw in the Financial Review this morning, that the government is looking at those transitional arrangements and would like to act. It is probably fairly desperate to try and put some of the blame for the problems of the car industry onto the opposition when 
 in fact they are problems entirely of the government's own making. The cost of the buyers' strike to government revenue has been estimated by Martec at $450 million this year. You would think that there would be some trade-off between that loss of revenue and the cost of an alternative transitional arrangement for the GST which would end the buyers' strike and end the crisis in the car manufacturing industry.
Unfortunately, the cost of reducing the wholesale sales tax to the same retail value level tax as the GST would be about $1.3 billion for the last nine months of this year. That is obviously a fairly big bite out of the government's surplus so they are reluctant to do that. The government are putting off taking any effective action on the transitional arrangements for the GST on cars because they know that taking effective action would cost them more than $100 million a month. For every month that they leave the car industry in crisis, the government revenue that will be saved will be more than $100 million. The Treasurer has got himself into the unenviable situation, because of his miscalculation of the effectiveness of the transitional arrangement that he did put in place, where he has a choice, and his choice is to either wreck the car industry or wreck his budget. (Extension of time granted)
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, who is at the table, might like to confirm in his response—and I will certainly put out a press release later today asking the Treasurer to do this if I do not get an answer now—Martec's estimate of the loss of revenue from the buyers' strike of $450 million. I think he will be reluctant to do that. He certainly, if he wished, would be able to tell the House precisely what the revenue cost of reducing the wholesale sales tax to the same equivalent level as the GST would be, either for the whole of the year or on a monthly basis, and I would ask him to do that. I also ask him to tell the House whether the impression that Senator Minchin sought to give the Senate yesterday—that the government was looking at this issue, was intending to act and was prepared to act—is true. I also ask him to tell 
 the House whether any action is imminent or whether, because the cost to revenue of acting will be about $100 million a month, the situation will be that the plight of the car industry will be left to get worse, month after month. Will we see more plant stand-downs and shut-downs as the industry seeks to reduce its production of passenger motor vehicles in this country because of the declining demand, with all the attendant effects that that will have on component suppliers who supply the vehicle assemblers, and all of the spin-off effects that that will have on other parts of the economy which are dependent on the wages of all the people in those industries who supply business inputs to the component and vehicle industries?
It is the biggest issue in Australian manufacturing this year, and I think the vehicle industry and the people who work in the vehicle industry are entitled to much clearer answers about the government's attitude to it than they are presently getting from Senator Minchin.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,2,1
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I would suggest that some of those questions that the honourable member has just raised, particularly with regard to Senator Minchin's intention, be asked directly of him. I am not a mind-reader, and do not profess to answer on his behalf. However, I am pleased to see that the opposition is not going to block this bill from going through now, and I am sure that will be a great relief for the car industry.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1999-10-13,"—It has been a long wait, but I am sure those searching for my words of wisdom will not find it too difficult to find the beginning of this contribution. I was, when interrupted by the adjournment the other night, commenting on the restructure of the commission which, as set out in the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 , has the potential for leaving subject areas of discrimination virtually unrepresented.
I understand that the government has attempted to cut and paste this bill and subsequently amend the section relating to transitional times and arrangements for the specialist commissioners, who would have found themselves automatically terminated. The amendment goes some way towards maintaining a minimum amount of independence for the commission—a token amendment, if you like, and one of the many recommended by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which examined this bill.
The government realised it would not get away with a lack of transitional arrangements for the commissioners, as it contradicts the Paris principle on national human rights institutions. That principle clearly states:
In order to ensure a stable mandate for the members of the national institution, without which there can be no real independence, their appointment shall be effected by an official act which shall establish the specific duration of the mandate.
I am disappointed that the government has made this amendment purely on the basis of the Paris principle and legal obligation. Surely, moral obligation would dictate provisions for transitional arrangements to be included from the outset. This bill proposes that the commission undergo changes in its functions in the hope of improving human 
 rights for all Australians. I support any initiative to improve human rights for all Australians—as, indeed, would any member in this parliament—but not this robbing Peter to pay Paul principle that permeates this bill.
While I welcome the proposal for the commission to focus on education, education alone does not guarantee that all people will treat each other with the respect that they deserve or that their human rights dictate. Education does not provide the independent scrutiny which the commission performs in compliance with Australia's international legal obligations.
The other new function presented under the education umbrella includes the creation of guidelines for the commission to assist business and the community to avoid discrimination. That is fair enough and difficult to argue against, but it does not make sense that if the commission is to have the authority over businesses and individuals in terms of advising on discrimination issues then it should have its very powers to exercise that authority reduced.
Now I move to the abolition of the Community Relations Council under the new functions of the commission. Although it is argued that the commission is able to consult with appropriate groups or individuals as required and that the advisory council was never fully utilised, the situation mirrors that of the commission's power to recommend damages. Even if the tool is not always accessed, it does not mean that it will not be required in the future or that it is useless.
Let me turn to some other issues, notably the renaming of the commission to the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission. There was no public input and no apparent support or submissions on this matter, and no logic, in fact, for the change, except perhaps to flag support for the Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities, which emphasises responsibilities at the expense of rights and to which we are not yet—I emphasise `yet'—a signatory. Perhaps the mutual responsibility team from social services got to work on this one too. If it has to be renamed, amend it to `Human Rights Commission'. The public, the media and most of us refer to it by that name 
 anyway. Let us turn that practice into law and keep it that way.	The government might also wish to consider that any name change costs time, effort, resources and funds. How about channelling those funds into worthwhile areas to assist the commission, such as legal aid, instead of new stationery and signage for the commission?
Further, on legal aid, which I mentioned earlier in the first part of my contribution to the debate late on Monday evening, the number of constituents with legal aid problems who walk into my office every day falls just short of Telstra complaints and about on par with complaints about child support, with which legal aid has a close connection. The decision announced by the government to cut $120 million over three years from legal aid funding, and consequently dismantle Australia's national unified legal aid system, is having a profound effect on the ability of Australians to enforce their human rights. In accordance with the provisions of this bill, discrimination law disputes will now be determined in the Federal Court of Australia—if, of course, you can afford the legal costs. The legal aid cuts over the six years budgeted by the coalition government represent a $231 million reduction in legal aid funding in real terms. Every year this government is spending $46.5 million less in real terms on legal aid funding.
The current Commonwealth-state agreements for legal aid, introduced in 1997, contain a guideline for the commission to grant assistance in terms of funding for equal opportunity and discrimination cases. This sounds fine, except that guideline unfairly excludes people suffering from discrimination from access to legal assistance. The rhetoric of human rights is contained in the guideline; the practical reality of delivering through proper legal aid is just not there. We do not want Australia to become a country where human rights are only an issue if you can afford to defend them.
The Human Rights Commissioner, Chris Sidoti, has only recently returned from Burma, where his undoubted skills may hopefully inspire a breakthrough in human rights and eventual establishment of an 
 HREOC in that country. I find it inconceivable that, at a time when there is a call for a more comprehensive federal legislative framework to address discrimination issues, the government is attempting to muzzle a highly internationally respected institution and reduce access to achieving those rights. Mr Sidoti has stated that as a nation we are at a point where discrimination on the grounds of age, sexual orientation, trade union activity, criminal record and religious and political opinion require the same level of legislation as sex, race and disability grounds.
If anything, there should be an expansion of the commission's duties, powers and responsibilities and, in turn, an expansion of resources. Instead, the government has produced a piece of legislation that trends the other way. If you listened to the government, you could be fooled into thinking that the bill will help develop the commission and bring it into a new cultural era. However, it is a culture all too well recognisable, a culture of government control of processes, a further concentration of executive control over areas which should be at arms-length from government—not unlike the deceitful republic model on offer. This executive intrusion is especially repugnant in the area of human rights and discrimination, where the government may all too often be a party to the dispute. I have studied the opposition's amendments in detail, and I recommend them to the House as a means of substantially restoring fairness and logic to this legislation.",REPS,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1

 its capacity to promote and protect the human rights of all Australians and to deal with human rights issues in a constantly changing and developing social context.
Under the provisions of the bill, the structure of the commission will be freed up to deal with the broad range of human rights issues by establishing three deputy presidents rather than designated special-purpose commissioners. This will provide the commission with the flexibility to change its culture and organisation to meet the community's needs and address particular issues of concern in a changing environment. It will also assist in enhancing the commission's image as an institution concerned with protecting and promoting the human rights and responsibilities of all Australians, not just of those who fit within the narrow classification of specialist commissioners.
This is an important move which would address the current perception among many in the community that the commission is focused only on specific areas such as sex, race or disability discrimination. I note that under the present structure of the commission there are six members who have the status of deputy secretaries in the Australian Public Service. Despite having many more staff at a more junior level, my own department, in comparison, has only two deputy secretaries to cover its entire range of responsibilities. This results in the commission being simply top heavy and inhibits the commission's ability to use its resources efficiently and to the benefit of as broad a cross-section of the community as possible.
I am constantly being asked to establish more commissioners to focus on other groups who perceive that their particular interests are not served by the designated commissioners. Children, the aged, refugees and those in same-sex relationships are just some of those who claim not to have their interests represented by the current commissioners. The calls for representation by these groups highlight the problem that there is really no limit to the number or types of groups who may claim not to be properly represented in a commission structure which relies so heavily on specially designated commissioners. 
 These groups also reflect the changing range of human rights issues which arise over time and which would be better served by a flexible commission structure.
I note also in this regard that the bill will enhance the commission's ability to organise its staff and resources to reflect human rights priorities and areas of focus or attention. I note in particular that the commission has recently appointed Mr Graeme Innes as the Assistant Disability Discrimination Commissioner. In this role, Mr Innes will work with the Disability Discrimination Unit to advise and assist the Acting Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Susan Halliday. The bill should make it easier for the commission to make this type of flexible, needs based arrangement in the future.
While Australians can be proud of our human rights record and our commitment to developing and fostering a tolerant community where the human rights of all its members are protected, we need to look at human rights and antidiscrimination as global issues and to focus on the community as a whole. In this way, more effective action can be taken to secure and protect the rights of all Australians. I believe that the establishment of deputy presidents will take us in this direction.
The bill makes it clear that the new commission's priority will be to educate Australians about human rights and discrimination and to help them to understand their responsibility, as members of the Australian community, to respect other people's human rights. This refocusing of the commission's functions and the emphasis on education is reflected in the new name proposed in this bill, the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission.
I note that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee has reported on the bill and made some recommendations in relation to it. I advise that I will be moving amendments at the consideration in detail stage to address issues in that report relating to transitional provisions for the current commissioners and the commission's power to intervene in court proceedings.
I note that the majority report also recommended that the bill be amended to clarify the legal status and effect of guidelines created by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The government does not intend to move such an amendment. I do not consider it appropriate to provide in legislation for the status of such guidelines. I agree with the commission that the guidelines are a policy interpretation of the application of the law and, as such, are there to assist people and organisations to comply with the law. To attempt to specify in legislation that they do or do not have legal status would run the risk that the guidelines are either elevated to a status that is not intended or, alternatively, diminished in their importance. I consider it best to leave it as a matter for the courts in any particular case to determine all the facts surrounding a complaint, whether or not there has been compliance with legislative requirements and whether the actions of parties were reasonable in all the circumstances, including whether policy guidelines issued by the commission have relevance to the facts in a particular case.
I note the views of the members for Barton, Oxley, Sydney, Chifley and Isaacs in relation to the comments made by the Committee for the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This bill will not change in any way the functions of the commission in relation to the enjoyment and exercise of human rights by Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. While there will no longer be a designated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the bill will confer the functions on the commission as a whole. It will then be up to the commission to delegate the responsibility for the performance of these functions to a deputy president.
The government expects, of course, that the commission will allocate these functions to the deputy president with responsibility for racial discrimination and social justice. That deputy president will in this way be able to develop his or her own knowledge and expertise in relation to indigenous human rights. The commission will also continue to have the benefit of the specialist expertise of the 
 staff currently working in its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice unit. The functions of the specialist units in the commission will not be affected by the bill.
The member for Calwell has criticised the move to deputy presidents on the basis that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of complaints to the commission based on racial and ethnic prejudice. This is not the case. While it is true that there was a substantial increase made in the number of complaints made under the Racial Discrimination Act in 1998-99, the commission advises that, of the 898 complaints made, 467 were against the same respondent and related to the same subject matter. If these complaints are removed from consideration, the remaining 431 complaints actually represent a decrease from the 482 reported for 1997-98. The 482 in 1997-98 also represented a decrease from the 683 complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act made to the commission in the previous year.
The members for Barton, Oxley, Calwell, Sydney, Chifley, Isaacs and Throsby have once again raised the issue of cuts to the commission's budget. The member for Calare raised it this morning as well. Once again, I utterly reject any claims that this government has used budget cuts to undermine the commission. The government remains strongly committed to maintaining a strong national human rights institution. However, in tough financial times that institution's funding cannot be quarantined.
I would like to take this opportunity to outline for the record some history of this issue, as some fairly outrageous claims have been made in this parliament and in other public fora. First, the initial reduction to HREOC funding in the 1997-98 financial year was no more than the efficiency savings that were imposed on all agencies within the Attorney-General's portfolio and the Australian Public Service. This amounted to a four per cent savings in running costs and a one per cent efficiency dividend. The government was forced to implement budget reductions across the Public Service in order to address the financial problems which remained from the previous Labor government's misman 
 agement of the economy. The other relevant factor in that financial year was that the commission had completed a project for which specific funding had been allocated. Any responsible government would of course not continue to allocate funding to an organisation for tasks that are completed.
With respect to the 1998-99 budget, the portfolio budget statements, which are freely available to the public, indicate that the commission's funding was reduced by approximately 25 per cent—nothing like the figure of 43 per cent that has been consistently and misleadingly used. Again, there were sound reasons for these reductions. First, efficiency dividends were again necessary which applied to the commission and all Commonwealth departments and agencies. Second, in order to address the High Court's decision in the Brandy case, the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Act No. 1, which was passed by this parliament on 23 September 1999, will transfer the commission's hearing function to the Federal Court. A reduction to the commission's funding base therefore accounts for part of the reductions that appear on paper, though the actual reduction will not take place until the transfer of function proceeds. Third, the commission had completed another project which had received specific additional funding. Again, the government was not going to continue funding the commission for projects that had been finished.
Members should also note that any reductions should be considered in context. HREOC's growth over the decade prior to this period had been significantly disproportionate to that in other areas of government. Over the nine years prior to the first cuts, funding to HREOC had increased fourfold. Over the same period, staff members increased from 51 to 200—at one stage exceeding 220. The commission's budget now reflects a more realistic allocation for it to undertake its core functions.
One of those core functions is education of the Australian community about human rights. I thank the member for Barton for indicating his commitment to education. It is unfortunate that opposition members do not support the 
 government in its aims, therefore, to provide the commission with a greater focus in this area by supporting this bill. The opposition have alleged that this government has little commitment to educating Australians about the need to respect each other's human rights. The opposition conveniently ignore the government's commitment to establishing a National Committee on Human Rights Education to form part of Australia's response to the United Nations call to celebrate the Decade for Human Rights Education. I anticipate that the committee will lay the groundwork for developing a national approach to human rights education by pursuing joint initiatives with non-government organisations and with the business sector.
Last year I announced that the government had endorsed Dr Eric Tan AM as the chair of the national committee. Dr Tan brings with him a great deal of experience and has already shown an enormous enthusiasm	for the task of coordinating and promoting the work of the national committee. This government is committed to promoting community harmony and cultural diversity. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs launched, in August last year, the Living in Harmony campaign to combat racism and bigotry in our community. A centrepiece of this campaign is a community grants program which will allocate $2.5 million to community projects aimed at promoting community harmony. These are but two examples of significant initiatives undertaken by the government to educate the community about human rights. It is a pity that the opposition will not assist us to build on such initiatives by supporting this bill and its central aim of enhancing education by providing the commission with an increased focus in this area.
The members for Barton, Sydney, Chifley, Isaacs and Throsby raised concerns about the proposed change of name for the commission to the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission. The government is seeking a change in the commission's name to reflect the fundamental changes proposed to the commission's structure and focus. The government intends that the commission's priorities will in the future lie in the areas of 
 education and dissemination of information on human rights and assistance to business and the general community to comply with their human rights obligations. Of course, making people aware of their responsibilities to respect other people's human rights can be, in the long run, more effective than educating people about their own rights. Certainly, one cannot effectively occur without the other. The government hopes that the commission will actively encourage people to think about their responsibilities in this regard and to act accordingly. If we can engender in the Australian community a sense of deep respect for human rights born of a recognition that the enjoyment and protection of such rights carries with it a responsibility to respect the rights of others, we will be a long way down the road to achieving effective protection of the rights of all Australians. I find it difficult to accept that any person who is genuinely concerned about ensuring and promoting human rights can argue that the proposed new name for the commission does not reflect its role and aims.
The member for Oxley demonstrated a profound misunderstanding of how the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission operates when he stated that the prohibition on the delegation of the president with respect to complaint handling will `eventually force individuals to take their concerns outside the commission'. This, of course, is a change which was made under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Amendment Act (No. 1) 1999 and not under this bill. That act remedied a longstanding difficulty in relation to the non-enforceable determination of disputes by the commission, resulting from the decision of the High Court in Brandy, by removing the commission's redundant hearing function. Under the act, the commission will continue to handle and attempt to conciliate disputes. The act reorganises and streamlines the complaint handling functions of the commission under the president, freeing commissioners to focus on their inquiry and education functions.
Under this bill, the commission will still have the same complaints function and the role of conciliating with respect to those 
 complaints that it now has. In practice, the commission has a well-staffed complaints unit that takes on this function and people's complaints will continue to be capably handled by that unit of people with experience and expertise in this work. This bill is an important step in making the commission more relevant and more responsive to the needs of the Australian community.
Despite extravagant claims to the contrary, it does not limit the commission's ability to protect and promote human rights in Australia. In fact, the government believes that the bill will assist the commission in more effectively achieving this goal, by giving it a more flexible and less top-heavy structure with the capacity to adapt and reflect the needs and concerns of all Australians. I challenge the opposition to get serious about promoting human rights in Australia by supporting this legislation and assisting the government to bring about much-needed structural change to the commission. I commend the bill to the House.
Question put:
That the bill be read a second time.",REPS,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I move:
That the amendments be disagreed to.
The Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  provides legislative support to the outcomes being achieved under the regional forest agreement process. The government is working cooperatively with the states to implement the National Forest Policy Statement, which is the framework for a long-term and lasting resolution of forest industry, conservation and community interests and expectations concerning our nation's forests. The bill is intended to provide a degree of certainty for forest conservation and management not seen for several decades. It provides certainty that a comprehensive, adequate and representative forest reserve system is guaranteed under nationally agreed criteria which far exceed any such criteria in the world. It provides certainty that our forest industries will have access to the timber outside that reserve system, and it ensures that these multiple-use forests will be managed under agreed pre 
 scriptions for ecologically sustainable forest management.
The government must therefore reject the Senate amendments which seek to change the objects of the act. Those amendments offer so many opportunities for litigation that the impact would be to fatally flaw the regional forest agreement process. The government must also reject the Senate amendments which seek to require any RFA made, or sought to be made, after 1 March 1999 to successfully undergo public and parliamentary scrutiny prior to it being recognised as a RFA under the bill.
In relation to the 1 March 1999 cut-off, there is no objective basis on which such a differentiation can be justified. The only difference appears to be a political one, not one that goes to the substance of the agreement or the process undertaken in its development. In any case, under existing Commonwealth legislation, the Commonwealth is already required to meet all its environmental obligations before it agrees to enter into any RFA. Additionally, given the extensive public consultation that has taken place in relation to all RFAs, there is no reason to suggest that the notification of the Commonwealth's intention to enter into an RFA or the publishing of a draft RFA will serve any purpose.
As for the Senate amendment to provide the opportunity for either house of parliament to disallow a regional forest agreement, the government's legal advice, which I have tabled previously in this place, is that such a provision would contravene section 99 of the Constitution. The opposition has so far declined to table any contrary legal advice, despite its claims to be able to do so. I indicated in my response to the majority report of the Senate inquiry on this bill that I am willing to ensure that all completed RFAs are tabled in the parliament, thus providing a further opportunity for discussion and extending the already very open and transparent nature of the RFA process. In reaffirmation of that commitment, I seek leave to table the regional forest agreements for Tasmania, the Central Highlands, north-east Victoria, south-western Australia, Eden and East Gippsland.
Leave granted.
—I thank the House. I turn to the amendment proposing that the definition of RFA or regional forest agreement include a requirement that the agreement provides for structural adjustment packages, including relocation and retraining for affected workers and their families. This amendment provides no benchmark an RFA would have to meet to qualify as `providing for' such structural adjustment packages. It fails to recognise that the impact of an RFA on industry structures in each region is different, requiring different approaches to structural adjustment, and that in the states with multiple RFAs structural adjustment packages are constructed on a state-wide basis.
This amendment also provides a clear differentiation between coalition party policy and Labor policy in this particular area. (Extension of time granted) It appears that Labor is still committed to job destruction arising out of forestry policy. It focuses on compensation, buying people out of their business, buying people out of their jobs. The evidence that this particular policy is a disaster is clear to find. You need only go to certain areas where previous Labor governments delivered this arrangement. The people used that finance, they thought wisely, to pay out their home mortgage, for instance. They now find themselves stuck with a house in a town that has lost its only industry, the house is unsaleable and job replacement, whatever the training, simply does not exist.
That stands in stark contrast to the policy that the government is following of funding industry development. We keep people in employment, even where there is a reduced wood supply, by directing them into value adding for which they need very little extra training. A sawmill operative can continue to operate planing machinery. A forklift operator can just as easily load timber into a drying kiln as onto the back of a truck to send it away in its lowest value form as green sawn timber. It is a clear line of demarcation, evidenced by the fact that all that the Labor Party could focus on with their amendments was making sure people got paid to leave the industry. All of our efforts are in keeping 
 them in the industry and expending government funds for that purpose.
Another Senate amendment proposes that the minister must cause to be established a comprehensive and publicly available national forest database to ensure that decision making and management of timber resources are based on best available information. This amendment is vague and invites further unnecessary legal debate. In any case, the Commonwealth already publicly provides a state of the forest report. Another amendment proposes to qualify exemptions provided to RFA forestry operations under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 by incorporating qualifications contained in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The proposed amendment attempts to connect the two processes without any substantive reason for so doing.
The government also rejects the Senate amendments which propose to alter the compensation clause in the bill in a way that not only is confused but will have no effect, as the liability to pay compensation continues to arise out of the terms of the RFA itself. It is unclear as to what the term `losses arising from the loss of legally exercisable right' actually means. It is clearly designed to open opportunities for litigation and create uncertainty in terms of the compensation a dispossessed company would otherwise anticipate.
Other Senate amendments deal with the requirements for consultation and making information available. I need say no more than that the regional forest agreement process has been one of the most open and consultative processes ever undertaken by governments in this country. I repeat my commitment to that process. I can give you evidence in recent times of the RFA process in Western Victoria. It is interesting to note that the local member, Mr O'Keefe, has congratulated me for my consideration of fair, reasonable and substantive propositions put to me by organisations such as the Wombat Forest Group.
To conclude, the government introduced this bill to secure the outcomes of the regional forest agreement process and to provide certainty for the world-class sustainable management of our forests and the industries 
 and the communities which depend upon them. Shortly I will be moving an amendment to establish a Forest Products Advisory Council. This amendment and the bill are supported by the CFMEU, the National Association of Forest Industries, the Forest Protection Society and, to the best of my knowledge, the Australian Workers Union. The bill as amended by Labor in the Senate is supported by no-one, not even the conservation lobby whose Senate allies voted against it, and certainly not the Labor state governments who are aghast at the prospect of their RFAs being overturned in the Senate. (Extension of time granted)
As Tasmanian Deputy Premier Lennon has said, the Tasmanian RFA, which has been completed in good faith, is at risk of being compromised by federal Labor's proposed amendments to the bill. As the member for McMillan has so astutely pointed out in a letter to me, the RFA process should rise above the pettiness of partisan politics. I urge the opposition to take heed of this advice and indicate their support for the bill. In closing, I challenge the member for Reid to take this opportunity to reaffirm the Labor Party's commitment to the National Forest Policy Statement which they wrote in 1992 and the sustainable harvesting of native forests outside the CAR reserve system. I thank the House.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—At the outset I take up the point just raised by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation and reiterate Labor's strong support for the National Forest Policy Statement. It is interesting to note that part of the rhetoric over there is to delete from the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  objects that essentially come verbatim from the National Forest Policy Statement. As we can see, they are trying to delete them from this series of amendments that came from the Senate. Labor remains strongly committed to the process, notwithstanding our public disquiet about the performance of the current minister.
We understand that a need has emerged for legislation to resolve various legal uncertainties surrounding the RFA process, particularly the compensation provisions of certain exist 
 ing agreements. It is very interesting to note that, in trying to slag off about Labor's proposals in regard to compensation and in saying how fantastic the current situation with RFA agreements is, the reality is that this legislation is needed because of the failure of the then Liberal government in Tasmania and the federal government to properly negotiate compensation wording in the RFA agreement in Tasmania. That is why we have got this bill.
Mr Nairn interjecting—
—Ask the minister. For reasons known only to the government, this bill has been before the parliament for the best part of a year. It was stalled on the Senate business paper from mid-February until late August.
Ms Bailey interjecting—
—It was stalled by the government for a period of six months despite the grandstanding by the current minister. Given the predictable opposition of the Greens and the Democrats, the third reading of the bill was only carried in the Senate on 2 September with Labor support. The committee stage of the Senate debate ran for more than a week. In the final analysis 15 amendments were carried. Many other amendments were defeated, including the opposition's proposal to establish a wood and paper industry council. When the minister says that the CFMEU supports his current watered-down, lukewarm provisions with regard to the wood and paper council, he well knows that the very amendments that he is rejecting are almost totally the view of the CFMEU.
The government has had six weeks to decide what to do about the legislation. It had the option of resolving the matter in a constructive manner given the bipartisan support for the RFA process which I am reiterating here today. Instead, it has decided to reject out of hand all the Senate's amendments. It has done so not for sound policy reasons, not for any great matter of principle and not for any concern about the industry, investment, development or technology but simply because this minister has made a judgment that there is some political advantage in continu 
 ing to misrepresent the opposition's intentions. Given the track record of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation this should come as no surprise. He calls Richard Court an `appeaser'. He constantly engenders debate with Cheryl Edwards, the minister over there. Marie Tehan, well known to those opposite, told him to keep out of Victoria, thank you very much. Peter Beattie had to bypass him and go straight to the Prime Minister to get a proper hearing of Queensland's case. We have read the positive press releases from the Queensland government as a result of those discussions with the Prime Minister.
The situation is that he continues to punish the timber industry in New South Wales for having the temerity to cooperate with the state Labor government. As we well know, one of the Labor Party's amendments is that there must be gazettal within 21 days. What we are seeing in New South Wales is, if truth be known, that small sawmillers and tree-fellers are being told that their produce cannot be taken by major companies because of the uncertainty in the New South Wales industry occasioned by the minister's constant prevarication and stonewalling on the New South Wales agreements. We know that after all the rhetoric he carried on with about the Eden area—after months of attacking it, saying how dreadful it was, that the world was collapsing and that he would not tolerate this kind of thing—at the end of the day the amendments and changes that he accomplished counted for nothing. What we are seeing in the north of New South Wales at the moment is a repetition of that. The industry is held up because of his failure to finalise this agreement.
We all know he has been writing to Queensland sawmillers and other interested parties in Queensland and saying, `Please give me some reasons to criticise the Queensland agreement. I haven't got the information. Please, write me. Tell me what's wrong with Queensland.' We all know that the Queensland Timber Board has not exactly been on the same line as the minister; they have been somewhat supportive of the Queensland agreement. So the situation around this country is that, when he talks about working cooperatively with the state governments, with 
 the exception of South Australia—which has no forests—I cannot find a government with which he is in total accord.
It can truly be said that if he had been the minister at the time, agreement to the National Forest Policy Statement would never have been entered into. It would never have happened, given his performance in negotiations and his compromise with the various states of this country. (Extension of time granted) As evidence of this, let me go through the specific amendments that the government is now proposing to reject. First, there is the objects clause. The very first Senate amendment the government seeks to reject is the insertion of an objects clause in the act—objects taken directly from the National Forest Policy Statement. We did not persevere with all those specifications in the National Forest Policy Statement. If it was the view of the opposition that this is essentially to try to accomplish legal problems for the industry, we might also have included those provisions in that part of the National Forest Policy Statement which deals with forestry research and development and the farming of plantations and forest. We did not include them because they might indeed engender a degree of legal debate and litigation. These statements, I reiterate, come from the National Forest Policy Statement—the very thing that this government tries to throw back, saying that Labor repudiates it. They refused to put those very same objects, which they supposedly signed up to with state and territory governments around this country, in the bill under the pretext of some legal possibilities.
In his second reading speech the minister explicitly linked the bill to the National Forest Policy Statement, saying it provided:
. . . the framework for a long-term and lasting resolution of forest industry, conservation and community interests, and expectations concerning our nation's forest.
That is what he said was his aim, and now he seeks basically to delete those requirements. He then turns around and says he is completely opposed to the parliament acting to put into effect the very goals of the National Forest Policy Statement by inserting them in the bill. He is similarly opposed to an entirely reason 
 able amendment that requires individual RFAs to have regard to the objects of the act.
Senate amendment (5) requires individual RFAs to provide for structural adjustment measures to assist workers and communities affected by reduced timber harvesting volumes. While we can start carrying on and trying to score minor points over this, the fact of life in this country is that, even with the government's negotiations, jobs will disappear and plants around this country will close. The minister likes to masquerade as a friend of blue-collar workers, and then comes in here and totally rejects a reasonable amendment that insists that structural adjustment measures for timber workers must be a core element of each RFA, not an optional extra that he might allow if he feels like it or is in the mood or is actually feeling kindly toward somebody. We are saying that this structural adjustment payment must be part of the actual process.
Senate amendments (4) and (6) provide for a limited process of public and parliamentary scrutiny for RFAs signed after 1 March 1999. The government opposes these key amendments, as it clearly wants free rein for the minister to do as he pleases, despite the havoc that he has created, in Western Australia in particular. We all know about the constant repudiation by the member for Eden-Monaro's colleagues around this country in every state administration. He well knows that we found his National Party colleagues voting in the parliament of New South Wales in regard to agreements that this minister opposes.
—That was disgraceful.
—`Disgraceful,' he says. Go and tell that to the state opposition. The minister would insist that we give a tick to an RFA signed in May that the Western Australian government has since moved away from. He would have insisted that there be no public scrutiny of that, that the rest of Australia have no say, that it was his authority alone and that he can be trusted. What has happened over there? We know the reality. The Western Australian government has walked away from it. Ever since then, we have had acrimony, whingeing and complaining from the minister about how dreadful his coalition colleagues in Western Australia are. 
 We all know that he had significant complaints from a number of his colleagues from that state.
The minister would have us pretend that an agreement offers a secure framework for managing the south-west forests over the next 20 years, when we all know that the Premier announced in July a substantially amended package. We also know that the minister wanted to suspend all FISAP funding to Western Australia, until the Prime Minister overruled him. Once again, he went out front, making a whole lot of statements about how he was going to push the state government of Western Australia around and deny them funding and, as he well knows, he was repudiated by the Prime Minister. The minister can look amazed by the claim, but it is a fact of life.
—They haven't got any money yet.
—They may not have the money, but you know the Prime Minister's decision on it.
—The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
—You know you were repudiated by the Prime Minister; stop playing games here. Yet the minister now turns around and says to this parliament and the Australian people, `Trust me with a blank cheque.'
Senate amendment (7) requires the minister to establish a comprehensive and publicly available national forest database to ensure that decision making is based on the best available information. I think we have seen around this country, regardless of our views on each of the state agreements, the degree of debate, the degree of argument, the degree of contention about the nature of the comprehensive forest agreement. There is a need for a database. Rather than being a stick-in-the-mud and saying, `It is too much trouble,' et cetera, you would think that any minister who was keen to ensure that there was a more informed debate about forest policy issues would enthusiastically support such a proposal. Not surprisingly, the current minister takes a different view. (Extension of time granted) The minister insists that the parliament is not going to amend his bill, as if he is the first minister who has ever had to accept the Senate exercising its right to make amendments.
The legal uncertainty surrounding the compensation provisions of existing RFAs is the key reason this bill was introduced. Some people over there might not know it, but the minister is well aware of that reality. The opposition supports the concept of compensation and is happy to clarify any legal uncertainties. Equally, we have an obligation to protect the interests of the taxpayers of this country. We believe the bill is deficient in failing to properly define the extent of the Commonwealth's potential compensation liability. Senate amendments (10) to (13) do this, chiefly by linking compensation to `actual losses arising from the loss of legally exercisable rights'.
Labor reiterates its support for the original Wood and Paper Industry Council, rejects totally the government's contention that there is not the possibility of a bipartisan sensible compromise in regard to these amendments and looks forward to further discussions with the government over these matters.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—This is actually the fourth time that I have spoken on this Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  or aspects of the legislation. It is the fourth time that I have had to get up and defend the government's position of wanting to support those workers out in the rural towns, whom the members opposite are determined to walk away from. It is the fourth time that I have had to get up and defend the people out in my electorate and in the central highlands of Victoria because the Labor Party are determined to walk away from the position that they took to the people of Australia at the last election, when they said that they supported a bipartisan approach in introducing the RFA legislation based on the National Forest Policy Statement. What the Labor Party are doing to this legislation is an absolute travesty, as is what they are doing to people out in all of the small rural communities throughout our nation.
The member for Reid happened to mention the CFMEU, and he was saying how people on this side of the House do not support the blue-collar workers. Let me quote what Mr Michael O'Connor, the National Secretary of the CFMEU, had to say on 10 May about the member for Reid's side of this House and, in particular, about the leader of the Labor Party. He said:
Beazley's comments were a betrayal of tens of thousands of workers throughout Australia employed in the forest and forest products industry. Beazley has torn up the ALP national policy and has deceived workers, their families and communities of regional Australia, and he has signalled that the federal ALP is out to get timber workers. Beazley's comments have given ALP commitments to the National Forest Policy Statement the value of a dud cheque.
That is what the CFMEU has to say, so it is no good the member for Reid standing here in this place and simply using rhetorical statements, completely unsubstantiated, to back up his comments. Let me also remind the member for Reid of what Mr Tim Daley, the WA branch secretary from the AWU had to say:
I am particularly concerned that the decision taken by the ALP is a political decision and not one based on science or fact.
That goes to the absolute nub of this question, because those opposite are not interested in the science: they are content to walk away from the science on this issue and are simply concerned with making political statements. These amendments must be disagreed with.
Let me read something else that goes to the absolute nub of this, and that is the legal advice that the government has received on this matter from the Australian Government Solicitor. The Australian Government Solicitor said:
The bill if amended as proposed would confer on the Houses of Parliament an unlimited discretion whether to permit the minister to enter into any particular RFA. In these circumstances, it is likely that the bill would be regarded by the High Court as authorising the giving of preference to one region over another contrary to section 99 of our Constitution.
He goes on to give a reference and in fact says: 
The bill if enacted in that form would then be invalid.
It is against that advice that every member of the opposition is going to stand up and try to defend their position; and this is simply untenable. Instead of supporting legislation which would provide opportunities for all those small rural communities—opportunities for the workers that they purport to support—what they are doing is in fact closing off opportunities: opportunities for investment, for employment in all of those small regional towns and communities, and for those small rural communities to actually survive. Each one of them—the member for McMillan, who I notice is not in the chamber today; and, I suspect, other members—knows the truth and will not stand up for it.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Let me first reassure the House of my support for the National Forest Policy Statement and its objectives and for the RFAs that have resulted from it. It is a very good statement, and we need legislation to pass this parliament to give support to it. There are some comments being made, and certainly within my own party there seems to be some resonance to do with forest based industries, especially the hardwood industry. There seems to be some feeling that the hardwood industry is bad and that softwoods or plantation hardwoods are good. They do not seem to be able to move through that and see that there is a whole history of industry there and that it is a much more complex industry than that and that we need to look at it.
We do need to have forest products advisory councils or a body to help government, along with the stakeholders in this industry, to drive it forward. We need to push through, and I think some people in my party need come to grips with the fact that this country does import $1.9 billion worth of forest products and forest based products and that there is a need to make sure that we can replace some of those with Tasmanian and Australian grown industry products. In Tasmania we have a situation of pulp wood coming in from Indonesia to go into our paper making plants. We have woodchips sitting on the wharf in Burnie to go off to Japan. It is a 
 pretty hard thing to tell people that there is some rational industry plan or rational understanding of this industry going on or that we have got our act together. We certainly have not; and, when they see that, it is very hard for people to understand—especially when workers and communities are suffering because of it.
In Tasmania we have been selling woodchips to Japan, and only to Japan, and this is now of course starting to reflect on us as well, because we have had all our eggs in the one basket and, with the downturn in that industry in Japan, the pressure that is being applied back into Tasmania onto the contractors in the forest based industries and also onto the workers in these industries is quite severe. There are a lot of people suffering greatly.
It does not help that we go through some of these tortured positions and cannot find goodwill, even within this parliament, to make some way forward in this. I feel quite bad and inadequate that we have not been able to move forward. I think it reflects on some people within the process that they have got very closed minds and are unable to shift in this area. The minister read out what the member for McMillan was saying—that is, that we should get above the political process and endeavour to move forward, and I think we should. With regard to the disallowance amendment that my party moved, I have stated publicly that I am opposed to it and will continue to oppose it. It came about because of the RFA position in Western Australia and the associated problems there. The campaign push to discredit RFAs was moved to the eastern states and failed; so I think people should now move on and find some goodwill so that we can make this bill pass the parliament and build a forest products industry, find investment, give security and get on with it for those communities and those people who work within this industry.

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—It is all very well for the member for Lyons to struggle through that sort of speech trying to support his colleagues, but in fact he does not support the Labor amendments; he really 
 does support the workers out there in the bush. He knows it, because the Deputy Premier of Tasmania said:
The Labor amendments, as they are currently drafted, have serious implications for Tasmania and the now enacted Tasmanian RFA. The Tasmanian RFA, which has been completed in good faith, is at risk of being compromised by the proposed amendments to the bill.
That is the reality of it. I think all of the Labor members in Tasmania must be feeling pretty poor at the moment that they are being forced to support amendments that the Labor Party are putting forward. When the National Forest Policy Statement was brought down by the Labor Party in 1992, many people thought it was too good to be true. The reason they thought it was too good to be true was that it was based on science. For the first time in almost decades, the Labor Party were prepared to put something together in the forest industry which actually had a science base. How long did it last? Not that long, it seems, when you look at these amendments. All of a sudden, out went the science and in came the political science, because that is the only type of science that is known on that side of the House. Go around all the members of the ALP and try and find one single person who really understands science—impossible. They all have studied political science—you do not get into parliament with the ALP unless you are a political scientist, not a real scientist. That is really the crux of this. It was actually shown quite clearly in that quote which the member for McEwen read before. The whole quote from Tim Daly of the AWU read:
The AWU in WA represents workers in the forest industry in this state. I am today advised that the ALP caucus has decided to support a disallowance provision to be placed on the Regional Forest Agreement Bill.
I am particularly concerned that the decision taken by the ALP is a political decision and not one based on science or fact.
Even the AWU know that the ALP have thrown out science and brought political science back in. The quotes are there to support that.
In my electorate of Eden-Monaro there was no better example than the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, who totally 
 ignored the science—even before the science was completed. He did not even allow the economic science to be done to look at the socioeconomic impact on the communities. That had not even been completed. And what did he do? He locked up all the forest areas into national park. He conned the Liberal and National parties in New South Wales to support a bill in the New South Wales house and consequently the National Forest Policy Statement was basically out the window when it came to the Eden agreement. The minister at the table, Minister Tuckey, did his utmost under the circumstances of what was left to negotiate to get a slightly better deal out of it in the end. But it could have been a much better deal—not only for the workers in the bush, so many of whom were lost to my electorate well before I came into parliament, but also for conservation. When you throw away the science, you also throw away the science of the environment. People should remember that. Too often they come up with a so-called good political decision but ultimately it will be a bad decision scientifically—not only from the timber industry point of view but also from the conservation point of view.
The Southern RFA at the moment is under negotiation in my area. There is a long way to go with that, and this is why this piece of legislation in the form in which the government has put it is crucial to give the security. It really is beyond me why those  members opposite who represent communities that will benefit from resource security for the timber industry have not applied pressure to their leader on this. As we have heard from various people recently, the shadow minister has been sidelined on this debate; it has been run by political hacks out of Beazley's office. I am surprised that the members for Paterson, McMillan, Bendigo, Braddon, Bass, Franklin and Lyons have not realised that their leader is not in much of a bargaining position at the moment—he needs all the help he can get, and I think he needs to keep the member for Hotham at bay. I urge the Labor Party to listen to the people and, like the Deputy Premier of Tasmania and Michael O'Connor, take the political science out of this debate and put back the real science.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I wish to address some technical legal matters that have been raised in this debate. The proposition that has been put forward that the bill may be vulnerable to legal challenge is false. It has been done on the basis of an opinion provided by the Office of General Counsel, dated 10 August 1999. The thrust of that opinion is that the amendments would create two possible outcomes that could result in an infringement of section 99 and that the bill itself if amended as proposed would probably infringe section 99. Both propositions are expressed in the most qualified of language and are wrong. Moreover, the reasoning supporting them conflicts with the considered advice, dated 12 February, tendered to the parliament by the Office of General Counsel to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, whose report has been published in this parliament.
The issue of what constitutes the kind of discrimination that constitutes a prohibited preference is discussed in Hanks's Australian Constitutional Law, 6th edition, at pages 620-622. What appears clear from the decided cases is that the approach that the High Court has adopted in the past has been to look to the form of the law. If the law applies the same set of rules uniformly or if the difference in treatment is unrelated to geographical criteria, then the law is not invalid by reason of section 99, notwithstanding that the application of the law may lead to unequal outcomes. Thus, in the opinion submitted to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, the Office of General Counsel concluded at paragraph 8.21:
The consequence of sections 5 l(ii) and 99 being considered as establishing a `free trade area' throughout the territory of the Commonwealth is that the discrimination that they prohibit is discrimination between different places on the basis of geographical criteria . Legislation will not be discriminatory in this sense if it applies non-geographical criteria even though the application of those criteria may have different consequences in different places because of inherent differences between those places.
The amendments proposed by the opposition do not discriminate in that sense at all. It may be conceded that the amendments `discriminate' between those RFAs signed and in 
 effect at the date of the commencement of the act and future prospective RFAs by deeming the former to have complied with the act's procedural and substantive requirements whilst reserving the right of the houses of parliament to examine the latter to satisfy themselves as to whether they in fact comply, but this does not offend section 99.
This is not discrimination with respect to states or parts of states. It is merely the parliament adopting a process of dealing with the fact that some RFAs will have been completed and signed at the date of the act's commencement and some will not. Having actual knowledge of those already signed it consents to them; not having knowledge of those yet to be entered into it requires them to be submitted for scrutiny and disallowance if they do not meet the standards mandated by the legislation. Plainly, on the state of the existing authorities, the amendments are constitutionally sound.
For completeness, I should indicate that Hanks draws attention to the fact that the High Court's historical approach in section 99:
. . . may require reassessment at some later stage in light of the High Court's decision in Street v Queensland Bar Association .
But, were it to do so, it would mean looking at the actual operation of the law and the court comparing each RFA given legislative sanction by the act. It could lead to a quagmire of issues regarding whether the processes and substantive outcomes between different RFAs were or were not materially different. If they applied that test, they would apply the test that, in the words of Mr Justice McHugh:
Discrimination can arise just as readily from a law which treats as equals those who are different as it can from a law which treats differently those whose circumstances are not materially different.
But that difficulty, if it arose, would apply equally to the bill as amended and to the bill as submitted by the government.
If the High Court would set aside its hitherto unanimity, then that issue would arise irrespective of the course of this debate. Indeed, from a positive point of view, it may be argued that the disallowance mechanism actually provides the means for this parlia 
 ment to ensure greater opportunity to ensure compliance with the equality of treatment provisions mandated by section 99.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1
"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—What a sad day for timber workers and their families. Let us be absolutely clear about this, and let no-one be in any doubt at all, that the member for Lyons has very clearly summed up what his position is. The great challenge for him now is to vote against his party, and I challenge him to do that. The great challenge for the member for McMillan is to come in here and defend his position vis-a-vis his comments to Minister Tuckey in relation to the urgency of this legislation going through. Let us be very clear that what we are talking about today is the ability of timber workers and their families, and conservationists, to have some certainty in relation to an industry that this nation desperately needs.
We are not talking about an industry that you can package up in a small ball and toss in the wastepaper basket. We are talking about an industry upon which many hundreds of thousands of regional and rural Australians rely. It is not just the people in the forest, it is the people outside the forests servicing them. Those families and those children—
Mr Horne interjecting—
—Now, Bob, you are in an incredibly difficult position because you have not got the intestinal fortitude to stand up for your timber workers and the blue-collar workers that you are meant to represent.
—I can't support this minister.
—Why don't you support your timber workers?
—Why don't you support my timber workers?
—Let us not underestimate the significance of this debate today. This extraordinary attempt by the Labor Party, against every single person in the process, to talk about disallowance and other motions is just plain nonsense. The member for Reid—someone that I personally respect and admire because we have taken up issues together—simply cannot come into this House and read a prepared speech, prepared by one of his 
 staff members, the great basis of which was to attack the minister. What does that add to the debate? Nothing at all. There was no talk about the issues, and I am personally disappointed. I want to read from a letter from Trevor Smith, the National Secretary of the CFMEU, the union that represents the workers in the forest and the union that has been very happy to have the minister that you have been attacking stand side by side with them in timber mills throughout Australia.
Surely you do not mean to tell this House, Laurie, that they do not respect the minister when they are prepared to stand side by side with him! He is invited to do so because they know that the coalition government is the one providing a reasonable opportunity for some certainty in an industry that is pivotal in rural and regional Australia. In a letter dated 12 March, Trevor Smith, National Secretary of the CFMEU, said:
On the issue of disallowance, I again repeated the Unions position that it does not support this proposal as we believe that it is a proposal that would again take the Parliamentary Labor Party down the road of tearing itself apart over forest issues.
Quite frankly, I am not terribly interested whether the Labor Party tears itself apart over forest industries, but I am terribly interested in the forest workers and the people in regional and rural Australia. He goes on:
In fact the mechanism of a disallowance mechanism was never raised during the ALP Opposition's response to the first introduction of the RFA Bill by Minister Anderson last year.
If the disallowance mechanism becomes part of the RFA process, then every RFA will become subject to a disallowance vote and a campaign from those who wish to derail the RFA process. This could see the whole NFSP/RFA initiative of the former Labor Government being completely gutted.
I am going to stay here because I want to speak on this again, but I challenge people whom I respect on the other side of the House to get some commonsense in relation to something that should not even have to be debated today. It is far too important to those people out there who are relying on us to give them a future. (Time expired)

"Lawrence, Carmen, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—It is very important that we realise what we are doing here today, and that is basically examining amendments that the Senate has required in order for this legislation, the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 , to be passed. It need be said the legislation would be passed if these amendments were accepted. So, if there is any delay, it is on the part of the government. You simply have to accept these amendments. In my view, these amendments from the Senate are a reasonable minimum required by this parliament. Why the government is resisting them is beyond belief.
Regional forest agreements have a long term and massive impact on our forests. Therefore, it is quite reasonable that the Senate and this House ask for better scrutiny. It is reasonable that the regional forest agreements be subjected to public scrutiny before their final ratification.
—They are.
—The minister interjects that they are. In Western Australia, the Regional Forest Agreement was signed off before anybody else saw it. There was no public scrutiny. That is the way this operates. It is essential too that we look at this expanded set of objectives that the Senate has requested. They better reflect sustainable management, conservation values and the need for a decent industry. They are, as has been said, the intent of the national forest policy. Why is the government resisting them? They are in the original agreement, the one it purports to support.
The Senate disallowance, in my view, is the best mechanism for making sure there is proper public scrutiny of these very important agreements. These agreements are not only about the present but also about the future. We are talking about the next 20 years. The experience in Western Australia is instructive, and it is very important in assessing these amendments. We in Western Australia have seen a very flawed process by all, leading to a very poor outcome. Depending on the polls you look at, 80 per cent or 90 per cent of 
 Western Australians agree with that assessment.
By the way, before the RFAs were properly concluded or even debated, considered or examined, one of the first acts of the Court government was to massively increase the woodchip levels, pretty much to double them. The woodchip industry is a low employment sector, taking the forests for very little value. There was a very significant slowdown in the alternative of agroforestry and plantations. They took a backward step in 1993, and we are now living with the consequences.
Members opposite like to talk a lot about science and the scientific assessment of these processes. But, in Western Australia, the people involved in the RFA have repudiated and ignored scientific advice, and systematically so, what is more. Just recently, we in Western Australia were told by the government that, in the course of reaching their RFA mark 1, which they have now repudiated, 500 scientists were involved. They were a bit embarrassed when they went back and discovered that a lot of people who had been put on that list of 500 did not agree that they had been involved in the assessment of the RFA. I know a couple of them. They got letters from the minister asking that they commit themselves to be named publicly as being part of the RFA process.
Mr Tuckey interjecting—
—No, the minister in Western Australia. Needless to say, since they had not been involved, most of them did not agree to that and the 500 scientists disappeared without a trace. So there is a lot of suspect science going on in the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement.
We have seen domination too by the Conservation and Land Management Authority, which benefits financially from the continued and expanding exploitation of forests. They are not innocent bystanders; they are players. They are not in a position to properly assess sustainable levels, and there clearly was in Western Australia, again by all assessments, inadequate consultation with the community—not just the conservationists but everybody.
The Regional Forest Agreement that was finally entered into between this government and the state government provided for only a very minuscule increase in the areas reserved. Of course, the result was that it violated the original national forest policy principles and failed to meet even the very inadequate RFA principles that were endorsed by this government. It fell far short of it, and everybody could see that.
There has been a refusal by this government to heed the very strong community opinion in Western Australia, and there has been harassment and attempts by the Western Australian government particularly to exclude protesters from forests, and I will speak a little more about that later. But the original agreement failed to provide for restructuring of the industry and industry development as well.

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—We have heard now the voice of the party machine from the member for Fremantle. We heard the legal gobbledegook from the member for Denison. I would like to flip back again to the words of the member for Lyons. He was talking about the importation of $1.9 billion worth of forest products from places like Indonesia. I have bad news for the member for Lyons because, under the crazy and ridiculous agreement proposed by the Labor Party in Queensland, we are going to see more of this sort of importation. I will just give you a quick summary of what is being proposed there.
We are talking about locking up 425,000 hectares of native forest immediately, shutting down all native forest logging within 25 years, and planting and growing to maturity hardwood plantations to replace that natural resource within 25 years—yeah, right! We are going to buy out all of Boral's resources. We are going to keep all the other mills operating, in part, on an area of timber of the order of, I think, 200,000 hectares, on which special logging rules are going to apply, and in that area we are going to log every tree of 40 centimetres or greater diameter—in 200,000 hectares, every tree over 40 centimetres in diameter will be cut. If that is a conservation agreement, if that is an economic agreement 
 and if that is an agreement that takes into account the social consequences, I am the Pope!
The first rule of these important regional forest agreements is that we have to harvest the native forest resource sustainably. The second rule is that we have to involve an assessment of the consequences in an environmental sense and an economic sense, and we also have to consider the social consequences of the agreements that we are reaching.
The grounds on which the Labor Party want to amend this legislation we have now ignore all of those consequences. If you take into account the idea that we are going to propose compensation on the obscure grounds they are proposing to apply, how does that impact on the social consequences? When you simply operate a compensation system where you buy out a mill and you give them a cheque, what does that do for the workers? What does that do for the towns they live in? Who is going to provide for their existence? What is that going to do for the value of homes in that town? Nothing. That compensation completely ignores the onflowing consequences.
As for structural adjustment, the Labor Party's scheme proposes the same kind of cockamamie idea for every single state. Structural adjustment here, structural adjustment there, and everyone will feel wonderful. I can tell you that that is not the basis of a regional forest agreement. The idea of a regional forest agreement is that you look at the specifics for every state, not the great, big, wonderful, Labor Party scheme for every one of them—we ignore the needs of the specific states when we apply one rule for the whole lot.
Also, there is the idea that we bring it back to parliament and have it debated in parliament. I can accept assessing the environmental consequences, economic consequences and social consequences, but the political ones? Do we really have to bring it back here and run a political ruler over everything we do to see if it is politically correct or not? I do not think that is what we should be debating at all.
One of the things that has arisen from what the member for Lyons had to say is whether 
 or not the Labor caucus has had its say about all of this. I know on our side of the House we have been through it backwards and forwards, up hill and down dale. You have not taken it to your caucus, have you? You have not got their backing for this position.
—Order! Address your remarks through the chair.
—We want to see a genuine position. I believe there are more people on the Labor side other than the member for Lyons and the member for McMillan who have grave concerns with the position being foisted on them by the Leader of the Opposition. We have got here a party dictate running the agenda of the members opposite. I invite the member for Lyons and the other members over there to stand up and get your position straight: represent the forest workers in your areas and make sure that, with us, you go ahead to create proper regional forest agreements in every state, not ones driven by a party agenda for political purposes rather than for the purposes of endorsing the timber industry and providing its future on a sustainable basis.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Isn't it interesting to come in here today and listen to the hypocrisy of those members of the government who claim they defend blue-collar workers? If there is a book I look forward to being written, it is a book by Wilson Tuckey called `My View of the World'. It will rank with Gulliver's Travels  and Alice in Wonderland , but it will not have one ounce of fact in it.
Let us talk about fact and let us talk about RFAs in New South Wales. The minister knows, I understand, about RFAs in New South Wales and he knows that his inaction in my electorate is costing jobs right now. This minister knows that the state government of New South Wales passed its regional forest agreement last November. It passed it with the support of the Labor Party, it passed it with the support of the National Party and it passed it with the support of the Liberal Party. What has this minister done about it? The RFA sat on his desk, it sat in a pigeon 
 hole, it sat somewhere, but has he acted on it? No.
What is happening today? Woodchip is being refused from mills. Minister, you would see that if you came into my electorate and visited a few mills. That woodchip is cash flow, but it will not be taken for export. This minister knows that, as of 1 January next year, if that woodchip is carried over, it cannot be sold because the export agreement would be completed by then. If he has not signed off on the RFA that woodchip cannot be exported.
What do we find? The woodchip depot in Newcastle ceased taking woodchip a month ago. Why did it cease taking it? Because this minister refuses to sign off on the RFA for the North Coast and the Mid-North Coast that was supported by his state colleagues in both the National and Liberal parties nearly 12 months ago. He has the audacity to come in here and say that the Labor Party is holding up the progress of the forestry industry, and that is costing jobs in the forestry industry. If ever there was a minister who should be condemned for his inaction on the industry he represents, it is the minister at the table today. He has a deplorable record.
Some members opposite who were not here in 1993 spoke about the National Forest Policy Statement and the urgency for bipartisan attitudes. Hey, I didn't see too much bipartisan attitude back then. I saw lots of people assisting the blockade of Parliament House. I saw lots of people creating as much chaos and as much uncertainty in the timber industry as they possibly could. They were not concerned about blue-collar workers or a dynamic industry at all. All they were interested in was creating havoc, and they did it.
We are talking about a government that has been in power for four years. How much have you done with the National Forest Policy Statement and the RFAs? It has taken you four years to get this far. In New South Wales, it has taken you 12 months to even read it. You certainly have not acted on it. You have not acted in the interest of workers. Really, the forestry industry is embarrassed that it did show you some support in 1996, because it knows that under this minister and 
 this government the industry has gone backwards.
Minister, the next time you want to come to my electorate, I am quite willing to make a day or so available to you. We will travel around and talk to some sawmillers and forestry workers, and we will personally see the respect they have for you. We will also visit some of those people who have lost their jobs because woodchip is not being accepted because of your inaction.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—What an amazing phenomenon we have here in this House today for those people who were here in 1995 and saw the blockade around the parliament. Members of the Labor Party are saying that they will not support the RFA; they have experienced ministers in the former Labor government fighting amongst themselves—Minister Collins, Minister Beddall and others. They understood that the RFA process was a flow-on from the National Forest Policy Statement and they instituted the arrangements. They understood the difficulties of putting the RFA into practice and they were part of the loggers blockade around this parliament. Yet they come into the parliament today and basically want to remove the RFA process. They want to remove the fundamental legal aspects of the RFA process—the National Forest Policy Statement that they put in place when they were in government.
We have a position where the shadow minister at the table, Mr Laurie Ferguson, has sold out on the workers; he has not been in the forest like the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, who is also at the table. The shadow minister has not supported his workers. The member for Lyons has got the courage and the understanding to support his workers in the electorate of Tasmania, because he understands the timber workers and he understands the issues. He understands that we import $1.9 billion worth of timber products and he supports the position that the RFA process is good. The member for Fremantle has got the temerity to come in here and argue about the RFA. I think she was part of the government at the time, but she understood the arguments. The member for 
 McMillan has made a public statement, but he is not here. Where is he to support the timber workers of McMillan? The member for Paterson is here. What is his position? Is he going to vote for or against the RFA? Does he support the workers?
Members of the House should fully understand that the RFA process is based on science—it is sustainable, and, in any one year under this process, one per cent of the hardwood forests will be harvested. Let us get that fact very clear: one per cent of hardwood forests will be harvested in any one year. Throughout Australia, that is the position. This argument that great tracts of forests are being harvested is factually not true.
To put it clearly on the record again for those opposite who do not understand, the RFA process will provide for a sustainable yield over the next 20 years. It was agreed to by the various parties. There has been a lot of debate on the comprehensive adequate reserve system, but it will be in the RFA. What about job creation? This is creating jobs, not taking jobs out of the system, as members on this side have talked about. We are trying to create jobs in the forest industry, and it will be ecologically sustainable on the basis of scientific assessment. There is the JANIS system, supported by a number of people in the environmental movement, whereby we have 15 per cent pre-European, 60 per cent old growth forests and 90 per cent high quality wilderness.
In my own area, the Otways, we have four timber mills, directly employing more than 200 people, with further flow-on jobs. The RFA process that is under consideration in western Victoria affects those people; it affects jobs. The Kirner government were well known for their environmental tendencies. Indeed, then Premier Kirner had a long interest in the whole debate. The Kirner government's report suggested that there would be 44,000 cubic metres of sustainable yield. That was done on a scientific basis under a Labor government, and that will be the basis of a lot of debates in that area.
Minister Tuckey came down to Colac in the heartland of Corangamite. He was a friend of the workers. We had 200 workers in Colac 
 supporting Minister Tuckey because he was supporting their position, supporting their jobs. He put the arguments cogently and clearly to the workers of Colac and the timber workers at the Otways. He had very strong support for his position because he outlined to them what the RFA process was about. The Tasmanians have signed their RFA. New South Wales have signed it, but there is a lot of suggestion that it is not sustainable. The Victorian Central Highlands have signed; the north-east have signed; East Gippsland has signed. Gippsland and Western Victoria will sign.
The RFA is based on science. The premiers and the Prime Minister sign the RFAs. That will ensure that jobs will be available for the next 20 years. Members opposite are putting up some amendments to try to remove the effectiveness of the RFA process.

"Sidebottom, Peter, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Today demonstrates several things, and the first is that the history of this issue is basically bound up in conflict and consensus. I do not hear anybody in this House saying that they do not want consensus on this issue. Everybody in this House says that they support the National Forest Policy Statement and the principles associated with it. We share that. We also support regional forest agreements and the processes. What we have difficulty are the clauses, the regulations and the methods that we use to go about achieving the principles of the National Forest Policy Statement.
It is a nonsense for those opposite to suggest that, because I do not agree with them about the method and the process, I do not care about the jobs of people working in the forest industry—and they know that. It goes on in this House over just about every policy that we may disagree on, and it is stupid. Everybody in this House at the moment supports the families and the communities associated with the timber and forest industries. So do not start shouting at me and saying that I do not care. I do, just the same as you do. So let us stop that nonsense.
Mr Cameron Thompson interjecting—
—Well, it is. The way we carry on sometimes really does beggar belief. I know that you care. I know that, for all your intervention, Minister, you care as well. We are going to disagree about how we go about it, so be it; that is what we will argue. There are difficulties for some of us with these amendments. They have come back into this House from the Senate. We say to you, Minister, `Take up these amendments, consider them in more detail and we will arrive at a consensus,' because we will then achieve the aims of the regional forest agreements that we agree on, and we also support the principles of the National Forest Policy Statement.
I recognise that it is impossible to legislate for investment in downstream processing. The loss of jobs highlights why we must strive for some form of mutual obligation in the RFA process. There is an absence of true, Commonwealth sponsored industry development, and we have still not heard about the so-called action strategy. This strategy has been long awaited, Minister, and I do look forward to it because I know that you have a passion for this industry, like we do. I look forward to the detail and hope that you will share that with us. We will reach consensus on that and stand here in this House and say, `Let's get on with it.' I look forward to that, Minister. But in the absence of that to date, many of us have reservations about legislation which gives a blank cheque to future RFAs that has not been scrutinised by this parliament.
An industry which is environmentally responsible and economically sustainable and which creates jobs is the key to the success of regional forest agreements at state and federal levels. Any RFA must be accompanied by a comprehensive industry policy that grows jobs, not just trees and profits. The 1995 Wood and Paper Industry Strategy developed by the federal Labor government set the wheels in motion for the regional forest agreements that are now being taken up around Australia. The federal Australian Labor Party has consistently given in principle support to the legislative enactment of the objectives of the National Forest Policy 
 Statement of 1992, and we have reaffirmed that since, as you have.
Not only does this principle endorse the RFA process of balancing the economic, environmental, heritage and cultural factors involved but it clearly incorporates within the RFA a commitment to industry development, downstream processing and value adding—in short, to mutual obligation. The amendments proposed by the ALP ensure that out of a RFA a commitment is made to implementing an industry policy that will provide job security for the current work force and grow more jobs by value adding the resource rather than seeing that resource going out as woodchips or unprocessed whole logs. My colleague the member for Lyons talked about the woodchip pile at Burnie and the fact that we import pulp. People want to see an association between protection and security and downstream processing. We all agree with that, so we need to encourage value adding. This will be done not through resource security alone but also through an industry policy being attached to it.

"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—With the greatest respect to the member for Braddon, we are not talking today about things at the edges, about little bits and pieces of minor regulations. We are debating today the integrity of this process. You cannot, on the one hand, say, `We support the National Forest Policy Statement, we support (a), (b) and (c) and we support RFAs.' The realities are that, if this goes through—if the Labor Party has its way—the utter integrity of this process will be put at risk. It is just not good enough to stand there and say, `I do care for my timber workers. Do not accuse me of not caring for them.' I am sure that the member for Braddon does care for them. I have never said that he does not, but the outcome of what he is doing today means that he is going to attack those timber workers and their families and their future. This is not about bits and pieces at the edges. It is about the integrity of the process. I am sure that the timber workers in Tasmania would love to read the member for Denison's speech where he talked about constitutional matters—I doubt that is going 
 to be of great importance to them. I will again read to you the comments of Trevor Smith:
If the disallowance mechanism becomes part of the RFA process, then every RFA will become subject to a disallowance vote and a campaign from those who wish to derail the RFA process. This could see the whole NFPS/RFA initiative of the former Labor Government being completely gutted.
So we are not, with the greatest respect to the member for Braddon, talking about bits and pieces at the edges. We are talking about the basic principles of this process. It is not good enough, with the greatest respect to him, to stand there and say, `We can reach a bit of consensus and compromise on this and get it through.' You have the opportunity here as a member of the Australian Labor Party to support the government on this and to support your timber workers. It is not about those things at the edges; it is about the basic principles of the RFA process. That is the decision that you guys have to make—whether you are prepared to stand up for and effect your own policy. We are implementing your policy—you are voting against your policy.
There are many people in my own electorate, in the Wombat Forest, who have an extraordinary interest in this matter—whether it is the Forest Protection Society and its local branch president, Debbie Mauric, or the Wombat Forest Society—which is an environmental based group led by Tim Anderson—everyone has a great interest in this. The member for Braddon, the member for Lyons and the shadow minister for forestry and conservation know that the integrity of this process, in relation to both the industry and conservation, is what makes the RFA process what it is—it is a mixture of both. It looks at all those issues. The three main objectives of the RFA—I want to read them into Hansard—are:
to protect environmental values and a Comprehensive, Adequate and Representative (CAR) Reserve System based on nationally agreed criteria;
to encourage job creation and growth in forest-based industries, including wood products, tourism and minerals; and
to manage all native forests in an ecologically sustainable way. 

It is a complete package; you know that and I know that. But you must also understand that, if you destroy the absolute fabric of the RFA process—which is the certainty for industry and environmentalists—you destroy the principles of the RFA process. That is what your decision is about today. You cannot come in here and say, `I support the RFA process,' and then continue with your amendments because, by voting against the government, you are not voting for the RFA process—you are voting the RFA process down. It is as simple as that. While we can talk about things at the edges, that is what this debate today is about. Ultimately, you have that in your hands. If you are prepared to support us, you will see the certainty and the integrity of the RFA process that you want maintained. If you do not vote with us, you are voting against the process. That is something that you will need to go back to your own members about.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I congratulate the parties to an historic agreement on the future of the forests of south-east Queensland. I congratulate the Beattie government, especially Jim Elder as the Minister for State Development, the officials of the Department of State Development and Rod Welford, the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources. I congratulate the Australian Workers Union. It bargained hard and negotiated hard on this agreement to protect the jobs of workers and insisted on extra jobs being created. That is what has been achieved in this agreement. Bill Ludwig has been at the forefront of that endeavour, and he has succeeded. I congratulate the conservation movement. Most active in that movement have been Dr Aila Keto and Keith Scott. I congratulate the Queensland Timber Board, which is also a party to this agreement. I am very disturbed, however, to hear suggestions that the National Association of Forest Industries has advised the Queensland Timber Board against this agreement.
This is a historic agreement and it reflects the negotiating skills and goodwill of all the parties to the agreement. This agreement involves the creation of extra jobs in the forest industry and provides certainty that has 
 never been available before—for a period of 25 years—for the forest industry of south-east Queensland. I was extremely concerned to hear the contribution to this debate from the member for Blair, who condemned the agreement. He condemned an agreement that will provide certainty to the industry for 25 years and create extra jobs. The member for Blair is opposed to the creation of extra jobs in the forest industry. This is completely perplexing to me. I say to the Minister for Forestry and Conservation: in a spirit of goodwill, I urge you to sign up to this agreement. If he and his department and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet have concerns or questions about the agreement, I want those concerns and questions expressed, as they have been, to Queensland officials, and have this issue resolved quickly.
I understand that the meetings have been going pretty well, so I see no reason—other than the possibility of political opportunism—for the minister not to sign up to this agreement. The mills that are affected by this are being offered the prospect of certainty in their investment decisions for a full 25 years. The mayors of those towns are urging the federal government to sign up to this agreement—to recognise it as a proper regional forest agreement and to be a party to it. Those mills need the financial support that is potentially on offer from the federal government. Yet the minister continues to ask questions. I want to see that resolved so that those mills get the certainty that they deserve.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this debate is about the RFA legislation and the amendments made in the Senate, not about a Queensland agreement totally outside the National Forest Policy Statement, which is all the member is talking about. He is not talking about the bill before us.
—There is no point of order. I have listened very carefully to what has been said.
—That was a frivolous point of order. We are talking about a regional forest agreement here. It is a historic agreement. In a spirit of goodwill, I am urging the Minister for Forestry and Conser 
 vation to sign up for the historic agreement and allocate the necessary funds to complete the arrangements for it. If the member for Eden-Monaro does not understand that this debate is about regional forest agreements—and what we are talking about for Queensland is a regional forest agreement—he has walked into the House by accident and is participating in another debate completely.
As a result of these discussions between officials, it is time for the minister to make his decision to support the future of the forests and workers and to give certainty to the timber mills being offered certainty as a result of this excellent agreement involving all parties in Queensland. Please, Minister, sign up to the agreement. Get on with it so that we have that certainty, future prosperity in the industry and the good conservation outcome that is promised by this agreement.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I do not think I should let what the member for Rankin has just said go by. The Queensland agreement that he was referring to is not good for the timber industry or the environment in Queensland. It does not fit the social needs of the people of Queensland. It is not going to help the economy of Queensland. In fact, it is a disaster. I was interested to hear the member say that the National Association of Forest Industries has advised the Queensland Timber Board against it. I am not surprised at  that at all. The Premier of Queensland, Mr Peter Beattie, made a huge hullabaloo about the agreement, but all his TV ads called it `a historic agreement'.
The agreement was signed not by the Australian Workers Union, which was a party to an earlier agreement involving the Queensland Timber Board, but by various representatives of the Greens, one representative of the Queensland Timber Board and the Queensland Premier. They were the only signatories. The one name from the Queensland Timber Board was Mr McNamara. Now the Queensland Timber Board have put out a statement, which they have sent to a member of Queensland parliament, saying that they are no longer calling it a `historic agreement'; it is now an 
 `in-principle agreement'. On 11 October, the Queensland Timber Board said:
We look forward to a thorough, robust and rigorous investigation of the primary data surrounding the in principle RFA agreement so that any flaws uncovered can be quickly debated and that appropriate parts of the agreement can be renegotiated.
That is not an agreement; that is a recipe for disaster. I spoke earlier about some of the ramifications of the agreement. It locks up 425,000 hectares of native forest immediately, shuts down all native forest logging forever in 25 years and proposes that we plant and grow an entire hardwood resource from seedlings to maturity in 25 years to such a point where the government anticipate they will get 10 times the yield of a native forest resource in Queensland in 25 years. Yet they cannot say what species they are going to grow, and they do not have one square metre of ground on which they are going to grow it. I would call that an absolutely airy-fairy agreement. How the Queensland Timber Board ever got sucked into it I do not understand. Frankly, how the environment movement ever got sucked into it I do not understand either. By shutting down this native forest hardwood resource and not sustainably logging it, they are ensuring that instead we will continue to rip down more forests in Indonesia and places like that which, as the member for Lyons said, we import timber from.
This crazy agreement is going to take away from us the responsibility of sustainably managing our forests and deputise the responsibility for that management to Indonesia, Korea, Finland and those places. We are going to sit back here, twiddle our thumbs and wait for the seedlings to grow. By the time the seedlings come up, our timber industry in Queensland will be history. That is a simple fact. There is no way that we will accomplish that kind of outcome in 25 years. I am not surprised now that the Queensland Timber Board should be backing away from the stupid agreement that it signed with the Queensland Premier.
If we are going to reach an RFA, the first thing the Queensland government is going to have to do is make an agreement under which it is going to sustainably log that existing 
 native hardwood resource. We would all love to get onto plantations sooner or later, but that resource has to be protected and, by harvesting the logs, we provide the mechanism for its protection. This is a eucalypt forest. If we get out of there, we can say that it is protected. But our word to protect it will not stop the next bushfire that comes along, particularly when we have taken away all the road resources, the people up the fire towers and all the other things that come with logging. The simple fact is that that is the way the industry is managed in Queensland—a simple fact that the Queensland Timber Board and the greenies completely ignored when they signed the stupid agreement.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—It could be said that there have been some interesting contributions from the government side in this debate. The member for Eden-Monaro, in a very elitist tone, gave the House the impression that the only people who can comment on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  are those with a science `background'. I am often reminded in many of these debates of Dr Johnson's contention that `patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel'. Quite frankly, in the way this debate has been handled—with the self-important tone that it is all science—science certainly seems to be becoming the last refuge of scoundrels. The way in which both sides of this debate around the country can conveniently find what is wrong with the science and its actual process is quite interesting.
Despite the processes the government went through in New South Wales—which were supported by the state coalition very fulsomely, as the member opposite would know—supposedly science was not adhered to. Science was adhered to in Western Australia, and yet the Western Australian government walked away from the agreement. The member for Fremantle cited that Cheryl Edwards spoke about having the support and involvement of 500 scientists. Yet, five minutes later, the government supposedly walked away from this scientifically based agreement. We have the Minister for Forestry and Conservation and the member for Blair whingeing and whining about the Queensland agreement. 
 That is the reality out here. Let us stop kidding ourselves about the supposed scientific basis of either side of the argument. Of course, the minister has not bothered to give the legal advice he received to a number of members opposite.
It is quite interesting to note that, when the same organisation that gives advice to the government in legal matters went before the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, in its report on the provisions of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 it gave diametrically opposite advice. The reality is that the same office came before that committee and said that in that case it was not discrimination. Five minutes later, on the same day the minister sought the advice, it was able to rush across an opinion, which he well knows is basically only out there to confuse the debate, diametrically opposed to what it told the Senate committee in similar provisions. Quite frankly, if there is any validity whatsoever—and there is not—with regard to the government's contentions about our amendments, the same thing can be said about the whole RFA process. The same challenge can be mounted. In both cases, the challenge is fallacious. In both cases, there are no legal grounds for defeating either the bill or our amendments.
The other point is the question of scrutiny. It is dreadful that the Australian people, through their supposedly elected representatives, can have any oversight of this process. We have heard the members opposite saying that any questioning of the minister and what he comes up with undermines this industry. Yet he raced around Tasmania last week boasting about the amount of investment coming into the industry. Of course, that was at the same time as the $218 million deterioration we saw in our forest trade deficit in the last year or so. In all this undermining of the process around the country, he has not given much attention to that aspect of it.
Let us see what parliamentary scrutiny involves. It involves a 15-day process, a 15-day scrutiny of the legislation. For the members opposite to say that the process of oversight by the Senate and by the House of Representatives—elected by the Australian 
 people—was basically an attempt to look at what the government was doing is dreadful, the end of the world, et cetera. The process will not drag on for 20 years; it must be decided within 15 days.
The other point that the member for Paterson made quite clearly is that, at the moment, the minister can sit around twiddling his thumbs and try to undermine various states around Australia with regard to agreements they come to with their industries in their states. He can basically undermine that attempt to intimidate those states and industries and not come before this parliament with the agreement. The other provision that Labor has in its amendments is that, within 21 days, these agreements are basically gazetted so that the parliament has some say and so that the minister is under some pressure to stop stuffing around and undermining state agreements, industry, employment and jobs.
In conclusion, we have had a complaint by those opposite that supporting structural adjustment payments to the industry is supposedly condoning the loss of jobs. The fact of life is the reverse. There will be losses of jobs under this government and under any government. They are saying that they do not want to provide for these workers. They do not want to give one cent. We all know that, under the industrial relations provisions of this country, where there are 15 or fewer employees people receive no redundancy payments.

"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,1999-10-13,"—I sometimes despair about the forestry debate in Australia. As the member for Reid would know, I entered the New South Wales parliament some 15 years ago with him on the same day. If he had listened to my maiden speech, he would have found that it was basically about forestry, because my youth was spent in the forests of northern New South Wales and I know something about them. I know something about the management of forests and I know something about the resource and its ability to provide very good decentralised industry to this country.
In recent times, since the Victorian election, members have stood up here wringing their hands about the plight of regional Australia. 
 I say something to the Labor Party: if they want to help regional Australia, then start helping the forest industry because that is a decentralised industry and it provides work for people in the rural areas. It is not high paying work, I might say, but it is work.
Over 15 years now we have had a dishonest debate about forestry. The green movement have hijacked the agenda with the help of the media. They never print the facts. They always go out there and make some gross dishonest statement about the last remaining trees or the last animal or make some other emotive argument. They never get down to the facts about these issues.
As I said, I grew up in the forests and I can tell you now that koalas do not live in old trees. They are smarter than that because the leaves on an old tree do not contain the nutrients that they need. They live in young, growing trees that are around 15 years old. I have been there and I have seen it. If you lock up these forests—
Mr Wilton interjecting—
—That is typical of what we get from the cities. We get from the cities all the time this argument which is dishonest and not based on fact. The previous Keating government—and I did not agree with a lot of the things it did—made an honest attempt to get some facts and some science into this debate. It made an honest attempt to do that. If you get the facts and the science into the debate, you might get some resolution of this dispute.
If the member for Reid wants to talk to me about what is going on in New South Wales, I can enlighten him on that as well, because that process has been totally manipulated by the NSW minister, Mr Yeadon. Yet he stands up and says, `We want a value adding industry.' How are you going to have a value adding industry if you have not got certainty of resource? That is what this is about. Industry have been saying as long as I can remember—for almost 15 years—that, if we have to invest millions and millions of dollars into equipment that will give us the ability to value add, then we have to have security of resource. That is absolutely basic. The Labor Party in its about-turn on this particular issue 
 wants to have a parliamentary look every time the licences come up. Do you think that is security? There is no way in the wide world that industry will accept that.
The member for Reid says that the coalition agreed to it in New South Wales. I might enlighten him a little bit on that. The coalition agreed to that motion in the parliament only because Col Dorber tramped the corridors of the parliament and threatened them with political repercussions if they did not agree to it, and they were stupid enough to listen to him. He represents only a handful of the sawmilling interests in New South Wales. Why does he represent them? Because they want to get their share of the very small resource that is left at the present time.
The Labor Party has divided and conquered in New South Wales. It has offered some of these people money and said, `We will give you a long-term agreement,' but it has thrown the rest to the wolves. I remember when I was in the New South Wales parliament that Bob Carr, who was the then Minister for Planning and Environment, came into the House one night in a rage after he had announced I think six national parks. He said about the green movement, `They are like timber wolves: you throw them a national park and they look up with languid eyes and ask for more.' That is exactly right. They will not be satisfied until they lock up the whole of the native forest industry in Australia.
If the Labor Party agreed to that, it is an absolute disgrace. No wonder the working classes have said that you have totally deserted them. I think it is about time that the shadow minister started to listen to someone who knows something about it instead of playing politics, because it is not helping Australia and not helping the workers.

"Lawrence, Carmen, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I want to add to my earlier remarks. There has been some comment, quite properly, about the employment generating effects of the forest industry. One of the conspicuous failures of Western Australia's first attempt at an RFA, which was signed off by this minister, was that it failed to provide for such structural adjustment and industry develop 
 ment. Indeed, the history of this industry is a history of declining employment. It has had nothing to do with access to the resource; it has had to do with mechanisation and the changed base of the industry.
I condemn a lot of the people opposite because they fail to provide for the future of workers in these regional areas. They link them to an industry which is inevitably in decline and offer them no hope for the future. It is of interest in Western Australia that those towns where mills have closed down in the south-west, in particular Denmark and Walpole, have been booming since that has occurred. There are alternative industries. There is alternative forestry industry available if the government only had the foresight to embrace it.
The result of the first RFA in Western Australia—and this is why we need scrutiny in public and before the Senate—was community outrage, quite properly, because it failed to meet all reasonable criteria. Of course we had the National Party in Western Australia backing away from it at a million miles an hour—and, before long, most of the backbenchers were too. The government did a backflip and came out with the revision, which was acceptable to nobody, including, apparently, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, who is at the table. We also saw incitement by certain people to violence, which previously had not occurred in this debate in Western Australia. The minister at the table I think can be fairly said to have encouraged workers in the south-west to invade some of the protest camps.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1

"Lawrence, Carmen, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I think if the member examines what I said, he will find that I said, `He is said to have incited.' That is the report that came out of the Sunday Times , where it says:
ANGRY timber workers warned shaken protesters yesterday to leave the South-West or risk being bashed by night hit squads.
Conservationists were terrorised by 40 armed loggers who ransacked and burnt a bush camp at Wattle Block, 55 km south of Manjimup.
The vigilante loggers wielded baseball bats, axes and sledgehammers as they wrecked the camp and threatened to kill eight protesters.
They also turned on the Sunday Times  photographer Kerry Berrington when they spotted him at the edge of the camp.
The account goes on:
Some of the loggers wore balaclavas to hide their identity.
That is certainly something that the opposition knows about. It is very clear that some days before, as reported by the Sunday Times :
Mr Tuckey said it was time the anti-logging protesters were forced out of the South-West.
The Sunday Times  reports that he spoke of a war in the forests. It is very clear that, prior to the intervention of this minister, the protests were occurring in a reasonable manner. There was disagreement certainly in Western Australia but nothing of this kind took place. For the first time we had violence taking place in the south-west of Western Australia.
As a result of that backflip by the Court government we have yet another inquiry into the sustainability of logging. It is very clear that Wesfarmers/Bunnings, who have a virtual monopoly in Western Australia, used the government about-face as a blind for further reduction in the work force. They blamed the policy change, but it was completely unrelated. The minister says that the revision is 
 unacceptable, but he is being provocative and florid in attacks on his own party. Had the original RFA been set in concrete, as the government's RFA legislation proposed, this RFA would have been impossible to modify, would have been impossible to change. That is what all the voters of Western Australia want, Minister. It is interesting that no government member from Western Australia is in this House. They know that that is the community opinion.
—Before I call the member for McEwen, I issue a general warning to members to address their remarks through the chair.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I rise yet again in this debate to remind those members present and those listening what this debate is really about. I am going to use as an example the Central Highlands, which is within my electorate of McEwen. We have a signed RFA for the Central Highlands of Victoria. The Central Highlands is made up of many small towns.
I listened to the previous speaker in this debate, who is now departing the chamber, accuse members on this side of representing areas where we are not encouraging new industries. We do not have just the timber industry in the Central Highlands; we have groups of people developing new industries like wasabi, green tea and tourism. These people are desperate to remain within the beautiful Central Highlands of Victoria.
Most importantly, hundreds of families have been involved in the timber industry over many generations. During that period many of those people have moved with the times; they have learnt how to value add a timber product. Gone are the days when those timber families went out into the forests, clear felled, brought the product back and simply sold it off in its original raw state. That value adding takes a lot of investment.
When the RFA was actually signed in the Central Highlands I had numerous contractors, mill owners, people working in all areas of the timber industry—that is, people working in the forests and people servicing people working in the timber industry—coming to 
 me because they wanted a copy of the RFA. They wanted a copy of that RFA to take it to their local bank manager because the bank manager recognised that as security. Not today will those bank managers in the Central Highlands look at a copy of an RFA and regard that as security in lending money to people who want to invest in their region in order to create employment.
Members can stand up in this place and make spurious arguments. We have seen the member for Denison stand up and give an alternative legal opinion. That actually proves the very point that we are making that, wherever you get two legal practitioners, you are going to get a difference of view. That is the very aspect that is undermining the security for investment that could flow if we get this legislation through.
We have also heard people talk spuriously about the science that has been involved. The whole RFA process, based on the National Forest Policy Statement brought into this place in October 1992, has undergone the most open period of scrutiny of anything that I have ever been associated with in this place. Yet these people stand up and say that there has not been sufficient consultation and they question the science. This is a nonsense.
I pay credit to the member for Lyons because he at least knows his communities. He knows what the security and certainty of this legislation means to those families and workers within the area he represents.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I have a request of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. Could the minister please indicate in his summing up and response to this debate whether he is disposed towards supporting the agreement that has been reached on forests in Queensland. The reason I ask is that this is a very important agreement. It provides security and certainty for the industry for 25 years, it creates additional jobs and it achieves the important conservation objectives. 
I am asking this in a spirit of goodwill because this debate about the future of forests in Australia has gone on for many years. I was first associated with it back in 1986. Here is a rare and unique opportunity to remove the politics from this debate. All the parties to the agreement in Queensland have worked very hard, in a spirit of cooperation and goodwill, to achieve the agreement that has been reached.
I am alarmed by the comments of the member for Blair. I hope what he has had to say does not reflect the official government position in relation to the agreement in Queensland. He may see some merit in making speeches like that from the point of view of his own electorate. I guess that is up to him. I would like to see the minister and the government embrace the agreement in Queensland. Here is an opportunity today for the minister to indicate not necessarily his final position on it but whether he is moving towards endorsing this agreement and thereby providing Commonwealth assistance to bring the agreement into full effect—assistance that is needed to allow these mills to continue operations for a guaranteed period of 25 years, which is a long time in any investment horizon. There is a great opportunity. I want the politics removed from this debate. So I say sincerely to the minister, in a spirit of goodwill, could you please indicate the direction in which you are moving in relation to the Queensland agreement.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,6,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I wish to add to the remarks I have put on the record previously and continue to argue the case that the amendments put forward by the Senate bring certainty to the RFA process. The member for Denison supported that argument quite strenuously in his contribution to this debate by saying that there can be some legal interpretation by both sides of the debate on the amendments and the way in which the Senate might look at the RFA process. The very point we are making on this side of the parliament is that the amendments open up the RFA process to yet another debate. The shadow minister at the table suggested 14 days. This allows everyone 
 in the political process to have yet another go at the RFA that has been agreed to.
The RFA process is based on the science of forestry. I notice that members opposite are challenging that position. The truth of the matter is that, when the Labor Party was in government, it agreed that a process should be set in train that allowed the scientists, the environmentalists and the loggers to make a contribution on the sustainability of forest operations.
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—The shadow minister at the table understands, because he was in the government at the time and he understood that it was very difficult to make judgments about which parts of the forests should be logged and which parts should be locked up for national parks and non-logging.
The RFA process involved consultation between the various interest groups. The conservationists had a go. The loggers had a go. The departments had a go. The federal government had a go. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry had a go. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage made a contribution. In the Labor government there was a great argument between the two ministers as to what the final outcome would be—so much so that the departments had logging coupes in Bass Strait. That is how stupid it was. What we are saying is that this process, difficult though it is, should be one where all parties are involved.
Professor Ferguson, who is known to me, is a professor from Melbourne University and the Creswick School of Forestry and regarded as a world authority on forestry matters. That is a world renowned institution for producing foresters and reputable undertakings and for making scientific assessments of forestry matters. Professor Ferguson has broadly endorsed the RFA process. He is prepared to comment and add his weight of scientific opinion to the process.
I remind members opposite and members of this House that forests comprise young trees that grow to become mature trees that eventually die. I think a lot of people who have 
 contributed to this debate have tended to overlook that fundamental issue.
—I remind the minister of standing order 57, which is that no member may pass between the chair and the member who is speaking.
—I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—The process of forestry allows trees to mature and, if no harvesting takes place, eventually die. We have an opportunity in Australia for these trees to be harvested for commercial purposes. The RFA process is an open and world-class process. Both sides would agree with that. This is unlike a lot of other countries around the world, where there is no such process for allowing various groups to put their points of view.
The hardwood timber used by a number of these mills, which provide jobs, as the member for Page has so clearly pointed out, comes from public forests in general terms. The suggestion that there would be a plantation of hardwood has never been substantiated by any advocate of that position. Hardwood forests take between 40 and 60 years to reach maturity. There are insufficient hardwood plantations to make up that shortfall. In the case of Queensland, the suggestion that after 25 years there will be sufficient plantation hardwood logs to make the product and allow the industry to continue is fanciful.
On a political point, I quote again the statement of Michael O'Connor, the National Secretary of the CFMEU, on the Labor Party's position:
Beazley's comments were a betrayal of tens of thousands of workers throughout Australia employed in the forest and forest products industry. Beazley has torn up the ALP national policy and has deceived workers, their families and communities of regional Australia and he has signalled that the federal ALP is out to get timber workers. Beazley's comments give the ALP commitments to the National Forest Policy Statement the value of a dud cheque.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—Both the member for McEwen and the member for Corangamite have demonstrated the circum 
 stance where there is a problem of simultaneous adherence to two contradictory positions in respect of this debate. The difficulty that they put forward suggesting there may be some legal challenge to the bill is accurate, but it arises not because of anything the opposition is proposing. In fact, I find it extraordinarily puzzling that the government is seeking to give any weight to advice that suggests the historic and constitutionally settled view of section 99 would be overturned, because, were it to be overturned, it would open not the bill as amended by the opposition to the possibility of challenge but the whole process of RFA establishment and the bill itself as proposed by the government.
I have made plain that the government received a considered and extensive legal advice which it tendered to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, which reported on 25 February 1999. In that advice the government pointed out that preference necessarily involves discrimination or lack of uniformity but discrimination or lack of uniformity does not necessarily involve preference. It referred to the case of Elliott v. The Commonwealth and the judgments of Chief Justice Latham and other authorities. On that basis, and on the advice that was tendered to the Senate committee—a considered advice—there would be no difficulty with the constitutional validity of the bill as proposed by the government, nor the amendments as proposed by the opposition.
I raised that the subsequent advice which was obtained by the minister—sought and obtained on the same day to a different effect—was intended to throw some doubt about the constitutional legitimacy of the opposition proposed amendments but, were it to be argued successfully, would have the effect of actually undermining the legitimacy of the bill itself, because it would mean that the attack on the whole RFA process would depend not on the form of the law but on whether one or more of the RFAs were materially different and whether the legislative underpinning of materially different RFAs gives discriminatory preference to a state or part of a state.
Even with respect to existing RFAs of which we have knowledge, such claims are regularly, if mistakenly, made and there is no doubt that there are potential litigants—the Greens and many others—who are ready to seize hold of these arguments, which appear to be buttressed by this minister as if he were entering into a debate in a helpful way to support his legislation. But what he is doing is giving credence to a view of the law which the High Court has hitherto not held and which is put forward speculatively by Hanks in his book as saying that the issue may require some reconsideration in the future. There is not one authority that presently exists in relation to this section that would justify it, but he is saying that on that basis the opposition amendments would be constitutionally invalid. The problem for the minister is on that basis.
The whole process of the RFA settlement and establishment which is meant to bring security is open to attack. Each individual RFA could be inspected by a potential litigant. The arguments are mounted on science, of which there are obviously contested views. The shadow minister has raised the point of how in this debate science has been used by many in different and contested ways. The processes could be contrasted, the outcomes with respect to exporters could be contrasted and, as the Office of General Counsel indicated in its Senate advice, those circumstances between individual exporters were that this approach to be adopted could undermine that.
That is not a situation which I would have thought this minister had any interest in pursuing. The opposition has no interest in pursuing it. Our interest is to hold the traditional view of the law which the High Court has expounded in many cases and which has been unchallenged since 1934 and which this government, for spurious and selfish political interests, and on the basis of advice sought and tendered on the same day against its own considered advice, has put into this debate.

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I wish to participate a second time in this debate and follow the spirit of the argument put forward by the member for Braddon, who 
 is my golfing colleague, and talk about investment and, in particular, the disallowance aspect of these amendments. Before I do so, could I comment on a couple of matters that have been raised throughout the debate here today. Firstly, the member for Fremantle in her first contribution was rubbishing the procedures that the department in Western Australia, CALM, ran as part of the regional forest agreement. The same procedures were set up when she was the Premier. They were okay when she was the Premier over there but now, because it does not suit the political argument, she was in here rubbishing them. Perhaps she forgot that she was actually in charge at the time those were put in place.
Also, the member for Reid had a go at me for concentrating on science. I do not apologise at all for concentrating on the science, because that is what it is really all about. My charge of those opposite that none of them understand real science at all, and that they understand only political science, was proven by the member for Paterson when he attacked Minister Tuckey over the record of passing RFA legislation. Clearly, he has no science background, and maths is a science. He attacked the minister for actually signing six RFAs in 3½ years whereas, when he was the member for Paterson prior to being thrown out in 1996, under a Labor government they signed zero RFAs in four years. Maths is my background in science and zero out of four is certainly not as good as six RFAs in 3½ years, I can assure the member for Paterson.
Also, the member for Reid talked passionately about this disallowance only being 15 days. What he did not say is that it is 15 sitting days, and there is a significant difference between 15 days and 15 sitting days. That brings the politics back into it again. Talking of politics, when members opposite say that these things will not be a problem, I remind them of a quote from Senator Bob Brown representing the Greens of Tasmania:
The Senate can now disallow most of the regional forest agreements. The Western Australian RFA in particular is doomed.
That is what they would have to cope with under these sorts of amendments.
That brings me back to where I started in relation to investment and disallowance. I agree with the member for Braddon that we can work through some of this. The real sticking point is in relation to this disallowance. The reason we are absolutely passionate about this is that it is the link to investment. I made the charge before about the members opposite not understanding science, and I am afraid that I have to make the same charge against the members opposite in relation to investment. There are not too many opposite who have been through these sorts of processes. They have to understand how the real world works. When someone goes to their bank manager wanting to expand their business and put on more people, they have to give some security. What sort of security is it to tell the bank manager that they have this fantastic value adding project that they want to implement? Hopefully, it will be in my electorate of Eden-Monaro where we need it or in one of the other regional areas with high unemployment. How can the bank lend them money if the person wanting the loan says, `I might get resourced for a year or a couple of years; the parliament can always look again at those things and throw them out'? That is effectively what will happen under this disallowance.
Unemployment continues to be a problem in regional areas. I notice that member for McMillan did not come into this place for any of this debate. He is often standing up complaining about unemployment problems in his electorate, but he has not been here in two hours of this debate. He should be in here telling his Labor colleagues that the amendments that they want will stop investment. They will not provide the investment, and you will not get the jobs unless you get the investment.

"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,1999-10-13,"—I wish to re-enter this debate to make a few points. It is important that the parliament go back and assess the National Forest Policy Statement that this originates from. The National Forest Policy Statement clearly said that we should have an assessment of our natural forest resource and set aside those areas that need to be set aside—those areas which are 
 genuine wilderness, those areas that would be better reserved in national parks, and also areas that were working forest. That is very important to isolated areas of Australia. Many in my electorate of Page up around Woodenbong, Urbenville and Bonalbo have little else but a forest industry that sustains their local economy.
That is the important part of this. It was said that when a regional forest agreement was assessed, agreed to and signed off then there was long-term security to industry; they could be assured that they would get that resource. As the member for Eden-Monaro rightly says, if you are going to invest millions of dollars in an enterprise which is to give the value adding that everyone wants, you cannot amortise that against five years of resource. You have to have a long-term resource of maybe 20 years if you are going to amortise the investment in that industry.
State governments have to be honest in this as well. I have to say that I do not believe that the New South Wales state government has been honest at all in the assessment of its forest areas. If I remember correctly, the National Forest Policy Statement said that we should look at about six generic areas across Australia and set aside up to 15 per cent of pre-1750 species. Assessing what species were around in 1750 is difficult, so that raises one debate. The second one, of course, is that New South Wales did not look at the generic area particularly on the North Coast of New South Wales and southern Queensland where the species are basically the same. It divided the state up into small areas and said, `Right, we are going to ignore the national parks we have already got. We are going to ignore the crown land that we have already got. We are going to look at these small areas and we are going to lock up 15 per cent of these areas.' Effectively, what it did was to leave only about 30 per cent of the resource available to industry. Many members would realise that I was the minister for forests in New South Wales.
—Tell Souris this.
—The member for Reid remembers that. The foresters tell me that the way this has been manipulated in New South 
 Wales means that the resource in northern New South Wales might last eight years. A statement made by Pam Allen when she was Minister for the Environment rings clearly in my ears. She said, `I intend to phase out the native forest industry in New South Wales within eight years,' and, by golly, that is just what it is trying to do.
The problem with the Labor Party is that they do not understand how a forest can be managed. A forest can be managed in such a way that it can continually be harvested for the resource that we need. The problem with the Labor Party is that they ignore that and want to go long with the popular opinion in the city which is misinformed. The city is never informed by the media of the facts about how these forests can be managed. There is always this emotional debate. The Labor Party are removing the certainty—even Minister Yeadon claims that to be the reason for the RFAs in New South Wales—because they want to bring this back to politics every few years. There is absolutely no certainty in politics, and that is why these amendments are absolutely atrocious.
The Leader of the Opposition is now in the chamber and it is about time he stood up for the working class in Australia and workers in the timber industry. It is about time he represented those particular workers. The Labor Party are listening to the academics from Perth, like the one we heard a while ago, but they are not listening to the working class who are losing their jobs in droves around regional Australia. It is no use getting up in here and wringing your hands about regional Australia. Get out and do something about it; get out and defend and protect the jobs out there. This is a decentralised industry and one that will continue to grow. It is about time the member for Reid learnt something about it and that he listened to the blue-collar workers who are out there trying to earn an honest living.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I move:
That this House censures the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs for attempting to mislead the House and the Australian public by not truthfully explaining the government's plans on higher education reform, their breach with previous government undertakings, and for his deceitful answers in the House which are contradicted by confidential government documents which he has prepared for cabinet.
Let me open the debate today on proceedings that will change Australian education back to where it was before Menzies was in government and before the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme was introduced—but in an era when student fees charged, compared with what is being charged now, in that 25 per cent hitherto devoted to purely privately funded tuition. It seeks to shift our education system back to that point which will give 
 negligible opportunities for middle-income Australians to get themselves to university.
As I speak to this censure motion, I am mindful of the fact that I was a beneficiary, from a middle-income Australian family, of Menzies' Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme, as was the minister. I reflect on the fact that the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Treasurer of this nation and the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation all were beneficiaries of a free higher education system, which they have made thorough use of since they got in this place and, of course, prior to that. Having had that opportunity, they now wish to drag the ladder up behind them so that ordinary middle-income Australian families are not able to get there again.
Let me reflect upon answers we have been given today. Dr Kemp has said various things including:
The suggestion that there are regional university campuses at risk is absolutely absurd, and I completely reject that. The government is not only supporting universities to produce the highest revenues that they have ever had but also strengthening—
Et cetera. Elsewhere in the same answer he says that the government has put the universities in a position where they are now better resourced than they have ever been. He says:
. . . this government is committed to access to quality university education for qualified students in metropolitan and regional Australia.
I will devote most of my remarks to the impact that these propositions will have on Australian families. But let me start with the situation in which we now find ourselves—and that the minister prates about in this House with such evident pride—as a result of three years of starvation of the system. It is as though the minister has tied up a dog for those three years, starved it, then unleashed it and pointed it straight at the students and families of Australia to sate its hunger for the resources that it needs to deliver.
Let us now reflect on what he says in the cabinet submission about how well they are doing in regional Australia. He says that eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit and that some regional campuses are at risk. 
 We quoted some of that submission to him in one of the questions that we asked here today that he walked away from and refused to tell us whether it was his private opinion. It was in fact the opinion that he expressed in his cabinet submission. He says of his high-quality campuses to date—this is his analysis to his colleagues—that there are higher student-staff ratios, less frequent lecture and tutorial contacts, the persistence of outdated technology and gaps in key areas of professional preparation.
That is what happens when you take $800 million worth of public funds out of the education system. That is what happens when you drive the universities of this country into the ground. That is what happens when we confront a situation where the University of Singapore, for example, on public funds, is funded to the tune of twice that of the wealthiest Australian university. That is what happens when you decide you will kill the knowledge nation. That is what happens when you decide to deprive your society of a belief that what we ought to be doing is encouraging excellence in our higher education institutions, knowing that our higher education institutions, more than any other sector of our education system, drive the new ideas, the new technologies and the new opportunities for future industries and future employment in this country.
This minister presides over a unique situation in the industrialised world. He is the only education minister—the only one—who is presiding over a decrease in public funds to higher education. He is the only education minister who is presiding over a decrease in resources going to education, training and research in this country. He is the only one presiding over a falling percentage of GDP. This has been a matter of deliberate strategy. It started of course as a matter of social revenge.
The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business—holding half the portfolio that this minister was stripped of after the last election—drives his industrial policy with his prejudices against workers who decide they will band together to secure a decent wage and a decent life for their 
 families. So does the education minister—in his revolt against the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s when in regional Australia ordinary middle-income families began to find themselves opportunities in higher education—despise the institutions that grew and developed in the Western Suburbs of Sydney, in the working class suburbs of Melbourne, in the bush and in regional Australia. He despises them as not really appropriate to the image that he has of hallowed sandstone halls around which we quietly drink sherry with our professors and enjoy a civilised, philosophical discourse. Just as he despises what has generated education opportunity for the ordinary Australian, so this submission is his final act of social revenge on middle-income people.
I can make a plea in here for poor Australians, and I will. But it would be falsely cast because the people who are really being driven into the ground by this submission are ordinary, aspirational middle-income Australian families. The people who are pilloried by this submission are the households where, say, the principal breadwinner is on $40,000 to $45,000 a year and perhaps the spouse is earning $15,000 to $20,000 a year, thereby basically moving themselves out of most compensatory arrangements associated with the rearing of families. If they have a set of kids now in their mid-teens, watch out, because this bloke has got them. If this cabinet submission comes in, if this proposition is put in place and the start-up date—listen to this—is 1 January after the latest date for the next election—the ultimate act of cynicism—what he does not realise is that people with 15-year-olds can also count. They know exactly what is going to happen to them as a result of this.
This brings me to, for the remainder of my remarks, the actual effect of what he is saying. Contrary to his undertaking, this represents a proposal to deregulate all university fees. That means that, whereas now fully privately funded places in courses are limited to 25 per cent, it will be 100 per cent from this point on. There is no cap. For example, while the calculation of the tuition subsidy is based upon the average cost of a course of $11,000 a year, if the course happens to cost 
 $15,000 or $17,000, as it is with the physiotherapy example that we cited—and Melbourne has a two-year course of law at $72,000—the student bears it through a loan system now calculated on the basis of a real interest rate, according to this particular proposition. It is effectively the introduction of vouchers, despite his undertaking.
The subsidy as it exists now, as the minister boasts proudly, has a lesser and lesser impact in terms of the total percentage of costs on the student or the student's family as opposed to the taxpayer generally. Those students will now find themselves in a situation where they can hawk that particular proposition as a voucher from university to university. What is actually going to happen to the regional universities of this country? What is going to happen to the universities of Western Sydney? What is going to happen to the eight universities—they are not named here but they have an operating deficit, and you can bet your bottom dollar most of those are in regional Australia, and indeed he says some regional Australian campuses are at risk—when they lose any critical mass of students?
I am surprised the Deputy Prime Minister is not in here because, if this happens to go through, the Deputy Prime Minister stands naked in regional Australia. Scattered though regional Queensland in particular but also regional New South Wales, regional Victoria and, to a lesser degree, the other states, is the development opportunity of regional communities based on industry associated with universities. That is there. That is what gives us hope that opportunities will arise in regional Australia for the development of new industries based on new information technologies, new biotechnologies. They are gone if this proposition ever gets put into place and if HECS is abolished and replaced with an unfair loans scheme.
Mr Lee interjecting—
—An afterthought, yes. We referred in question time to the example of what would happen. I know of so many female students—in fact I have produced a few of them myself; at least my wife has, but I have had something to do with it—who anticipate this for their lives. They anticipate 
 completing their courses, they anticipate perhaps a couple of years in the work force. They then anticipate, of course, several years of child rearing in which they will exit either the full-time work force or the work force altogether.
What they will be experiencing as that occurs is compounding interest. So after their children reach school years, or perhaps earlier, and they come back into the full-time work force, triggering the repayment schedules in their income tax associated with this submission, they will then find themselves in a situation where they will carry a debt for 40 years—a 40-year debt burden on the ordinary Australian family.
This is the Americanisation of the Australian system without the American protections. It is all very well to talk about Americanising the system, but the average wage in the United States is darn close to twice ours. Prices for houses and prices for most consumer goods are way below Australian prices, but not in the area of education—until now. In the propositions this government has been operating with regard to HECS increases—and remember it increased HECS by 125 per cent in some areas—we actually have approached now, and in some cases exceeded, the cost of state universities in the United States. What this will do is go three times over the top of them on what were hitherto state universities here in Australia. That will be the impact of this proposition. It will be extraordinarily damaging to the average family.
Remember I stated this is a major attack on middle-income Australians. There is also a proposition here, the minister says—as a sort of afterthought—that there must be some protection for low-income individuals, and he cites reasonably enough our indigenous communities. But the amount he is talking about in here is about $20 million a year, in a system of over $5 billion! There is no prospect in this for Australians to attend a university, except for the very, very bright young working-class Australian—no prospect at all.
This is a product of extreme right-wing conservative ideology imposed on middle 
 Australia in a way, I suppose, that Victorians with Jeff Kennett have become all too familiar with. It is bad enough for the average Australian family confronting this disaster. It is bad enough for the average Australian tax paying family who have seen the older kids down the street go through a system in which they were provided by the taxpayer with real opportunity. It is bad enough for them as they scrimped and scraped while their kids were five and six years old and watched the Costellos and the Wooldridges of life go through fully funded in university; but when their kids now make it themselves, they are going to be hit with bills cumulatively of $100,000 or more.
Any kid who wants to get into the premium priced sandstones—the University of Melbourne, the University of Western Australia, the University of Adelaide or the University of Queensland—and this is all anticipated here, will face the very worst impact of these real interest rates imposed on their so-called student loan. They will face a massive impact. They will give up. There is a massive price sensitivity in higher education, and they will give up.
But the ultimate betrayal in this document is a betrayal of the collective Australian people in the middle of an election campaign. Let me go to our beloved Prime Minister on this particular subject. During the last election campaign in a press conference in Perth, on the matter of vouchers he said:
As far as West—
that is the West report, and this is far worse than anything West suggested—
is concerned David Kemp had something to say about her attitude—
that is a mistake and that should be `our' attitude—
to vouchers and things like that, ruling them out absolutely.
That is the Prime Minister's word. What is that worth?
He will get up, like he did with the cutesy on the GST, and say, `I said I wouldn't introduce it but, because it comes in after the next election, it really isn't a broken promise. Because this will come in the January after 
 the next election, it isn't really a broken promise.' It is with that sort of moral slovenliness that politicians in this country come into gross discredit in the electorate.
But the real penalty is ultimately paid by the Australian people on this one. If we are going to build a knowledge nation, we need all our people with that opportunity to obtain every educational opportunity that their skills will permit them—every opportunity. If they are priced out of it, they will suffer as individuals, but this country will suffer massively.
You are a completely worthless minister. Your Prime Minister worked that out sufficiently in the employment area, and you have demonstrated adequately your worthlessness in the collapse of the universities you attest to in your submission. You should be censured and gone. (Time expired)

"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—We have just heard a typical example of the confected outrage of this empty Leader of the Opposition. The sounding drums strike loudest when they are large and empty, and what we have is large rhetoric and no substance. We are in a position to evaluate the Leader of the Opposition because he has been minister for education. He left no legacy as minister for education. No-one in Australia remembers a single achievement from the time he was—
—I didn't even know that he was the minister for education.
—My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed surprise at the historical information that the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for education, because there was absolutely no achievement.
Honourable members interjecting—
—Order! The minister is entitled to at least as much courtesy as was extended to the Leader of the Opposition.
—The socialists have gone nuts. You hate being called socialists, don't you? You used to argue for it!
—Order! The Minister for Foreign Affairs is being of no assistance to the minister. When the House comes to order, the minister will have the call.
—The Leader of the Opposition has had the chance to demonstrate his commitment to education. When he was minister, we saw nothing. When he was Leader of the Opposition, we saw him preside over a policy process which produced an education policy at the last election that was so flawed that the shadow minister who was asked to be responsible for it resigned and went to the back bench.
The education policy that this empty Leader of the Opposition put forward at the last election was a policy that was actually going to cut funding to university research; that had four lines on the largest social justice issue in education, which is literacy; and that was based on totally mistaken assumptions about the funding of technical and further education in Australia. It was a completely incompetent policy endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition. When the member for Werriwa—one of the few thinkers on the other side of the House—saw this policy, he felt that he could not accept personal responsibility for it and resigned. The Leader of the Opposition was able, however, to find somebody to take responsibility, and that was the member for Dobell.
Since then the member for Dobell has been the perfect spokesman for the policy vacuum, because he has said nothing. He has issued nothing. He has done nothing. He is a shadow minister who has been under tremendous pressure and threat. Michelle Grattan, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 2 October, urged the Leader of the Opposition to reshuffle this shadow minister, the member for Dobell, out of the way and replace him with the member for Fremantle. She said:
This is an area of priority for Mr Beazley, who aspires to be the education Prime Minister. Mr Lee could be better used elsewhere.
I do not think the fact that some mate somewhere may have slipped him a document is 
 going to make him a decent shadow minister for education. Let us look at the substance of what the Leader of the Opposition said. The Leader of the Opposition, rhetorically, with enormous confected emotion, talked about Australia becoming a country based on ideas and knowledge.
Australia must strike out its position in the 21st century based on the quality of its education and the skills of its people. That is where we are going to get our great comparative advantage in the world—because we have a highly skilled, highly knowledgeable population. The Labor Party, however, has never suggested a single policy which will achieve that. Indeed, it would have to be the last major political party in the world which has yet to confront the issue of achieving a focus on outcomes in education. The Labor Party has always taken the attitude that you throw money at something and you solve the problem. Of course, the Australian Education Union requires it to do that.
At the end of Mr Beazley's term as education minister, 30 per cent of young Australians could not read properly. They were young Australians who were struggling. He did nothing about them. When I became education minister, I found that the Labor Party had suppressed—I use that word quite deliberately—20 years of research into education standards amongst young Australians. That research had provided information about the literacy and numeracy skills of young people in year 9, age 14. They were very large surveys, taken throughout the time when you were in government. Those surveys have been deliberately kept secret. The Australian Education Union did not want the results published.
Unless the Labor Party commits itself to achieving better outcomes for young people and starts to support policies which will achieve better outcomes for young people, it has no credibility whatever in its education policy. It is nothing more—has never been anything more—than the mouthpiece for the Australian Education Union and the National Tertiary Education Union. It never says anything original. It never says how the money that is spent is going to produce 
 decent outcomes. It weeps crocodile tears about young people from low-income backgrounds who cannot gain access to education, but when it has a chance to do something about it, it does nothing. It was those students from low-income, blue-collar suburbs, surrounded by a culture of low educational  expectations, whom the Labor Party surrendered and did nothing to help throughout its 13 years in office. So many of those young people are now in their mid-20s and they have never known a year's continuous employment, because of the failure of the Labor Party.
When we look at the state of university education under the Labor Party, we find that there was an enormous unmet demand. At times that unmet demand reached a figure of round about 40,000 qualified students who could not get places. Why was that? Because the Labor Party restricted artificially and ideologically the entry of qualified Australian students to the university system. It failed to fund students that universities admitted over and above the fully funded places. It failed to give young Australians access to universities on the same basis as overseas students. It shut and slammed the doors in the face of qualified young Australians. And those young Australians who were shut out of universities were the most marginal applicants. And we know from all the research that those young Australians were the ones from the most disadvantaged educational backgrounds. So the Labor Party, for all its rhetoric, barred from higher education tens of thousands of qualified young people. It is this government that has opened the doors. We have opened the doors to educational opportunity at all levels of education. We have opened the doors to Australia's most important social justice education policy ever—our National Literacy Plan—
—You are the only minister to reduce funding.
—to tens of thousands of young people who previously had no future whatever.
—Have a look at your backbench. They are not too convinced.
—The member for Port Adelaide!
—We have opened the doors of Australian universities to tens of thousands of students who were previously locked out.
—You can say all you like, but you do not convince them. Look at them.
—I warn the member for Port Adelaide.
—It is the commitment of this government to continue to act to improve access to quality training for young Australians. Under the previous government the apprenticeship system was essential to so many young people from the kinds of families the Labor Party likes to think it appeals to. Yet the Labor Party almost wrecked Australia's apprenticeship system, and it did that by insisting that the trade union movement be one of the overseers of Australian apprenticeships, and many employers would not take on apprentices because it meant inviting the unions into the workplace. We have rebuilt Australia's apprenticeship system. We have opened opportunities for tens of thousands of young Australians to do quality apprenticeship training.
The Labor Party has never committed itself to that. The Labor Party has never committed itself to the National Literacy Plan. The Labor Party has never committed itself to the New Apprenticeships system—a business owned enterprise friendly system—because its union mates will not let it. It has never committed itself to maintaining the funding for universities which has opened the doors that the government has put in place. When it attempted to develop a policy it lost its shadow minister, who was appalled at the quality of that policy. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition coming into this House pretending that he cares for the educational future of this country. He has no record, he has no performance and he has no policy.
The Labor Party are claiming that they have a copy of a cabinet submission that I have prepared. They will not table this cabinet submission. They intend apparently to keep it secret.
—You've got it. You wrote it.
—Well, we do not know what documents you have got. Maybe they are frightened that we might find out where it came from. Maybe they are frightened that there will be many aspects of that policy that will be exceedingly popular, that will be widely welcomed in the community.
—It was boxed an hour ago, you fool.
—The member for Dobell would rather like the call, I would have thought, in a minute or two.
—Any policy that this government puts forward for education will be a policy which will continue our determination to make Australia an educated, knowledge based society with opportunity for all, and that will include opportunity for all qualified students regardless of their financial background. It is those students who are already in universities who were not there when the Labor Party were in office. The Labor Party do not like the fact that we have opened the doors. They do not like the fact that we have rebuilt educational opportunity in Australia. All they have is the empty sound of the big bass drum—sounding empty, saying nothing.
This government is very proud of its educational record. This is a government with policy ideas. This is a great reforming government. This is a government which has rebuilt the economy of this country, which is building the social partnerships and coalitions on which a healthy society will be built. I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House censures the Member for Dobell for his failure to develop any manner of education policy and orders the Member for Dobell to produce forthwith, without any further amendment or debate, the original document purporting to be a Cabinet submission, and any copies thereof made by the Opposition, from which he was quoting during question time today.""",REPS,"<title>MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, TRAINING AND YOUTH AFFAIRS</title>",<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,11,1
"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—This document will see off David Kemp. This document should see off David Kemp because every person who is listening to the radio, every parent who is up in the gallery—
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask the member to table the document 
 he has just made available. He is not claiming that it is confidential, is he?
Opposition members interjecting—
—I will recognise the member for Dobell in just a moment. I thought the obligation to table papers was an obligation that rests with ministers, but I will hear the Leader of the House. It is not my intention to frustrate his request.
—My point of order is quite simple. Under standing order 316 there is a requirement for the tabling of papers. It has been quoted from by a member in the House and not just during question time.
—Which standing order, Pete? Which one are you making up now?
—This point of order relates to standing order 316, on the advice of those experts close to me, who do not need to be brought into the controversy. But it is quite clear: there is a standing order. It is true that it is not often used, as has also been my advice, but there is a requirement. It is obviously on the claim of the shadow minister that it is not a private document or a confidential document. He claims to have been boxing it up in the gallery. My point is that I have seen the document which they are boxing in the gallery and it is not the document which he now has. So he ought to be required to table it.
—On the point of order, Mr Speaker: standing order 316 says:
Papers may be ordered to be laid before the House, and the Clerk shall communicate to the Minister concerned all orders for papers made by the House; and such papers when received shall be laid on the Table by the Clerk.
—I am aware of standing order 316. I would have thought the standing order would be implemented by the order of the House rather than by a request for leave. I would have thought also that the motion moved by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs would effectively make that sort of order of the House.
—Mr Speaker, on the point of order: I only make the point that the Labor Party is claiming one document here but 
 boxing another. That is deceiving people; that is misleading people.
Opposition members interjecting—
—The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Lilley is skating on very thin ice, as I am sure he is aware. He is also now taking up the time of the member for Dobell, whom I now recognise.
—All the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs had to say was, `The cabinet submission does not exist.' The reason he did not say that is that we know this minister has developed a submission to do these very things. The minister had half a dozen occasions in question time today to deny it was the case, and he did not because he knows he has lodged this submission. The reason we have moved this censure in the House today is that this minister has deceived the House. This minister has misled the House. Question after question was put to the minister today, and he deliberately deceived the House. Let me make it clear where he has done that. We asked him whether he stood by his pledge not to bring in vouchers for higher education, and he said, `The government stands by undertakings that it has made in the past.' That is what he says publicly, and privately he produces a cabinet submission to do the exact opposite.
Then we asked him: do you stand by your pledge not to deregulate university fees? And he said, `The government's policies in relation to education are on the public record.' That is what he says publicly; privately, he prepares a cabinet submission that says the exact opposite in relation to the deregulation of fees for universities. Then we asked him: do you take responsibility for the fact that so many universities are now operating at a deficit? We asked him whether he accepted that there were regional campuses at risk, and his answer was, `The suggestion that there are regional university campuses at risk is absolutely absurd, and I completely reject that.' That is what he says in public, but in private he says, `Already, eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit, and some regional campuses are at risk.'
There is no more important responsibility of a member of the Australian House of Representatives than to tell the truth in here. Today that man did not tell the truth in here, and this man should go. This man has misled the House; he has deceived the House; he is not fit to be Australia's minister for education. The point we make is that he understands how much damage his $800 million cuts have done to Australian education. He knows there are more students in the lecture theatres. There are fewer tutorials being held. The quality of education is being undermined by the things he has already done.
We learnt today that this has been part of a four-year strategy. For four years this government, under Prime Minister John Howard and under Education Minister David Kemp, has had a deliberate strategy to chain up the higher education system with $800 million worth of budget cuts, to starve them of funds for another four years and then to say to them, `The only way that you can get money is to fleece the students. The only way that you can solve the crisis in higher education is to attack the students. Take the money from the students and, in the process, make it harder and less affordable for ordinary working-class kids to get to university.' We are going to hold this minister accountable for this submission. We are going to make it clear to the parents and the students in the gallery today. The parents and the students that are out there are going to hear of your plan. We will hold you accountable for this plan.
This plan will mean a number of things. It is going to mean that, first of all, the fees charged will go through the roof. The minister challenged our figure of $100,000 in the debate today. The figures are based on an analysis of what it would cost someone doing physiotherapy. People who are doing physiotherapy who are not getting the HECS funded places are already paying between $16,000 and $18,500 a year at Melbourne University. So it is based on fees already out there in the system. If you look at the impact of charging those fees over the period of time it takes to become qualified in physiotherapy and also the impact of the government's plan to intro 
 duce a loans scheme with a real rate of interest, it can be seen that people will be forced to pay $100,000 to go to university—$40,000 in up-front fees and another $60,000 as they repay that money over 28 years.
It gets worse. Take a female physiotherapist who works for three years and then takes three years off because she wants to raise a family. The impact on her is that she will be up for a total cost of $150,000—a massive burden that ordinary Australians cannot afford to pay. The point we make is that, before the election, those opposite said there would be no vouchers. Before the election the Prime Minister and this minister guaranteed that there would be no vouchers. Before the election they said that there would be no deregulation of fees in higher education. Yet we now understand that that was just to get them through the election.
I say to my colleagues: we will fight every inch of the way to stop this plan. But, even if we succeed with John Howard sacking David Kemp tomorrow and the legislation being defeated in the Senate, let me warn my colleagues: know that under a government led by John Howard this will be the second wave of higher education changes after the next election. We know that this government has a long-term strategy to deregulate fees in higher education, to bring in vouchers, to bring in a loans scheme with high interest rates. We know that, even if we succeed to block the legislation in the Senate at this time, or even if we get the minister's scalp, a government led by John Howard will try and try again to implement these changes.
I say to my colleagues: we have to mount every attack possible to stop these changes. We will do that because this government with this plan is saying to parents, `You're going to have a very ugly choice: if you're battlers, you're going to have to choose between whether to buy your house or buy a decent education for your kids.' How can ordinary families afford an extra burden of $100,000? Ask the people who live in Western Sydney, or the families living in Burnie, in north-west Tasmania or in the Hunter. Ask the parents living in Penrith whether they can afford to pay $100,000. The battlers are the ones who 
 will have to choose between paying for the house or giving the kids a decent education. Those families who are slightly better off and who think, `Well, we'll make that extra effort to pay the extra $100,000,' will be left with the decision, `Do we pay off the mortgage for the house first or do we pay off the mortgage for the higher education debt?'
—What if there are two of them?
—Imagine a young couple that incurs two of these debts. How will that couple ever be able to afford to raise a family when saddled with these sorts of debts?
Those in regional communities in particular will be faced with an invidious choice. Universities in regional Australia are already under threat. If sandstone universities get the right to massively jack up their fees, enormous pressure will be put on regional campuses. Those regional campuses know that they will be forced to drop their fees. They will be forced to have less revenue than that now coming into them. Regional universities will be the ones that are forced to cut back on the number of staff they employ, to cut back on the number of courses they offer, to cut back on the great impact they have in regional communities. Often it is the universities that provide the driving force for development in regional communities. All of this is placed at risk by this government's deliberate attempt to move down the deregulatory path. We will end up with two classes of university: universities for the rich, with very high fees, with students who carry very high debts, and universities for the rest of us. It is the sort of process that will lead Australia towards the American style of university system, with students carrying massive loans for many years to come.
It is quite clear that this is just the beginning. We have Senator Newman with a secret plan to make changes in social security that will cause enormous pain to low income earners right across the community. Today we have exposed a secret plan to deregulate higher education with the introduction of massive fees for students who are studying at university and a loans scheme with a real rate of interest which will force young people to 
 carry a debt for years to come. This is the government's secret plan in higher education. Mr Speaker, can't you just see that twinkle in David Kemp's eye with his plan for TAFE, his plan for schools? You can just imagine that this is only the beginning of the changes that this minister wants to bring in.
But we are going to hold this minister accountable. We are going to hold those opposite accountable for the changes they are trying to make to the Australian education system. We will be doing it for the young people in the gallery today and for the young people who are out there studying hard in secondary education. Their future depends on us stopping this plan. We will be going in to bat for those 15-year-olds who are out there today studying hard in their secondary schools. If this minister has his way, every one of those young people who might be clever enough, smart enough to get into university will be faced with these debts—these massive burdens of up to $100,000.
Those young people deserve more. If they are prepared to make the effort to study hard enough to ensure that their results at the end of their secondary school education are high enough to get into university, they deserve the right to a university education without being saddled with a debt of $100,000. The arguments being put forward by this government place the future of those young people at risk. If those young people in secondary school today want a high value, high wage job in years to come, they know they have to try to get into university. This government is trying to put up additional barriers to those young people being able to afford to go to university.
It is also apparent that this minister has clearly misled the House. For that reason, this minister must go. He has deceived the House. He has breached his own pledge that there would be no vouchers. He has breached his own pledge that there would be no deregulation of university fees. He has breached the Prime Minister's promise that there would be no vouchers in higher education. He has developed a plan whereby young people will be forced to carry debts, which will mean they have to repay amounts of up to 
 $100,000. He has developed a plan for a new loans scheme that will be like a ball and chain shackled to the ankles of young Australians, discouraging them from trying to go to university, denying them the opportunity to get high value, high wage jobs of the future. This minister therefore must be held accountable. John Howard must sack David Kemp today.

"Lawler, Tony, MP",NP,1999-10-13,"—The Leader of the Opposition asked hypocritically, `What about Australia's regional universities?' Australia's regional universities are being delivered to in spades by this government, much to the neglect of the previous government. This is a government that has delivered in my electorate of western New South Wales new universities in Dubbo and Broken Hill.
Mrs Irwin interjecting—
—I warn the member for Fowler.
—The communities in the western region of New South Wales are looking forward to the higher education opportunities that are being delivered by this government, including the related jobs, the related opportunities, the entertainment and the cultural benefits that will be delivered to rural and regional New South Wales by the provision of rural universities and campuses delivered by the Howard government.
It is absolutely hypocritical for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up and cry crocodile tears about what he believes rural universities should have. This is the man who wanted to be the Education Prime Minister of Australia. He also wanted to be the finance minister of Australia—and he left this government with a $25 billion deficit.
—How much?
—Twenty-five billion. Do we accept the staking of his claim as the Australian employment minister when he left us with 11 per cent unemployment? The man has no credibility.
I ask the member for Dobell: where have you been in the education debate in the last six to 12 months? He has been missing in action. Now he is taking an opportunity to try 
 to raise his profile by slandering this government, by raising false accusations about what this government has not done and by ignoring the benefits that this government has delivered to the education sector in Australia. This is a government that keeps its election promises. This is a government that promised to deliver cheaper diesel fuel to the bush, and it has delivered. This is a government that promised to deliver decreases in personal income tax, and it has delivered. This is a government that promised to abolish wholesale sales tax, and it has delivered. Those opposite were in government when they promised to deliver l-a-w tax cuts. Where are the l-a-w tax cuts? Those on the other side of the House were in government when they put up the wholesale sales tax, and they did not say anything about it, let alone make any announcement before the election.
There are three areas of education that we need to look at: schools, universities, and vocational education and training. The `damage' done by the government to higher education has resulted in an extra 26,000 undergraduate places at universities in total. That is an extra seven per cent on what was left behind by the Labor Party. `But that includes fee payers,' they say. In 1999, fully funded actual undergraduate places increased by 12,665 or 3½ per cent more than those available in 1996. Who was in government at the start of 1996? Not this side of the House. In 1999, the estimated total university revenue was $376 million more than it was in 1996. So the money available to universities under the coalition government has increased by $724 million over the last four years.
We talk about equity in education. There are more people in every equity group at university now than there were in 1996. The number of students from rural areas is up by seven per cent. The number of indigenous students is up by 12 per cent. The number of students from low SES backgrounds is up by 9.4 per cent, and the number of students with disabilities is up by a massive 61 per cent. Disadvantaged groups are the major beneficiaries of the increasing undergraduate places under this government. The ALP offer no constructive options for equity. They continue 
 to support schemes that have not been effective in the past.
I must admit that I am particularly concerned about the smaller groups from remote areas that perhaps are lacking an increasing presence in tertiary education due to the difficult situation that many of us find ourselves in with drought and commodity prices. But we can see that universities are increasing investment in education, and university revenues are now at a record level. No matter how the opposition try to twist the figures, universities have never had more money than they do today.
The Labor Party's policy on HECS is to charge people studying a course like medicine, which has a huge income earning potential, the same amount as people studying a course like arts, whose potential for earning has nothing to do with a degree and is more relevant to the skill of the person. In effect, they want the same HECS charge to be applied to someone earning a lower income as someone earning a higher income. Under the coalition government, universities are becoming deregulated. There will be greater pressure on them to maintain and improve teaching standards. In the last year of Labor, $399 million was provided for research funding for higher education. Now up to $460 million is provided by the Howard-Anderson government.
One of the great initiatives instituted by this government is the expansion of the role of universities in regional Australia. Construction of a permanent campus at Charles Sturt University in Dubbo will become a reality in the new year, with the announcement of a $3 million capital development grant from the federal government. This new funding, along with the $1 million that was already allocated by the government for 1998, and a further commitment by the university of $5 million, will provide people in the western area of New South Wales with a new university established for a combined cost of about $9 million.
This campus will be built with state-of-the-art technology. Stage 1 plans to include an interactive learning centre that will feature large student work areas, computers and 
 Internet and interactive video access. A microwave link which already provides a high quality telecommunications link between Charles Sturt University's main campuses in Albury, Bathurst and Wagga will increase the number of courses and the opportunities for people in western New South Wales. This is an example of the Howard government's innovative approach to education. Not only will we have the provision of a university in Dubbo; the construction of a new super-high school on the same site very near the TAFE college will provide enormous new opportunities in education for students in the whole area of western New South Wales.
I believe the communications capabilities of this university will lead to a much wider range of choices of courses for people living in my area, not only around Dubbo, Parkes and Forbes but right out through Cobar and Broken Hill. Opportunities such as these were previously not available. Under the previous government, people had no chance of taking advantage of these opportunities.
The courses that will be offered at the Dubbo campus will be Bachelor of Business Accounting for both full- and part-time students, Bachelor of Nursing, Bachelor of Health Science, Graduate Certificate in Small and Medium Enterprise and Graduate Certificate in Applied Science. One of the important benefits I see of the university being established in Dubbo is that it will offer an innovative management course in applied science. This will link with the Western Plains Zoo and provide even more opportunities not only for regional and Australian students but also for overseas students to come and study at Dubbo with reference to the Western Plains Zoo. The benefit to Australian students of studying alongside international students will be enormous. It will bring more tourism opportunities and put country places like Dubbo on the international education map—again, an achievement of the Howard government.
Also recently constructed in my electorate under the Howard-Fischer government was the Department of Rural Health campus for Sydney University built out at Broken Hill. This has been an enormously successful 
 innovation and is part of an ongoing commitment by this government to provide medical training to people in regional Australia. Not only are we providing the opportunity for people studying medicine to experience life in the bush, which will lead in the long term to a better delivery of medical services, but also the benefits to Aboriginal health out in the far western area of New South Wales have to be seen to be believed. It has long been recognised that the best way to address the shortage of doctors in rural and regional Australia is to train them in the bush or at least provide some significant component of their training in the bush. As well as the places at the Broken Hill campus, the government has provided 60 places at Queensland's James Cook University at a cost of over $28 million—as promised at the last election. We also know that the Wagga campus of Charles Sturt University will be taking medical students from the University of New South Wales under a program to which this government has committed over $13 million. So far we have been able to identify that any damage that has been done to education in country Australia has been done by those on the other side, not by this government.
The area of vocational education and training is a very sore point with members of the opposition. They know that they cut the vocational education and training opportunities of people right across Australia to the bone. They had no interest when they were in government in anyone who was not going to go to university. The chardonnay socialists tried to bring everyone up to university level with no regard for people who did not have the intention, the desire or the ability to complete tertiary education. That government did not recognise the message that it gave to young people—that it was university or nowhere.
The New Apprenticeships scheme which this government has introduced has delivered in spades to people in rural and regional Australia. Apprenticeships are now available in industries that previously had no interaction with the training system. Training is now based on industry determined competency and on ability rather than on time periods alone; 
 an innovation that we were able to put in place because we untied the concept from the union movement. As we know, only 30 per cent of students leave school and go straight to university, and this has posed a challenge for some years to provide a pathway between school and work for the remaining 70 per cent of school leavers. Employers in occupations experiencing skill shortages in non-metropolitan Australia receive an additional $1,000 incentive payment when their apprentices progress from certificate level 2 up to level 3, bringing total employee incentives up to $5,000.
Another successful program in my electorate to improve education is the Jobs Pathway Program. Many students have no idea of the demands of the workplace. They have limited interview techniques or practice and often have no idea how to handle a situation when they are interviewed by people senior to them. In some cases, careers advisers themselves have not had the necessary training to assist, and often both they and their students had little knowledge of apprenticeships. The Jobs Pathway program is yet another promise delivered by the Howard government to improve the education opportunities of and access to further education by young Australians. One of the great things about it is that it will assist these kids who, as I said, have not had good advice at school and perhaps may have gone to a disadvantaged school. They will finish up with the same advice—or often, in fact, better advice—as those who have been lucky enough to go to one of the stronger schools. Private enterprise is better able to provide current information on what employers are seeking in the workplace today.
While we are talking about youth, how about the $60 million that will be provided over the next four years to continue the job placement education and training program that helps young people at risk overcome the barriers they face in maintaining stable accommodation, finding work, accessing training and re-entering the education system? Over 40,000 young people will be assisted in this area.
Mr Speaker, just recently I had the pleasure of announcing large amounts of funds to 
 different schools in my electorate. To quote a few: $1.3 million has been allocated to upgrade facilities at Parkes High School, and $1½ million has been contributed by the federal government for a special education unit that upgrades food and music education at Parkes High. At Dubbo South Public School I had the pleasure of announcing funding of almost $3 million. This money will go towards major construction projects such as a hall, a library and a covered outdoor assembly area. In a place like Dubbo, the covering of an outdoor assembly area is an enormous benefit to the ability of students to concentrate in their classrooms. Dubbo's multi-campus senior school concept—I have already mentioned that it is to be constructed in conjunction with Charles Sturt University—has received $7.6 million in federal government funding. This proposed senior college will cater for years 10 to 12 at a new campus incorporating high-tech learning and links to tertiary institutions. This round of funding will upgrade the buildings at two existing high schools in Dubbo to accommodate the new system and consolidate the Dubbo Public School at one site. One of my favourite announcements—even though, on a monetary scale, it is much smaller than the other ones—was the $12,000 grant allocated to the Paroo Contact Children's Mobile Service out at Wanaaring.
Mr Wilton interjecting—
—The member for Isaacs is warned! He is not even in his own seat.
—The service is invaluable in providing social stimulation and educational experience for young people on remote properties.
Mr Speaker, you can see that it is this government that is delivering in spades to regional and rural Australia. Millions of dollars have been spent in my electorate not only on upgrading universities, building new universities, upgrading schools and providing new education opportunities for the youth of Australia but also on reimplementing and reinvigorating the vocational education and training which was so sadly neglected by the opposition when they were in government prior to the election of this government.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have a question for you. Part of the amendment before the House in relation to the member for Dobell says:
. . . and orders the Member for Dobell to produce forthwith, without any further amendment or debate, the original document purporting to be a Cabinet submission . . .
My concern is that page 682 of House of Representatives Practice , third edition, talks about enumeration of privileges, and it says:
The following were listed by Quick and Garran  as among the original principal powers, privileges and immunities of each House, and of the Members of each House . . . as at 1901.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. At this stage you have nothing before you on which to answer the member for Banks' question. The matter has not yet been put to the House. It would be after the matter had been put to the House that the question from the member for Banks would then have some appropriateness, if at all. It certainly does not at this stage of the debate.
—I am questioning the power of the question to be put before it is put, Mr Speaker, and I think you are entitled to rule if the House or the government does not have the power to move that amendment in that form. I am questioning where the government derives its power to order a member of parliament to produce a document forthwith. This is a serious question. Up until now—and, indeed, in the Senate at the moment—the Senate has required a minister to produce—
—Mr Speaker, on the point of order, in response to what the member for Banks is saying, the list he is reading from is listed by Quick and Garran  as:
. . . among the original principal powers . . . of each House . . . as at 1901.
Specifically, if you look at standing order 316 it does imply that the House does have the power to order that papers be laid before the House.
—I thank the member for Boothby for his contribution to the point of order. The Chief Government Whip is seeking my call. I am happy to accommodate him if he wishes.
—I was just waiting for my point of order to be ruled on.
—Mr Speaker, just on the point of order by the whip, before mine is ruled on, I would argue that this is the appropriate time to rule—before the question is put before the House—because, if you rule that the government does not have the power to move this amendment, then the amendment should not be put. We would only be debating the original motion before the House. I am happy to defer my point of order until you rule on whether it should be taken now or after the question is put.
—I was happy to hear the member for Banks.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. Page 682 lays down the original principal powers, privileges and immunities. The House does have the power to then enumerate those things. I say that nowhere in the standing orders does the House enumerate the power to do what the government is seeking to do in their amendment. Indeed, standing order 316 specifically refers to papers. It says:
316	 Papers may be ordered to be laid before the House—
this is not a paper—
and the Clerk shall communicate to the Minister concerned all orders for papers made by the House . . . 
The inference there is that this is in relation to government papers; the communication is to the minister. That is consistent with the practice. Indeed, it is consistent with the motion of the Senate that has been carried already ordering the minister to produce particular papers, and the minister has defied that. There is nothing that I can see in terms of precedent or practice in the past that has required members of parliament to produce papers. So I say to you, Mr Speaker, `Nice try, but they do not have the power to move their amendment,' and I would ask you to rule accordingly.
—Mr Speaker, on the point of order as to the validity of the motion—
—The amendment.
—The amendment, which will become the motion. I put it to you, Mr Speak 
 er, that the proposed amendment is entirely valid. It is within the powers of this House to pass such a motion, and it then places an onus on the subjects of that amendment to comply with an order of the House.
—You know all about complying.
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition takes far more liberties than he should.
—I refer you in particular to House of Representatives Practice , third edition, Chapter 17, `Papers and documents', page 555, which says:
The House itself has a right, expressed in the standing orders, to seek information in documentary form.
—`Seek'—does that mean `order'?
—How else would you seek them but by requiring them to be laid before the House?
—I require the member for Melbourne, after a great deal of patience has been exercised, to excuse himself from the House under standing order 304A.
The honourable member for Melbourne thereupon withdrew from the chamber.
—In respect of the standing order, the fact of the matter is that this motion stands in its own right. In a sense it stands above the standing order. The standing order does not in any way constrain the capacity of the House to require that this document be so tabled. Mr Speaker, just to put the matter in a more complete context, what is happening here is the document—which I can see—is being said by the opposition to have been boxed in the parliamentary press gallery. But I have seen the document that they have boxed in the parliamentary press gallery and—tantalisingly close as it is—they refuse to box that document. They are deceiving people. What they have done is taken a document and doctored it.
Miss Jackie Kelly interjecting—
—I warn the Minister for Sport and Tourism! The Leader of the House must come to the point of order.
—On the point of order, I rely upon the House of Representatives Practice , which makes it crystal clear that this is a valid amendment to a motion before the House and it can therefore be put and voted upon and, when it is voted upon, it will be the obligation that that particular document—that one which I can but very closely touch—be actually tabled.
—On the point of order, Mr Speaker, I too go to page 555 of House of Representatives Practice .
Mr Reith interjecting—
—No. You are far too smart by half.
—In making your deliberation on the question that has been raised—
—The member for Cunningham will resume his seat. There would be a good deal of precedent created if simultaneously both the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of Government Business were required to leave the House. I am not in the mood for creating precedent, but neither am I in the mood for having the debate interrupted.
—Mr Speaker, again I go to page 555, which the honourable Leader of the House referred to in his point of order. I would put to you, in making your deliberation on the point raised by my colleague the member for Banks, that quite clearly this particular area goes to responsibility of government. It talks about the fact that, in order to exercise effectively its responsibility to oversight the activities of the executive government, the parliament needs to be kept informed of the government's activities; and it goes on in two paragraphs to talk about the fact that this particular issue goes to the tabling of documents by ministers, by the executive government, so that that particular area of responsibility and accountability can be open and certainly under scrutiny by the parliament.
I would put to you, in making your ruling on the point of order raised by the member for Banks, that the particular document that has been referred to in the amendment to the motion before the House this afternoon does 
 not fit the criterion of being part of the government's administrative responsibility. If they in fact do want to see that particular document tabled, then they should get the original tabled by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs.
—Mr Speaker, on page 555 it quite clearly says that papers and documents are presented to the House in a number of ways, including by order of the House. On page 550 it is quite clear that there is a provision under House of Representatives practice for it to be delivered by order of the House.
—On the same point of order, Mr Speaker, I wonder whether, in view of the intervention by the Chief Government Whip, you might be able to indicate the precedent for where this particular issue is represented in House of Representatives Practice  and how in fact, in those paragraphs that I referred to on page 555, it was supposed to refer to anything other than the government tabling information.
—On the same point of order, Mr Speaker, it is very plain that the power of this House to seek and to require the production of documents does go, as the member for Cunningham indicated, to the responsibility of this parliament to ensure the oversight of the executive. That is the framework on which the standing orders are set. It also illuminates conventions that have applied since this parliament was established in 1901. For example, irrespective of the power of this House notionally under standing orders to seek production of a document from a Senate minister, no Senate minister is compellable. Indeed, this issue has been considered and commented on by the High Court to the effect that it may be in fact a matter of substantive law.
Further, it is plain that in this instance the purported exercise that is being carried through by this proposed and purported amendment is not designed in any way to illuminate the capacity of this House to require the accountability of the executive. It is in fact the executive seeking to abrogate its responsibility to this parliament. It is precisely a circumstance where both the law and con 
 vention would indicate that this parliament should not entertain this amendment. You, Mr Speaker, charged with the responsibility of determining whether a matter of this nature is cognisable by this parliament, have to determine this in the same way as you would if a motion were put forward by this House requiring the attendance in this House of a Senate minister or the production of a paper by a Senate minister—or, indeed, were the Senate to require the attendance of a minister from this House to produce a document. The Senate can control the production of those documents and by convention, although the act is silent, as a matter of law the court has said that that is to be inferred.
Similarly, if you look at the context and purpose of the standing orders, it is plain that they are designed to allow this parliament to have an independent role in the scrutiny of the executive—albeit that now we are in a party system when the executive occupies a majority of seats in this place, and so it is a power which is not used in this House by practice but is used in the other place from time to time and is resented and ignored in practice from time to time by this government. As a matter of law it was never intended or put forward as a basis whereby that component of the House which has a temporary majority could, by a measure of this kind, require a member of the opposition or a backbench member or an Independent to produce a document in these circumstances. It is a misuse and it is traducing the whole tradition of this parliament, and it does not stand in accordance with the intent and indeed with the question of how the standing orders are properly to be operated.
Mr Speaker, you do have a point of order in front of you as to whether this is a lawful implementation of the standing orders in parliamentary usage. I say there has been no precedent for it whatsoever since this parliament was established. If you can point to any precedent in any Westminster parliament, or if you can point to its having occurred in the parliament of the United Kingdom, I cannot recall it. I know of none. I have recently been working on an article which will be published in the November edition of the Australian Bar 
 Review and which goes precisely to the power of the Senate to require the production of executive documents, and I know of no such precedent. You should rule this out as being outside the parliamentary reach of this House either by convention or by the proper interpretation of the standing orders by parliamentary convention and practice.
—Mr Speaker, my further point of order is that that is a frivolous point of order. Furthermore, whilst a point was being made in that point of order, the Leader of the Opposition took the document, gave it to a member of the deputy opposition leader's staff so as to remove the document from the House, which demonstrates that these points are frivolous and contemptuous of the House.
Miss Jackie Kelly interjecting—
—Toss her out. She's at it the whole time. Yap, yap, yap.
—She's been warned.
—The member for Isaacs will excuse himself from the House under the provisions of standing order 304A.
The honourable member for Isaacs thereupon withdrew from the chamber.
—What about the minister?
—I warn the member for Braddon.
—On a further point of order, Mr Speaker, there is no precedent anywhere in the standing orders or the explanatory document for standing orders for ordering a member to do this, as this motion seeks to do. You would be making a ruling that allows this to stand which removes essential protections from private members based solely on argument around standing orders which are clearly intended for questions of the provision of documents from the executive. It would be a precedent in this almost century-old parliament which would have no equivalent in the Westminster system nor any background from any state parliament here. The questions of return to orders have always been—as our standing orders indicate—questions related to requiring documents of ministers.
In the House of Representatives Practice section on papers and documents by private members, it states:
Other than providing for the tabling of committee and delegation reports, the standing orders make no provision for private Members to table papers and documents.
The honourable member, although he is a member of the frontbench, is a private member of this place. Governments do have power and authority in this chamber—that is how they are formed. But Speakers also protect the situation of private members because, unless the situation of private members is protected, that essential element of parliamentary accountability simply cannot be pursued. So use of force majeure or raw numbers will not do in this case. When you search diligently through it, the only reference you can find that in any way relates to a private member is to indicate that the private member does not have standing, as far as that is concerned. This is a motion which is completely out of order and completely without precedent. In making a precedent like this, I submit to you with the greatest respect, you would do serious damage to the rights of individual members of this chamber.
—Do the decent thing and withdraw it.
Mr Reith interjecting—
—The Leader of the House and the member for Batman!
Mr Ronaldson interjecting—
—I warn the Chief Government Whip! I have had quite enough of the chair being ignored.
—Mr Speaker, on the argument before you, if you were to accept the arguments put forward by the Leader of the Opposition and his supporting speakers on this point, you would in fact be enshrining an absurdity in the practice of the parliament. It would be an absurdity if a private member—or, in this case, a member of the opposition—could get up and use the form and privileges of the House to quote from a document, make serious assertions about a document, as they did in this case, deny completely the opportunity for natural justice and defy and neuter 
 the parliament by saying, `Notwithstanding the private member being able to identify a document, authenticate it and do all those sorts of things, nobody can look at the document if ordered by the House to do so, because the House does not have jurisdiction to require the document to be tabled.' That is an absurdity. If one were to allow that to be a precedent of the House, then you would have a situation where any member of the House other than a minister—who is covered by special rules—would be able to get up and allege that certain matters are contained in a document and then not be able to verify the document.
The other point to consider is that at no time did the member referring to the document say that he was doing so and claim some confidentiality, which is a special rule allowed  for ministers—even in that case he did not do it. So you have a situation where this House should not allow a member to go away and make assertions from a document which he said was authenticated and then say, `However, I am not going to show it to you, if the House asks to be shown the document.' So it is fundamental and important for this House that it does have access to that document.
—Mr Speaker, I wonder if you could listen to something from Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice .
—Is this a matter of choice?
—On this point of order—
—I am being frivolous. I recognise the Leader of the Opposition.
—At page 388 it states:
There is no rule to prevent members not connected with the government from citing documents in their possession, both public and private, which are not before the House, even though the House will not be able to form a correct judgment from partial extracts.
—What is that all about?
—What that means, my friend, is that irrespective—
—The Leader of the Opposition will address his remarks through the chair.  
—What that means is that the content of a document or whether or not people found it satisfactory is irrelevant to the case. On the same page there is a footnote from an 1855 House of Commons debate in which a private member's action in handing a document to a minister—that is, actually handing it across on a voluntary basis—in support of arguments was ruled to be very irregular.
That is the nearest precedent that you have to these circumstances: an individual member was citing a document, it was voluntarily put across to a minister and that was found to be an irregularity. That is it. That is the House of Commons' bible, in so far as parliamentary practice is concerned. There is nothing in our bible that deals with this at all, because it is clearly something not anticipated in that the return to orders in our standing orders apply exclusively to the executive. In the House of Commons, there is a specific protection of the right of an individual member of parliament to do this, to do it without duress, and to do it without a requirement upon them. Even though it may be required of them to substantiate the totality of an argument, it is regarded as irregular that they should be obliged to do that, according to Erskine May. This motion has nothing to support it, nothing to substantiate it within the framework of our standing orders and our parliamentary practice; in fact, it does just the opposite, it opposes it according to the tradition of the mother of parliaments.
—Mr Speaker, given the seriousness of the debate on this point of order, would it not be appropriate if the original document was handed to you for safekeeping while you deliberate on this very important issue?
—Mr Speaker, it was my sincere belief that in this place we could move a motion or amend a motion as we saw fit. There is a section in the standing orders on amendments—it goes from standing order No. 171 through to No. 187—that speaks about the adding or removing of words when someone is making an amendment. It does not specify the words or what they should order. This House can order any way 
 it feels fit. I find the efforts of the opposition in drawing red herrings and various other parts of standing orders into this debate quite irrelevant. We are making an amendment to a motion, and we can amend it in any way that we see fit and, if the House so votes, that is it.
—Mr Speaker, in relation to the power which you inherently have in the management of this process, I mention to you one matter which I believe is material—that is, that the boundaries and extent of this parliament's powers with respect to its privileges are not simply matters which are unilaterally to be determined by a resolution of the House. It is plain that the questions about the existence of or boundaries to the powers and privileges of legislative chamber in Australia are justiciable—that is, they are capable of being determined by the court.
That principle is established in the case of Egan and Willis at pages 530 and 572, paragraphs 133 and 135. The High Court maintains a general supervisory jurisdiction as guardian of the Constitution and in extreme cases where the parliament has demonstrably acted beyond its lawful remit the court may intervene. Chief Justice Barwick, in Cormack and Cope, stated: . . . it is not the case in Australia, as it is in United Kingdom, that the judiciary will restrain itself from interference in any part of the law-making process of Parliament. Whilst the Court will not interfere with what I have called intra-mural deliberative activities of the House . . . there is no parliamentary privilege that can stand in the way of the Court's right and duty to ensure that the constitutionally provided methods of law-making are observed.
Importantly, in this area, the court has established the constitutional privilege that goes to the right to conduct freedom of political debate. It is a constitutionally provided right which the High Court of Australia has said is inherent. Nothing could be so destructive of that constitutional right than the executive seeking, in the pursuit of its objectives, to require an individual member of this House to produce a document in a circumstance that is unprecedented since 1901, is unprecedented in any Westminster parliament and is plainly not a response to the reason why these standing orders are included or the powers that are granted either by constitutional implication, as they flowed when the Constitution was first 
 granted, or in the statutory redrafting of that when those powers were codified to some degree by this parliament.
Mr Justice Kirby in Egan and Willis said that courts in this country, at least in the scrutiny of requirements to the Australian Constitution, have generally rejected the notion that they are forbidden by constitutions of parliamentary privilege, or of the ancient common-law of parliament, from adjudging the validity of parliamentary conduct when this must be measured against the requirements of the Constitution.
Not only would a resolution of this kind not be justifiable on the basis of proper interpretation of standing orders; it would not be referable to any action taken in this parliament since the formation of the democratic system of national government. It does not have a precedent that can be established in any state parliament. To the best of the research that has been capable of being undertaken to date, and I believe it has been extensive—at least, on my part—there is no precedent whatsoever for this having occurred in the Westminster parliament itself nor indeed in the parliaments of Canada or the United States.
Mr Speaker, you are being asked to assent, within the standing orders of this parliament, to a motion which would turn on its head the very reason for this standing order to be there, which is to enable the parliament to examine the lawful reach of executive conduct, a reach which has always been within the power of this parliament—in both its chambers; the House of Representatives and the Senate—to inquire into and to hold ministers to account. It would be to turn that entirely on its head, most improperly, to then apply that to the conduct of an individual member who is not a member of the executive.
Most importantly, adding to that point which is internal to this parliament, it would also mean that, were the parliament to take any further step in purported observance of that, it opens up the whole question of whether or not those issues may be the subject of further proceedings outside this parliament which relate to that constitutional power—that is, the right of every member of parliament 
 and, more than every member of this parliament, every member of this community, to exercise lawful, free speech. The reason there is absolute privilege with respect to all that is said and done in this parliament is so that those rights can be observed. It would cut right across that fundamental principle, which is part of our traditions—and which you, Mr Speaker, were sworn to uphold—were you to allow this monstrous motion to go through.
—I feel duty-bound to respond to the references to Erskine May and to put something on the record. I have now looked at the reference made by the member for Banks or the Leader of the Opposition.
—It was the Leader of the Opposition.
—He read it only because somebody handed it to him. He just read it out.
—The Leader of the House will come to his point of order.
—I only make the point that you should read it, understand it and then present it to the House. The particular section is on citing documents not before the House and relates to different circumstances. If you go to the papers index and look at the principal issue, you will find that it relates to the powers of the House, particularly in respect of committees.
Opposition member interjecting—
—Yes, it does. This is the 21st edition, which only confuses the matter because you have a different edition. The more general point that Erskine May makes is:
There is no restriction on the power of committees to require the production of papers by private bodies or individuals and the like.
That is a power exercised by the committees. It cannot possibly be that the House has lesser powers than the powers which it has preferred to its committees for the conduct of its work. Clearly, the House has these powers, and therefore the motion is a valid one. Ultimately, this is a matter for the House to decide as commonsense would dictate. In the end, it is for the House to decide the manner in which it will exercise its powers. It clearly has the powers and they ought to be exercised, 
 particularly in this case, where we have what appears to be a stolen document.
Opposition members interjecting—
—The Leader of the Opposition made the claim during question time that, by his word, the document was authenticated. He is saying that it is definitely a cabinet document. It clearly has not come to them by any form of authorisation. We can only therefore fairly assume that it is a document which has come into their hands by illegal means. We now know that a different document is being circulated in the press gallery. I know it is a different document because I saw it before it was whisked away from the table out of the chamber, out of our vision and out of the jurisdiction of the chamber so that the opposition could try to deny the fact that we have two different documents. That is outrageous. It is therefore in the public interest, and certainly within the powers of this chamber, to require the production of that document. On that basis, we stick to our position. We think that the matter ought to be soon brought to a head, and there should be a vote.
—The chair has heard a great deal of advice from sundry and assorted legal sources and is inclined to think that injecting a little commonsense into the debate may be somewhat advantageous as well. I will hear the Leader of the Opposition, I will hear one other member from the government and I then intend to rule.
—I am very glad that you sought the application because I wish to assist you in that regard. The section of Erskine May from which the Leader of the House was quoting is in fact not exclusively related to committees at all. It is a section headed `Citing documents not before the House'. It starts with the documents not before the House most likely to be cited—that is, documents utilised by ministers. It starts with a discussion of ministers and documents before the House. It says:
A minister of the Crown may not read or quote from a dispatch or other state paper not before the House unless he is prepared to lay it upon the table. Similarly, it has been accepted that a document which has been cited by a minister ought to be laid upon the table of the House if it can be done without injury to the public interests. A 
 minister who summarises a correspondence and does not actually quote from it is not bound to lay it upon the table. The rule for the laying of cited documents does not apply to private letters or memoranda.
It goes on to detail that. It goes through documents of the clerks and documents from committees. Then it comes to its one discussion in relation to members of parliament. As I cited before, it states:
There is no rule to prevent members not connected with the government from citing documents in their possession both public and private—
And this is a public document—
which are not before the House, even though the House will not be able to form a correct judgment from partial extracts.
I reiterate the point I made earlier. It is for the protection of individual members. Members will frequently partially quote documents in this place for a variety of purposes. Sometimes the documents may become public documents. Sometimes they are government documents. More often than not they are documents of a confidential nature handed to members by individual constituents.
If this proposition is allowed to carry, it means that the majority of the House of Representatives for the first time in any parliament in the Westminster system will be able to utilise its majority to override the position of private members and their absolute protection to be able to cite documents, as indicated in Erskine May. I would say that it is quite clear by implication. Otherwise, why would you bother to represent the question of not being able to form a correct judgment from partial extracts other than that the member of parliament is entitled to do so partially? This obviously protects an individual member of parliament from somebody standing up and demanding that they produce the entirety of a document in order that we can understand whether or not the partial extract actually represents it. They are protected. They can choose not to do that. Parliamentary practice protects their right not to do that.
Obviously, a private member at some point of time gave into the blandishments of a minister like this back in the House of Commons in 1855 and handed a document to the 
 minister in support of statements he was making. The Speaker ruled on that occasion that what that member had done then was `very irregular'. In 19th century terms, that is about as harsh as you can get in telling a person he has done the wrong thing. In terms of parliamentary practice, to support this motion would be to do the wrong thing; for this particular motion to be carried and to have affect would be the wrong thing and also it would be the wrong thing for it to be put.
—Mr Speaker—
Opposition members interjecting—
—I remind members opposite that some of them have very little leash left.
—The member for Eden-Monaro recently put a proposal to you, which I presume you are considering, regarding the retention within this chamber of that particular document. I want to put to you that there is a very substantial reason for that because it is evidence. We have seen some interesting events today. Quite frequently, when members of parliament choose to refer to a document and they are asked about its source, they say, `It fell off the back of a truck.' I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that when the Leader of the Opposition had that opportunity he did not use it. He stood up instead and said to you that he could—
—What is your point?
—The point is that there has either been a misleading of this House or the Leader of the Opposition has admitted to theft. They are the two options.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Mr Speaker, I am speaking to this point. The point I am making to you is that at your special request the Leader of the Opposition guaranteed that the document he was holding was authentic. If it is authentic, Mr Speaker, it has been stolen, and it was stolen with the knowledge of the Leader of the Opposition because he has told you it is authentic. The only alternative is that it came to him without his knowledge and, therefore, he misled the House by claiming to you, sir, that the document was authentic. That is, of course, a breach of the fundamentals of the 
 responsibilities of members of parliament to uphold the law such as thou shalt not steal.
It is up to you, sir, to consider this in terms of any reference you might make to the police authorities, because we are now dealing with a Leader of the Opposition who has said to you that a document, which could never come to his hands by proper means, is authentic. That is something I have not heard in this place before. I have never heard anybody produce a cabinet document in opposition and tell a Speaker it is authentic because it is an absolute admission that he or she knows the source and that it has come to that person illegally. Therefore, sir, I think it is appropriate that the document should remain in this place and I suggest that it may have to be your responsibility to draw this matter to the attention of the Federal Police.
—The chair has a fundamental responsibility to protect the rights of all individual members and to so conduct the House that whatever is the will of the majority becomes in fact what the House does. What the member for Dobell has done today in bringing in a document and—to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition—`citing' it in question time, quoting from it and using it as a substance for questions that were asked, and even then in fundamentally making sure that it was no longer in the House, is the entirely proper conduct of an individual member.
The question before the chair is not the question of whether the member for Dobell ought to have brought the document in or used it. The only requirement I felt I had was to ascertain whether it was an authentic document, as I asked and was reassured. The question before the chair right now is whether the House has the power to require the production of that document. It seems that, if we look to the matter of precedent, in fact it has. In 1905, a Mr Wilkes moved that there be prepared and laid on the table certain documents from a royal commission. The High Court has determined in both Egan v. Willis and Egan v. Chadwick that the House has a constitutional right to require the production of documents.
The dilemma that the chair faces is much more substantial than any of those that have been addressed, if I might say with great respect, in the point of order. The dilemma the chair faces is that if the chair regards this motion currently before the chair as out of order then the chair is limiting the power of the House in relation to the production of papers, not limiting the power or the right of members to bring in and cite certain documents as indicated by the Leader of the Opposition. It is not my intention, as holder of this chair, to limit the power of this House to determine what can or cannot be produced. I have always occupied this chair on the understanding that the House was master of its own destiny, and I rule that the motion may be put.

Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1999-10-13,"—It would seem to me in circumstances such as these that it would be quite unparalleled for me to have to in fact name someone. The member for Dobell must be aware that the latter remarks he made may be deemed to be in contempt of the House, which I do not think would have been his intent. If he wishes not in any way to revise the statement he has made, then I will invite him to reconsider his position. If he chooses not to reconsider his position, then it is a matter that I will refer—properly, I think—to the Privileges Committee. I invite him simply to indicate whether he wants to reconsider his position.

—This is not an argument, Mr Speaker. This is an important issue.
—Of course. That is precisely why I am dealing with it as I am.
—You have asked me for my position and, because of that, Mr Speaker, I am not in a position to withdraw the second part of my statement.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the 10th report of the committee for 1999 relating to CSIRO Clayton (Eastern Precinct) Development Works, Victoria.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The report which I have just tabled concerns the proposed construction of facilities at the CSIRO's Clayton site in Melbourne. Research complexes at the Clayton site now house the largest concentration of CSIRO scientific expertise in Victoria. The site is the centre of CSIRO research into minerals, forest products, molecular and polymer science, manufacturing science and technology and mathematical and information science.
The proposal examined by the committee will enable the consolidation of CSIRO's divisions of Manufacturing Science and Technology, Mathematics, Information Science, Information Technology Services and Petroleum Resources at Clayton. This consolidation will enable CSIRO to vacate sites at Preston and Syndal, freeing up these sites for 
 sale. It will also relocate staff and resources from leased premises.
The extent of the proposal will provide nearly 7,000 square metres gross floor area of new building accommodation, together with another 7,000 square metres of refurbishment in an existing laboratory complex. The scope of the proposed works will provide laboratories, offices, process and technical bays, research support facilities and staff amenities. It will provide modern scientific research facilities for over 370 staff.
When referred to the committee, the estimated cost of the project was $28 million. The committee has recommended that the project should proceed. In arriving at this recommendation, the committee has concluded that, since 1961, substantial investments have been made by the Commonwealth in the construction of major CSIRO research laboratory complexes at Clayton.
A number of elements of research divisions—in particular, Manufacturing Science and Technology and Petroleum Resources—remain at other centres within the Melbourne metropolitan area in properties owned or leased by CSIRO. Capacity remains at the Clayton site for further co-location and rationalisation of research activities. This rationalisation would result in reduced overheads and realise proceeds from property sales for investment in new and upgraded research facilities at Clayton. It would also facilitate interaction between research groups and between divisions, cooperative research centres and staff and postgraduate students from Monash University, which is located adjacent to the Clayton site.
In property terms, sites at Preston and Syndal and leased premises at Carlton and Clayton could be vacated and staff relocated to Clayton. On this basis, the committee concluded that a need therefore exists to provide additional research facilities at the Clayton site for more than 370 CSIRO staff. The committee has also concluded that the scope of the proposed development includes refurbished and new accommodation at a standard commensurate with modern research requirements and on a scale consistent with the number of staff to be employed. The 
 scope of the project can also be justified as making innovative reuse of refurbished buildings with new construction reflecting contemporary generic research facilities already provided at other sites. There is also capacity for expansion.
Two matters need to be addressed by the CSIRO. Firstly, the committee has recommended that the need for stainless steel downpipes proposed for the refurbished David Rivett Building should be reviewed. Secondly, the committee has recommended that the CSIRO should develop a master plan for the further development of the site which will avoid costly removal of existing facilities and infrastructure. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,17,1

"Lieberman, Lou, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—As a member for north-east Victoria, I would like to mention very briefly how important it is that the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 , put forward by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, be no longer delayed and frustrated, as has happened, sadly, since it was first debated quite some time ago—in fact, I spoke on this bill at the time. May I just record the appreciation of the community I represent for the work of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, who is at the table, and his advisers, staff and department in dealing with the regional forest agreement proposals for north-east Victoria.
There is a mill called Mount Beauty Timbers in Mount Beauty. Mount Beauty is a beautiful town which has gone through some tremendously difficult times and social and 
 economic change. It originally was a town used to house the construction workers for the hydro-electric scheme in the Kiewa Valley. After that, it was a town to house the staff of the State Electricity Commission, for which I was the minister in Victoria for a time. There were many hundreds of employees there, but with the passage of time the employment in SEC has been reduced to virtually a handful.
There has been massive change, great difficulties and a lot of unemployment in that town. The Mount Beauty mill, which has been assisted substantially by the government, is an employer of 60 to 70 people. If that mill is lost, those people will lose their work, their jobs and their livelihood and their families will suffer substantially, and that community will be brought to its knees. On the other hand, because of the leadership and assistance of the minister, with the support of the Prime Minister, a proposal has been put forward to provide industry assistance to the industry to enable it to make changes to use the logs that will become available as a result of the regional forest agreement, logs that are not as large as the mill can accommodate at the moment. It is a very critical issue, and I would urge my friend at the table, the shadow minister, and the opposition to heed the words implied by the member for Denison and the member for Lyons to get this legislation through so that the help for communities and workers can be delivered without further delay or confusion.
Sadly, there have been two youth suicides in Mount Beauty in the last couple of years or so which I think are indirectly associated with the problems of social change and upheaval. I want that community to have hope and to have a future, and under the management proposals of the minister at the table, supported by the Prime Minister, it has. But this legislation is needed in order that the whole process can be completed efficiently. So I make this personal plea to members on the other side: support the minister in the work he is doing and enable this legislation to go through. It has been delayed far too long, and it should not be delayed any further.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,20,1
"St Clair, Stuart, MP",NP,1999-10-13,"—I too would like to support the minister. I have been involved in the timber industry for 33 years. I am a sawmiller and was a sawmiller for 16 years immediately prior to coming into this place—a practical sawmiller with the practical experience of actually being there with my men.	 I have seen a great deal of change come over the industry, as we all do in various practices, but it has been particularly so in the timber industry. The mill I happen to own, which is a very small mill, never employed probably more than five or six people in the small town we are in of 88 people, but it has been there since 1887. For the 10 or 12 years prior to 1887, it was further out of town. During the last 15 or 16 years, I have seen a concerted effort that I believe started probably in the mid-seventies. I remember that a minister in the state as she became, Pam Allan, set about destroying small native hardwood sawmillers in New South Wales in the middle of the seventies.
Back in those days, I remember a front page photo on I think the Sydney Morning Herald of a kangaroo standing in the middle of a felled paddock and all you could see was the felled area. It basically was appealing to the preservation people who lived in the cities that this was the type of rape and pillage of the forest that was going on. What the article failed to show and describe was the regenerated regrowth timber in the rest of those areas that had been logged before.
The member for Lyons spoke earlier, and I know he understands regrowth in native hardwood forests because in Tasmania it has been something that has been done on a sustainable basis and run by professional foresters, workers and people for many, many years. In fact, the member for Indi mentioned Mount Beauty Timbers. I also remember doing business in the Gippsland, Nowa Nowa, Waygara, Orbost, Omeo and all sorts of different places where the sawmilling industry built this nation. Then I watched over the period when the corruption, in my belief, started to enter the game, where big companies started to form a pact, particularly in New South Wales, with the big unions. With 
 some of the forest products associations under the control of Col Dorber, they also set about the destruction of us little fellows. There were a lot of us through this nation, as you can imagine.
In the New England today, there are more trees than there ever has been in the history of this nation. My sawmill was the last little one to close on the whole of the New England tableland area of New South Wales. There is one left at Walcha. Under these RFAs and from the information that has been given over the years, I believe they will strip the areas they have within the next 10 years and leave it as bare of trees as the floor of this House.
I also implore the opposition to pass the RFAs, particularly in Queensland where I have colleagues and friends in the central tablelands area who have no security. They understand that change has to take place. They understand that native hardwood sawmilling under the preservationists, and particularly with the governments of both Queensland and New South Wales, is going to destroy the little fellows unless something gives. To bring an RFA back to the parliament every time you have an alteration is quite ridiculous.
I just want to give another idea. In the town of Nundle, which is a small town in my electorate, the Sommerville family run a sawmilling business. They are traditionally hardwood sawmilling people and have been there for many generations. They are turning to plantation pine, which is great; I have no problem with that. The issue is that there are stands of growing trees that are now going to waste, to be burnt.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I thought I might start by responding to the remarks of the members for Braddon and Lyons, who both put a case for bipartisanship. That is not surprising because they come from Tasmania and that is exactly what has happened in the Tasmanian parliament. There is no conflict and there is no political point scoring of substance in the Tasmanian parliament on the issue of forestry. One of those 
 speakers might remind me, but I think the industry represents 20 or 30 per cent of the employment in that state.
Those people down there, including Deputy Premier Lennon, with whom I have an excellent relationship, desperately want this legislation. It is no secret that Mr Lennon attended the Senate inquiry relating to this matter in Melbourne and said, `The state of Tasmania wants the legislation without amendment.' That is the position of people who have put the interests of their constituents above the opportunity for some political point scoring. A couple of times by way of interjection today it has been said to me, `Give in and you get your bill.' It is not a case of giving in; it is all a case of making sure we are delivering what is clearly understood to be the right and proper legislation as assessed by both sides of politics in the biggest timber employing state, Tasmania.
Other people who have made a contribution to this issue—and the quotes have been read to the House today—that is, the CFMEU, NAFI, AWU and the Forest Protection Society, all desperately want this bill and they want it without amendment. They unanimously want—and I will refer to this later—a Forest Products Advisory Council.
I would like to put what people want in words: they want secure and uncontestable resource security for their industry. Furthermore, we in this place will not be the judges of that; the judges will be the people who are being asked to invest $100,000, $1 million, $10 million or $2 billion. The challenge to this House is not to keep telling ourselves who is right—my dad can beat your dad—but to present a piece of legislation that the people who are going to make these substantial investments to the benefit of so many other people can trust.
The member for Braddon asked: where is your action agenda? I can tell you where it is. It is stalled on this piece of legislation. I am out there—I am not a bad salesman—and I am putting arguments. I have listened to experts. I have arguments to put to all sectors of the industry as to how we might bring this together. I have had two meetings. I have people meeting in focus groups and steering 
 groups trying to get this thing up. A lot of those people see the benefit of the Forest Products Advisory Council.
But when I talk to those who have real money they ask, `When are you going to give us resource security?' They do not want me to tell them that there is a little bit in there—as the member for Denison has said—where there is opposing legal opinion. They do not want any prospect of legal action whatsoever. They are keeping their cheque book zipped up until that happens. (Extension of time granted) If we therefore want progress in the forests, it is our job to put up legislation which the rest of the world says is secure and uncontestable.
I interjected once in this House about lawyers: they cannot be that smart because every time they go to court one of them loses. All we had from the member for Denison today was an example of that. We do not want that. We do not want anything in this legislation that opens the opportunity for litigation and consequently creates a circumstance where people just simply say, `I don't need the trouble.' I have people kicking my door in looking for my billions every day. More particularly, we need expertise if we are going to get that level of investment in Tasmania that returns things to the way the member for Braddon believes they should be—a very substantial pulp and paper opportunity. Of course we are now noticing that having taken a decision in Tasmania to import paper pulp the price is going up, so the opportunities are improving.
I think it is also reasonable to lay down in this place that the regional forest agreement process is not a dud and is not dishonest. More than anything, it is time politicians and green activists laid off the scientists, public servants and others who are involved in the process. Not long ago the officials representing Australia went before a tribunal in the Hague with scientific evidence and convinced them that the Japanese were taking too many southern bluefin tuna. We all cheered in this place—we were bipartisan. How did we win that case? We won it on scientific evidence. Yet people tell me, `You can come up with a resource base of the southern bluefin tuna in 
 an international arena, but we have not got one scientist competent enough to count trees, to measure them, to take photographs of them or to see that certain trees are growing out of the ground.'
If you heard some of the green activists' rhetoric, you would wonder why trees need seeds because the old ones never die and if you cut them down nothing grows in their place. We know that is not true. There are good scientists and decent people out there who go into our regrowth forests and our old-growth forests and set little traps out there—not to destroy the animals but to see how many are there. When they go into the old-growth forests, they catch them. When they go into the regrowth forests, they catch them. But if you listened to a well-known dress designer, who was quoted in the Woman's Weekly—and it is no credit to the journalist—you would believe that if you cut down trees all the animals would die. Well, they do not. She made a similar claim that the birds would stop cohabitating, but of course we can breed them in captivity, and of the animals that will not go into a regrowth forest we have photographs of them on golf courses!
As people leading this nation, when are we going to stop listening to rubbish like that? And you wonder why the member for Fremantle can run the argument that 80 per cent of people do not like regional forest agreements. The suggestion is that in some states and in other places there has been a lack of transparency and there has been a lack of consultation. The fact is that that is just not true either. The process is set down in these books. It is followed religiously.
—But that's what happened in Queensland—exactly that.
—A process was followed in Queensland until the state government decided to do something on its own, which did ignore what had happened. But I think it is reasonable to lay down what happens in the regional forest agreement process—which, for instance, did not happen prior to the last state election in New South Wales on the North-East Regional Forest Agreement—and that is the following. First, there is a public announcement that there is going to be a region 
 al forest agreement assessment. (Extension of time granted)  A map is published as to the region involved.
Then starts a process primarily funded by money obtained from this House for scientific assessments. They are environmental assessments, they are social assessments and they are economic assessments. Why is that the case? Because that is what this book tells us to do. When one gets into the JANIS criterion which deals with the reserve area—section 5.4—we find that even the scientists who were expressly commissioned to deal with the reserve area tell us:
It should be recognised that the extent of potential social and economic impacts may limit the ability to meet reserve criteria.
They wrote back to us after they were commissioned and said, `It's not fair to save the forest if you can't save the people.'
I want to comment on that. I hear all these wonderful schemes as to how you would make some three-fingered sawmill operator serve at tables. It is a silly concept. It is not one I accept and, furthermore, every time there is a new tourist job, I want some currently unemployed kid to get that job. I do not want a situation where we are shuffling deckchairs on the Titanic while there are better alternatives. So we go out and test those things, and we spend around Australia over $100 million—usually $10 million or $12 million per state. We hire the best people. They are not crooks, and they are not fools. In Western Australia, they published 46 scientific papers. I want to come back to that in regard to some of the comments of the member for Fremantle.
We get those people to advise us. I do not get up some mornings as the Minister for Forestry and Conservation and think, `I know enough about forests. I'll make all the decisions. This is it. Give me a map. I'll draw some squares on it.' Vegetation mapping is done. Aerial photographs are taken and analysed. We have had forest industries around the world for thousands of years. There is a huge body of expertise. We have some of the more outstanding schools of academic forestry in the world. That work is done, and nothing is secret.
As those reports are given to the government, they are published. They are not given to me. We have a task force. It is made up of representatives—officials of Environment Australia, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and AFFA. They are the decision makers. A lot of social inquiry is done through public meetings. People go out and ask, `What are your problems? Could you get another job?' We go to so many of these towns, and we try to materialise jobs. It never works. The one resource for many of those towns is native timber and if you do not let them use it nothing else comes up by way of a job.
We get to the position where we have all of this advice, we publish it—it goes on the Internet—and then we have some very specific acts. We publish a comprehensive regional assessment. There are a couple about to go out in Victoria. This is a summary of all those facts and figures. When that has been in the public arena for a period of time—and everybody who genuinely wants to know can get one—we put out an options paper. It has maps in it; it has all these things. It says, `You can do this, that or something else.' It describes how it might or might not meet the JANIS criteria, it describes the social effect, et cetera.
Typically—and there has been a little bit of pressure lately that has restricted this—we then allow six weeks for public submissions. One of the problems we had there in the early stages was that certain people thought that was some sort of popularity poll, and they loaded us up with 20,000 or 30,000 submissions, the greatest bulk of which were form letters—a waste of woodchips. And, by the way, since I have been making that point, there has been a drop off. It is an opportunity given to people to make substantive responses. (Extension of time granted) I recently had three people come to me who have a sincere interest in the Wombat Forest, which is in the electorate of Mr O'Keefe—forgive me, I can't think of the name. They had an area of concern that the state agency was not to be trusted in calculating the sustainable yield. They said, `But if you are to get Dr Turner from the ANU Department of Forestry to 
 reassess that, we would accept it.' I said, `Done.' I do not even know how much it is costing us. Mr O'Keefe turned around and said to me, `That was a great thing you did, Wilson.'
I have been jibed at all day because the then state Minister for Conservation and Land Management, Marie Tehan, told me to butt out of Victoria. I told her that I will not. I want it understood that, when I take responsibilities on, I take them on on both sides but that I have a bias towards the interests of the industry. I make no secret of it, because I think the people who work in the industry are the salt of the earth, and I think they have equal rights to a job, particularly when there is nothing else about.
When we have eventually got those submissions, they are considered. And eventually someone has to sit down and make the final decision, which is called a RFA and I tabled seven of those today: Tasmania, Central Highlands, north-east Victoria, south-western Australia, Eden and East Gippsland. The interesting thing, for the information of the member for Paterson, is that all this policy was set down in 1992. The Labor Party lost government in 1996, and there was not one RFA finished. That is what we have achieved since then. That is in response to the sorts of silly arguments that we have had brought up here today.
One of the arguments emanating from the opposition is that we should take it back and let them have another fight about it. When the options were put out in Western Australia there were three—A, B and C. A was the greenest and C the brownest. Everybody was saying, `We are bound to get C. Isn't it dreadful.' The actual agreement—which, by the way, was presented to the Commonwealth by the state government; it was their choice—was greener than any of those three. We signed it at their request, and I supported them. That was the situation. They have not walked away from the agreement—they are hanging on to that like grim death—but they are working within it to change their forest management practices, which is their right under the agreement, to take a lot of wood away. They started complaining. I think the 
 member for Fremantle complained that they started to lose jobs, and that was nasty old big business.
Bunnings had a workshop which, on the strength of that agreement, they decided to put to work to build all the drying kilns for their Pemberton mill. That was going to be a big experiment, because it was the first serious time anyone had tried to kiln dry kauri. That is what those workers were going to do. Overnight, Richard Court—you know, the only living heart donor—took away all that kauri. In four years time, that Pemberton mill closes down. It is a big mill; it closes down. So what did they need their workshops for? To fix a couple of trucks. They just wrote their business down by $30 million, so they closed it. And Court and his mates said, `This is dreadful,' and the member for Fremantle carries on in the same way.
Let me tell you what the outcome of all these processes was with regard to Western Australia. The outcome was the best JANIS outcome of any agreement signed to that time, a decision taken not by CALM, which of course Brian Burke and the member for Fremantle created, as to what the sustainable yield of the remaining forest was but a decision made by Professor Ian Ferguson of the Melbourne School of Forestry. It was made by Dr Turner, whom I have just mentioned has been endorsed by another green group. (Extension of time granted) And it was endorsed by a nominee of the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority. They set down what that quota should be, and it vastly exceeded the contracted entitlements of the sawmilling industry in Western Australia at this moment and until 2003.
The sawmilling industry said, `If you are going to give us this agreement and you are going to give us guarantees for 20 years at those new levels, we will forgo voluntarily our unsustainable contracts.' The fourth and the best item was on the signing, and for some weeks after, nobody lost their job. That was partly because we brought $20 million of Commonwealth money to the arrangement, which was all to be addressed and directed to value adding of the nature I have just mentioned. Stop cutting hardwood into green 
 sawn timber and recognise its value in the highest value markets in the world. The potential for our hardwood has soared, and processed timber is so high that it may be too expensive for Australians. That is the potential. We have got these people trying to kill it off. Why would you do that? So that is the system. It is transparent, right up to that last minute. Of course there is a point in time when the ministers have got to sit down and sign the final agreement. If we agreed to that arrangement, that would just be a springboard for another grab.
The member for Paterson keeps saying in this place that there is a RFA on my desk. Of course there is not. A RFA is just that—an agreement between a state government and a federal government. It cannot be the unilateral decision of a state government. He might think that the one that New South Wales put together was a really good one in every respect, but it could have been lousy for the environment. His suggestion to me was, once they have made their mind up, I should tick off on it. Why do you think we used the export power for woodchips? To make sure we got satisfactory environmental outcomes. That was the intention of the Labor Party back in 1992. The member for Paterson gets up and says, `The state government have made up their mind, Tuckey, sign off on it.' But he also misleads further when he says that people are not able to get their woodchips sold on account of this. Boral, the major exporter, for that reason, has a letter from me guaranteeing the time lines for that RFA.
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—Well, it is possible that they do not need their product; business is a bit quiet. But the reason is not the one that the member for Paterson announced
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—I would not be surprised. But they have a letter from me that says that they are all right, and the time lines will be met or else. And you know a bit about what `or else' means. So there is that opportunity. And `or else' is not a threat, as the member for Reid knows. That is why we had those export controls. It is just plain silly. I have touched on a few of the myths of the forest 
 debate, but we have never had even the starting point of an RFA in New South Wales, other than in Eden. That was the only place where we had got to the point of having public consultation. Yet the member for Paterson says that it was lovely.
Let us get a few things straight while I quickly respond to some of the other people. I have mentioned most of the issues related to the Western Australian RFA. Let me say that I have seen this business with the state Labor Party. It is even worse. They want to close down what is left and, of course, they too are going to have a miracle. Everybody is going to be bought out of their jobs. The state of Western Australia is currently running a deficit budget, so one does not know what hospital beds or police stations will be closed down to find that money. But they are going to make a very large and prosperous town that did not need their help into a mendicant situation.
It was raised by the member for Reid and then by the member for Lyons, and very correctly so, that we have a $1.9 billion cash trade deficit. We borrow $1.9 billion from the rest of the world every year. (Extension of time granted) But we have the third highest per capita forest resources in the world and we are large exporters of wood in its primary form, its raw form. We will not get a change in that situation until we get secure and uncontestable legislation—and it is for that reason we are sticking to the points.
But the member for Reid did get a little bit cute when he said that we would not have a database. I gave him a bit of paper saying that, if we could get a final agreement, we would have a database. There are so many databases, but if he had wanted that in the legislation and they were going to support it—
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—You were given the offer of having it and some other matters, but they were not enough for you. You are still of the view that the best thing to do is to close down the forests, give the people a bit of cash and tell them to go away and forget about it. Richardson did that in the rainforest in 
 Queensland. I was up there the other day and the effects are still very obvious.
The member for Fremantle just went on and on. I just want her to know one thing. She said that we have ignored scientific advice. Some doctors advertised that—100 of them—and I wrote to them and said, `Please send me the papers.' When a doctor is going to operate on me, I hope he has read the instructions. Let me just put it to you that, for doctors—including that doctor opposite, an academically trained woman—to make that claim, I would have thought they actually would have read the documents they were talking to. So I wrote and asked them for those papers. They could not provide them. They sent me a list that I had previously got from the Wilderness Society of 33 scientific references. I gave it to my department who replied, `31 of those 33 references are included in the 46 scientific papers, Mr Minister; the other two say nothing about Western Australia.'
The member for Fremantle went on to suggest that I had incited violence—and I found her suggestion to be outrageous. I know what I said. I said that the people camping in the forest were as illegal as those people who camp on beaches and get their shacks knocked over by council bulldozers and I said that I thought it was time the local council asked them to move, under the law. Any action of any sawmillers or other people after that had nothing to do with my comments, and in fact happened some many days later. It is just silly to make that remark, but it is also outrageous coming from someone like her. I will not even talk about what she did.
Let me just say this to the member for Braddon, the member for Lyons and the member for Rankin, whom I do have to respond to. He wants to know whether I would go ahead with what has happened in Queensland. I have the agreement here. I do not have time to read it all, but I will read 215 to you. It states:
In the interests of either transferring additional areas into part A . . . the Queensland government has first right of refusal in terms of any mill seeking to sell their wood supply allocation or their business.  

It is an agreement signed by the managing director of the biggest pine milling operation in Queensland, and he is signing off a right of first refusal for every little sawmill in Queensland. And the member for Rankin wants me to go ahead with it. But we have asked some simple questions. They have said that they are going to have 10 million trees. Doesn't that sound good? That is 10,000 hectares. By the time the trees get to maturity, you would have only 2½ million left. The member for Lyons would know why that happens in proper silviculture. The reality is that we said, `Well, you've made all these statements. You've gone and bought television time. When are you going to plant the trees?' They do not know. But they only have 25 years to get them up, and the scientists in my department say that you will really only know how well you are travelling up there in five to 10 years of research.
It is pretty interesting because they came down and asked for $18 million of Australian taxpayers' money—and I am a bit concerned about that because I do not want to be tied into Tuckey's folly. We said to them, `But hang on a minute, there are many more millions than that available through the tax system.' The private sector is planting practically 20,000 hectares—certainly in that region—per annum in my electorate and the same is happening in Victoria and South Australia. Why aren't they planting them in Queensland? It just might be that they are not sure they will grow in a competitive way. And they do not want pulp wood; Queensland wants sawlogs because they are going to close down the entire forest.
I have to know a bit more than that. (Extension of time granted) I have to know that if Commonwealth money is expended—and it will not be expended on plantation—there will be a long-term future. The member for Blair wants to know where the native forest timber will come from for the next 25 years. The member for Lyons and the member for Braddon know that, if you cart it too far, it becomes uneconomic.	Let me say of the plantations: when they are on stream, where are the sawmills going to be? Right alongside them. Not in Gympie, not in Maryborough. 
 All these people say that they have got a job for the future. It is my job to ask those questions. I will not be satisfied with a document—and there is a photocopy of it, it has not even got a letterhead on it; it was just done for publicity purposes—and now they are running around in ever decreasing circles trying to prove up the science. As the member for Blair has said, they want to cut down every tree over 40 centimetres and call that sustainable management.
It is pretty easy to answer the claims. I love the member for Fremantle's reference to it being a declining industry. The projections are that in the next 40 years timber sales for wood products will grow from 1.7 billion cubic metres per annum to 2.3 billion cubic metres per annum. The other day a wholesaler rang CSR and said, `Can you send me my usual order of wood?' They said, `Sorry, mate, we have just sold 100,000 cubic metres of pine to China.' Why is China buying wood? It is building three times as many houses a year as the entire Australian housing stock. And the member for Fremantle says it is a declining industry. She says that there are no jobs in it because they count how many people stand around a woodchipper. She believes the trees get up out of the forest and walk there. Just think how many people are involved in transporting a million tonnes of anything—it is a lot of people—not to mention the tyres and everything else that are required.
So much was said, and I thought it was my responsibility to speak to a bit of it, but there is a very good reason the member for Braddon and the member for Lyons should not vote against our rejection of the Senate amendments. It is all in the words of Senator Brown. What did Senator Brown say? He said that he was so pleased to see those particular—
—Since when is he the Bible ?
—You know what he said.
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—Do not worry about his vote. He told the truth for once. He said that your amendments will blow the RFAs out of 
 the water. We went right around Australia boasting how successful he had been.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I move:
(1)	 Page 5 (after line 24), at the end of the Bill, add:
9  Forest Products Advisory Council
	 (1)	 A Forest Products Advisory Council is established by this section.
	 (2)	 The Council consists of:
		 (a)	 the Minister, as Chairperson; and
		 (b)	 such other members as the Minister appoints in writing.
	 (3)	 A majority of the members appointed by the Minister must be from the Forests and Wood Products Sector and its workforce.
	 (4)	 The functions of the Council are:
		 (a)	 to provide advice to the Minister on the development and implementation of the Action Agenda for the Forests and Wood Products Sector, incorporating the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy; and  

		 (b)	 any other functions that are determined in writing by the Minister.
	 (5)	 A determination under subsection (4) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 .
	 (6)	 Meetings of the Council are to be convened by the Minister. The Minister must convene at least 2 meetings in each calendar year and such additional meetings as are requested by a majority of the Council.
	 (7)	 The Council may determine the procedure to be followed at its meetings.
	 (8)	 The Council may establish working groups to assist in the performance of its functions. Working groups may include persons who are not members of the Council.
	 (9)	 In this section:
 Forests and Wood Products Sector  means the following industries:
		 (a)	 forest industries;
		 (b)	 wood products industries.
This amendment proposes that the government's Forest Products Advisory Council, with membership drawn from the forest industries work force, be established under legislation to provide advice to the government on matters affecting the forest and wood products industries.
I initially had some doubts about the need for such a council to be created under the legislation as I felt we could achieve for the industry without that particular activity. However, I decided after close consultation with the industry and the unions that such a legislative arrangement was desirable to ensure the industry had a formal mechanism to place its views accurately and directly with the government. The establishment of the council is also consistent with and complementary to the government's action agenda which will drive the next period of industry development.
The formation of the council provides an opportunity for the forest and wood products industries to build on the cohesion among its different sectors. Over 80,000 Australians work in an industry which now will have a direct voice in Commonwealth decision making concerning their industry. Member 
 ship of the council will predominantly comprise representatives from the forest and forest products industry, including its work force. However, I anticipate that membership will also include representatives of the state and Commonwealth agencies and independent people with expertise in sustainable management of forests. The establishment of this council and this amendment is supported by stakeholders, including the CFMEU, the National Association of Forest Industries and the Forest Protection Society.
It is now time to make it abundantly clear that this government amendment is the only amendment the government will accept to this bill, the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . As the shadow minister is well aware, he has been approached to give him an opportunity to suggest practical amendments which did not destroy the integrity and purpose of this legislation. It is clear he has been totally sidelined and that the real shadow minister for forestry is a staffer in the office of the Leader of the Opposition. What I am saying to the opposition is that this bill is now a package including the Forest Products Advisory Council measure. It contains this measure in a form approved by the CFMEU and NAFI and, I believe, the AWU. This is the only amendment so far considered that has such approval. If the opposition in the Senate is instrumental in forcing other amendments through, then the bill will not be accepted by the government and this vital amendment to create a Forest Products Advisory Council will also be lost. The Labor Party cannot therefore argue to its own constituency that it voted for this measure whilst proposing other unacceptable amendments as such amendments will mean no forest products advisory council. I commend the amendment to the House and I provide the supplementary explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,20,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—The amendment moved by the minister to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  to establish a Forest Products Advisory Council was moved in the Senate by this side of the House as well, but it did not seem to have the support of the government at that time. There is certainly a need for it, which I want to go 
 over. The minister outlined some of the RFA process quite well. In Tasmania, as well, the process was certainly long. It was thorough. Nobody could argue it was not the correct process or that it did not meet the guidelines. That is why the RFA in general terms has met with approval. That is why it has the support of the stakeholders—the industry, the trade unions, the state Labor government, the state Liberal Party and, hopefully, this parliament.
I also want to reinforce a couple of things that were said in the debate in relation to forestry. The issue of constantly trying to deal with the rhetoric becomes rather tiresome. It is impossible to always agree, but let me say that there is no scientific indication that one species of animal has been lost because of forestry in Australia. Nothing has been proven in that regard; there is science to say otherwise.
An industry council is urgently needed. We talked about this earlier in the day. The $1.9 billion of imports into Australia for forest and forest based industries is significant. We need to build the industry if we are going to give the jobs that we talk about in those small regional communities and if we are going to give our union members the work that they deserve. At the moment the industry is not going in the direction that it should. It seems to be getting its act together in the promotion of woods much better than it did in the past, and I commend it for that. We need to pull this industry together. We need to stop the bantering from one political side to the other and to endeavour to deal with this industry in a positive manner.",REPS,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message and Unrelated Amendments</title>,Bills,20,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—One would have thought from the contribution of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation to the debate on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  that there was some similarity between the amendment he has put forward today and the suggestions of the CFMEU in relation to a council. He well knows that that is not the case. The reality is that the council he put forward today—which he said he has done with some reluctance; that he originally opposed the idea; that he did not think it was a good idea—is totally inadequate. If we look at the features of it, we 
 see that it must meet at least twice a year. That is the only commitment he says it has with regard to its meetings—twice a year.
—That's the minimum.
—It is the minimum. As he well knows, it falls far short of the suggestions of the CFMEU and the amendments that the opposition put forward in the Senate. If we look at the membership of the council that he is putting forward today, once again, it asks for another blank cheque for a minister who has been sidelined. As we have seen with Premier Beattie's dealings recently with this government, if there is one person being sidelined, it is the minister opposite. Despite that reality in Australian politics, despite the reality of the very positive comments coming out of the Premier of Queensland after discussions with the Prime Minister, the minister is saying that we should give him a blank cheque on this as well. The amendment says:
(2)	 The Council consists of:
		 (a)	 the Minister, as Chairperson; and
		 (b)	 such other members as the Minister appoints in writing.
There are no specifics on where they might come from, who they are or the nature of the parts of the industry they represent.
—Trust me.
—A number of coalition governments around this country have found themselves to have made a mistake in trusting you previously.
—The member for Reid will address his remarks through the chair, and the Minister for Forestry and Conservation will be silent.
—In contrast, the Labor Party's amendments obviously deal in a very real sense with the nature of this industry and making sure that a variety of forces are represented. It specifies that somebody be there from the hardwood sawmilling section, another from the softwood sawmilling sector, someone from the pulp and paper sector, someone from the timber furniture industry sector and another from the reconstituted wood products sector. It specifies that there be one from each state. It requires that 
 the ACTU have at least two people on the board.
We have heard complaints from some of those opposite about the big end of town in the industry—as represented, allegedly, by the Queensland Timber Board or by their nemesis Col Dorber in New South Wales; these dreadful people who do not agree with the minister opposite—and how sawmillers are being marginalised, ignored and pushed out of industry. Yet what we are seeing here today is a proposal that this minister should be given the total say about who is on the industry council. Frankly, there is a very urgent need for all sectors to be represented and for the representation to be specified, so that we do not have the kind of problem that the government is alleging occurs.
Frankly, if we are to say that the minister should be trusted, we have to look at the track record of those opposite. The former Labor government consulted key stakeholders about the development of a wood and paper industry strategy. The strategy was publicly announced in December 1995 and included additional funding of $38 million in addition to the $107 million previously announced for structural adjustment. It was intended that the strategy be driven by a high-powered wood and paper industry council, chaired personally by the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources.
However, what is the performance of the government in this area where they supposedly profess so much interest in our deficit, so much interest in the employees, so much interest in regard to their work practices? What is the record of the coalition in regard to this matter? They abolished the council and put in place a low key Wood and Paper Industry Forum. The minister, Mr Tuckey, has admitted that this body met on only two occasions during the last parliamentary term: in October 1997 and February 1998. This is fairly indicative of the government's complete lack of interest in the 1995 strategy, and its complete lack of interest in regard to having an effective council there to actually do something.
It is all right to whine about our deficit, but this industry policy has to be driven by an 
 effective council with proper representation that represents the entire industry and actually meets. He is saying today—and I suppose they are going to trust him—that he will put in a condition here that they meet at least twice a year. What is their track record? Their track record was to abolish an effective committee that was actually doing something in the industry and to make sure that this replacement, second-rate operation met only twice in a parliamentary term.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—The questions arising for members of the opposition this afternoon are: just how low can this government go and how low can the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs go? First, over the last couple of years, we have seen huge cuts of up to $800 million to universities in Australia, and now it is the students who are going to have to pay for those cuts with the sorts of figures of $100,000 per degree floating around in that cabinet submission this afternoon.
A few weeks ago I spoke in the debate on the  Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1999  and in my speech I offered to paint a picture for the minister of the university in my electorate, to tell him about the kinds of students that go to that university. He obviously did not listen, because anyone who had listened to the outline of the demographics of Central Queensland University could not have prepared this submission as a serious advance in education in this country. Here are the figures: 70 per cent of the students at Central Queensland University are the first generation of their family to attend university. We have the highest number of indigenous students of any university in Australia and we have over 40 per cent of our students coming from a low socioeconomic background. They are the 
 department's own figures that I am quoting there.
We have the highest proportion of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds of any university, according to those figures. These are all the groups in our community that have traditionally been excluded by previous conservative governments from getting the opportunity of a tertiary education. If the minister thinks that students and families in my electorate can afford to pay $100,000 to go to university, he is seriously out of touch with reality. There is another example that I have come across this week showing exactly how far out of touch with reality this minister is. It is contained in his view of the New Apprenticeships scheme. The minister has been in parliament in the last couple of days answering questions and speaking in very glowing terms of how wonderful the system of New Apprenticeships Centres is going to be. I will just tell him a bit about the reality of what is happening in Central Queensland this week with one of my group training companies.
I have had a number of calls, very angry calls, from the manager of the Capricornia Training Company this week. This company has a long experience with apprentices and trainees in Central Queensland. They actually have 302 apprentices and trainees on their books at the moment and have 24 staff. They have worked long and hard for a good reputation in our town for good service to employers and to trainees and apprentices. They missed out on a contract to continue their work as a New Apprenticeships Centre. They can live with that; that is business. But what they are really upset about is how the handling of this by DETYA is reflecting on their company, and the adverse effects that this could have on the apprentices and trainees that they have tried to serve very well in the past.
The Capricornia Training Company, I am told, were not advised in writing by DETYA that they were not successful in their contract. They were advised that they could check out the successful contractors on the department's web site—and they found that very difficult to do. They were told by phone on Monday 
 that they were not successful in getting a contract to be a New Apprenticeships Centre under the next round. They got a phone call from someone purporting to be from DETYA in Canberra to say, `You  have missed out, and we would like to know now which company or organisation you are going to transfer your apprentices and trainees to: QCCI or Employment National?'
Worse than that, the Capricornia Training Company started getting calls in from their employer clients to say that they had been getting phone calls from DETYA as well—and this, only a matter of a day after CTC had been informed that they were not going to be successful. So here you have a company now dealing with the effects of DETYA's incompetence. The word is around all over Rockhampton that CTC is closing its doors—which is clearly not the case.
This incompetence by DETYA is seriously undermining the service that this company is trying to provide to its employers and to its apprentices and trainees and is really doing quite a lot of damage to their reputation as a business with a lot of experience in this area. The minister needs to spend less time writing extremely damaging and negative cabinet submissions and spend a bit more time looking at what he is actually doing for students, apprentices and trainees in this country—particularly in the regional areas of Australia where our hard-working small business organisations—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Education: Funding Cuts</title>,Adjournment,21,1
"Wilton, Greg, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I would like to draw the attention of the House to the plight of Mr Nasrullah Wahidi, an Afghani who was denied a protection visa in a decision by the Refugee Review Tribunal, No. V99/10339, on 28 September this year. Mr Wahidi worked as a dentist in Afghanistan. He had a female patient who consulted him on three occasions. On the first two occasions she was accompanied by a child. On the third visit the applicant had to uncover her face—that is, lift her veil—to fit a denture he had made for her. The applicant left the room to make some adjustments to the denture, and when he returned the Taliban were there. The applicant was accused of being an adulterer. He was told that the woman had been followed and that they were aware this was the third time she had come to see him. He later learnt that the Taliban had a checkpoint outside his surgery.
The applicant is not in any way linked to any particular political group. He has rightly claimed that the Taliban are against socially well-known families that are well educated and that the Taliban wished to discredit them amongst the community. For this reason, they created a false impression against the applicant. The Taliban are of the view that scholars are only those people who study religion, and they do not recognise other professions or fields of study.
The applicant explained that he had a female patient who wanted a front denture. On the first visit, she came to be measured; on the second visit, he fixed the denture with wax; and on the third visit, he was to ensure that it fitted properly. The applicant's clinic had four sections, and on the third visit he had gone to another section to fit the denture. He returned from that section to the theatre only to be beaten with a gun by the Taliban who were in the surgery. The applicant was taken to an office at the police station and kept there for 16 days. He was beaten and tortured, and they tried to force him to make a statement that he had raped the woman. They said that she visited him on three occasions and they were suspicious.
The applicant was asked whether the allegation was one of rape or adultery. He responded that the allegation was a sort of adultery and because of the relationship the consequence was rape. The applicant believes that he was accused of this crime because of the general intention to discredit educated people. When the applicant was in detention he was taken to the mosque five times a day to pray. Due to his habit of smoking cigarettes, he befriended a guard who asked him about his crime and he swore that he was innocent. The guard informed him that, when the Mullah returned from the front line, he would be stoned. The guard agreed to help him escape.
The upshot of this is that the applicant has asked the tribunal to consider his application on humanitarian grounds. Although the applicant is at risk of harm if he returns to Afghanistan, the tribunal is limited to determining whether the applicant satisfies the criteria for the grant of a protection visa. Consideration of this rests with the minister. I urge the minister to grant a protection visa.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  is a bill which strengthens the forfeiture and enforcement powers under the Fisheries Management Act and also provides for the implementation of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995. The opposition supports amendments to the bill as being necessary to adequately deal with the increasing problem of illegal fishing in Australia's fishing zone and to give effect to the intentions of the previous Labor government in relation to the implementation of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement.
As noted in the second reading speech of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on the introduction of the legislation to the House, the objective of this piece of legislation is to strengthen measures to ensure the sustainable management of fisheries in our coastal waters. An important part of that management is to strengthen measures to ensure domestic and international compliance with existing fishery management regimes. We acknowledge on 
 this side of the House the growing problem of illegal fishing within Australia's fishing zone and also unregulated fishing on the high seas, which is leading to the depletion of migratory fish stocks important to Australia's fishing industry.
The first schedule of this bill, relating to the forfeiture and enforcement powers to combat illegal fishing, includes the following measures: an automatic catch, gear and boat forfeiture scheme to deter illegal foreign fishing in the Australian fishing zone, and incorporating into Australian law actions possible under international law to provide a more effective enforcement action against illegal foreign fishers, including actions against mother ships operating outside the Australian fishing zone and supporting illegal fishing within the zone. It also provides for the doubling of penalties for various fishing offences. It makes explicit provision for the automatic forfeiture regime for foreign fishers to prevail over the Admiralty Act. This ensures that Australian investigations and judicial actions are not frustrated by foreign third parties.
When one examines the growth of Australia's fishing industry, it can be appreciated why these measures are becoming increasingly necessary. Recent surveys of fish consumption in Australia indicate an increase of some 13 per cent since 1991. Australian exports have risen over the past decade from about $783 million to just under $1.5 billion. The reality of that export performance is simply that it is based on highly prized and highly priced shellfish and other fish sold at a premium into lucrative Asian markets in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. Tuna, along with abalone, crabs, prawns, scallops and rock lobsters are all in increasing demand, especially in these Asian markets.
There is an important feature of Australian fisheries that must be appreciated in this context, especially by those countries which may recklessly overfish straddling stocks on the high seas or fish illegally in Australia's waters. Australia has an enormous diversity in its fishing resource under its legal management and control. However, they are not what you would call volume fisheries compared to other parts of the globe. The products that come out of them are high value and go to lucrative markets, especially in Asia. These are important and growing markets for Australia. If they are to maintain past growth patterns and export performance, then our fisheries must be carefully managed along sustainability principles.
Because of the nature of these fisheries there is a real danger that they can be overfished, and illegal fishing only exacerbates that problem. The Bureau of Rural Science recently found that four species in our fishing zone were in danger of being overfished: tiger prawns in the Northern Prawn Fishery, school shark in the Southern Shark Fishery, eastern gemfish in the South-Eastern Fishery and southern bluefin tuna, which is fished off the south-east coast of Australia. That report was referred to and contained in an article in the Weekend Financial Review of 9-10 October. The article highlighted the problems we face with these very valuable fishing resources, which are not extensive and which can be overfished, especially by illegal fishers in our waters.
Schedule 2 of the bill relates to the implementation of provisions to ratify the UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995. Australia signed this agreement in 1995, and it is expected to come into force in the year 2000. I understand that around 30 countries have signed the agreement. Its objective is to provide rights, obligations and management principles for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. Some of our most lucrative fisheries fall into this category. The objects of the agreement are to gain greater cooperation in the management of these straddling stocks and to enforce sustainability principles by getting greater cooperation through regional fisheries management organisations.
To ratify this agreement Australian law must reflect the obligations contained in the agreement. The process will consist of a regulation impact statement in which the effect on businesses and regional communities and groups will be assessed, followed by a national interest analysis. Of course, any legislation that ratifies an external treaty goes to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for further examination and consideration.
The amendments contained in the second schedule to the bill will provide for additional functions and objectives for the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to participate in devising and implementing international and regional conservation and management measures to regulate fishing on the high seas in particular, and requiring the observation of internationally agreed measures in the management of the fisheries. They also provide for the inclusion of stock specific reference points which implement the precautionary approach in fisheries management plans relevant to those highly migratory straddling stocks. They require Australian fishing vessels operating outside the fishing zone to meet several conditions including vessel position reporting, marking and the facilitation of boarding in accordance with the conditions consistent with regionally agreed conservation and management measures. They also create a set of powers to enable fisheries officers to inspect and board foreign vessels on the high seas to check compliance with regionally agreed conservation and management measures. They provide for new offences for foreign vessels, which may be prosecuted following authorisation by a vessel's flag country implemented through the consent of the Australian Attorney-General.
Some people might have reservations about the strengthening of the provisions contained in this legislation and the fact that they are being brought into line with border control measures and other legislation that will be brought before the House. We have examined these provisions quite carefully and have weighed up the increased powers that are provided under this act with the necessity to ensure that Australian fisheries are properly managed in a sustainable way. We on this side of the House are satisfied that the provisions contained in this legislation are not excessive.
However, I offer this note of caution, that officers who are charged with the responsibility of enforcing this legislation ought to be adequately trained for the task. We note that at a time when budgets are constrained at the federal level, as a deliberate objective of government policy, there is a danger that, within the authorities that are entrusted with the task of managing these fisheries, the task I have outlined can often fall by the wayside, or be incompletely fulfilled. So there is a note of caution from this side of the House to the government to consider carefully the training regimes for personnel who are going to be entrusted with the onerous responsibility of enforcing the provisions of this particular piece of legislation and, of course, other pieces of legislation that come before the House in dealing with substantial enforcement powers.
It is getting dangerous on the high seas. We have illegal fishing vessels that are very fast, and we have illegal fishers who are very organised. There are quite explicit powers given under this legislation for Australia to pursue its interests outside the Australian fishing zone on the high seas. We must be very careful where this occurs that the personnel to whom we entrust this immediate task, the identification of the foreign fishing vessels either within our zone or fishing straddling stocks in an unregulated way on the high seas—an enforcement of this act—are properly trained. We must ensure not only a quick response but also an effective response from skilled officers who are aware of the powers that are granted to them under this particular 
 piece of legislation and who wield those powers in a responsible way in Australia's national interest.
The fishing industry is very important to the economic future of many coastal and regional communities throughout Australia. I was recently in Tasmania at the invitation of the honourable member for Lyons, Mr Adams, who is a great proponent of Tasmania's fishing industry. We had cause to visit a new facility in his electorate where seahorses are grown and produced. It was a very interesting tour that we undertook of that facility. The facility required very high capital investment, but it had enormous potential to service the lucrative markets that are in Asia for the products that come from this particular resource, especially the Asian medicines. I congratulate the people who are involved in this particular project. It is one that has enormous regional potential and it has important export potential for Australia.
The member for Lyons is a great supporter of the fishing industry in Tasmania and, indeed, Australia. Anybody who has had cause over the past few years to attend the many functions that he organises for the Tasmanian salmon industry can appreciate the depth of his interest and his commitment to the entrepreneurs and the workers who form the backbone of this very important regional industry for the state of Tasmania and for Australia. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge on the floor of the House the contribution that the honourable member for Lyons makes to this industry in Tasmania and Australia. I understand he will be following me in this debate. It is probably just as well that he was not in the chamber to hear the accolades that I have just poured upon him. But, seeing that he has just returned, let me say that the support that the honourable member for Lyons gives to the Tasmanian fishing industry is appreciated by the entrepreneurs and the workers in that industry in that state.
We do not intend to oppose this piece of legislation. It is in line with many of the measures that Labor in power over the past 13 years has pursued. We do understand that there is a new dimension now to the illegal fishing issue. There is a greater urgency for Australia to manage in a sustainable way in the future the rather precious and valuable fish stocks in our waters and those straddling stocks that come into the Australian fishing zone. So the opposition will be supporting this piece of legislation before the House.",REPS,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Washer, Mal, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—I rise to support the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  as there are many people in my electorate who make their livelihood from the vast oceans off Western Australia. This bill introduces new measures to combat illegal fishing within the Australian fishing zone, as well as to develop new strategies to guarantee our vast fishing industry can be maintained without fear of overfishing and endangering marine stocks.
It is well documented that Australia is recognised as a pacesetter in world fisheries management. Since 1996, the coalition government has acted unfalteringly to protect our fishery resources by working with the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the fishing industry and the community. The coasts and clean seas initiative committed $125 million under the Natural Heritage Trust and the $10 million Fisheries Action Program has helped to rehabilitate coastal and marine environments and restore fishery habitats.
In our first term, 260 foreign vessels were caught operating illegally in Australian waters, and Japanese fishing vessels have been banned from Australian ports in response to Japan's disregard of the quota set for the fishing of southern bluefin tuna, a fish that is in serious danger of extinction. Last year we established Australia's first whale policy to ensure the permanent protection of the world's whales. This recognised that, despite a general change 
 in attitude by most countries that whaling was both environmentally and morally abhorrent, nations such as Japan and Norway are still pushing for the return of commercial whaling. Australia's policy on the protection of whales was a welcome stand.
In a recent article in the Australian by Sue Arnold, Coordinator of Australians for Animals, it was said that:
In a world in which governments are seen as environmental wimps, it's not surprising that Australia's stand has attracted the attention of environmental groups and the public. Neither is it an exaggeration to say the global village looks to Australia to take the lead.
The management of the principal fishing industry in my electorate of Moore is also impressive by global standards.
Not only is the western rock lobster, known to most of us as the crayfish, the most valuable single species fishery in Australia, but also the industry is acknowledged as one of the best managed fisheries in the world, with the longest running management plan of any fishery in Australia. The western rock lobster represents about 20 per cent of the total value of Australia's fisheries and is exported mainly to South-East Asia, the United States, Europe and Japan.
The industry generates around $300 million towards Western Australia's economy each year. You have got to hear about the western rock lobster. The season runs from November to June, and the season that finished this June was a bumper, with a region off the coast of Moore increasing its catch by 41 per cent. Such is the control of the management plan for the species that this increase was actually predicted three to four years ago through the monitoring of one-year-old rock lobster samples, which were counted along the coast.
The crayfish industry was first regulated in the 1960s, when licence and pot numbers were frozen as far back as 1963. A sustainable catch is estimated to be around 10,000 to 11,000 tonnes of crays each year, although the last season saw around 13,000 tonnes caught due to the increase in stock that I mentioned earlier. The rock lobster industry is big business. A 100-pot licence, along with the boat and associated equipment, is valued at around $3 million. Furthermore, around 10 per cent of pots were removed from the industry in the early 1990s, which served to add value to the remaining pots.
Another strictly controlled industry is that of the abalone, with commercial fishing quotas set at around 300 tonnes per season. Specialised investigations have recently made inroads into the illegal trade of abalone, with those caught facing huge fines. A recent case in Perth saw three people convicted of attempting to sell 329 abalone to restaurants in Northbridge for $20 a kilo. They were collectively fined $90,000 and had their fishing equipment confiscated. This fine follows a record $179,000 fine issued in May of this year for purchasing abalone which had been caught illegally. The tight control of the recreational abalone fishing industry is evident in the length of the recreational abalone season in Perth. The season runs for the grand total of 7½ hours once a year in order to protect limited stocks.
The restrictions and monitoring of the two industries I have just mentioned have proved to be a successful way to ensure that these industries remain sustainable while generating valuable export dollars and jobs for Western Australians. The control of the western rock lobster industry, in particular, should be used as a benchmark for other industries and other nations when formulating sustainable industries from the fragile environment around us.
Schedule 1 of the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 will help to increase the deterrence of illegal fishing in Australian waters by foreign vessels, mainly through the 
 automatic forfeiture of the vessel itself. Many of these illegal operations are highly organised and use extremely modern and costly equipment. If we can make the penalty—in this instance, confiscation of that expensive equipment—too costly to risk the venture, it will reduce the number of foreign vessels willing to take the risk. Furthermore, the doubling of penalties for illegal fishing recognises the huge sums of money that can be made from fishing in Australian waters and that the penalties have to act as a sufficient deterrent.
The bill also deals with the problems experienced after the apprehension of Aliza Glacial in 1997 by the Australian Defence Force near Heard Island in the Australian fishing zone. The Panamanian registered vessel was confiscated by Australian authorities, but had to be released under the Admiralty Act to have it sold by a third party because the owners had defaulted on their mortgage of the vessel. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority reported at the time in a media release:
The release of the vessel follows twelve months of extensive legal action to have the Commonwealth's interest in the vessel recognised. However, as the master and the fishing master charged with illegal fishing offences had left Australia and had not returned to face Court hearings, the prosecution was unable to proceed. Although the vessel has not been forfeited to the Commonwealth, the owners at the time the vessel was apprehended have lost their vessel and the action sends a strong message to foreign vessels who may contemplate fishing illegally in Australian waters.
Under the new legislation, third party interests will not take precedence, through the Admiralty Act, over new enforcement rules—a move that will send an even stronger message to the illegal fishing industry. It is interesting to note that the Aliza Glacial , a state-of-the-art vessel, is currently valued at $9.4 million. I hope that any funds raised from the forfeiture of vessels is directed into the increased enforcement of these new international fishing rules to ensure their continued success and to minimise the cost to the Australian taxpayers.
Schedule 2 of the  Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  demonstrates Australia's commitment to the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the first international agreement to regulate fishing in international waters. This agreement will provide rights, obligations and fisheries management principles for the long-term conservation of fish stocks on the high seas. These stocks include: orange roughy, tuna and the much publicised Patagonian toothfish. This fish is a remarkable creature that can grow to over two metres and lives for up to 50 years. A white-flesh fish, the Patagonian toothfish was discovered commercially as a substitute after the market collapse of overexploited white-flesh fish such as orange roughy and black cod.
The Patagonian toothfish is described as the `poor man's lobster' in the New York fish markets. It is found in both Australian waters and the high seas and is in serious danger of being overfished because of illegal and unregulated fish longliners. In the waters around heritage listed Macquarie Island alone, stocks of the Patagonian toothfish have dropped by a massive 90 per cent in 1998.
In recent years illegal trade has by far outdone the regulated and licensed industry by about 90,000 tonnes a year. The flood of this fish into the world market has meant that the price of the Patagonian toothfish has dropped dramatically to the point where it is no longer worth operating in the legal market. At this rate, it is predicted by ISOFICH—the International Southern Ocean Longline Fisheries Information Clearing House—another initiative funded by the coalition's Natural Heritage Trust—that the Patagonian toothfish will crash to commercial extinction within three to five years. The ratifying of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement will benefit all Australian stakeholders, including the commercial, recreational and charter fishing industries, environmental interests, the Australian community and regional economies. I am 
 also pleased that measures will be developed under the agreement to address the accidental killing of other species, such as seabirds and dolphins, through longline fishing. It is estimated that around 100,000 seabirds a year are killed through this type of fishing.
This bill is also supported by another new piece of draft legislation to come through this House which deals with enhancing the powers of investigation at sea by Australian authorities, including the boarding and hot pursuit of vessels in both Australian waters and the high seas. The  Border Protection Legislation Amendment Bill 1999  also covers the detention of foreign people fishing illegally in Australian territory so it can be determined whether or not to charge the person with an offence related to illegal fishing.
Finally, as proved by the successful western rock lobster industry in my electorate, it is possible to maintain a successful balance between environmental sustainability and ensuring that commercial fishing remains a substantial part of our primary industry base. Of course there will always be the pirates, but Australia can lead by example in acting as the water police of oceans surrounding our nation and showing these pirates that we mean business. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—The figures provided by the member for Moore on the reduction of Patagonian toothfish in and around Macquarie Island south of Tasmania—because Macquarie Island is a part of Tasmania—show the need for a bill like this, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 , to be before the parliament. The purpose of the bill is to introduce new powers and offences and sanctions to ensure compliance with fisheries management measures. It is none too soon. Incursions into the Australian fisheries are having a severe effect on its viability.
Others might have been interested to see a program recently that addressed the problem of fish poaching on the Tasman rise. Here was a case where we have very weak powers at the moment to undertake sufficient surveillance, and little means to stop and search vessels that have been known to have been inside Australian territorial waters.
The program was graphic. It showed South African ships that somehow by magic knew exactly where to go and when to maximise its fishing. It also took far beyond the sustainable limit of fish in a few days and then disappeared from whence it came.
It showed the ships fishing and moving in and out of territorial waters. It also showed that the ships were not carrying any means of identification although they were later identified to be part of a fleet that was owned by an Asian country but run out of South Africa. It turned out that this company had obtained information from a New Zealand rogue fish captain who had peddled his information on the Tasman rise and its fishing times to these unscrupulous fishing folk based in South Africa. I believe the New Zealand government is moving to rectify this matter and to make sure that its nationals cannot peddle such information in the future. I would expect New Zealand to act in a responsible manner.
We have to stop this sort of poaching of our fish. We know that fish stocks are declining. More and more we need to understand what is there, when it should be taken and how to conserve what is left. The legislation is appropriate and I welcome the fact that we can ensure a more effective fisheries surveillance and enforcement within the Australian fishing zone. It means that now poachers can forfeit ketch, gear and their boat if they are fishing illegally in the Australian fishing zone. It allows Australian law actions to take into account international law to provide more effective enforcement action against illegal foreign fishers, including actions against mother ships operating outside the zone but supporting illegal fishers within 
 it. This is of particular importance because many of these rogue fishers work in this way. It allows them greater range and they can track fish shoals very precisely these days. Cut their supply lines and processing facilities and it can curb their activities.
Another important aspect is the explicit provision for the automatic forfeiture regime for foreign fishers to prevail over the Admiralty Act. This will ensure that Australian investigations and jurisdiction actions are not frustrated by third parties such as foreign mortgagees. They cannot wriggle out of charges because they are owned by a third country. In schedule 2, there are provisions necessary to ratify and then implement the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982. This relates to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. This comes into the Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995. These amendments will allow for AFMA to participate in devising and implementing international/regional conservation and management measures to regulate fishing on the high seas and requires the observation of internationally agreed measures in the management of fisheries. It includes also reference points to particular stock so that a cautionary approach can be undertaken where there are highly migratory and straddling stocks.
The last one gives us the power to look after those fish on the Tasman rise that race in and out of the area using the rise as their central feeding ground. It is an area rich in species and they use this area as a feeding stop during their migration. Australians have known about it for years but have been careful to protect its values and only take a sustainable catch under past management plans. Imagine their disgust and anger to see these raiders come in and cream off the best of the catch and disappear into the night without any means to stop them. Of course, this is where the orange roughy can also spend some of its time in their millions. We are only now coming to grips with the science and therefore the management of this fish. Like the Patagonian toothfish the orange roughy is a very old fish. It takes a long time to mature and has long breeding cycles. We are still gaining that information through the science of our fishing authorities and scientific research organisations.
There can now be some retaliation with this legislation. Offences by foreign vessels can be prosecuted after obtaining the permission of the vessel's flag country and the consent of the Australian Attorney-General. However, the downside is that offending vessels must have a nationality which is party to the fish stocks agreement and have contravened a conservation or management measure or a regional organisation in which Australia participates. I think that is where a lot of work has to be done on the diplomatic front.
It takes me back to the work done in transport committees of this parliament in relation to the `Ships of shame'. We have the same sort of situation applying in the fishing industry where we have these rogues using capital to buy fishing boats and putting them on the high seas. They break all the rules in the world and go against the best interests of people who try to have conventions and pull countries together to look after the fish stocks of the world. We have people using ships in the same way people used the `Ships of shame' to transport freight or other commodities around the world without due regard for life or the environment.
We have a very similar situation of ships being used to exploit the fishing stocks of the world without any consideration being given to the long-term implications of their actions. It goes against people who are trying in a world sense—through conventions, agreements and treaties—to come to grips with putting a quota system on a species. The quota system ensures that we can manage a fishery and that we can harvest a certain amount each year knowing 
 that we have a very good system in place in order to continue the rock lobsters in the electorate of the member for Moore coming in.
We need to constantly work on this and to constantly be involved in the world theatre of the fishing industry. We have played some part in this and we should congratulate our officials that have been involved. We will need to be there in the future, and future ministers for foreign affairs and trade will have to take up these issues.
It is not clear what happens to the fish pirates from non-participating countries. We have to work hard to make sure that we drum them right out of the fishing game anywhere in the world. Hopefully, this will be covered under, as I said, international treaties on our fish stocks.
The bill does, however, allow fishery officers to inspect and board foreign vessels on the high seas to check compliance with regionally agreed conservation and management measures. It puts some pressures on our own boats too. It seeks to have the Australian vessels report on their positions. It requires the marking and facilitation of boarding. It goes into monitoring and the authorisation of our vessels to fish on the high seas, while ensuring regionally agreed conservation and management measures. I think our local industry supports this as long as it does not become a prohibitive expense, to their cost. They are always conscious of that.
The shadow minister for fisheries, Gavan O'Connor, mentioned the need for training. I think that is essential in this piece of legislation. The people that are going to do the enforcing and the boarding need to be trained well to have a basic understanding of what the law is and where it is coming from, so that they do it in a correct and positive manner. There will need to be some compliance costs and some initial money put forward for that training to be done.
In 1997 I was involved in the hearings that culminated in the report, Managing Commonwealth fisheries, which looked into the many problems associated with management of our fisheries. It pointed out some of the glaring difficulties with having a number of agreements between the states and Commonwealth jurisdictions and the jurisdictional problems that that caused. I believe that report helped start the move towards having uniform management tools and enlisting the fishers to help in controlling the resource.
You really need to have fishers who are really positive, and most of them have a lot of knowledge. We need to have them onside to manage our fisheries, not offside so that there is a them and us problem. We need to make sure that we have fishers who are supportive and who have an understanding of protecting their own fisheries. We need to make sure we use them as a positive resource in this whole management of fisheries regime.
Fisheries are a renewable resource, but the renewability of stocks is entirely dependent on limiting the pressures on fish stocks and avoiding over-exploitation. Management and regulations controlling the harvesting of these valuable resources are vital, especially in fishing methods that have improved so that increasingly large catches can be taken by commercial fishers.
So when the mavericks in the industry from other countries move in and raid stocks, it has some very serious implications for our own industry. While I believe we are now setting the parameters for managing the fish in our own territorial waters, and the states are getting together with legislation, we are still very vulnerable, with our huge coastline, to incursions by other countries into our rich fishing areas.
There is also a problem because many of the species we fish within our waters originate from outside. For instance, the migratory pattern of tuna, which spawn in the north-west of 
 Western Australia, follows the Western Australian coastline south into the Great Australian Bight and then around Tasmania into the Southern Ocean and back up the east coast of Tasmania. According to the experts, tuna are at their best either south or east of Tasmania. That is where their colour and their taste are at their best, where they are mature young adults of about six or seven years of age. Tasmanian waters actually have more nutrients in the water for travelling fish as the currents around the Tasman rise allow upwellings from the Southern Ocean to bring a rich source of food to our fish stocks. No wonder the pirates make for this particular spot in the Southern Ocean. There are also thousands of square miles of ocean there, which makes it very hard to police. Unless we have some prior warning, or some of our own fleet are in the area, it is very hard to detect these poachers quickly.
Another aspect of the management recognised in Australia  is the excess capacity of the fishing fleet and its effect on sustainability. This threatens the economic viability of the whole industry. Therefore, strict measures have been suggested to overcome this problem such as input controls on tradeable units of gear, or some proxy for gear. Catch quotas are also part of these controls. I read recently that the world has an over-capitalised fishing fleet of about 50 per cent. Maybe we are getting on top of our excess capitalisation of the fishing industry.
Fishers here have some difficulty with being subject to quotas when other countries come in within the legitimate treaties situation and pick up some of that quota. They are even more incensed, of course, when raiders come in illegally and make massive inroads into their catch and therefore their viability in the industry. So I do support the basis of this bill, but not all the financial responsibilities should be laid on our fishers. We should be pursuing within our international treaties some more stringent arrangements. Countries should only be signed up to agreements where they can help contribute to the sustainable management of international fisheries. And that international law can be used to attack the poachers where it really hurts, with huge fines and the loss of vessels and gear. This bill can certainly assist in that process.
I believe Australia should look to upgrading the 1998 and the 1995 international agreements and continue to work on the international scene. It is in the best interests of Australian fisheries, our fishing people and our fishing communities around our regional areas of Australia and it is in the national interest that we take an international role. I urge the government to do that. I have a great deal of pleasure in giving support to this bill.",REPS,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1999-10-13,"—The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  was introduced in the House on 1 September 1999. The effect of the legislation has no doubt been well laid down by previous speakers. It introduces new measures for sustainable fisheries management and, importantly, introduces new powers, offences and sanctions to enforce compliance with both existing and new management measures. The legislation in question is a reaction to the growing incidence of illegal fishing in Australian sovereign waters—as I have just heard the previous speaker, with a strong interest in Tasmania, mention—and the increasing practice of unregulated fishing in international waters, a practice that flouts the recognised international agreements on fishing.
I am privileged to be the federal parliamentary representative of much of Australia's fishing fleet, especially those elements of the fleet committed to the fishing of the wild and open seas of the Great Southern Ocean. The City of Port Lincoln is home to the largest single fishing fleet in the Southern Hemisphere, and it is fishing that has secured the city's magnificent development.
As new and innovative onshore and offshore aquaculture industries develop along the west coast of South Australia and within the Spencer Gulf, the mainstay of the seafood industry remains the fishermen of the southern seas. Those fishermen have long maintained a commitment to a sustainable management program for the southern fisheries of Australia. That commitment, reinforced by the support of the Australian government and scientists, will be strengthened by the adoption of the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 September 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, otherwise known as the fish stocks agreement.
I turn now to past international fisheries management. The fish stocks agreement applies to fish populations that straddle the boundaries of exclusive economic zones, EEZs—that is, at the 200 nautical mile limit—and the high seas, along with those migratory fish that migrate through different EEZs and high seas areas. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, all nations are able to fish on the high seas, subject to certain conditions. However, those provisions were so broad as to render a viable management system unworkable. The outcome of this failure was the collapse or severe degradation of several fisheries and the consequent demand of many nations for a comprehensive management system. These demands led to the negotiation of the fish stocks agreement between 1993 and 1995.
The fish stocks agreement has a number of major themes: where fish stocks straddle boundaries or migrate great distances, management measures in the high seas sector ought to be compatible with bordering EEZs; ratifying countries must apply a precautionary approach to straddling and highly migratory species; only members of, or countries cooperating with, the relevant regional fish management organisations—RFMOs—may fish in those applicable areas; RFMO members may undertake certain compliance and enforcement actions against vessels from member countries; and member countries may take action against fishing by non-members where that fishing constitutes a danger to the implementation of the agreement.
While the agreement is not yet in force, some RFMOs have already come into being. Obvious examples include the Southern Bluefish Tuna Commission and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. Presently, another treaty addressing the needs of the tuna fisheries of the central and western Pacific is under negotiation. The legislation before the House is intended to pave the way for the implementation of the fish stocks agreement in line with the recommendations of the Consultative Committee on High Seas and Remote Area Fishing established in 1996.
Illegal fishing in Australian waters presents a number of challenges to Australian interests. Illegal fishing threatens the Australian fishing industry by depleting our fish stocks, by presenting a danger to Australian quarantine standards, and by repudiating the carefully constructed management relationship between scientists and industry. Furthermore, illegal fishing is an incursion into Australian sovereignty that challenges our defence and strategic interests and provides cover for other activities such as the importation of illicit drugs and illegal immigrants.
It is frightening to realise that between March 1996 and December 1998, 285 fishing vessels suspected of illegal fishing inside our EEZ were apprehended by Coastwatch, fisheries authorities and the Royal Australian Navy. The majority of vessels apprehended were encountered in the waters off the northwest coast of Australia.
Under the changes before the House, penalties for illegal fishing are proposed to be doubled, with the top penalty rising to $550,000. The changes will also overcome the difficulties 
 brought to the fore by the case of the Aliza Glacial, a vessel that was caught fishing illegally within the fishing zone surrounding Heard Island. In that case, a third party, the mortgagee of the vessel, successfully asserted the primacy of its interest over the vessel to the detriment of the Commonwealth. These reforms make it clear that third party interest will not prevail over Commonwealth enforcement action in those circumstances.
Fisheries officers will now be able to seize foreign boats and fishing gear where illegal fishing is encountered in the Australian fishing zone. Onus of proof will rest on the illegal fishers if they wish to establish legitimacy of their operations and retrieve their forfeited property. The amendments implement the international law principle of constructive presence, whereby action may be taken against mother ships supporting illegal fishing within the Australian zone.
Furthermore, Australian authorities will be able to use reasonable force to require a boat to stop where, consistent with international law, illegal fishing is suspected. Such force could include: the firing of warning shots, the use of anti-propulsion devices—I am not clear what they might be but I hope they are effective—or direct action against the ship in question.
The importance of fisheries management was highlighted earlier this year by the southern bluefin tuna case. The unilateral decision by Japan in June to undertake an experimental fishing program for southern bluefin tuna was roundly condemned by both Australia and New Zealand. Australia's victory before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg two months later proved comprehensively that the Japanese initiative was a cynical attempt to circumvent proper fisheries management and increase its catch by almost 20 per cent. As the Attorney-General remarked at the time:
the Tribunal has stated, inter alia , in its order that:
* the conservation of living resources of the sea is an element in the protection and preservation of the marine environment;
* the parties (ie. Australia, New Zealand and Japan) should in the circumstances act with prudence and caution to ensure that effective conservation measures are taken to prevent serious harm to the stock of Southern Bluefin Tuna; and
* the parties should intensify their efforts to cooperate with other participants in the fishery for Southern Bluefin Tuna with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilisation of the stock.
It is to be hoped that all parties continue to respect the tribunal's findings and that the bilateral relationship between Australia and Japan, a relationship that is particularly important to the Australian seafood industry, remains strong.
It is worth while to take a moment in this debate to inform the House of events surrounding Greenpeace's ill-informed and dangerous incursion into the tuna industry early last year. I have already noted that the City of Port Lincoln and its fishermen have a long-term vested interest in the proper maintenance of the southern fisheries—an interest that is widely known throughout the seafood industry. Yet the political group, Greenpeace, chose in January 1998 to stage a series of stunts in the waters around Port Lincoln in which they attempted to prevent the harvesting of tuna, thereby endangering lives, vessels and sailors. At the time, the local community was naturally outraged by this action. It was testimony to their reasonableness and thoughtfulness that local fishermen did not take retaliatory action against Greenpeace on the high seas, but rather allowed Greenpeace to move on after the obvious failure of its media campaign, no doubt attempting to top up its coffers from around the world.
As far as the effects of changes on Australian fishermen are concerned, the emphasis of the fish stocks agreement is on reasonable cooperation. As such, Australia will be obliged to participate in cooperative enforcement on the high seas including the boarding of vessels fishing in areas covered by the relevant RFMO and the taking of appropriate action where management measures appear to have been breached; to license all Australian vessels operating on the high seas and require maintenance of catch records and the like; to investigate suspected transgressions of RFMO measures by Australian vessels; and to prevent the vessels convicted of RFMO violations, but which have not complied with sanctions, from continuing to operate in that area.
Of concern to the fishing industry has been the potential implementation costs of these changes. I understand that essential costs are likely to total $3,348,262—I apologise for not using the cents—with the bulk of that expenditure being annual in nature. I further understand that 95 per cent of these costs are to be met by the government including, for example, membership fees for RFMOs, staff and travel costs, et cetera.
Optional costs of $1.828 million have been earmarked in the regulatory impact statement, with around two-thirds of this potential cost funded by the government for patrolling functions. Where management measures of this type are likely to directly benefit industry operators, costs will be recovered. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,1999-10-13,"—I have pleasure in speaking to the debate of the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . As has been stated earlier in the debate, there are two main purposes to this bill. The first is to provide for more effective enforcement against foreign vessels and foreign nationals engaging in illegal fishing within Australian waters and the second purpose is to implement a range of legislative measures that will allow Australia to ratify the fish stocks agreement and to participate in regional fisheries management organisations under the fish stocks agreement. The fish stocks agreement regulates control of fisheries which extend outside the Australian exclusive economic zone and into the high seas for the protection of fisheries known as straddling stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.
Some might ask why I, as the representative of the electorate of Scullin, which is not renowned for its large fishing fleets, have an interest in this piece of legislation. One cannot go to the Plenty River or the Merri Creek and find trawlers at wharves, unlike the member for Grey. My interest in this piece of legislation is that it is an important piece of legislation because it is an illustration of something that has been a bit of a buzz cry throughout the 1990s, and that is the notion of ecologically sustainable development.
Really, we can have no clearer example in a global sense of the way in which a natural resource has been exploited—and perhaps to a large extent overexploited—than in the world's fisheries. That is not to deny what the honourable member for Grey said on behalf of those that are involved in the fishing industry in his electorate that those directly involved in the industry are not unaware of the need to have proper practices.
If we look at some of the examples thrown up by this piece of legislation, we see that we have a phenomena where, because of changing practices in the way that fishing practices were carried out, some of the fishing stocks in shallower waters were exploited and to some extent put out of existence due to the use of long-line trawling. Those involved in the fishing industry were able to go to stocks that were in deeper waters.
One of the classic examples of this phenomena is the orange roughy, whose scientific name is Hoplostethus atlanticus. Those fishing stocks can be anything from 800 to 1,200 metres 
 below the surface. This has been a clear example of where new technology has made available new fishing stock. It was a fishing stock that was very popular and quite marketable. For instance, when doing some research for this speech, I surfed the net for items on orange roughy and ended up with bookshelves of recipes on how to use orange roughy. That is a reflection that the Internet still remains predominantly an American technology in the English language and that orange roughy has been a very popular fish in the American market.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 11.02 a.m. to 11.14 a.m.
—Before the suspension I was talking about the time when orange roughy started to become a fishing stock that was being commercially exploited. At that time there was not a realisation of the nature of orange roughy and there was not sufficient knowledge about the life cycle of orange roughy. In the early nineties scientists became suspicious that what was in fact happening was that the fishing practices being used were very rapidly diminishing the stock.
On 30 August a Four Corners program, which I wish to refer to later in a different context, covered the situation at St Helens in Tasmania when the orange roughy became a commercial prospect. The words of the reporter were:
In Australia the gold rush began a decade ago when the first breeding ground was found at St Helens off Tasmania.
The way that fishing stock was exploited was just like a gold rush. People were rapidly going in there and, in this case, trawling up the fish—just as they would in a gold rush where the gold would have been dug up—as if there were no need to worry about what would happen in the future.
That fishing stock lasted for only a couple of seasons because the trawlers were just queuing up, dropping their nets, filling them and going back to port—a rapid turnover. Regrettably, it was a situation in which the fish were coming ashore at such a fast rate that the catch could not even be processed, and much of it went to the tip. At about that time there was a suspicion about the age of the fish that were actually being caught, and it was decided that there was a great need to look at the situation to better understand why the stocks were diminishing at such a great rate.
Of course now it is known that orange roughy reach maturity at about 30 years of age and have been found to live for 150 years or more. The problem was that the average age of the catch was about 60 years. So with such a long time to reach maturity, there had to be greater care in the way in which those fishing stocks were being exploited. Because of this better understanding, especially in Australia, the industry was quite open to government efforts to ensure that sustainable practices were put in place in the way in which the Australian fishing industry went about the exploitation of orange roughy stocks.
The pressure is felt when fishing fleets from other countries decide to pursue the same fishing stock. As we have said, this piece of legislation tries to deal with that on two grounds. Firstly, where these stocks are clearly in Australian waters, this piece of legislation is to strengthen the measures that can be taken to prevent fishing fleets from other countries engaging in that type of poaching.
Secondly, the other difficulty, which is exemplified by orange roughy, is where the fishing stock is either in the high seas or actually straddles the Australian fishing zone and the high 
 seas. This is termed `straddling stock'. As has been said, if you take it at first glance, the notion of a straddling stock can be easily understood. One of the real problems in a very defendable, technical sense is being able to define what a straddling stock is and therefore getting the protection of the international agreements.
Certainly, endeavours have been made. In that Four Corners program late in August there was an indication that there was a dispute between our government and the New Zealand government about whether a definite straddling stock existed in the South Tasman rise. Studies that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority rely upon indicate that, in the South Tasman rise, it is a straddling stock. It is a discrete fishing stock. It is thought that what happens is that the juvenile fish congregate inside the Australian fishing zone and the adult fish then move to the outside of the zone to spawn. In fact, what we have is a phenomenon that is occurring within a discrete fishing stock which straddles the boundary.
We have tried to put protection in place through an agreement of the Australian and New Zealand governments. As I understand it, that was by way of a memorandum of understanding which I think has lapsed. I hope that the minister might be able to assist me by clarifying the position when he sums up. It would seem that because the New Zealanders want to try to get a greater share of the action they may be playing a bit hard, but we have to understand it in the context that they are going through the same phenomenon that everybody else is—that is, that within their own waters the stocks are diminishing and they want to get access to stocks that will enable them to have a viable industry.
I certainly think that orange roughy is a case where, by using proper science, there is a better understanding of the phenomenon of this fish, not only as a species but as a commercial product. There is a better understanding of what is required to ensure that if that fishing stock is exploited, it is done in a sustainable way. Because of the long length of time for orange roughy to reach maturity, that is a difficult task and the quotas have to be fairly harsh. The Australian industry has shown a willingness to cooperate in this. If the stock is wiped out, the Australian industry will have access to nothing, so it is really quite happy to be involved in something that is based on fact and is able to be sustained.
The other matter covered by the international agreement is the migratory fish stocks, and a clear example of that is the southern bluefin tuna. Australia took out a case against the Japanese so-called experimental fishing and had success at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea with an 18 to four decision on 27 August out of Hamburg, Germany, that granted the provisional measures sought by Australian and New Zealand. This was a fairly positive step forward, and it is something that we should welcome because it is an indication that measures put in place by international agreements can have some success.
The tribunal upheld the submission of Australia and New Zealand that this experiment was in fact a thinly disguised ploy by the Japanese to take more than its quota of what is very much a threatened species. The decision of the tribunal is now before a dispute resolution process that has been triggered by the agreement under the provisions of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. Many observers have made the point that this is a key test of the new tribunal's powers in these matters.
By way of an aside, I acknowledge that so far in this case the Australian government has properly resourced the efforts. I think that is reflected by this success, and I hope that that resourcing continues. But I do have some concerns, and I want to raise what is an unrelated example with regard to the World Trade Organisation. A firm in my electorate, Howe Leather, 
 has been involved in an ongoing saga over American automotive leather interests in trying to determine whether the type of assistance that the Australian government has given to Howe Leather comes within WTO guidelines. I have made the observation in the past that I have some concern that Australia is not pursuing these cases as determinedly as it should, perhaps within the tribunals. I know there has been a great deal of diplomatic effort—and I acknowledge that in the Howe Leather case—but sometimes we have to show that we are fair dinkum, as we have in the case of the southern bluefin tuna, in going into the tribunals and using them to get a determination.
As I said from the outset, my interest in this piece of legislation is because it is a clear example of where, if people sit down and go through the facts and do the proper science, environmental and industry concerns can be adequately covered. It is a recognition that in any industry the players in that industry will do the right thing by the environment because, as I have said in many of these arguments, it is in their best interests. I acknowledge that the honourable member for Grey feels aggrieved when environmental groups overstep the mark in their reaction to what the fishing fleets from his electorate are doing, and that, perhaps, is inappropriate. But having said that, I think we also have to understand that there is a growing awareness amongst the public of behaving in a proper way because of the need to protect the renewability of, in this case, the fish stocks.
For instance, Greenpeace in America have suggested that if the American public were educated to realise that orange roughy is such a threatened species, perhaps that could have an effect. In some of the literature I saw they gave the example that the American public would not eat rhinoceros because it is acknowledged that the rhinoceros is a threatened species. Perhaps we really have to educate people that in some cases there are many fish species in the same boat.
I noticed—I think it was World Ocean Day—a piece in the Age earlier this year where there was a list of fish, giving the names which they are retailed under, and suggesting that the public should think twice about whether they really wanted to use those as food products.
I think it has been made clear by the number of questions that have been raised on behalf of the opposition by the shadow minister that we support this piece of legislation. We see that it is a fairly important piece of legislation. I think that this is an area where public awareness is required. I am a great defender of the concept of the Main Committee but, in this case, even though this is a non-controversial piece of legislation, it is probably the type of legislation that by being debated in the main chamber would be given the proper eminence it should have.
In conclusion, I have just remembered that there was a point about the Four Corners program that I wanted to mention. Whilst I thought that it was a very good program for at least raising the issue and making people aware of what was going on, I was a bit saddened when I then read in the AFMA's newsletter that perhaps Four Corners could have been a bit clearer about an incident it highlighted on the South Tasman rise towards the end of June and in early July. What the Four Corners program did not highlight, which the AFMA newsletter does, was that the four vessels in that fishing zone finally left on 19 July. In the case of the South African vessels, negotiations—at, I presume, governmental level—led to the cancellation of the high seas fishing licence of the South African vessels, and the Belizean-flagged vessel was actually deregistered. So I think that we have to give credit where there is at least some action taken.
In the 19 days that they were probably in that zone, I know that they could have done a great deal of damage because they were fairly large trawlers and they were taking about twice as much as the annual Australian quota. So I am not saying that Four Corners was wrong in highlighting it, but I think that what we have to do is to say, `Some people might say that we are toothless tigers in this regard, but there is action being taken.' This piece of legislation will definitely strengthen that action and I support it.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,1999-10-13,"—in reply—I thank members who have contributed to the second reading debate on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . It is obviously a bill whose time has come in that there is a lot of community concern about these issues. As the honourable member for Scullin, who has just concluded his remarks, mentioned, the issues that this bill addresses have attracted a great deal of community attention in recent times, and rightly so. Australia has the third largest fishing zone in the world. Naturally, therefore, a lot of that zone is isolated and it has been easier for people to make illegal use of unregulated fisheries. It is a real challenge for Australia to adequately supervise such a large fishing zone.
In addition, the honourable member for Scullin raised the matter of our lack of knowledge in many instances about the extent of stocks that are available. He referred to orange roughy as being potentially an endangered species. The reality is that, having regard to the very deep sea fish stock, orange roughy was hardly heard of a decade or two ago until its eating qualities became known. I suspect that, because of the nature of its habitat, we still do not know very much about the extent of orange roughy stocks in the world. That is all the more reason why we need to take appropriate action to preserve orange roughy, southern bluefin tuna—whatever the stocks may be. They are an important part of our environment and they are also an important part of our economy.
Because we have significant fish stocks within Australian waters, they have tended to become an attraction to vessels from other parts of the world, including vessels from flags of convenience nations. It is therefore very important for us as a nation to have appropriate international regimes in place to address fish stock management issues.
I refer briefly to a couple of the matters raised by a number of speakers, including the orange roughy arrangements and the current state of negotiations with New Zealand for future management of the South Tasman rise. Negotiations have been continuing with New Zealand to renew the memorandum of understanding for that particular area. The negotiations have been progressing cooperatively. New Zealand Minister Luxton was due here next week and it was our hope to reach finality on those matters. The New Zealand election has now intervened and he may well not be coming. That will put some pressure on those negotiations, because clearly we need a new MOU in place in time for the next potential fishing season. That is something that we need to work on very promptly indeed.
As the honourable member for Scullin said, there is a fair bit about the orange roughy south Tasman rise story that we perhaps do not yet know. We are also having discussions with South Africa in relation to this matter. They have also been cooperative. But it is our view that the South Africans have information which would be very helpful to us in pursuing investigations in relation to the south Tasman rise issue. We are keen for South Africa to give us that sort of information, because I think that there are further chapters in this saga that could be written and which would be helpful to us all in regard to the future management of these areas.
With respect to the southern bluefin tuna, we have had interim success in the tribunal in relation to our dispute with Japan over what they euphemistically call `experimental fishing'. I am not quite sure what the actual experiment is. Some have suggested that the experiment is to see how many you can take before there are none left, and that is obviously not an acceptable position for us. There is obviously sensitivity about this issue. We are having a number of cooperative discussions. There are, however, disputes between Australia and Japan over interpretation of the decision. We are endeavouring to reach a satisfactory conclusion to those matters. Again, we want to ensure that the stocks are preserved so that they are available for future generations. They are in high demand. The southern bluefin tuna is a very important fish, particularly as far as the Japanese are concerned. It is in their interests, as well as ours, to ensure that these stocks are preserved and managed in a sustainable way.
There is considerable interest in Australia's deep-sea fishing resources and we have a particular responsibility to move towards managing those resources effectively. This particular bill will strengthen Australia's powers. It provides for securing fish resources for Australia through two particular initiatives. The first, dealt within schedule 1, has measures for more effective enforcement against illegal foreign fishing operations which are making incursions into the Australian fishing zone. This will also provide greater deterrence for those seeking to take fish from within our waters.
However, there are a range of other fish management issues that are particularly important. The straddling stocks and highly migratory fish stocks cannot be effectively dealt with just by Australian law. Schedule 2 of this bill has measures to implement the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. This agreement will provide a great deal of international support for better management of highly migratory fish stocks, both those that are fished within our waters under national jurisdictions and those on the high seas. As the member for Scullin reflected in his address, there are sometimes arguments as to whether or not a stock fits into one category or another. We have no doubt on the science that the orange roughy on the south Tasman rise is a migratory stock. I think New Zealand's argument on that score is scientifically utterly threadbare. But there are occasions when there is legitimate dispute on these matters and that is why the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement will be an especially powerful tool.
This legislation increases deterrence by providing greater certainty that an offending vessel will be forfeited, that higher fines will be imposed and that there will be greater expediency in dealing with apprehended foreign fishing vessels. These measures were developed particularly as a result of the experience in apprehending a vessel poaching Patagonian toothfish in the sub-Antarctic Heard and McDonald Islands areas and also from the apprehension of significant numbers of boats to Australia's north.
The case in the Antarctic waters was again a well publicised example and demonstrates how difficult effective policing can be. When you have to travel a very long way, over several days, to actually apprehend the vessel it has to be done with equipment that is capable of making such a journey. It needs to be done obviously in secrecy to make sure that the vessels do not abscond in the time that is available for us to reach those sorts of destinations. In the Antarctic Heard and McDonald Islands area our success in that regard was somewhat mitigated when the law proved to be not adequate to enable us to in fact impose the maximum possible penalty, including forfeiture. These amendments will certainly be an aid in that regard.
The measures in schedule 1 enable action against illegal operators who would otherwise undermine our efforts to substantially manage fish stocks in our fishing zone. Schedule 2 on 
 the other hand provides for the cooperative management with other countries that are fishing possibly the same stocks on the high seas. They are consistent with international law and reflect Australia's strong commitment to using all possible avenues to safeguard the sustainability of fisheries.
I would also like to draw attention to the recent success that we have had in the international tribunal on the laws of the sea as I think this particular judgment highlights that there is a capacity to use the international processes to achieve worthwhile outcomes. I know there are some—and this was almost implied on the Four Corners program as well—that suggest that Australia should mount a naval operation out into international seas and basically act like pirates. Even if the cause may be noble, the morality and the legal jurisdiction for that is certainly questionable. I think it is more important for us to achieve satisfactory international agreements which enable us to achieve the desired results in an appropriately cooperative way.
Those of course are not the only initiatives that the government is taking in relation to ensuring better management of our fish stocks. We are members of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and we are working with a number of nations involved in the fisheries in the southern and western Pacific to better manage fish stocks, which, of course, in that area are largely migratory in nature.
There is currently another officer in Rome at the FAO working on a project looking at the scope and nature of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing as the basis for the development of an international strategy to combat this sort of activity. We are also working in a number of other fora to endeavour to achieve a more satisfactory outcome and better manage fishing stocks.
Our ocean policy covers the work that we are doing through the commission for the conservation of marine living resources to develop a trade certification scheme to better identify legally traded toothfish product; the work that we are doing through the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna to develop a product certification scheme for the trade of FBT; our ongoing action in the Tribunal for the Law of the Sea; a $16.3 million commitment to surveillance and an enforcement program in subAntarctic waters; and our work with other countries to ensure that the issues of fishery subsidies are discussed in the new round of world trade negotiations. I think these will all help to lead to a fairer and better managed system of international fisheries.
I thank members for their contributions to the debate. I acknowledge the cooperation and the support of the opposition and that of the minor parties in the other chamber for this legislation. I commend the bill to the House. It will advance foreign fishing enforcement measures and enable Australia to ratify the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. I think that will provide real benefits to the conservation of marine resources in Australia and also the future viability of Australia's very important fishing industry.
