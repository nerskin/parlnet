"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—I move:
That requested amendment (1) be not made.
I am pleased with the progress of the legislation to establish the new Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme. I wish to thank honourable members and senators for their contributions to the debate, especially the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, Senator Sandy Macdonald, and all members of the committee for their contribution. Passage of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 2003 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003 will enable the government to carry through its commitment to have the new Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme fully operational on 1 July 2004. This is a short time frame, and the cooperation of the Senate and the House of Representatives in progressing this legislation has greatly assisted the government to have the scheme in place on time to meet the needs of the serving members from that date. I am also grateful for the effort of the staff of the Senate committee secretariat, especially over the Christmas period, to keep the report and the legislation on schedule. The absence of a minority report on the bills was welcome. The recommendations were sensible and the government was pleased to accept them as reflections of the thinking of the veterans community and as improvements to the bills.
This legislation will put in place a framework for a repatriation system for the 21st century. Its importance cannot be overstated, and members and senators during this debate have acknowledged the significance of these bills in meeting the nation's commitment to those who serve in the defence of Australia. The strength of support given to the development of the legislation by the ex-service organisations is also testimony to its significance. This process was characterised by close consultation between the government, Australian Defence Force service members and the ex-service community.
I am pleased to note the early, in-principle support of the legislation by the opposition, subject to the detail of the legislation that emerged from the Senate committee process. The government has accepted the Senate committee's recommendations regarding entitlements for widowed partners of ADF members and review rights for members under the new scheme. As a result of these amendments, in the event that an ADF member is killed, the widowed partner will be eligible for a lump sum death benefit of $103,000, regardless of whether the member was engaged in warlike, non-warlike or peacetime service.
The government believes that a special level of entitlement for compensation benefits should continue to be available to those members who face increased risk of personal harm through warlike or non-warlike service; nor did the Senate committee demur. The lump sum provided will be in addition to the choice of a war widows pension or an age based lump sum compensation payment, comprehensive health care through the gold card, ancillary benefits, military superannuation entitlements and compensation benefits for any dependent children.
The government has also accepted the recommendation of the Senate committee that all ADF members, regardless of the nature of their service, have the option of applying to the Veterans' Review Board for review of decisions affecting them. This opportunity to present a case in the less formal environment of the VRB has, since 1994, not been available to most ADF members with peacetime service.
Other amendments will improve the operation of a return to work scheme under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill for veterans receiving the special rate disability pension safety net payment who can be rehabilitated to undertake more than 10 hours of paid work a week. It is proposed to have the option of using a modified form of the Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme, the VVRS, under the VEA. Amendments in the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill remove unintended disincentives to the VVRS, which will flow through to the new scheme. Amendments will also make it clear that those who are eligible for the special rate disability pension retain the right to certain benefits under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill, such as telephone allowance or automatic war widows pension for a spouse, even where they return to work in subsequent years. This is consistent with the provisions available under the VEA for VVRS participants.
The emphasis on rehabilitation is evident in the title of the legislation, and our aim is wherever possible to provide the support that injured personnel need to make a full recovery. However, it is not our intention to create a situation where, in seeking to return to work, any member will be disadvantaged, and these amendments address that issue. 
The government's other key amendment ensures that injured reservist members are treated equally in calculating the incapacity payments. I note the Senate committee recommended that an increased effort be made to familiarise serving members with the new scheme. I can assure the House and the defence and veteran community that we will be working in the coming months to help members and their families understand the new arrangements. (Extension of time granted)
Turning now to the Senate's requests, the government is pleased to accept them with the exception of the request to redefine `partner' to recognise same sex relationships for the purpose of benefits and entitlements. Existing ADF policies enable the provision of a range of employer benefits and entitlements to couples who are either married or living in ADF recognised de facto relationships. These policies specifically exclude couples cohabitating in same sex relationships and rely on the Marriage Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. 
For the purposes of both the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits, the DFRDB, and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, the MSBS, a spouse is defined as a person of the opposite sex to the member. The Department of Veterans' Affairs does not recognise same sex relationships. The Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 describes a member of a couple as being a person of the same sex so that neither pensions nor bereavement payments are payable to a same sex partner in the event of a death of a member or a retired member. The Department of Family and Community Services does not recognise same sex domestic relationships. Members of same sex relationships are unable to claim the same level of allowances and payments as their heterosexual counterparts. The legislation in each of these instances reflects government policy, which is to acknowledge the primacy of heterosexual relationships as the basis of the family, the most basic unit in our society and one which the government recognises and will continue to strengthen and encourage. I thank the House. ",REPS,<title>MILITARY REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,4,1
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—The Labor Party support the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 2003 and the next bill we will be dealing with, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003, and the amendments made by the Senate. There are of course some unsatisfactory elements to the legislation, and we know that the ex-service community is not entirely happy. But, overall, the bills are beneficial, especially for serving members of the ADF. At the same time, we believe that veterans' interests have been largely protected. Overall, the rationalisation of military compensation into one scheme has to be a good thing in the long term, but we believe there are still many jagged edges. There are a number of issues about which we remain concerned, so we will be watching the bills' operation very closely. 
I must say that we are pleased at least to see the policy on war widows sorted out. All widows of Australian Defence Force personnel will now be treated the same. While compensation for the loss of a loved one can never be enough, this package is a significant improvement. We thank, therefore, those Liberal senators who came along with the ALP and overturned their minister's discretionary model. 
The fact that there has been a win on this issue can be pretty well entirely credited to Kylie Russell. Kylie Russell is a young woman who lost her husband in Afghanistan. I have immense respect and regard for this gutsy lady. She was not asking for anything for herself but, in the best traditions of the Australian heritage of mateship, she put her hand up to fight for improvements for others. The fact that there has been movement in this area can be entirely attributed to the gutsy performance of this young lady. She campaigned publicly, and she received the support of the Special Air Services and the Special Air Services Association. I believe that they and other members of the defence community have much to claim credit for here.
We also recognise the government's acceptance of our view that administrative review needed to be fairer. Again, the minister's ill-considered model has been rolled, and we are pleased about that. It is to be hoped in time that others in the government ranks might also look objectively at this legislation. They might consider the needs of Australian Defence Force personnel and future veterans, rather than the blinkered view taken by the minister. 
Again, we support the legislation, but the serving and future ex-service community can be assured that the Labor Party will be keeping a very close eye on the operation of this legislation. Should the need arise and should it become evident that this legislation is not doing what the government has claimed that it will do, we will be more than prepared to intervene in their interests.

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—I would like to indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments (1) to (25) and (28) to (39) be agreed to and that amendments (26) and (27) be disagreed to. I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House first to consider amendments (1) to (25) and (28) to (39) and, when those amendments have been disposed of, to consider amendments (26) and (27). I move:
That amendments (1) to (25) and (28) to (39) be agreed to.
These amendments, which have passed through the Senate, I understand, without opposition, involve the government's response to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's report on the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003 and issues raised in the context of recent industry consultations on supporting regulations. The government considered it necessary to move minor amendments to the bill in the Senate. The amendments will strengthen the operation of key aspects of the bill. In particular, they will ensure clarity and appropriate flexibility in the operation of the new trustee licensing regime which is being introduced by the bill. They will be welcomed by industry as being responsive to their concern.
The amendments to the bill extend the regulator's existing powers to modify or exempt trustees from certain provisions in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—the so-called SI(S) Act—so that they also apply to amendments concerning trustee compliance with equal representation requirements. The amendments clarify the operation of materiality provisions relating to reporting by actuaries and auditors so that it is clear that they apply only to reporting to the regulator and not to trustees. In effect, the amendments will clarify the application of the bill in certain circumstances. They do not alter the requirements placed on trustees.

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—I move:
That amendments (26) and (27) be disagreed to.
The government will not be accepting either of these two amendments moved by Labor and agreed to by the Senate. Amendment (26) deals with the 100 per cent compensation provision, inserting a requirement in the legislation for the government to provide financial assistance of 100 per cent for superannuation losses due to fraud or theft, and the government will reject the amendment.
Under part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the minister has discretion to grant compensation for losses as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft. In exercising this discretion, the minister may grant financial assistance up to 100 per cent of the determined eligible loss. Ministerial discretion ensures that public interest considerations can be taken into account when determining the level of financial assistance to be paid in the event of theft or fraudulent conduct. Within this framework, it has been longstanding government policy to cap financial assistance provided under part 23 of the SI(S) Act at 90 per cent of the eligible loss.
Payment of less than 100 per cent financial assistance seeks to address moral hazard concerns. In particular, it ensures that fund members bear at least some responsibility for any losses and have incentives to monitor their accounts and check that funds are being managed in a prudent manner. This approach also ensures that the costs of losses resulting from theft or fraudulent conduct are shared equitably between members of funds who have suffered losses and other superannuation fund members through financial assistance levies imposed on all funds.
Capping financial assistance is also consistent with international practice and other government assistance programs. Comparable overseas financial assistance schemes generally limit the compensation paid through either a percentage or a monetary cap. The United Kingdom Pensions Compensation Board limits payment of assistance to 90 per cent of loss suffered except where a person is within 10 years of retirement, where 100 per cent is paid. The OECD reports that countries such as Canada, the United States and France impose caps on payments, while Japan and the UK provide a percentage based limit on compensation.
The government considers that determining the level of financial assistance should continue to be implemented using the existing arrangements in part 23 of the SI(S) Act. This will ensure that appropriate flexibility in the operation of these provisions is retained. The Senate's amendments to mandate the level of financial assistance would inappropriately limit the minister's ability to take into account public interest considerations when applying government policy.
The government will not be supporting amendment (27) to the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003 requiring defined benefit funds to report annually to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority on their financial position and requiring APRA to publish information concerning the financial position of defined benefit funds on its web site. The government considers that the current provisions provide appropriate protection to members and ensure that they have sufficient information upon which to make informed decisions about their superannuation.
The Financial Services Reform Act 2001 and associated regulation already requires information on the management financial position and investment performance of superannuation funds to be provided on at least an annual basis. This information includes audited fund accounts or abridged financial statements and details of fund reserves. In relation to defined benefit funds, trustees are also required to report to members when employer sponsor contributions are less than an actuarially approved amount. The trustee must also tell members of the consequences for the fund of the shortfall and what action the trustee will take in relation to the shortfall.
The Financial Services Reform Act also requires the ongoing disclosure of material changes and significant events to members of superannuation funds, which may include a significant event relating to solvency. In addition, members of the public may also request copies of the audited accounts of a superannuation entity. (Extension of time granted) In meeting a request, funds must also provide a copy of the auditor's report, even if this has not been specifically requested.
The introduction of further reporting requirements for defined benefit funds would impose costs on both the funds and APRA for minimal, if any, additional benefit. These costs may make defined benefit funds less attractive to employer sponsors. Labor's amendments would tie defined benefit funds up in further red tape for little or no benefit. The government is opposing the first amendment on the policy ground that it defeats an appropriate sharing of risk. We want to retain the muscle of scrutiny and accountability in the relationship between fund members and fund managers and we believe that the amendment will work to weaken that muscle. At the same time, we believe that there is already provision made for the objectives of the second amendment in the Financial Services Reform Act.",REPS,<title>SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,6,1
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—The shadow minister for retirement incomes will no doubt be disappointed by the government's persistence in rejecting his amendments. The opposition will not be holding the bill up further in pursuit of these issues when it is returned to the Senate. However, the position that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has outlined today clearly establishes a policy difference between the government and the Labor Party which we will take to the next election.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—Labor do not oppose the Migration Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 2004. We wish to reserve our position on it, pending consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The bill seeks to reintroduce into the migration legislation time limits in respect of judicial review or appeals, and to confirm the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court through the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court itself. In other words, the bill seeks to ensure the exclusion of the capacity of individuals to go to state supreme courts. It also seeks to ensure that merits review occurs prior to any judicial review.
On its face, all these matters are sensible and have as their objective fast and efficient judicial review which does not clog up the courts and which gives people procedural rights. There is certainly no difficulty with requiring a merits review prior to judicial review. In the current context, that of course requires going to the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal prior to going to the Federal Magistrates Court or the Federal Court itself. So far as jurisdiction is concerned, it is obviously sensible to retain the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts in migration matters.
The time limits again on the face of it seem sensible—28 days for lodging an appeal after the deemed advice of a migration decision is concerned, and then a further 56 days within which a court has a discretion to extend the timetable in the interests of justice. The difficulty, of course, is that these provisions of the bill essentially relate to what have become known as privative clauses or ouster clauses so far as judicial review of migration decisions is concerned. This legislation needs to be considered in the context of the High Court decision in Plaintiff S157/2002 v. the Commonwealth of Australia, which is the most recent High Court decision in respect of these matters. Without going through that case at length, it is easy to summarise the decision of the High Court in that matter as saying that a privative clause could of course be constitutional but that a privative clause could not operate in respect of decisions that were made without jurisdiction.
The rub, so far as judicial review of migration decisions is concerned, is that that requirement then imposes on the court to effectively engage in a full judicial review in order to determine whether a decision was made with jurisdiction or without jurisdiction. The privative clause issue arises from the general requirement that the parliament can only make laws subject to the Constitution. But we also have the provision of section 75(v) of the Constitution, which provides the High Court with its original jurisdiction.
So there is a clear constitutional issue here. There is also a clear public policy issue. The clear constitutional issue is whether this legislation—which is narrow in its intent and purpose—because it seeks to exclude the capacity of the High Court to entertain an appeal after the 28-day and then the 56-day period, has the effect of rendering the decision unconstitutional. In order to get over the decision in S157, the bill relates not just to decisions made under the act but to `purported decisions' made under the act. In other words, the bill seeks to get around the S157 High Court decision by saying that these time limits apply not just to decisions made under the Migration Act but to purported decisions. The phrase `purported decision' in the bill is simply a very elegantly drafted way of saying that the bill covers lawful decisions and unlawful decisions—decisions made with jurisdiction and decisions made without jurisdiction. Whilst the expression drafted in the bill may be elegant, it goes to the heart of the bill's constitutionality.
If a challenge is made to this bill on the basis of the court's decision in S157, will the bill survive? I say that because it seeks to exclude the original jurisdiction of the High Court by having an ironclad time limit within which an individual aggrieved by a migration decision can make an appeal, or request judicial review to the High Court, on the basis that the decision made was made with want of jurisdiction or was made without lawful authority. That is the constitutional point, and that is a serious point.
The public policy point is whether, as a matter of public policy, it would be a sensible thing in any event to reserve to, for example, the High Court a separate jurisdiction to enable, in extraordinary circumstances, leave to be given for an appeal to be pursued outside of the 28-day and 56-day period. There might be extraordinary circumstances which would warrant such an approach to the High Court. Clearly, that would need to be done using sensible court based restrictions, like leave, written applications, written submissions and time limits so far as the case handling is concerned. So the bill throws up that important constitutional issue—and that needs to be carefully examined—and, secondly, the public policy point of whether it might actually be in the interests of justice that some separate and special discretion be granted or allowed to enable extraordinary cases to be dealt with where they fall outside the 28-day and 56-day period.
So our suggestion is that this bill be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. That of course is a matter for the Senate, but I am sure that will occur. I noticed the other day, as I am sure the government has, that the Law Council of Australia indicated that this is a bill which the parliament should not rush to adopt. They also suggested that the bill be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. 
The minister's second reading speech makes a number of comments which on the face of them are unobjectionable, and I will read some of them into the record:
The government has grave concerns about the growing number of unmeritorious judicial review applications being made. These have led to increasing costs and delays in the judicial review process. Increased delays have encouraged many applicants to litigate to the maximum regardless of the legal merits. This is solely to delay their departure from Australia.
These concerns need to be addressed urgently. The opposition also shares these concerns and has been exploring ways to streamline judicial review of migration matters.
And that is the case; we have been exploring ways of streamlining judicial review of migration matters, which is why when the leader of the Labor Party, Mark Latham, appointed me as shadow minister for immigration at the end of November last year I made the point, in some of my initial remarks, that we would respond favourably to any suggestions that the government made in this area if they were sensible and positive suggestions. I made that point because the government, unfortunately, has failed over a number of years to really adequately address the issue of timeliness of judicial review and appeal processes for migration decisions. That has been largely, if not exclusively, as a result of the obsession of the former minister for immigration, now Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, with privative causes. That, in my view, was always problematic; it was always going to be a forlorn task. If the then minister for immigration, now Attorney-General, had invested much more time in applying appropriate court based procedures to ensure fast and efficient outcomes of review and appeals, then we would be much better placed than we are now.
I do not want to see the same well-trodden path to the High Court taken again as a result of this bill and the constitutionality of this provision. That is why it is worth while for the parliament to allow the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee to hear submissions on this point and to determine whether there is a serious concern about the constitutionality of the bill and, secondly, whether a modest or minor amendment might rescue it from that fate.
 The minister's second reading speech also makes this point:
The amendments being made by this bill to the Migration Act 1958 follow the completion of the Attorney-General's recent migration litigation review. These changes are straightforward and will have a significant impact on reducing the large numbers of unmeritorious migration related judicial review applications. The government will be announcing its response to other matters in the review shortly.
I hope the Attorney-General, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the government will make that document public. If one of the reasons for this legislation is the government's receipt of the migration litigation review report—which, it is my understanding, the Attorney-General has had since just before or just after Christmas—then the release of that report would seem to me to help a sensible public policy discussion in this area to take place, not just in the parliament but in the legal fraternity and the migration fraternity and amongst other people interested in these matters. It would be a helpful contribution. I would not want the Attorney-General not to release that report because in some way the report expressed or implied criticism of his obsession with privative clauses. He should take that on the chin. A most helpful contribution to a serious examination of the detail of this bill would be the release of the migration litigation review.
Before one gets to a judicial review of an administrative decision or a ministerial delegate's decision in the migration area, I think it is important to focus on the original decision and the merits review. Currently we have a system where the minister's delegate will make an original decision, which is subject to appeal to the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal, as the case may be. Given that in recent years most of the focus in the migration area has been on refugee matters, let me restrict my remarks to a decision by a ministerial delegate in a review by the Refugee Review Tribunal. I have made it clear privately and publicly—and I am happy to make it clear in the parliament—that it seems to me that there is a want of confidence, firstly, in the initial decision-making process and, secondly, in the Refugee Review Tribunal's review. There is also clearly a need to attend, as this bill seeks to do, to the backlog of judicial reviews that we find in the courts at the moment. That is why Labor have adopted an approach of saying that, firstly, we believe the Refugee Review Tribunal should be abolished and replaced with what we describe as the Refugee Status Determination Tribunal and, secondly, appeals from that tribunal should go to the Federal Magistrates Service, essentially by way of a one-stop shop. So you would have an effective review by the Refugee Status Determination Tribunal and then a one-stop approach as far as appeals are concerned.
Let me take those in a logical order. I have become increasingly concerned about the quality of original decisions made by the ministerial delegates in the asylum seeker area. I think one way in which the quality of those decisions can be improved is by making sure the individual asylum seeker is fully aware of the procedures which attend an application for refugee status under the refugee convention, which is why I have indicated that I believe a system of case managing individual asylum seekers will actually assist the quality of the original decision, will assist the efficiency of merits and judicial review and will also, if in the event the outcome is refugee status and settlement in Australia, assist settlement here. If the outcome is rejection of refugee status and a requirement to return to country of origin, it will make the prospects of voluntary return to country of origin better. I envisage a model where individual asylum seekers would be case managed through the process from day one.
There are a number of possibilities as to who might do that case management. I think on its face it is clear that it could not or should not be done by a DIMIA officer; there is a clear conflict of interest there. It could in theory be done by another Commonwealth officer, such as an officer of the Attorney-General's Department. It could be done by an officer of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. My own view is that, on balance, it is probably best done by non-government organisations. We have a range of organisations in Australia whose officers have become very experienced in refugee and migration settlement matters. The Red Cross is one example; the Uniting Church another. My view is that it would actually assist the quality of original decision-making processes and improve the efficiency and quality of merits and subsequent review if case management along these lines were effected from day one. That would include ensuring necessary translators, access to legal advice, access to information about welfare of family et cetera.
The second area which we believe needs to be improved is the merits review process. My own assessment is that there is an ongoing lack of confidence in the Refugee Review Tribunal. If there is an ongoing lack of confidence in an administrative body or a merits review body then there is a danger that the superior courts, the courts of review, will seek to rectify that problem at source rather than focusing on what they should be focusing on: a review which goes to error of law, want of jurisdiction or breach of natural justice.
Our approach is to abolish the Refugee Review Tribunal and replace it with the Refugee Status Determination Tribunal. That would be chaired by a person who is legally qualified. There would be a panel of three, with two community members or community representatives effectively on either side of the legally qualified chairperson. My aspiration or ambition would be to have as the legally qualified person a recently retired state supreme or federal court judge. This would ensure confidence in the tribunal. 
Insofar as the community members are concerned, in the usual way we would be looking to the appointment of publicly spirited individuals, people who want to make their contribution to public policy. I have described people who seek appointment or who are appropriate to appointment to a range of Commonwealth bodies as right-thinking members of the community who are publicly spirited and publicly motivated. I do not see any limitation on the community representatives, other than fulfilling that general categorisation. In my view, there is no need for necessary experience in this particular area. That occurs in the course of appointments to government panels or boards every day of the week.
From the Refugee Status Determination Tribunal so comprised we envisage an appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court on the basis of that effecting a fast, efficient and speedy outcome. I have to acknowledge—and I am quite happy to acknowledge, as I have done privately and publicly in different contexts—that that suggested approach has not necessarily been met with universal acclamation. I have received a range of representations from lawyers or people interested in this area, saying that a preferable approach would be to continue to pursue appeals to the Federal Court and that the focus should be on court based procedures of leave, written applications and written submissions—sensible, court based, timely procedures to ensure that there is an efficiency of review and a removal of the current backlog.
Whilst our preference is to pursue the Federal Magistrates Court option, I have indicated that, because I am open to sensible and positive suggestions in this area, I am happy to parallel track, in a sense. In addition to working on that approach of improving the quality of the original decision by a ministerial delegate, improving the standing and the quality of the merits review through the Refugee Status Determination Tribunal and then having a one-stop shop appeal to the magistrates, I have been looking at and exploring, in consultation with interested people in this area, some sensible procedures which would see speedy appeals to the Federal Court.
As I have previously indicated, the original jurisdiction of the High Court, pursuant to section 75(v) of the Constitution, does require very keen and careful attention in this area. There are a couple of extracts from the analysis of the S157 case which I think are worthy of putting on the record. They come from an article by George Williams and Duncan Kerr, entitled `Review of executive action and the rule of law under the Australian Constitution'—Duncan Kerr of course being my colleague the member for Denison, who also appeared on behalf of the plaintiff in the S157 case. In their article, which appears in 14 PLR at page 219—that is the 2003 edition—they say:
While Plaintiff S157 dealt with some fundamental constitutional issues, its outcome depended upon the application and development of statutory interpretation principles. These meant that the court did not strike down s 474 of the Migration Act. This enabled the court to develop the constitutional basis for judicial review of executive action without actually engaging in the confrontation with the executive that might have occurred if s 474 had been declared invalid. Indeed, such a battle was avoided so adroitly that, despite the court rendering s 474 ineffective in a wide category of cases and indicating that any future legislative attempts to remove the possibility of judicial review must fail, federal Immigration Minister Ruddock still felt able to claim that the government had achieved a “win” in the case. This illustrates how the decision in Plaintiff S157, like that of the United States Supreme Court in Marbury v Madison, can be seen as “a Solomonic blend of diplomacy and defiance”.
Ultimately, a decision like that in Plaintiff S157 says much about the role of the High Court in Australia's constitutional system. As in the Communist Party Case, the High Court reached a conclusion that upheld its own capacity to exercise a power of judicial review, and in doing so emphasised the centrality of its role to the maintenance of the rule of law in Australia. In Marbury v Madison, Marshall CJ stated (at 177): “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is”. In Plaintiff S157, the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ concluded with the following words (at 474):
In any written constitution, where there are disputes over such matters, there must be an authoritative decision-maker. Under the Constitution of the Commonwealth the ultimate decision-maker in all matters where there is a contest, is this court. The court must be obedient to its constitutional function. In the end, pursuant to s 75 of the Constitution, this limits the powers of the parliament or of the executive to avoid, or confine, judicial review.
That, in my view, goes right to the heart of this bill. It is that issue which is central to my concern that the bill itself may not be constitutional. The time limit imposed on the bill has the effect of seeking to exclude the original jurisdiction of the High Court, pursuant to section 75(v), and would seek to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court to review a migration decision where, on its face, the bill acknowledges that that decision could be—to use the code in the bill—a purported decision which is in reality an unlawful decision. I think there are very grave concerns that, if there is a challenge to the High Court on this legislation as it now stands, following S157 there is a realistic possibility, chance or prospect that the High Court might say that the bill seeks to exclude the capacity of the High Court, in its original jurisdiction under section 75(v), to review a decision where that decision of itself was unlawful because it was made for want of jurisdiction.
I think the Senate committee should explore not only that particular issue but also whether an amendment to the bill which left to the High Court a capacity to hear cases out of time—in extraordinary circumstances, subject to rigorous procedures—might, firstly, avoid that constitutional issue and, secondly, catch those cases where because of extraordinary circumstances an individual was on the receiving end of essentially an unlawful decision which the courts would want to sensibly review.
That goes to the heart of the issue and is consistent with the minister's second reading speech in which he said that we had indicated our concern about these matters generally and were exploring options. I do not see any great point scoring to be effected here. In my view, I have been rightly critical of the obsession of the former minister—the current Attorney-General—with privative clauses. That was always a problematic and forlorn route that he chose which has compounded the felony in this area. I am also, in my view, rightly critical of his failure—and I hope it is not yet a refusal—to release the government's migration review litigation report. That would be a helpful contribution to sensible, detailed consideration in this area.
I do not see this in any way as being a great party political matter that is going to turn the minds of the community in the coming months. I think the most important thing to do is make sure that we get it right. The important thing to do is make sure that we do respect and acknowledge the fact that, whilst we make laws through this parliament, those laws must be subject to the Constitution and, whether we like it or not, part of that Constitution is that the High Court has an original jurisdiction to review ministerial or administrative decisions. If we wanted to, regrettably, tread that well-trodden path again, which the Attorney-General has forced us to do in the past through his obsessions, we would rush this bill through without judgment or cause for thought. There may well be a modest amendment to this bill which will rescue the question mark over its constitutionality and also make sure that, in very extraordinary circumstances, someone who might be on the receiving end of an unlawful decision actually gets a go before one of our courts.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (JUDICIAL REVIEW) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—I am quite astounded that my colleague the member for Perth, in the first instance, asserts that Labor agree with the Migration Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 2004 but then goes on to give us a litany of reasons why they do not. I am surprised and disappointed that, given the obvious need for this legislation, so many causes for filibustering have been invented. But I am assured of one thing: the people of Australia have good cause to often be disappointed in their elected representatives and their performance in this place. As I go around my very large electorate, which is approximately one-third of the Australian landmass, I find that people are simply interested in their elected representatives obtaining outcomes that they believe will change situations, will right what they perceive to be wrongs in the main and give solace to those people who deserve it.
I am therefore disappointed to learn that there is such deep concern for the legalese of this situation and so little concern for the very necessary outcomes. These are outcomes that, generally speaking, the majority of Australians want to see effected as quickly as possible—that is, to reduce the inordinate period of time that people who have arrived in this country uninvited, unannounced, illegally and purporting to be refugees may enjoy our hospitality whilst going through the legal system, time and time again appealing decisions that are made in the interest of law and time and time again having the opportunity to appeal once more. They then further frustrate the people of Australia by complaining that they are held in unreasonable conditions for an unreasonable period of time before achieving what was incredibly consistently their original intent, which was to simply jump the queue as a refugee or gain great advantage for a particular family in Australia—the chosen destination by the majority of people in the world who suffer deprivation and lack of democracy et cetera.
Some 14 per cent of my constituents live in an environment that is far more difficult and far less comfortable than the environment enjoyed by refugees or purported refugees residing in detention centres around this country. I refer to my remote community Indigenous people, who do not have the luxury of meals being prepared for them each day, the luxury of air-conditioned comfort, the luxury of immediate medical service, the luxury of tailored education and the luxury of every manner of counselling and support afforded to the refugees or people seeking refugee status in this country.
—Have you ever been to a detention centre?
—One of those staunch, ill-informed opposition members inquires about whether I have been to any detention centres. He is obviously ignorant of the fact that I have the Port Hedland Detention Centre in my electorate and also the previously active Curtin Detention Centre, which I visited most frequently—and I saw people who had every facility afforded to them except their absolute freedom. I saw those people and I spoke with those people, and I understood those people when they expressed their extreme desire to wait just as long as it would take to get a permanent foothold in Australia—because that is what they want. When they are confronted with every piece of evidence indicating that the political regime has changed in their country of origin—that they are clearly under no threat; that they clearly have no reason not to be returned to their country of origin—they cling with every last fibre to the legal opportunities that are extended to them under the system of Australian law. They know full well that every day they spend in a situation where they have money, entertainment, airconditioning, security, food, health, education—all things that they are deprived of in their country of origin, I might add—they are happy to stay there, waiting out the process and just enjoying every ounce of hospitality that is afforded to them.
The people of my electorate cannot understand why we as a government simply do not get on with the job of changing the laws so as to make sure that these people, as soon as it is determined that they have no legal right to claim refugee status, are returned to their country of origin as quickly as possible. I say again that the people of my electorate are sick and tired of those in the opposition who would filibuster and create circumstances whereby that hospitality, which is absolutely taken advantage of to the extreme, continues to be extended. It is Australians who ought to be important in the minds of the opposition. It is Australian welfare for the truly needy—the underprivileged—that is needed. It is Australian jobs that are needed, not more refugee Australians to take up positions—positions that are often, for those who have not yet successfully gone through the system and are out of detention, filled by people who have no legal status, who repeatedly work in the black market and create situations that are often above the law. They are situations that we regret but seem to have no control over because a number of members of this House—less than 50 per cent of them—would thwart and filibuster and be far more sympathetic, it would seem, to those illegal arrivals than they are to the citizens of their own country.
I think being soft on border protection generally is a crying shame, and I just know that the majority of Australians want the job progressed to the point where we can pass legislation that will put an end to this filibustering. They want legislation that will close the loopholes and determine a period of time within which persons seeking refugee status and permanent residency will have to work, so reducing the time, effort and money that is spent on unreasonable claims for refugee status. There are people whose claims have been proven to be false yet, because of loopholes in the legislation, they are allowed to appeal and appeal and appeal. My people are sick of it. They want change and they want change quickly.
Therefore, this bill, which will close current legal loopholes and give some return to the original intent of the legislation, is well and truly overdue. Even though, as I said, the Labor Party purports to agree with this legislation—and then goes on to explain every reason why it should be delayed—that same opposition group proposes that our borders be softened even more. So there might be a greater number of people taking advantage of this current situation where times can be extended! We have a situation where the Labor Party proposes that the Navy be taken off the task of patrolling our borders at sea, to be replaced with what has been referred to by Minister Downer as a water taxi service—a border protection service that is so soft that a better alternative might be that we put telephone boxes on the beach.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of relevance. He is rubbishing on about a whole lot of things that are not part of the legislation.
 (Hon. B.C. Scott)—The member for Kalgoorlie may be wide in his comments, but I believe he is still relevant to the bill before the House.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I certainly declare its relevance inasmuch as this legislation will be so necessary if ever, God forbid, this nation has to suffer a Labor Party in government. With the introduction of Labor's solutions to border protection we would have an even greater number of persons seeking refugee status. If this legislation is held up by reference to Senate committees, it would of course become more important because of a greater number of persons seeking the support of the Australian legislation as it stands and is effected today.
There are many reasons for getting on with the job of introducing this legislation sooner rather than later, because we have a huge number of persons there trying to thwart the current legislation and—without justification—seek review of their status and continue to appeal. We believe the cost savings resulting from this bill will be some $7 million per annum. That is $7 million that could be spent on other things—justifiable expenditure, in areas that the people of Australia want attended to, expenditure to improve their health situations, their educational situations et cetera. They do not want to spend money unnecessarily on people who seek refuge in this country outside the guidelines of the UNHCR.
If we hold the view that the UNHCR is a group that can reasonably assess the status of individuals and whether or not they deserve refugee status in this country and we then look at the number of claimants who appeal the decisions of UNHCR and go on in an arrogant and unjust manner to look for every legal loophole that the law of this country provides we find a grossly unjust situation. I for one believe that the UNHCR does a good job and its decisions ought to be final. If we put legislation in place that reduces the number of appeals possible and reduces the amount of time that people can survive in the appeal process and the costs involved in attending to such appeals then we will have an outcome that is desirable for the majority of Australians.
After all, I believe that that is our task in this place—to right wrongs and to create laws that allow behaviour that is better and more desirable for the people of Australia. After all, this House is for Australians. It is not designed to make life easier for those who would come to this country illegally and then abuse our laws in order to prolong their period of stay. Given the importance of this amendment in making the migration review process fairer, faster and more efficient for all concerned, I therefore urge that this bill be proclaimed and commence as soon as possible. I commend the Migration Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 2004 to the House.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (JUDICIAL REVIEW) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-03-31,"—The Migration Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 2004 represents another attempt by the Howard government to divide the Australian community on immigration matters. It should perhaps be retitled the `let them rot in hell' bill or the `let them rot in prison' bill. We have just heard from the member for Kalgoorlie a statement—an assertion almost—that our desert prisons are somehow luxurious resorts where the inmates are just having a wonderful time. I suggest that the member revisit Port Hedland and other detention centres and actually sit down and talk to some of the people in them, because I have heard all manner of stories of what goes on in those places. People are depressed, they are drugged up and they are attempting suicide. They just want their freedom. It is not just about colour TVs and square meals; it is about freedom. It is about some sort of certainty. They just want to lead normal lives.
The member for Kalgoorlie has said that what we should be considering there is what is best for the people of Australia. Well, the people of Australia want us to do the right thing. They want us to take care of basic human rights. What we are doing over there in places like Port Hedland is not taking care of basic human rights. I suggest that the member for Kalgoorlie does not have a clue about what is going on in his own backyard—his own detention centre. Some of the comments he has made here today about these people are disgraceful. It is quite legal for people to seek asylum in Australia; to refer to them as `illegals' is wrong. I think we have to remember there are men, women and children over there—ordinary people just like you and me—who need to be taken care of, and we are not doing that. To then get up and criticise the UNHCR is a further indication of the disgraceful attitude of this government. We saw just last week how the government refused to adopt the UN's anti-torture protocol.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The speaker puts into Hansard a falsehood that I have criticised the UNHCR.
 (Hon. B.C. Scott)—What is your point of order?
—That I have been incorrectly represented.
—There is no point of order.
—The government's recent refusal to adopt the UN anti-torture protocol is further evidence that this government basically does not want the truth about the asylum seekers and immigration detention centres to be let out into the public, and this bill is simply going further down that path. This time, via this bill, it is quite clear that this government is seeking to reduce access to appeals by asylum seekers by the use of restrictive time limits. The purpose of this bill is to reduce the volume of migration cases brought before the courts by widening the operation of the provisions of the Migration Act that restrict access to judicial review of administrative decisions made under the act.
The Howard coalition government knows that immigration is an issue on which it is able to play the blame game and score cheap political points. The Attorney-General has claimed that immigration appeals have disastrously harmed the court system. Australia's ability to provide justice generally is, according to him, now in danger. What a load of rubbish. The government has played political chess with people's lives on this issue for far too long, and the Greens will not stand by and allow the government to undermine—with this discriminatory piece of legislation—the rights of refugees and asylum seekers once again. The Greens condemn the government for this bill. I suppose the only thing I can agree with the member for Kalgoorlie on is that he pointed out that once again, rather unfortunately, the opposition spokesman on this bill raised many issues of concern over its content and implications yet nevertheless indicated the opposition would be supporting the bill. Frankly, I am getting used to this, but as I said it is disheartening to sit here and observe the Labor Party's weakness in this area.
As their rationale, the government claim that they have grave concerns about the growing number of so-called `unmeritorious' judicial review applications being lodged. The Attorney-General even went so far as to argue that these appeals are unlawful. I suggest that the applications are both meritorious and lawful. I know that this government love to describe anything relating to asylum seekers as unlawful, because it helps them sell their flawed and divisive message to the Australian public, but I would have expected more from the Attorney-General, given that he is a lawyer himself. If a person is within their rights to lodge an appeal to a higher court, how can that possibly be considered unlawful? Such a statement by this nation's Attorney-General is completely nonsensical—and we heard the previous speaker raising the word `unlawfulness' again.
The government also claim that appeals have led to increased costs and delays in the judicial review process, but they fail to acknowledge the responsibility that they hold in this scenario. They claim the proposed changes in this bill will reduce their litigation costs by about $5 million to $7 million per year, supposedly to save the taxpayer money. But it is laughable that this government claim to be concerned about expenditure in the area of migration matters when they have so blatantly wasted enormous amounts of money on their Fortress Australia program. The Greens cannot condone people's rights being eroded simply because the government want to play the `save the taxpayer' card. We all know this government are being disingenuous when they claim to be concerned about expending taxpayers' money in this area while wasting an exorbitant amount of that money propping up an inhumane mandatory detention centre network which even extends beyond our shores.
In his second reading speech to this bill, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs stated the following with regard to the issue of the increasing use of the Commonwealth courts by refugees and asylum seekers:
These statistics do speak for themselves. In 1995-96 there were 596 judicial review applications before the Commonwealth courts, compared with approximately 6,900 in 2002-03. That is an exponential growth. As a consequence, the litigation expenditure for my department exceeded $19 million in 2002-03.
It is therefore ironic that the government are advertising the fact that this enormous growth in litigation and expenditure has only occurred since they came to power and that it is entirely of their own making—it is their fault. Last year, a government report revealed that the federal government's spending on legal services is now $243 million—an increase of $100 million in four years. This government have taken such a draconian approach to the immigration portfolio that more and more people have been forced to take action in the higher courts. The minister is right—the statistics certainly do speak for themselves, and I am glad that he mentioned those statistics in his second reading speech.
The government have created a monster and now they want to blame others for it. Most of all, they want to blame the poor unfortunate souls who are languishing in our desert detention centres—the men, women and children who, as each day passes, become more despondent and depressed concerning their ultimate fate and their treatment by this government. The government want to blame people such as Muhammad Qasim, a 29-year-old Kashmiri man who has been in Australian immigration detention centres for five years and five months; who is claiming refugee status; who has no place to go to because India will not accept him; and who just wants to get on with leading a normal life. Yet this government will not allow that. This heartless government are happy to see him rot in an Australian detention centre, which is nothing less than a jail, a prison, and deny him any avenue of escape from this torture. That is right: I use the word `torture', for the treatment of Mr Qasim by this government is nothing less than inhumane.
The amendments proposed by the government in this bill will undermine people's rights in the following key procedural elements of the migration judicial review scheme. Firstly, they will place time limits on judicial review applications; secondly, only the High Court, the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court will be able to hear judicial review of migration applications; and, thirdly, an applicant will not be able to seek judicial review if merits review of the primary decision is available. It is widely accepted that the number of matters filed in the High Court has exploded, due to the changes made to the Migration Act, under which the federal government attempted to oust the jurisdiction of the courts, particularly the Federal Court, to hear appeals on merits from the Refugee Review Tribunal.
The Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Act 1990 introduced into the Migration Act a provision of the type that is known as a privative, or ouster, clause. A privative clause in an act is drafted as a fetter on the right of judicial review by a court, including the High Court, in relation to certain decisions made under that act. The privative clause provision in the Migration Act is constituted by section 474 of that act. The only avenue for those who wish to appeal is to take their case straight to the High Court, whose jurisdiction in immigration could not be taken away totally by legislation because the jurisdiction is founded in the Constitution. Applicants who get refused in the tribunal can go directly to the High Court, seeking a constitutional writ for review. In 2001-02 there were 300 applications for constitutional writs immigration cases. In the following year, 2002-03, this had shot up to 2,131 applications.
In essence, the High Court will continue to be swamped by immigration cases, unless the federal government relents from its determination to stop refugee applicants from applying to lower courts and to stop the High Court from sending cases back to the lower courts. Section 474 of the Migration Act applies to both the High Court and the Federal Court. However, the clause is arguably of greater significance to the High Court than the Federal Court. Generally, parliament may determine the judicial review jurisdiction of the Federal Court. However, the judicial review jurisdiction of the High Court is constitutionally entrenched. While the jurisdiction is entrenched, it may be circumvented by a privative clause.
Section 474 of the Migration Act, which came into force in October 2001, says that all administrative decisions: (a) are final and conclusive; (b) must not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question in any court; and (c) are not subject to prohibition, mandamus, injunction, declaration or certiorari in any court on any account. Though no doubt it is an irritant to the Attorney-General, the parliament cannot take away the High Court's original jurisdiction set out in the Constitution. In Australia, privative clauses date back to 1904, when the Commonwealth attempted to virtually eliminate the High Court's jurisdiction to review decisions of the Arbitration Court. The court unequivocally stated that the privative clause had no effect at all on the court's constitutional rights to judicial review, sparking a political and judicial debate for the next 40 years as to the parliament's ability to circumscribe judicial review.
In the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997 the members of the minority stated that the privative clause:
... defeats the purposes for which the Federal Court of Australia was, in part, established, namely as a court designed to relieve the burden on the High Court arising from the handling of immigration law cases.
They also commented that the proposed amendments were contrary to the desired trend `towards access to justice and the expression of clearer Commonwealth law'. 
The validity of section 474 of the Migration Act was considered by the full High Court in Plaintiff S157/2002 v. The Commonwealth. In that case the plaintiff argued that section 474, read literally, ousted the jurisdiction of the High Court and was therefore inconsistent with paragraph 75(v) of the Constitution, making it invalid. In essence, the High Court held in Plaintiff S157's case that the words of section 474 could not possibly refer to challenges against rulings by the refugee tribunal on the ground that the tribunal acted outside its jurisdiction. It held that a tribunal cannot determine its own jurisdiction without oversight by a higher court. A decision would involve jurisdictional error if it related to a matter that was not within the subject matter conferred by the act. A failure to satisfy the principles of natural justice was another way a decision might involve `jurisdictional error' as it would be considered to involve an excess of jurisdiction. Ironically, the government's attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the courts has resulted in an explosion of cases which will involve complex legal issues.
Some in the House and in the public may wonder why I previously referred to a case where the plaintiff was called S157. As Crispin Hull pointed out in his article in the Canberra Times on this subject back in August 2003:
... the Migration Act does not permit the naming of people applying for protection visas—better to have you think that they are not human, but just numbers.
The government have stated that their objective in introducing the bill is to decrease delays in migration litigation while giving applicants an opportunity to challenge migration decisions. It follows the review of migration legislation, which was established by the government in 2003.
The opposition have previously called for the release of the recommendations of the migration litigation review, from which the proposals in this bill have come. I echo this call. The Australian people have the right to know what the government's plans are with regard to the review. The Greens believe that there is obviously a problem with too many migration cases appearing before the higher courts, but the seeking to further undermine the rights of asylum seekers is not the way in which to address it. I believe the opposition are planning to send this proposed legislation to a Senate committee for consideration. Although the Greens are of the opinion that this legislation is fundamentally flawed—and, as the member for Perth has pointed out in this debate, the opposition also believe that this bill is most likely unconstitutional—I nevertheless commend the opposition if they choose to take this path of action in the other place.
The minister sums up in his second reading speech by saying:
By strengthening the procedural amendments the government is removing the incentive for an applicant to pursue litigation as an end in itself—to delay their departure from Australia.
In other words, the government are, in essence, once again seeking to erode people's rights under the law in order to more successfully get rid of the people they do not want in this country due to the fact that they—that is, the government—are pursuing a key political aim. The minister's words very much reflect the words we have heard here this morning from the member for Kalgoorlie when he stated that people, in his opinion, are basically happy to stay in those immigration detention centres and that that is why they are pursuing some of these legal avenues. I can assure the member for Kalgoorlie and others that every one of those people in those detention centres would love to be out of those walls and out from behind the razor wire as soon as possible. That is something that cannot be denied.
This legalistic bill has a very clear political motive. The government have proven themselves willing to play legal and political games with this portfolio without shame and without concern for the humanity of the issue. The government's attempt at excluding parts of Northern Australia from our migration zone is an absolute disgrace, though consistent with their performance in this area of decision making more generally. The government have chosen this path because they wish to avoid judicial scrutiny and review of their actions with regard to asylum seekers; they wish to avoid or minimise scrutiny and accountability for their actions. As I said, the recent decision not to support the UN protocol on torture or to allow a UN subcommittee to visit Australia independently and visit our immigration detention centres to assess the conditions of the detainees is further proof of the government's refusal to be open and accountable about this issue. It is in this context that the government aim to yet again undermine the rights of asylum seekers. They have proven time and time again that they are not to be trusted on this issue.
In closing, I would like to point out how I was shocked to read a comment the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs made in the media recently, where she stated:
... Australia is a country that has always welcomed refugees and it is a crying shame that some in the debate over the last couple of years for their own political ends have sought to teach Australian children that their own country doesn't welcome people in need, that their own country is a racist country in terms of its immigration policy and in particular in terms of refugees.
This comment left me somewhat speechless. While I recognise that the government in recent weeks have made some good efforts to increase the refugee intake—and I welcome those recent announcements—nevertheless the issue of our detention centres and the way in which asylum seekers and refugees are treated within those detention centres is a shame and a blight upon this country. I am constantly stunned by the levels to which the government will stoop in order to maintain—
—What do you want to do? Let them all out?
—As the minister suggests, yes, I would suggest—
—That's the Greens' position.
—that the people be released into the community. I sincerely hope that the government are not given the opportunity to disgrace the Australian people any further past the next federal election with regard to this matter. We need to treat these people more humanely. In the past, refugees came to our country and they were processed for a couple of weeks and put into our communities prior to the decision on their long-term suitability—
—How many million do you want here?
—We are talking about only a thousand people. So I would recommend that the government treat this issue in a more humane way rather than in the disgraceful manner in which they are proceeding.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (JUDICIAL REVIEW) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I will speak only briefly on the substance of this legislation but will add some short remarks in relation to the legal issues that my friend and colleague the member for Perth outlined as concerning the opposition. In broad terms, no-one would object to a fair time limit being imposed on a period for which a person can bring an appeal claiming that an administrative law decision adverse to them was infected by an error that requires judicial review. The question of what is a fair time limit, however, is obviously a contentious one. The Migration Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 2004 provides for a period of 35 days from the date of a deemed receipt of the decision and then a further period of some 58 days where a court can permit—on proper grounds being shown for exceptional circumstances—an extension of that original 35 days. Thus there is a period of about three months proposed by the bill, after which no judicial review would be possible—were this bill to be passed and were it to be constitutionally valid—and no determination could be made to overturn a decision made without jurisdiction, unlawfully, in bad faith or even as a result of fraud.
The first question is whether the proposed time limits in general are fair and apt. That is a matter that ought to be considered by the Senate in its review. Thirty-five days from the date of a deemed receipt of a decision is not really 35 days because, for various reasons, the actual receipt of notification of the decision could well be after the time at which the law, as provided in the Migration Act, deems that receipt to have occurred. There will be instances emerging from time to time where a person's actual knowledge of a notification of a decision that they would wish to appeal arises at a time which would give them virtually no opportunity to consult lawyers and to prepare the necessary papers to take their matter before a court. That is recognised, of course, by the provision allowing some extension in exceptional circumstances.
However, whether or not 35 days is a practical period of time to enable a person who receives an adverse decision to take legal advice and to have his or her solicitors or other representatives prepare the necessary papers and file them is a nice point. Many legal firms do not operate so effectively as to permit that. The circumstances of many applicants are that they have no English, they may not be aware of the nature of the correspondence that they receive, they may need translation between them and their solicitors and their solicitors may be dealing with complex issues of law, perhaps for the first time. Although there are some firms which specialise in this area, many do not and would not know where to start. Whether 35 days in those circumstances is an appropriate first date of cut-off I think needs some examination. It may well be too short. Whether three months in general terms is an appropriate period to cut off all applications is similarly a matter which requires some attention.
But let us concede, for the sake of argument in this House, that in general those time lines might be thought to be apt in the large majority of cases. Assuming that, there could be no broad objection to a principle that says that somebody must bring an application within a reasonable period of time for their matter to be the subject of judicial review.
However, the constitutional question arises because, outside the general provisions of statutory entitlements that this parliament is free to create and rescind, the High Court of Australia has a constitutional responsibility given to it by section 75 of the Constitution to hear applications which claim that an officer of the Commonwealth—that is, a bureaucrat acting in the name of the Commonwealth or the minister—has made a decision in a way which would entitle the applicant to have the decision set aside as being infected by jurisdictional error. A shorthand way of explaining that is to say that if a decision is so wrong as to be void or voidable, if a decision is so in error as to go beyond the powers that the parliament has properly conferred on that decision maker, the person about whom the decision is made has a right to bring the matter before the High Court of Australia and have that issue determined. Of course, that right is a fundamental element of what we all uphold in this parliament—there are some exceptions, perhaps, but I think the vast majority of us do—as a fundamental component of the rule of law.
The rule of law is nothing more or less than saying that all administrative decision makers in this country are obliged to follow the law, and any person—citizen or otherwise—who is adversely affected by a wrongful decision is entitled to have that wrongful decision set aside by a court. The High Court has the constitutional responsibility, through a constitutional guarantee underpinned by the rule of law, to ensure that that can occur. Section 75(v) of the Constitution—inserted in the Australian Constitution by its framers in the lead-up to our movement to a federation in 1901—explicitly adopted a framework in the Constitution which remedied a defect in the United States Constitution revealed in the case of Marbury v. Madison, where it was held that the United States Constitution had not given that power to the Supreme Court of the United States. So the framers of our Constitution deliberately conferred on the High Court of Australia that right and that power—a power which has been exercised through the more than 100 years of our federation to protect citizens and noncitizens alike and to ensure that decision makers comply with the law.
So, in those circumstances, how can the High Court deal with a provision that says there is a fixed and inflexible time limit from a deemed date of receipt of a notice if an applicant comes before them in circumstances which ordinarily would merit an entitlement for review and where the High Court can see that those circumstances of delay are no fault of the applicant? In Plaintiff S157, a case that has been referred to by the member for Perth and other speakers in this House, the Commonwealth argued that a 28-day period from the date of the actual receipt of a decision could be enacted by this parliament as an absolute bar to the High Court's hearing of an application for review. Responding to that, the plaintiff in that case argued that such a provision was unconstitutional. 
The High Court did not have to address that particular argument, because it read section 474 of the Migration Act as having no effect in relation to what it called purported decisions—that is, decisions which, whilst asserted by the decision maker to be decisions made under the act, were in fact decisions not authorised by law. So the High Court said that, where a person claimed that the decision was not made in accordance with law, the 28-day period simply did not come into effect. The claim was that there was no actual decision according to law, rather a purported decision, and that the 28-day period did not apply to purported decisions.
Now the government has changed the bar on the High Court's hearing of such matters by proposing that the new provisions apply not only to actual decisions made under the act but also to purported decisions. It has not gone so far as to try to prevent review of those purported decisions because the High Court in every instance of the judges hearing the matter indicated that, were it to do so, such a law would be struck down by the court. It made it unambiguously plain that that was the case. 
The new provisions say that time limits apply not only to decisions under the act but also to purported decisions. That then means that at some stage in the future it is inevitable that an instance will arise where the court will have to consider the arguments which it did not need to deal with in Plaintiff S157. There are two issues—firstly, whether this parliament has any power to pass a law which places any restriction on the time in which the High Court of Australia can exercise its constitutional guarantee rights under section 75(v). That question was agitated in the High Court. 
The Solicitor-General was asked under what head of power the parliament had purported to act. He indicated that it would be under the incidental powers relating to various procedures of the court. That was met with some scepticism in argument by members of the court, but, as I say, an ultimate decision did not need to be made. The unhappy reception of some of the arguments advanced by the Solicitor-General might give rise at least to an apprehension amongst the Commonwealth's advisers that that is a live issue still—that is, whether this parliament can set any period at all when the High Court has an entrenched constitutional right to guarantee judicial review or whether it is indeed for the court to determine for itself the circumstances in which that authority would be exercised.
The second issue is subsidiary to that—that is, if the Commonwealth does have power, it can only have power under the incidental provisions of the Constitution. One of the constraints on the use of the incidental provisions of Commonwealth powers of legislation is that they can be only proportional to the circumstances in which the power is exercised. This is a proportionality test. This arose in Davis and the Commonwealth where, under the incidental powers, the Commonwealth made certain laws which created offences with respect to the use of Commonwealth logos in order to protect the bicentennial celebrations. Ultimately, the High Court struck down those laws as being disproportionate to the inherent power of nationhood and the proportionality requirements. So, if there is any power that would go to the right of the parliament to set limits, those limits must be proportionate. But proportionate to what? They must be proportionate to the constitutional power of the court to exercise its rule of law functions to supervise the conduct of the executive.
Because of the way in which an absolute cut-off has been expressed, I believe it is most doubtful that the High Court would regard those provisions as constitutionally valid. Why? Firstly, because those provisions relate not to the actual receipt of the notice but to the deemed receipt, so those provisions provide an absolute cut-off to a person who has not in fact been notified of a decision. A deemed receipt may never be received. After the whole period in which a person has been deemed to receive a notice, even if he or she can show that they never actually received the notice, the Commonwealth wishes to pass a law which says even in those circumstances, you cannot be heard to complain that the decision which now affects you was made invalidly. I suspect that the High Court would say that that is an invalid and disproportionate way for the Commonwealth to legislate which offends the responsibility under the Constitution, given to the High Court by section 75(v).
Secondly, you can imagine many examples, even where a person has actual receipt, where it would be manifestly unfair to apply such an absolute deadline. For example, assume that somebody receives a notice but then suffers a car accident and is hospitalised through that period where the cut-off comes into effect. Is it in those circumstances apt that our law prevents that person from agitating subsequently on the legality or otherwise of a decision which adversely affects them? To take another example: let us assume that the decision was actuated by malice and fraud and that is later discovered, a fact that could not have been known to the applicant even if he received notice—for example, if a decision maker takes a bribe or acts in a way which is contrary to law, criminal and adverse to the person—and the circumstances which give rise to that being known emerge only after three months. Is it to be said that the High Court cannot then pursue an entitlement to review that decision which has adversely affected the person? For those kinds of circumstances I think it would be almost inevitable that, unless the Senate includes a provision that enables the High Court to examine such extraordinary and exceptional circumstances and to have a filter—albeit perhaps a tight filter, so that the general provision is not absolute—I think it is almost inevitable that the High Court can say, `We cannot, consistent with our constitutional duty and our responsibility to uphold the rule of law, allow such laws to stand as they are proposed.'
I thought it worth while to make those general observations because this matter will need further attention. I make one other point before conclusion. This act now is a mess. It is completely incomprehensible to any lay reader. It contains a myriad of provisions now which do not mean what they say. When the government brought in its first attempt to remove judicial review—namely, section 474—I spoke opposing that legislation and, in this House, the opposition opposed it on the basis that the provision was unconstitutional and that this parliament should not pass legislation knowing that it does not say what it means. Now, compounding the problem, we have section 474, which does not mean what it says, and a complex provision which says that, when you read section 474 and apply it to other decisions in relation to the time limits, the provisions apply to purported decisions. Try and read that as a sane citizen coming to the act for the first time and not an expert in migration law. Your average solicitor, lawyer or barrister, let alone your average parliamentarian or refugee claimant with limited English skills, would be completely lost.
This legislation is an abomination in terms of its comprehensibility and accessibility. It defies all the rules that we in this parliament have established for ourselves about trying to express ourselves in plain and simple English. It is a product of repeated efforts which had no prospect of success by a minister obsessed with an attack on the High Court of Australia in order to deny it its proper function and constrain the lawful entitlement of every citizen and noncitizen to ensure that administrative law is conducted according to law. Whatever the fate of these particular proposals in relation to time limits—and I am certain that they require amendment and that some mechanism is required to address those very exceptional circumstances where an absolute time limit would be held unconstitutional by the High Court—the act itself needs dramatic rewriting. It is simply not appropriate to have such fundamental legislation affecting the rights of persons who seek asylum in our country—and, indeed, section 474 and the other provisions that apply also to other migration decisions—expressed in such a turgid way.

"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—in reply—The member for Denison is well known in this place for not understanding time limits—his 10-minute speech went for 20 minutes—but it was a delight to hear him contribute to this debate. I want to thank all of the members for their contributions to the debate. Let me say formally for the record that the purpose of the Migration Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 2004 is in fact to reinstate the original intention of the judicial review procedural provisions which were passed by this parliament in September 2001. The simple and clear intention of the bill is to restore the original provisions which relate to procedural requirements for judicial review: firstly, those on time limits for judicial review applications; secondly, that only the High Court, the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court will be able to hear judicial review of migration applications; and, thirdly, that an applicant will not be able to seek judicial review if merits review of the primary decision is available.
This bill also provides a discretion for the courts to extend the time limits beyond the 28-day period for a further period of up to 56 days when it is in the interests of the administration of justice. The effect of Plaintiff S157/2002 v. Commonwealth of Australia in the 2003 High Court decision is to render ineffective the procedural provisions. As a result, courts have had to undertake complete judicial review of all migration decisions to determine if procedural restrictions apply. Around 40 per cent of current cases are now filed outside of time limits, with some lodged up to six years after the decision under challenge. Obviously, this is an enormous cost to the Australian taxpayer. Some people have been abusing the system of judicial review in this very fair set of circumstances that we extend to all comers in order to keep themselves in Australia, as that member for Kalgoorlie said in his contribution.
Let me take up the challenge of the member for Denison, who said the whole thing is too complex and very hard for the average person to read. He is a learned lawyer, and I suspect that he will have a tape of his contribution today made for some potential job application after parliament, as he brought his plaintiff lawyer style to the debate. I am not a lawyer, so let me just put it very simply: the bill will reinstate the original intention of the procedural provisions in relation to judicial review. The original provisions which the bill reinstates are: there are time limits—in other words, there is a process by which you can seek a review and you have to do it in a timely fashion for these judicial review applications; the High Court, the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court are the only courts that can hear the judicial review of those applications; and, of course, if there is a merits review available it should be sought in the first instance. This is all about restoring certainty and efficiency in resolving migration review applications.
The bill is necessary to address the unprecedented rise in migration legislation, with the associated increased costs and delays. Much of this rise is due to unmeritorious judicial review applications. In the S157 case, the High Court found that decisions with certain errors were not privative clause decisions. This means that the existing procedural provisions will have no practical effect as a court must undertake a full review of the claims challenged to determine if the procedural restrictions apply. This bill will in fact reinstate the original intention of key procedural provisions in relation to judicial review of migration decisions, including time limits for submitting applications.
Because the procedural restrictions have no effect, an increasing number of cases have been filed out of time or in an inappropriate court—as I said, in some cases up to six years have elapsed. In 2002-03 there were approximately 6,900 applications for migration judicial review before the court, and in this same year 99 per cent of constitutional writs before the High Court were migration matters. This rise is in fact in part due to the larger volume of cases being considered by the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. It is also due to a greater number of applicants seeking judicial review to delay their removal from Australia long after receipt of their visa decision. This is a particularly attractive option for some litigants, given that seeking judicial review through all the currently available courts can delay a person's removal for many years.
At the end of the day, the government is yet again acting particularly in the interests of those who have come to Australia through the process. The one thing that seems to have been forgotten by the Australian Labor Party in their contribution to the debate about this matter, and indeed in the broad migration debate when it comes to refugee asylum seekers, is the fact that the many people who do come through the system do not need to be tarred with the brush of the few who try to get around the system and then, worst of all, use the system to delay the inevitable—that is, their departure from Australia. These procedural restrictions need to be reinstated urgently before the judicial review system becomes even more seriously overloaded. The government is greatly concerned about the increasing numbers of applicants that are filing unmeritorious judicial review applications. This has greatly increased costs and delays in the judicial review process.
The member for Denison and the member for Perth also talked about matters to do with the constitutionality and legality of this. Let me say for the record that the Australian Government Solicitor has been consulted extensively throughout the drafting of this bill. The AGS was consulted on how to make the time limits and jurisdictional provisions work. The AGS advised us that the best approach was to make amendments which split the definition of `privative clause decision' into two, with the second part of the definition picking up `purported decision'. The AGS recommended that extendable time limits be put in place for the High Court and also recommended a 28-day time limit that could be extended for a further period at the discretion of the court. The AGS suggested that a further 28 or 56 days might be appropriate—we are talking here about taking it out to 84 days.
Finally, the AGS was asked to advise on the move from actual to deemed notice provisions before the High Court. This means that under this bill a person will have to make an application from the point that they are deemed to have been notified of the decision, and under the Migration Act this is usually seven days from the decision being made, to take account of postage. So, at the end of the day, we are actually looking at anything up to 91 days if you add it all together from the moment that that decision was made. The AGS advised that, given the onerous length of time for applicants to seek an extension of time, the deemed notice of provisions can be relied upon across the federal courts. These time limits are also consistent with other matters that appear before these courts.
At the end of the day, the protestations from those opposite about this matter again underscore that they are very happy about lining the pockets of lawyers and not dealing with the fact that it is the Australian taxpayer that is footing the bill for the delays that these lawyers are bringing about through overuse of this judicial review. The government believes that the restoration of the procedural requirements will reduce the number of migration judicial review applications by approximately 25 to 30 per cent. This will also mean a saving in the Australian government's own litigation costs of between $5 million and $7 million per year. As I mentioned when introducing this bill, the amendments do not impact on existing grounds for judicial review or change the basis of the lawfulness of a decision—they are only procedural in nature. The simple and clear intent of this bill is to uphold the procedural limitations on judicial review in order to ensure the efficient and effective cooperation of our judicial review system.
Finally, I would like to deal with a couple of the other points raised by the opposition. The member for Perth claims that we should be focusing on reform of the merits review rather than judicial review. He claims there is an ongoing lack of confidence in Refugee Review Tribunal decisions which has contributed to the rise in judicial review applications. The RRT is not the problem. There is no basis for claiming that merits review is the problem. The statistics confirm that most RRT decisions are upheld by the court. In fact, there has only been something in the order of a three per cent departmental loss or withdrawal in this massive year, when there were some 3,662 cases that appeared before it.
The opposition's proposal to replace the RRT with a tribunal combining primary and merits review processes will simply lead to more cases being litigated in the courts over longer time frames, hence my accusation that they are good at lining the pockets of the lawyers. Not being a lawyer, I often think that, if it is good for the lawyers, it cannot be good for the general society. The clerks will take offence at that, but at the end of the day we have to measure how excited we are about more money going to lawyers from taxpayers as against getting on with the job of giving people the opportunity to put an appeal forward and have that appeal heard. The opposition's proposed new tribunal will add to the workload, cost and time frame for decisions.
In summary, I note that the amendments contained in this bill will ensure that the parliament's original intention in relation to judicial review is reinstated. As I foreshadowed when introducing this bill, these amendments complement the findings of the Attorney-General's recent migration litigation review. The government will respond to the rest of that review over coming months. This bill provides a good, commonsense approach that is fair all round. I commend this bill to the chamber.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—To save time, as this is a fractured contribution to the debate, which I began two days ago, I seek leave to table an editorial from the West Australian newspaper.
Leave granted.
—I would like to briefly summarise what I was saying two days ago. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002 is necessary to the flexibility of the work force in Australia. The flexibility that has been created in the work force has produced outstanding productivity results and a better deal for workers. It has resulted in more pay and better conditions for workers. It allows for some matters to be negotiated and for the simplification of the arrangements for AWAs negotiated between businesses and workers. As I have pointed out to this House on several occasions, the proof of the pudding is in the detail: for example, in Western Australia the state sponsored EEAs, the employer-employee agreements, have been so poorly received that something like 114 individual awards have been taken up, which contrasts with, in the same period, something like 65,000 AWAs registered to individuals. It just shows what people want: the safety, protection, flexibility and the better enterprise bargaining that is given by Australian workplace agreements rather than the union-sponsored EEAs.
As I said in my previous contribution, the fact is that the Australian Labor Party will oppose this. We know they will oppose it because they have been told to by the people that put them here—their union bosses. At the end of the day, they will oppose it because, as the member for Rankin himself said after the Labor Party's national conference, Labor and unions are as one again; they cannot act without each other. If you want any further proof of this you only have to see the blue going on in Western Australia at the moment between the state Labor Party and the unions. The unions are claiming responsibility for putting different people into positions. Michelle Roberts is the state president of the Labor Party and there are different preselections that are union sponsored. Because there is fracture over some of the details with some of the unions involved, they are now saying that these preselections are in doubt. There is no doubt that the unions are controlling the people in this House.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order in relation to the relevance of these comments. The member for Canning cannot help himself. This bill is about award stripping, euphemistically called award simplification. It has nothing to do with the matters he is now canvassing and I ask that you draw him back to the substance of the bill.
 (Mr Lindsay)—I thank the member for Rankin. The member for Canning will link his comments to the bill.
—My comments are inextricably linked to the fact that the Labor Party are in here opposing this bill because they are in the control and the domain of the union movement. We know that; the member for Rankin said that himself after the national conference of the Labor Party. It is as simple as that—undeniable. This is somebody who is in a state of denial. He comes into this place and says that he will oppose every industrial relations bill that we have put up. He is on the record as saying that. Do not be ludicrous and say that we are off the subject here. We are totally on the subject because we are dealing with his comments as they relate to industrial relations matters in this House. This bill is just one of those industrial relations matters.
I want to look at the national media commentary on these workplace relations bills and the opposition from the Labor Party. But, before I go to the specifics of the national commentary, I want to say that one of the final provisions that the opposition and the member for Rankin have continued to allege is that this takes out the training component—`deskilling' I think he calls it. It is so far from the truth it is unbelievable. Since this government has been in place, we have gone from 105,000 apprenticeships a year to a number in the high 300,000s. In other words, we have almost trebled the number of apprenticeships being offered to young people in the workplace in Australia since we came to government in 1996. Compare that with Labor's record: they drove apprenticeships and training down to 105,000 per year in 1996, when we took over.
It is real skilling of the work force—not de-skilling but real skilling—when you can give young people an opportunity to train and, as a result of training in the industry that they choose, they get jobs. It is totally ludicrous to claim that there is de-skilling because it is not an award matter. This is something that is negotiated with your employer—and quite rightly negotiated, because you get a better deal when you can negotiate something rather than having the prescriptive award that the Australian Labor Party want. They want a prescriptive award because they want to maintain control. The award gives them an opportunity because one size fits all, and if one size fits all then they can control it. They do not like variables—loose ends that their union mates cannot control. That is why there is opposition here. It has nothing to do with training and prescriptions for training young people. We know that apprenticeships and training have grown; they have not diminished. We have a very proud record on that compared to the Labor Party when in government.
The fact is that, with the outlawing of workplace agreements by the state Labor government in Western Australia, what Labor say in the states is what Labor want to do federally. We know that. You only have to see what they will do in the states to see what they will do in the federal arena. The outlawing of these negotiated individual awards is an absolute disgrace because it is driving wages down in Western Australia and costing jobs. One has to look no further than the fact that in Western Australia a company called Consolidated Constructions went into liquidation—a company that had been an icon in Western Australia's building industry for years. They went into liquidation owing $10 million. They claimed quite readily that it was due largely to the interference by the CFMEU in their business and the conditions that they had given.
The involvement of unions through rights of entry granted under the state's Labor government and the harassment from people like Joe McDonald from the CFMEU have eventually driven a huge business in Western Australia into bankruptcy. Not only has this driven it into bankruptcy but it has cost something like 400 jobs, let alone the jobs of contractors and the businesses of contractors in Western Australia. That is the end result of union domination in the work force. It has crept back in Western Australia. As I said, you only have to see what they have done over there to realise what has happened. On Thursday, 4 March, the West Australian reported:
BIG WA builder Consolidated Constructions has collapsed with $10 million debts, leaving more than 400 staff and subcontractors uncertain about future work and getting paid.
The article goes on:
The collapse comes after a torrid year for Consolidated in which it has been enmeshed in contractual disputes and engaged in running battles with the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union over its policy of employing sub-contract labour.
What a sin! They wanted to employ subcontractors and the CFMEU continued to harass them. The article continues:
Consolidated has launched multiple legal actions against the CFMEU and its officials claiming they had intimidated workers at its sites ...
You need no further proof than that. And you have Joe McDonald almost gleefully saying that they have been able to do it. There is further evidence in Western Australia, particularly in the mining industry. An article entitled `Miners wary of ALP policies' in the Australian Financial Review says: 
Western Australia's biggest mining companies attacked the Labor Party's industrial policies yesterday, amid fears that a federal Labor government could centralise industrial relations and promote collective bargaining.
That is what we are talking about today—collective bargaining, because they are opposing the freeing up and simplification of awards. Collective bargaining comes from awards rather than from individual agreements. No less than BHP Billiton's iron ore president Graeme Hunt says:
The track record is very clear. We really can't afford to step backwards ... 
Another quote in the article is:
We certainly hope Labor does retain a one-on-one working contract because our whole philosophy is a direct relationship ...
There is a further quote:
WA employers were increasingly using Australian workplace agreements, direct deals between individual workers and employers, that federal Labor has pledged to scrap.
Shame! At the end of the day, you are putting in jeopardy one of the great drivers of this economy, particularly in Western Australia—that is, the mining industry. And the examples continue. Another article from the West Australian, titled `Business goes cold on Gallop', by Fran Spencer, says:
SMALL and medium-sized businesses have lost faith in Geoff Gallop's Labor Government ...
...	...	...
The February Sensis Business Index, to be released today, shows the WA Government has been deserted by the State's small and medium enterprises with support for its policies slumping 9 per cent in the three months to the end of January.
This is just more evidence. Again, in the Sun-Herald—you can see this is a good sample of articles from all around Australia—on 21 March an article by Kerry-Anne Walsh, titled `Poll finds Labor lagging on economy', said:
LATHAM Labor is lagging significantly behind the Government on economic credibility, an exclusive Sun-Herald poll of business reveals.
On every indicator, they went backwards. There is further evidence. `Latham would hurt industry in WA,' say bosses in a West Australian article on Saturday, 20 March this year. The article continues:
WA's main industry body has warned that the election of a Latham Labor government would be disastrous for the State's economy.
Chamber of Commerce and Industry spokesman Bob Pride said coast-to-coast Labor governments would severely disrupt WA's booming growth.
You can't get better than that! All around Australia, we have evidence. There was a very credible person speaking in the West Australian on 27 February: Michael Chaney—considered one of the best executives in Australia—from Wesfarmers. The article titled `Chaney blasts reform failure' says:
LEADING businessman Michael Chaney says businesses could suffer because of the State Government's industrial relations changes ...
...	...	...
... the Wesfarmers chief spoke about the Gallop Government's scrapping of individual workplace agreements in favour of the employer-employee contracts based on union-negotiated awards.
What state Labor does, federal Labor wants to do. Here we have all these eminent people from around Australia outlining just how it will hurt. The final coup de grace is an editorial in the Financial Review which is headed `Labor must pick jobs over dogma'. It says:
Let's start with Labor's promise to abolish Australian workplace agreements. Removing these has been an article of labour movement faith since formalised individual work contracts were introduced in 1997.
AWAs are a heresy to union officials because they exclude them from the workplace and deprive them of control and relevance.
Here is one of the most credible newspapers in the country—you cannot accuse it of any political bias—outlining what Labor would do if they could get hold of the award system in this country. If we had wall-to-wall Labor governments—six state Labor governments and a federal Labor government—workplace relations in this country would go back to the Dark Ages or to the dinosaur age that the member for Rankin is promoting on behalf of his Labor mates. The article continues:
... AWAs have become a symbol of waning industrial muscle that the unions, with Labor's support, are hell-bent on chopping down. Labor obediently promises to abolish AWAs if it wins office.
Compliantly and obediently the Labor Party are saying they will abolish AWAs if they win office. This is disastrous for Australia. The award system needs to be simplified to provide better flexibility and jobs for the people of Australia.

"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I am not surprised by the diatribe we have just heard from the member for Canning. I listened very intently because I wanted to hear what justification he would produce for supporting the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002. I think the only justification he gave was the notion that flexibility would be introduced by the passage of this bill.
—Read Hansard from two days ago.
—I listened intently to what you had to say and I think you should begin by acknowledging that—
 (Mr Lindsay)—Member for Throsby, I did not say anything.
—Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think the member for Canning should at least acknowledge from the beginning of this debate that the title of the bill is a gigantic misnomer. This bill has nothing to do with simplifying awards. This bill is really about obliterating the industrial safety net that the award system has provided, particularly for vulnerable workers, for a century and more. This has nothing to do with union bosses. It is about a system of conciliation and arbitration in this country that has been the envy of many countries throughout the world. It is a system that has been consistently under threat from this government. They continue to introduce bills into this chamber that reflect the archetypal Orwellian doublespeak. I thought the current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations might amend the government's ways, but all he has done is replicate the lessons that he has learnt from previous ministers. He has learnt from Tony Abbott, who was the minister prior to him, and is well taught by Peter Reith, who first introduced the notion of Orwellian doublespeak with his Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999.
The real agenda of this government is not about protecting the rights of ordinary people; it is about dismantling a system that has served this nation incredibly well and in particular has served the interests of low-paid workers. Many of them are not even in unions, but at least they know that the award system provides a safety net and a floor below which no member of the work force can fall. That has been a great thing that Australia has been able to do to protect the interests of those with the least bargaining power against rampant exploitation.
For the period of time that the Howard government has been in office, we have seen consistently, in every bill introduced in this House, a process of dismantling the system as we have known it—the system that has served the nation well. We have seen the balance of bargaining power tipped in the interests of employers and we have seen the introduction of individual contracts of employment, which are much touted by the member for Canning. We all know from our own personal experiences that people are told: `Either you sign up on the individual contract or you do not have a job.' The member for Canning should know that the introduction of AWAs in his state of Western Australia has in fact led to the most appalling outcomes for women workers. The gap in wages between men and women is growing under the Howard government, and it is accelerating at the greatest rate in the state of WA.
This is par for the course. The contribution from the member for Canning shows that he shares this government's ideological obsession with trying to reduce the protections for ordinary working people, many of whom are not unionised; trying to dismantle the powers of the commission; trying to reduce the powers of unions to defend and protect the rights of working people through collective bargaining; and trying to limit the potential of unions to take industrial action, even when that is in defiance of ILO conventions.
This bill is introduced into the House under the false title of `award simplification'. It is really part of an agenda that tries to obliterate the underpinning entitlements that exist for all working people. This comes as no surprise, because the government's real agenda from day one has been to try to legislate for a handful of minimum conditions and to leave everything else to be bargained for at the workplace level. It is a tragedy for those who do not have the capacity to bargain—the vulnerable, low-paid workers, women workers and part-time and casual workers for whom the award is the only measure of protection at work.
The introduction of this bill continues the government's award-stripping agenda. Much to the regret of working people, with the support of the Democrats the government was able to get away with its agenda to reduce the number of allowable matters to just 20. We were told then that this was all about flexibility. The member for Canning did not really address the issue of flexibility, which is much touted by the government as being the rationale for its reduction in workers' entitlements. You have to ask: flexibility for whom and at what expense?
When we first submitted these proposals to numerous Senate inquiries, I went back and wanted to put on record the words of a very eminent practitioner in the field of industrial relations Professor Isaac, who said at the time that the awards were first up for the chop with regard to entitlements. He said:
The significance of this reduction in the list of allowable matters is not merely that it reduces the role of the commission, and one may ask why this is justified, but, more importantly, that it effectively reduces the size of the safety net on which weaker sections of the work force and those that are unable to engage in enterprise bargaining rely. This group is on the safety net because it does not have the capacity to engage in enterprise bargaining or is unable to secure more favourable terms through enterprise bargaining. Close to one-third of employees are in this category and, while this group spans remuneration levels of up to $1,000 per week, it is dominated by low-wage earners, women and migrants, a large proportion of whom are part-time workers.
The tragedy of the government's attempts to further strip the awards is that the end result impacts most severely on those who have the least bargaining capacity.
What we saw happening in the first round of award stripping was that people with industrial capacity renegotiated all the lost conditions back into their enterprise agreement, and it was those without bargaining capacity who really felt the brunt of award stripping. I want to cite a couple of examples. It needs to be recognised that just under two million workers are covered by an award, so what they get at work—their wages and conditions—are what the minimum entitlements set out in the award provide for. The more you strip back those entitlements, the more you leave exposed those with the least bargaining capacity.
Let me cite one example of the impact of the first round of award stripping. As I said earlier, the commission's powers in determining what went into awards were part of the package. Not only did the government prescribe what was allowable but, in that process, it also reduced the powers of the independent umpire to determine what was fair and what was just. In the first round of award stripping, let us just look at the prevention of the right of the commission to set both maximum and minimum hours of work for part-time employees. The member for Canning would have you believe that, if you take away the right of the commission to set maximum and minimum hours of work, that is justified on the grounds of flexibility. But you have to ask: flexibility for whom? The flexibility really meant greater bargaining power for the employer, and the people who particularly lost out were those workers who relied on the award, which had previously set maximum and minimum hours of work.
So it was not uncommon in the cleaning industry, for example, where many people are low paid and dependent on just the award, to find that, whereas the award had previously prescribed their hours—so that it was not unusual for a worker to come in at 6 a.m. and finish at one, and to work the afternoon shift in the second week—this simple deletion, which was much touted because it was going to provide greater flexibility, left thousands of workers exposed to broken shifts. So, instead of regular and predictable hours of work, you had people coming into work for three hours in the morning—maybe taking an hour or more to get there—going home and then returning in the afternoon, with great disruption to their family life. And, as part and parcel of this so-called flexibility, they lost shift and other penalties that went with their previous working arrangements.
If it was not bad enough that the award could not set your maximum and minimum hours of work or that a boss could call you in for an hour, half an hour or whatever variation suited them, we also found with the first round of award stripping that the span of ordinary hours was increased. Whereas in the past nine to five represented the normal hours of work for an office worker, you could now have a span of hours that might start at 7 a.m. and conclude at 7 p.m., and every hour that you worked in that span of hours was considered ordinary—that is, without the prospect of overtime or penalty rates applying. So much for flexibility! We saw flexibility that impacted most negatively on those who had the least bargaining capacity.
The government lied to the people of Australia, because it assured working people at the time of the first round of award stripping that no worker would be worse off. You go out there and talk to ordinary working people, particularly casual, part-time or women workers or people reliant on the award system, and they will tell you that they were worse off. As far as their span of hours was concerned, they lost, because they no longer had regular and predictable hours of part-time work and they lost income because the conditions that previously applied in their award were taken away from them.
I cite that merely as one example to show that all the hype we had about award simplification really meant award stripping and that, if the government had its way, it would obliterate all industrial awards and legislate for a bare handful of minimum conditions and workers would be left out there in the marketplace to try and better that handful of minimum conditions. We now have a bill that wants to strip back awards even further. It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest, as this bill does, that awards should be stripped of such things as long service leave, skill based career paths, notice of termination and jury service—and there are a whole lot of other restrictions that would come with the passage of this legislation. It is absolutely appalling to think that this government would continue down the path of further erosion of basic award entitlements that underpin the notion of a fair go for those with least bargaining capacity in the workplace. If the government were to remove all those things, as it did with other areas in the first round of award stripping, people with industrial capacity would have the means to get all those conditions reinserted in their awards, but it is those people without bargaining capacity and without industrial muscle who would be very exposed in that process.
I want to deal specifically with one proposal in the bill and that is the removal of skill based career paths from industrial awards. This is an absolutely absurd proposition. Skill based career paths were first introduced into the award system with the unanimous support of employer organisations and the ACTU as part of a gigantic award restructuring exercise some two decades ago. Do you know why we introduced skill based career paths? It was primarily to encourage workers to undertake further training, which was to be based on approved industry training packages. We were encouraging workers to enhance their skills, their competence and their productivity, and in return we instituted skill based career paths that provided additional monetary compensation and remuneration for workers who took advantage of the opportunities of upskilling in the workplace.
This government is now suggesting that all the effort that went into providing for career paths based on approved industry training packages should be taken out of the award system—at precisely the time when reports indicate that our nation is facing a growing skills shortage in a number of significant areas of concern. So the government's intention would be to send that signal at a time when our growing domestic skills shortages are becoming a major national problem. If these career paths were to be removed from the award system—and I am confident that the Senate again will see the merit in the arguments that the opposition is advancing—the vast majority of employers would have neither the time, the resources nor the means to renegotiate similar provisions workplace by workplace. We have accredited national industry standards that are written into the awards—
—At long last.
—at long last, as my colleague says. They encourage workers to upgrade their skills and their competencies and to be remunerated for doing so. This has been particularly important for women workers. We have had a huge battle in our quest to get equal pay for women, and that quest continues today. But because many women workers—for example, clothing and textile workers—were never given the opportunity of gaining formal accredited qualifications, because apprenticeships were not available in many female-dominated industries, award restructuring meant for the first time that women could show their skill, their competence and their experience through the skill based career paths and could be remunerated for those experiences that historically had been denied to them.
So the removal of these skill based career paths would be bad for all working people—bad for the nation, bad for the economy, bad for our productivity, bad for the attempt to invest more in human skills and human capital—but it would be incredibly regressive for women workers who, in their quest for equal pay and recognition for skills that had never hitherto been properly acknowledged, finally, through the skill based career paths that this government is now attempting to take out of the award system, achieved that measure of recognition and recompense. So there is no justification at all for the proposal to eliminate skill based career paths, to take out long service leave provisions, to take out notice of termination provisions, to take out the rights of people to be involved in jury service and to take out the other entitlements that would be at risk if this bill were to see the light of day.
Let me conclude by saying that this government is engaging again in the greatest act of hypocrisy by coming into this House with a bill entitled `award simplification' when we all know it is about award destruction, award stripping and, ultimately, the obliteration of industrial awards. The people out there for a long time have understood that our system has been fair in that every working person's entitlements are underpinned by an industrial safety net which has been built up over a long period of time and which has been the envy of many other countries that have looked historically to Australia's system as one that really provides a fair go.
The second conclusion I would want to draw from this is that, despite all the rhetoric we hear about union bosses determining the agenda, the people who would be most disadvantaged if this bill ever saw the light of day would be predominantly people who are not even unionised—the low paid, the casual workers, the part-time workers, the young people at work, the migrant workers. This has nothing to do with shoring up the power of union bosses, as the member for Canning alleges. This is all about Australia having the decency to continue to underpin every working person's work day life with a set of entitlements that ensure that no-one falls through the floor, that not all power is with the employer and that decency can apply at the workplace level. That is why this side of the chamber is wholeheartedly opposed to this bill.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AWARD SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—Fewer strikes, lower inflation, higher productivity, lower interest rates, the creation of some 1.3 million jobs and increases in real wages of more than 13 per cent for ordinary Australians are, this government contends, some of the results of the workplace relations reforms over the last seven or so years. That list of matters has led to real progress in workplace relations in this country and is an important driver behind the reforms contained in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002 currently before the House. There is no doubt that overly complex and restrictive awards do hinder agreement making in individual workplaces and do act as a barrier to continued employment growth, and I believe it is now appropriate for the parliament to enact measures for further targeted simplification.
The bill before the House amends the 1996 act in order to tighten and clarify allowable award matters. Provisions which duplicate other legislative entitlements or which are more appropriately dealt with at the workplace level will be removed. In particular, the bill will clearly define and specify allowable matters. For example, redundancy pay will only relate to genuine redundancy and not to resignation. The range of matters currently referred to as `other like forms of leave' will be more closely specified, and the bill clarifies matters that are isolated from an award.
Let me deal with a couple of examples. The removal from awards of matters that are better dealt with at the workplace level through enterprise bargaining is one important target of the proposed bill. The proposed amendments will have the effect of removing from awards those matters more appropriately dealt with at the workplace level than at the industry level—such as is the focus of awards. The first of those matters is skill based career paths, as mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Throsby. Others are: certain forms of leave; transfer of employees between locations; training and education other than for apprentices and trainees; and transfers between different types of employment. It does seem logical, if one accepts the basic reforms in the Workplace Relations Act and the focus on agreement, that those matters are better dealt with at the workplace level.
Another area of focus of the bill is the removal from awards of matters that are duplicated in state, territory and/or other federal legislation. I give the examples of notices of termination, jury service, record of hours of work, arrival and departure times of employees, and accident make-up pay. There are also some training and education provisions relating to apprentices that are dealt with in the same category. Of course, we do live in a federal system. On the other hand, we ought to focus on the appropriate delivery within the Commonwealth structure of legislative process for the purposes of finding agreement at the industrial level—at the workplace. It seems to me that if we are focused on streamlining and simplifying the industrial process and the reaching of industrial agreements then we ought to ensure that the appropriate level of government deals with things in the appropriate industrial arbitral service—in this case, for the most part, state and territory industrial commissions or arbitral tribunals.
Another area of simplification involves the removal of matters that do not form part of a safety net of minimum terms and conditions. I give the examples of public holidays not declared to be observed generally within a state; removal of bonuses, except bonuses for outworkers; limitation of the scope of what may be included as an allowance; and clarification of the commission's power to make minimum rates awards that provide for basic entitlements. Finally, a further area of simplification which I think commendable is that of matters that hinder productivity in the workplace, including provisions specifying the number or proportion of employees in a particular type of employment and direct and indirect prohibitions on employers employing employees in a particular type of employment or classification.
There are other ad hoc measures that deal with other allowable award matters such as preserving freedom of association principles in relation to dispute resolution clauses and ensuring that all exceptional matters orders are now heard by a full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, but in effect the thrust of these provisions is to ensure that the government continues to put in place the framework for a workplace relations system that creates higher real wages and more jobs. At the end of the day, it gives freedom to those involved at the workplace—those on the part of the employers and industry and those on the part of the employees who actually do the hard work, if I can put it that way, at the coalface—who are best placed to reach agreement about the conditions of employment under which they make their own personal arrangements. That is the driving thrust behind the workplace relations legislation, introduced by this government, that has been so beneficial, and this legislation before the House is very much part of that program.
I have with me a copy of an example of an award—in this case, the Metal Industry Award—that I have printed off the Internet. It is a rather large tome. I suspect it must be nearly 1,000 pages. There are all sorts of schedules, amended schedules and provisions dating from different times and going right through. It would be wrong to say the whole thing is a dog's breakfast, but it is something that has with the accretion of time had bits rusted on here and there, and it is almost impossible for the ordinary person to read. I suspect it is almost impossible for the ordinary metalworker to read and digest. That is not conducive to good industrial relations. It certainly is not conducive to those who are on the shop floor understanding precisely what terms and conditions they are working under. So it is a good example of why we need award simplification, and it is a good example of why this House should support the legislation before it.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AWARD SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—Like other opposition speakers, I rise to speak in opposition to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002. Industrial relations have a great impact upon employment. I must say that I am getting quite alarmed by the employment statistics coming out of my electorate. For example, in December 2001 there were 75,942 people employed in my electorate. By December 2003 that had fallen to 70,230. Nearly 6,000 people have fallen out of employment in my electorate since the re-election of the Howard government.
Indeed, there has been a dramatic climb—of more than 1,000—in the number of unemployed people in my electorate. The figure rose from 4,796 in December 2001 to 6,601 in December 2003. The unemployment rate has gone up by half a per cent each quarter in the last five quarters. Of course, I am alarmed at that trend. In December 2003, it was 9.4 per cent. In December 2001, when the Howard government was re-elected, it was 6.3 per cent. I wish I could provide the House with some easy and ready explanation for what is happening in my electorate. I cannot, other than to say that these figures are telling a very stark story. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the table of the figures from which I have just quoted.
Leave granted.

—I thank the House and I particularly thank Parliamentary Secretary Stone, who is sitting at the table. On 15 October I asked the Prime Minister about these figures—that is, the increase by a half a per cent each quarter from June 2002 to June 2003. The Prime Minister was kind enough to accept that the figures that I had provided were reliable, and I thank him for that. But in response to what the government might do to lower unemployment, he relied on the fact that interest rates were low and that he wanted to get rid of the cumbersome unfair dismissal laws—get them off the back of small business. I want to make the point that I do not believe that unfair dismissal laws affect employment whatsoever. In fact, the small business that my wife is a director of has been putting people on, notwithstanding unfair dismissal laws. I believe there is a whole fabrication being built around this so-called burst of employment that might arise as a result of a further attack on workers' rights.
In speaking to this bill, I want to say that I am proud to be a union man. I have always been a member of a union. As a teenager, I was elected as a union delegate when I was working as a labourer on the water board, and then, when I started to work for PMG and later Telstra, I was always pleased to be a delegate. In fact, I have been very much involved in my branch's union activities. In those days, we were considered the militant section of the union, but we would talk ourselves blue in the face before we would take workers off the job. We did do it, but we exploited every opportunity. I think it is a great thing to have been a representative of people who work. I applaud my colleague the honourable member for Throsby, who came into this place with an illustrious record of having worked for workers' rights, including being the President of the ACTU. I do not see this as something on which to belittle me or the honourable member for Throsby. It is a point of pride with us. It is a point of accomplishment for us. To the day I die, I will be a union man.
But this government sees unions as evil—as somehow holding back progress in the world of work. I would like to remind the House of all the things that we did under the last Labor government to make changes in the workplace. There are some things that as a member for parliament you never forget. I remember that, when we were trying to get workers to be involved with management, to increase productivity and to develop quality circles, we were tramping around the paper mills down in Tasmania and we spoke to a delegate there. His words will never leave me because he said of those changes: `Before when I used to come to work, when I bundied on I left my brains behind; now, when I bundy on I am expected to bring my brains with me.'
I have never understood the philosophy of the Howard government—and I have been on both sides of the equation, as a worker and as a manager. How can you expect to get the best out of the workplace if you do not involve workers or if you terrorise them with concerns about losing their jobs? And, indeed, what does this bill do? It takes out termination as an issue for an award. So an employer can ring you up and say, `Goodbye, you don't have a job.' Already the work force is very concerned about the lack of certainty in their employment. I understand that over the last 20 years things have changed dramatically in the workplace. Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, you and I might have looked for a permanent job with a company or public institution and stayed for 10, 20 or 30 years and seen our careers out. Young people are different today. They are quite happy to move around in a way that we would have found very discomfiting.
Let me say this: on the Labor Party side we actually believe in the dignity of work—that is, that there is nothing dishonourable about working; that there is dignity in saying, `I am a worker.' Whether you are a blue-collar worker or a white-collar worker, there is dignity in that. As a society, we also credential ourselves by what we do. If you are meeting someone for the first time, the most common thing you ask is: `What do you do?' But what is the Howard government doing? The Howard government is trying to drive a huge wedge between workers and their employers.
Under the Howard government's industrial relations reforms, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, you and I can be doing the same job but we can be differently remunerated. I think that is terribly wrong. In Australia we are very proud to have had an arbitration system for more than 100 years. It was used to get over those terrible great strikes in the 1800s and the early 1900s; it was used to provide mechanisms whereby strikes could be resolved; but, most importantly, it provided protection for workers. The idea that somehow a worker and an employer are on an equal footing, equally able to negotiate on the fundamentals of employment, is absolutely farcical. Why continually attack organisations that seek the betterment of the working men and women of Australia? I do not understand that. It is a maniacal assault on the trade union movement. I just do not understand it.
Already, since 1996, the allowable matters in awards have been reduced to 20 matters. In the Hawke-Keating years, for example, we were able to achieve—without any strikes, without any lockouts—the crunching of over 300 separate awards in the car industry down to nine. In fact, the government got involved in a range of important issues. We did not stand at arms-length and say, `This is something that the marketplace has to sort out.' We actually got involved in the car industry and the steel industry and insisted that there ought to be reciprocity—that is, in return for concessions on the union side, there would be an investment program ensuring that the facilities that the workers had to work with were up to date, modern and the best that were available.
Whatever anyone would like to say in this place, it is unarguable that that car plan led to a massive transformation of our automobile and components industries. That was not an example of the Labor Party in government bringing down draconian legislation; it was not even a case of the Labor Party in government trying to favour one side of industrial relations over the other. It was done with the active support of the unions, the employers and the employer association. That is what should happen. But can you recall an example in the eight years of the Howard government where the Howard government has intervened to cause investment in an industry or got involved in ensuring an industry's future? Of course you cannot.
The member for Throsby pointed out what was being removed from the award system: skill based career paths for workers. The notion that if a worker undertakes study—an industry credentialled package of skills—and becomes more highly skilled, they should not be rewarded; that somehow Australia is so skilled that we do not have to worry about providing opportunities for the people of Australia, our working men and women, to gain further skills, and that when they gain those skills they should receive zero rewards for it. How absurd. I am sure that every coalition member understands that productivity, having increased so much through technological change, and skilling up the work force is now at the point of decline whereby it is starting to cause people to worry, and so they should. Australia has no comparative advantage in trying to compete internationally on a low-skill, low-pay base. We cannot do it. There are already countries in Asia which have wages much higher than in Australia.
We on this side of politics believe this passionately: our future is in providing opportunities for people. In the main, for working men and women, that means providing opportunities to get entry-level training into the careers of their choice and providing career training to enhance their skills. Not only do they benefit as individuals but we benefit as a nation. What is the Howard government doing? It is saying no. It is saying: `Nyet. We've got to get this out of the award system. This is holding Australia back. This is an alien philosophy to us. We can't have skill based career paths in our award system. If we get skills, we can't provide opportunities for people to move up the ladder in the world of work.' That is what they are saying. How absurd.
Long service leave is going to be taken out of awards. I think we can agree in a bipartisan way that there is nothing worse than seeing workers, men and women who give a lot of service to an individual company or organisation, accrue entitlements and then see that company go belly up so they do not get their entitlements. We can argue about the process for fixing it, but I think in this parliament we all should—and I believe we do—think that that is terribly wrong. On this side of the House, we say that the measures that you have sought to provide recompense in that system do not go far enough. Your safety net does not go far enough. That is a debate we can have, and we can take different sides of it, but why are you trying to take long service leave out of awards? What is the rationale? Do you want workers who do not have the benefit of strong union representation not to have long service leave in their agreements? Is that really what you are getting at? Is this another way of hollowing out workers' pay? There has been a lot of hollowing out of workers' pay since this government came in. Is this just another example? Why would we in the Labor Party not object to taking out skill based career paths and long service leave?
And—horror of horrors—how many times have we heard from the coalition members that workers should benefit from the success of their employers and places of employment? Many, many times. And now, of course, bonuses are to be taken out. You cannot have an award where workers might be paid a bonus. All the rewards of success should go to capital. All the rewards of success should go to management. It is diabolical, and I must say that it is a view of work and management that I do not share. But I will be interested to hear the coalition speakers provide justification for why skill based career paths, bonuses, long service leave and notice of termination should be out of awards.
The future of the world of work is dependent on a number of things. The involvement of workers is important. It should not just be a one-way thing. It should not just be: `You're lucky to get a job, and that's it.' You actually want workers to be committed to their place of work. You want them to be involved in key decisions, because often the workers, white-collar or blue-collar, know a lot more about the job than management does—and we were going along that path. I have always said that I believe, philosophically, that management and workers have a lot in common. But, rather than encouraging the sharing, you are trying to wrench them apart. You are trying to entrench the idea that all workers are entitled to is the privilege of a job at the whim of the employer, and that is it. (Time expired)
 (Mr Lindsay)—Order! Before I call the next speaker, during the member for Chifley's contribution leave was sought to incorporate material in Hansard. I have allowed that course of action to be followed. However, for the information of the House and the member for Chifley, it has been the practice of previous Speakers to keep Hansard as a true record of what is said. Where material can be read into the Hansard, it should be. The incorporation of anything into the Hansard record other than items such as tables, which need to be seen in visual form for comprehension, is usually not allowed.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AWARD SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1
"Ticehurst, Kenneth, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—I rise today to support the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002. The reforms in this bill are designed to implement the Howard government's ongoing commitment to maintaining the award system as a safety net of minimum wages and conditions that facilitates agreement making in the workplace. I must say that, unlike the member for Chifley, I have never been a union man. I have seen many companies that have been destroyed by intransigent unions, but all through my working career I have done my own bidding, and I have done that quite successfully. In my electorate of Dobell, small business is a huge contributor to the local economy, and job creation is a key strategic issue being addressed by all levels of government. For my electorate, this bill is important because it has the potential to reduce the complexity of the workplace relations system and to remove the burden on thousands of small businesses, which can create new jobs.
Reforms to the workplace relations system since the Howard government came to office in 1996 have assisted in the creation of more than 1.3 million jobs and led to increases in real wages for ordinary Australians of more than 13 per cent. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to tighten and clarify allowable award matters. For example, redundancy pay will only relate to genuine redundancy and not to resignation by an employee, as some award clauses currently allow for. The range of matters currently referred to as other forms of leave will be more closely specified, and the bill clarifies matters that are isolated from an award.
Provisions will be removed which duplicate other legislative entitlements. For example, legislation in every state and territory already provides for long service leave. Similarly, the removal of accident make-up pay from the awards is not about absolving employers of responsibility to employees injured at work—as Labor, I am sure, would like to have people believe. The fact is that weekly payments to injured workers are regulated by the relevant workers compensation legislation in each jurisdiction. It is appropriate, then, for payments in respect of accidents in the workplace to continue to be regulated at a state level, in order to fit with the current workers compensation regimes. Regulation of accident make-up pay—like regulation of training provisions relating to apprentices and trainees, notice of termination, jury service and records of hours of work—increases the complexity of awards. If parties want to increase the amount paid to injured employees above the statutory provisions, this should be covered in agreements and not in the award safety net. Surveys have shown that, because of overlapping federal and state legislation, many employees and employers do not know whether federal or state law applies to them. This overlapping is unnecessarily confusing and cumbersome, and I am sure that this move will be welcomed by many employers and employees in Dobell.
Provisions which hinder productivity and workplace performance or which are more appropriately dealt with at the workplace will also be removed from the awards. The fact is that skill based career paths, certain forms of leave, transfers of employees between locations, training and education other than for apprentices and trainees, and transfers between different types of employment are matters that are more appropriately dealt with at the workplace level.
I am going to expand briefly on the training and education provision. The training and skills of employees are vitally important for the Australian economy, and the Australian government remains committed to improving the knowledge and skills of the Australian work force. Removing training and education provisions from awards is consistent with the evolving workplace relations system that focuses on enterprises and workplaces, with agreement being the main form of determining pay and conditions.
The Labor Party's opposition to the bill is merely another example of the union movement being the owner and operator of the Australian Labor Party. I have been a small business owner, I have been a managing director of a multinational company and I have worked on the factory floor. Through my varied employment experience, I understand that matters associated with education and training are best dealt with by agreements between employers and employees at the workplace level. Workplace agreements enable employers and employees to develop and implement training and education arrangements. These arrangements meet the particular needs and circumstances of their own workplace, allow them to respond more quickly to changing skill needs by implementing new training and education arrangements, and avoid the prescriptive one size fits all approach. 
It is disappointing that the Labor Party has opposed award simplification since its introduction in 1996 and remains opposed to it even where there is clear evidence of improvements. It is disappointing that the Labor Party does not see the damage in overly complex and restrictive awards that act as a continued barrier to employment growth. One restrictive award that stood out for me had a clause relating to mandatory transfers between types of employment and a clause which placed restrictions on the employment of employees in a particular type of employment or classification. 
In my electorate and indeed nationally, the increase in the casualisation of the work force is cause for concern. Casual workers have no job security and no access to paid leave or holiday leave. They are not guaranteed an income and they will have little opportunity to borrow money for even a house or a car. But a provision requiring mandatory transfer of employees between different jobs is not the answer. All this does is hinder the productivity of the workplace and reduce the capacity of employers and employees to make choices about the way in which they regulate their employment relationship. Provisions that merely add prescriptive detail to awards and reduce flexibility simply do not belong in the industry wide awards. If these sorts of provisions are ever considered appropriate for a particular workplace, they should be contained in workplace agreements rather than broadly applied with the one size fits all approach. 
It is interesting to note that the previous Labor government did see the value in simplified awards. In a speech at the Institute of Directors in Melbourne on 21 April 1993, Mr Keating spoke about the model of industrial relations they were working towards, and he said:
The safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees, but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employers. 
Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards with fewer clauses.
Today's Labor Party, it seems, are going backwards in their support of an unrealistic and prehistoric one size fits all approach to workplace relations. Small businesses need greater flexibility because they do not have the same access to financial and human resources as larger businesses, and unplanned expenses can threaten the viability of a business and the jobs of those working for the business. It must be remembered that businesses can only pay employees out of profit—no profit, no continuing business. Long service leave and other provisions that are duplicated in state and territory legislation can cause unnecessary complications for employers, not to mention additional administrative costs that small businesses simply cannot afford. 
In conclusion, reforms of the workplace relations system since 1996 have not only created more jobs for Australians, but they have also resulted in fewer strikes, lower inflation, higher productivity and lower interest rates. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002 will contribute to a balanced system for both employers and employees, a process that would lessen complexity, lower costs and provide more certainty for both employers and employees. I urge members opposite to support this legislative move towards a more unified workplace relations system that contributes positively to the social and economic wellbeing of our community.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I love following government members in these debates when they talk about things they know absolutely nothing about. The absolute load of rhetoric coming from the other side cannot be actually quantified or justified by any example in any way, shape, size or form. The absolute dribble is just beautiful. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002 will impact particularly on small businesses. Small businesses like certainty; they like awards. It makes their lives easier. So to say that stripping back awards creates jobs is actually false. There is absolutely no demonstration that this is true. It is like saying that being able to sack someone more easily is going to create jobs. It is laughable and it is tragic. 
Coalition members in the government accuse us of not understanding business, but they come in here and talk about industrial relations and they do not know what it is or how it works. They have never worked in the system. They have never dealt with the day-to-day realities of industrial relations. They have not done it. There is about one person on the other side with any HR or IR background. I have worked on both sides of the fence, as an employer representative and as a union representative. I have seen it all. They come in here and talk the talk, but they do not actually understand the day-to-day applications of how these things work.
The tragedy is that you cannot escape the sense of deja vu about this bill. I have an overwhelming sense that I have been here before. Sadly, I have—I talked on this when the allowable matters were stripped back to just 20. Now we are here again to strip them back to 16. I love the rhetoric from the government that it is about award simplification. That is a load of bunkum. It is not; it is about stripping away more hard-won entitlements and creating a greater sense of confusion for employers. By the way, we have been waiting an awfully long time for this bill to come on. If it is so important and it was introduced in 2002, how come we have managed to get it onto the legislative program only at the very end of this session in 2004?
I mentioned that this bill creates confusion and headaches for employers, particularly in small businesses. The bill takes away another four allowable matters, reducing them from a mere 20 to 16, and places limits on those remaining 16 matters. Just imagine that you are starting up a small business and you are taking on staff. The first thing you want to know is, `How do I pay them and what are they entitled to?' Generally, people who are employing people want to treat them fairly, so they want to would know what their staff are entitled to overall. It used to be so easy—you would get a copy of the award and you would know you were doing the right thing. You also knew what rates and conditions your competitors were applying and you could factor this into your price structure—but not anymore. Now you have a narrow cast of matters in awards and no idea what may be housed in the agreements and AWAs applied by your competitors. This can result in a loss of business, because you can be undercut by competitors, or a loss of staff, who are attracted to better-paying jobs. Awards provided certainty for both employers and employees—but not anymore. The ideological bent of this government and the larger employer unions has won the day yet again. I am sorry, I am not allowed to call them `employer unions'; they are associations. They are not amalgamations of people protecting each other. No—that would be absurd. They are associations.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, ACCI, supports even further reforms to the awards system to create a framework which sets out only pay and leave conditions, much like the ill-fated Victorian IR system introduced by the Kennett government. That has now been consigned to the dustbin of history, thanks to the passing in this place of a bill introduced by the government—the Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Protection for Victorian Workers) Bill 2003. The notion of stripping back completely has been a failure. It was a failure in Victoria and it led to the government actually introducing a bill to overturn that. So they know it is a failure. They know that award simplification is a failure because it creates too much confusion and it leaves employees exposed. It is ironic that we are being lectured about how we are terrible about passing this bill when the government has already moved a bill in this House to reinstate conditions stripped away in Victoria, arriving at the same set of conclusions about those things that people in the larger employer associations want to achieve.
This exercise proves that there needs to be greater certainty about pay and conditions. Not every workplace has the capacity to undertake enterprise bargaining, especially small businesses. ACCI and the like do not represent the concerns of small business. Further, we still need the safety net—a set of conditions which the commission can rule a line under and say, `You can go no further than this.' Sadly, this bill continues the erosion of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's powers, which the government started way back in 1996. Of course, way back in 1996 we saw the best erosion when they took away the powers of the AIRC to ensure that people bargain in good faith. Nobody on the other side of the House talks about bargaining in good faith. Nobody talks about the savage lockouts experienced by employees that this government has allowed and more or less encouraged by the legislative enactment that they have put through. Regardless of what the AIRC may think is appropriate for awards and no matter what they may arbitrate in the commission, the government will simply legislate away what can be dealt with in awards. This is what we have before us.
The government spelt out its plan to denude workers of any vestige of rights in their workplaces back in 1996, with the joke-titled Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill. This bill before the House today is merely another stage in a long trip to rip things off employees to repay the government's masters who fund their election campaigns. This bill before the House would remove the following matters from federal awards: skill based career paths, bonuses, long service leave, notice of termination and jury service. In addition, some allowable matters would be restricted: training or education matters, rights of unions to take part in dispute settlement procedures, and transfer of one type of employment to another. Also, allowances would no longer include accident make-up pay, cultural leave would be limited to ceremonial leave for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and other similar types of cultural and religious observation, public holidays would include only government-declared public holidays and therefore not union picnic days, and the scope for awards to contain matters incidental to specific allowable matters would be narrowed. So there is a lot that this bill actually contains.
What are these areas that we are talking about? Skill based career paths are being taken out of awards. I can remember that, back in 1987, we went through an enormous amount of work to introduce skill based career paths into awards. There was a great sense of joint work between unions, employers and employees to establish those career path skill models. It has actually been demonstrated that taking these out of awards takes away the urgency for employers to actually engage in training staff. We have seen the absolute skill shortage we have in our society today. You need only to look at the lack of apprentices around us—and I mean genuine apprentices; ones who are going to walk out after four or five years with a specific trade certificate—to know that this type of narrowing of our award conditions is having a detrimental impact upon our economy. You need only to look at the job vacancies that cannot be filled, particularly in some regional areas, because there are no skilled people out there. One of the big reasons, of course, is that everything was privatised by various Liberal state governments so we do not actually have instrumentalities anymore that are training up apprentices. You also do not have employers taking on apprentices. This is a green light to say, `Training in the workplace is not important.' We used to talk about the lucky country, keeping up and continual learning, but this actually gives the green light to saying, `It's not important; don't worry about it.'
The other interesting matter is the removal of jury service. This is fundamentally ridiculous. It is important for the legal system to have certainty that people will actually serve on juries. If they have confusion with their employer about whether they can go and what happens to their pay when they go, it is now all nice and set—it is all very easy and it is there in the award. It says: `Yes, you can go. You'll get your jury payment and we'll make up the rest of the pay.' It is very simple. Why take that away? Why let that fall over?
It is like the absolutely ludicrous situation of the first allowable matters case, which took out blood donor leave. We now see a crisis in our supply of blood; there is actually a correlation between when the provision came out and the drop in the supply of blood. Other factors have been involved as well, but some work has been conducted to demonstrate that there has been a falling away in the number of people donating blood. They cannot say to their boss: `The mobile van is up the road. I think I'll go and donate some blood. Is that all right?' It used to be in the award, and they used to be able to say it was there. They would ring up the HR department—the person who looked after pay, personnel and that sort of stuff—and ask, `Is that all right?' and they would be told, `Yeah, off you go.'
We have a situation at the moment where people who are receiving regular plasma transfusions for various illnesses are being told, `Sorry, you can't have them.' This has been reported recently on radio in Victoria by Kylie Millar, a writer for the Green Guide. She can no longer receive her regular plasma transfusion because of the lack of supply—she cannot do it. This is putting her health at risk, because there is not the supply out there to support her. This is ludicrous; it is penny-pinching stupidity. It has an adverse effect; it is creating problems instead of solving them. It is like, in the first round, taking out Army Reserve leave. There is massive confusion around employees, again, going up to their boss and saying: `I've got a regular two-week camp for my reservist training. I've got to go on it. What happens now?' The employer scratches their head and says: `I don't actually know. It used to be in the award. It's not there. I haven't signed it off in the EB. I don't know. I don't think you can go.' If they do not go, they do not qualify in their reservist training. I would have thought that, in these uncertain times in our lives, we would want to encourage people to belong to the reservists and to be doing things, as opposed to putting an impediment in their place. Taking away jury service is going to cause the same problems that the removal of blood donor leave and Army Reservist leave has caused; it is not going to help anybody.
The other matter is the removal of long service leave. We have had employer associations saying, `Please don't do this to us; it is going to create confusion.' Way back in 1999, when this was first mooted, the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce said:
Our associations have some reservations in relation to the proposed changes ... in relation to the removal of long service leave from the allowable matters. We would see that that would create administrative burdens to members, especially where they have national businesses operating across state borders. Removing the long service leave provisions from federal awards for our members ... would subject these sorts of businesses to a multiplicity of different arrangements across different states, including different access times to long service leave and different outcomes in relation to the amounts of leave that are due ...
Yes, it is very simple: take it away and create confusion—particularly amongst small businesses, which the Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce represents. They do not need more confusion; they need certainty. Awards give them certainty.
Another issue is the reduction of transfer from one type of employment to another. Again, this is about reducing choice; it is about reducing choice for employees. In this day and age, people move in and out of modes of employment—particularly women returning to the work force after having children; they need to have greater choice, not less choice. We have the terrible situation, which was recently reported in the poverty inquiry report handed down by the Senate, of people who are in the work force but are living on subminimal amounts. They are all casuals in the work force but they would like to become at least permanent part-time workers, because it would give them some certainty. When they rock up to the bank they can say, `I am employed'—although it might be part-time—as opposed to saying, `I'm a casual,' and being told: `No, you can't have a bank loan. No, you can't take out a loan to buy a car. No, you can't have a credit card.' Those in full-time employment take all those things for granted. This gave certainty to employees about choice. It also gave certainty to employers, who can say: `Yeah, you can transfer in and out. This is how we'll do it. This is what happens to your terms and conditions. This is what happens to your pay.' That is gone; it is eroded—and it creates confusion.
Awards have already been stripped back—a massive task undertaken by unions, employers and the commission. The commission still has not undertaken the award simplification process passed by the last bit of legislation, because it is a huge task to go through an award, clause by clause, and say: `This has got to come out. This has got to go in. This has got to be written.' Hours and hours of work go into that, so we do not need to put more imposts on business in undertaking these tasks.
Last night I spoke in this House about the net effect that the stripping back of allowable matters has had. There was a case cited in the paper yesterday about a young employee at Westco. This employee was forced to wear a rather provocative T-shirt that caused her great distress. She had the bravery to say to her employer that she did not want to wear a T-shirt that was very tight and had written across it the words `Don't pretend you don't want me'—which is provocative on a very tight, white T-shirt. If the allowable matters had not come through last time, her employer could not do that. The previous federal shop assistants award had a clause that stated that employers could not require employees to wear revealing or indecent clothing that would cause the employee embarrassment. There was a clause in the award that stopped the employer doing that.
So why was there that clause? The Shop Assistants Union, back in the eighties, had a plethora of cases of women being required to be topless in the work force. There was this great marketing ploy in hardware and spare parts stores that they would employ topless sales assistants, and there was no provision in legislation to actually stop this from happening. So they put a very sensible clause in the award. It did not cost anybody any money; it just said that an employee could not be asked to wear revealing or indecent clothing.
So we have this ludicrous case of teenagers, particularly within the retail industry—and particularly within Westco—being demanded to wear sexually explicit advertising, more or less. Westco management said, `We just thought it was cheeky and provocative, and it has been demonstrated that it works because people have been buying our T-shirts.' It is one thing to choose to buy a T-shirt and wear it, but it is another thing to be forced to wear it in the workplace. We have the case of a poor girl who was brave enough to say, `No, I don't want to wear this,' and took it off after a male customer had harassed her. Funnily enough, if the T-shirt you are wearing has a line on it that says `Don't pretend you don't want me', you might think you are going to get a bit harassed by the male clientele. She was sent home. She was sent home because they had a policy of no T-shirt, no work. 
Westco had to back down on this because there has been such a hue and cry, but they still cannot understand why it is wrong. If that provision had been in the award, it would have been simple: that young girl could have rung up the HR area, the help desk or Wageline and said, `This has been asked of me; where do I stand?' They could have read out the provision in the award and said, `You don't have to do this.' Instead, she got sent home without any advice. She is a very brave soul, and I trust that nothing is going to happen to her employment.
I think it is hypocritical that the minister for industrial relations in this place—the great moral crusader—is forever telling us about the great moral stance he wants to take in life. What is he saying to parents of teenagers who work in these stores across the country: that it is perfectly all right for your teenager daughters to be exposed to this sort of sexual harassment? It is laughable. If the award had not been changed, there would have been the ability for the staff to say, `No, I don't have to do that; I'm protected by my award.'
I think Rob Hulls, the Victorian Attorney-General and industrial relations minister, summed up this government's IR credentials well. Back in February 2002, it was reported that:
Hulls compared the federal Workplace Relations Act to a dinosaur with an anti-family, anti-women and outdated IR agenda.
“Unfortunately, Tony Abbott—
the then minister—
believes that the only way that an industrial relations regime will work is to encourage conflict, to get two parties into a ring, allow them to beat the tripe out of each other and let all the spoils go to the last person standing,” he said.
The current workplace relations minister continues the tradition through yet another obnoxious, unnecessary bill—and we should reject it.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AWARD SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2004-03-31,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002 because, like 40 other bills, it is designed to make small business more efficient. It is primarily designed not only to allow all business and employment in Australia to be good for those who have a job now but also to make it easier for small business—in fact, all businesses around Australia—to employ more people in the future. The core difference between those opposite and us is that, while we look after those who now have jobs, we are always trying to get employment for those who do not have a job. Without a doubt, the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, and his party are more about keeping the union happy and getting perks for those with jobs than about trying to create new jobs.
This bill is about delivering to business what they have been asking for; that is, a simple regulation and a clear definition of the allowable award matters for employee contract negotiations—in other words, a simplification to make it easier for everyone, but especially small business and the employees of small business, to reach a simple agreement directly between employee and employer without being part of a union contract.
There are 20 allowable matters in the Workplace Relations Act that can be addressed by the Industrial Relations Commission. They make up the minimum award or safety net provisions for Australian employees. Those allowable matters are listed in paragraph 89A(2) of the act. The award system is a safety net. It is a minimum set of conditions which must apply to employees and employers in any field of endeavour or work. I think what business and government agree on here is that we should not be totally prescriptive—in other words, we should not put in a set of principles that cannot be varied and cannot help either side with respect to wages and conditions. We believe that employers and employees should be able to sit down and have the flexibility to negotiate a wage package that allows both sides to make the most of their opportunity in the situation they are in and that, at the same time, guarantees a safety net and satisfies the minimum standard.
Obviously each workplace will have unique circumstances, irrespective of the industry and the particular conditions involved in it. Differences can and must be accommodated, and that is what this bill is trying to provide for. The amendments will provide clarity for employers as to what those minimum standards are and how they have to be incorporated in a voluntary agreement. The amendments will provide a concise reference for the Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate where a dispute takes place. All that is pretty much commonsense and, I would have thought, beneficial to all sides. I certainly believe it will make it more possible for small business or any other business to expand and to chance its arm.
You would imagine that anybody would support such a circumstance; but will the Labor Party? No, they will not. Why? Quite obviously their union masters, the backroom boys of the Labor Party, will tell the man they direct, the member for Werriwa, that they do not want it. In other words, they do not want workers having freedom. They do not want a worker to be able to negotiate his own provisions in the workplace—not even when they meet the safety net or when they would be beneficial to the worker. That is not what they want. Anything that is not prescriptive, anything that does not put the union in the forefront, is of no use to them.
All of this totally ignores the fact that governments, the nation and employers are in the business of employment and production, and I would have thought that getting the maximum number of people in jobs would be at the forefront of everyone's mind—not giving the maximum number of union people a place in the movement of the work force. I think it would be very fair—when you read this sort of thing—to call the Labor Party `the unemployment party', because what they are supporting is certainly more in the interests of unemployment than getting people into jobs. 
This government believes in a minimum safety net, but it also believes in a situation that is not so prescriptive that it inhibits the negotiation of a more mutually—and I stress `mutually'—beneficial package of work. This coalition has an incredible record, and I suppose this narks upon those opposite; it has had a very proud record on industrial relations over the last seven years. It has delivered more jobs, higher wages, lower unemployment and fewer industrial disputes than the previous Labor government of 13 years. We want to continue that. We have every reason to do that, and so does Australia, so does business and so does anybody who is a prospective worker. We wish to have the positive reforms that I have already spoken about to entrench minimum standards, but we want simpler, fairer unfair dismissal legislation as well. What does Labor want? They want what we used to have: total regulation and a fully centralised negotiation system of workplace awards. In other words, they want union domination, union control and a say in everything a worker does—no matter whether the worker wants it or not.
Industrial relations is a further example of why we must look at what Labor do, as the Treasurer says, and not what they say. The present opposition will say virtually anything in the light of day in an attempt to look good; but at the same time they are quite happy to tear the guts out of business, especially small business, to appease the unions behind them. You only have to look at what they have done to see that. The best example of that is the ALP National Conference of January 2004. It gives an incredible insight into what a retrograde step Labor and the unions want to take in industrial relations. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have extensively reviewed the January 2004 policy, and they concluded that the policy would adversely affect the interests of private employers and compromise economic development. They also said that it would heighten trade union activity and have significant implications for jobs and employment. In this blunt and comprehensive assessment, the ACCI calls upon Labor to at least look at what Paul Keating tried to do. He failed, but he tried to have a less centralised workplace relations system. But his successor, if you like, the member for Werriwa, certainly cannot do that. He will not even follow the industrial relations attempts made by the previous Labor government.
I must comment on some of the statements and positions adopted by the opposition and the unions. The Victorian construction union branded Prime Minister John Howard, our leader, an industrial firebug. We have been anything but that, and we have proved that over the last seven years. With our economic management, construction activity has increased, jobs have increased and wages have increased. If this government are guilty of anything in industrial relations or productivity, we are guilty of providing jobs, of making sure wages and salaries are growing along with production, and of ensuring the forward movement of this economy and its growth in real terms. Yes, we are guilty of that.
What is our record? We have created more jobs in the last six months than the previous Labor government created in its last six years. The current Labor opposition are proposing—and I think this is an enormous point—to revert to processes and policies that were discarded by their predecessors during the Keating government's modest attempt at industrial relations reform. It is not just employers that should be afraid. Workers should be afraid—very afraid.
Let us take a look at where Labor wants to take the country. Forget the rosy words used by the member for Werriwa. Look at what it is doing. Look at where it will lead us. The bill is about the amendment of allowable matters, and I think we have got to look at that. The proposal is to limit the types of allowances that can be included to monetary allowances payable to employees for expenses incurred in the course of their employment, for particular responsibilities or skills such as handling hazardous materials, or for work in particular conditions such as confined spaces or remote localities. Yet Labor would oppose this.
Labor seemed to want any additional allowance to be included in the award and to therefore preserve the right of the union to call industrial action if that allowance, no matter what it was, was not to their liking. We would be back to the union controlled workplace. I would like to give an example of what that was.
Some members may remember the dim sim allowance—a debacle on the Sydney waterfront over 10 years ago. Construction workers on the Sydney waterfront objected to a local Chinese restaurant cooking dim sims—it might sound funny but it is serious; this is what happened—and demanded a weekly dim sim allowance equivalent to the price of a Chinese meal, just to keep them on the job because they did not like the smell of dim sims cooking. If members opposite want to question that, they can ask their mates in the Waterside Workers Union about it.
I imagine the unions are rubbing their hands together at the thought of returning to that kind of industrial mayhem and lack of productivity if the Labor opposition have their way. Heaven forbid: if the member for Werriwa leads a government, obviously that is where the unions will take us.
There is another allowable matter entitled `Public Holidays'. The amendment before the House clarifies these as including only those holidays gazetted by state and territory governments. In other words, any other days off are a matter for a workplace agreement or enterprise agreement and are not part of any national award. Again, we cannot return to the days where our national productivity is compromised because of union demands for days of rest or other issues which result in lengthy strikes, and have done in the past, or expensive Industrial Relations Commission involvement.
When the coalition government assumed office in 1996 there were massive structural inefficiencies in the workplace causing businesses to be uncompetitive in the world market. There was incredible unemployment—approximately one million people—and a union movement that was totally restricting efficiency and productivity.
Labor and the unions controlled the industrial relations agenda to the point where there was virtually no—I stress `no'—optimism within the business community. The union movement, supported by the Labor government, was far more interested in rorting the system, getting more holidays and getting every little dim sim they could than they were in employment. The result of that was one million people unemployed, and there were no new jobs. By fixing the economy and lowering interest rates this government has created not just business and productivity, but jobs, better working conditions and better wages.
What no-one on the other side of the House understands is that without profits we not only do not have pensions but we also do not have the ability to provide better conditions, because we cannot pay for them. We can pay for them in the short term but they do not last, because businesses go broke.
As the ACCI acknowledged in their review of Labor's industrial relations platform, at least Paul Keating tried to address some of these matters. He failed but at least he tried. The present opposition leader, the member for Werriwa, and those behind him, appear to lack both the will and the fortitude to do what is necessary. Just as their populist politics at the moment have absolutely no guts, no forethought and no future, what they are doing in industrial relations is what the popular union at the time wants.
This government has shown that it still has the will. It is still producing good policy and is, for the 41st time, trying to make certain that we get changes to the workplace that not only allow small and larger businesses to do better but also mean more jobs for more people. That is something the unions and Labor do not seem interested in.
I refer once more to the waterfront. We reformed that industry to the point that the average container moves per hour went from 16 to 30. We have averaged over 25 lifts per hour for the last 13 consecutive quarters. Despite knowing what a mess the waterfront was, Labor governments around Australia combined with unions to try and block those reforms. Happily for Australia—for workers, for small and large businesses and for the debt of Australia—they were not successful. I think a lot of people have a lot to thank Peter Reith, the former industrial relations minister, farmers bodies around Australia and all those involved with those reforms for, for simply fixing that situation.
This government is about more jobs, not more rorts. Even members opposite must admit—they cannot dispute the fact—that, after eight years of coalition government, there are more people in work, unemployment is at half the rate it was under Labor and real wages are better, yet Labor still oppose the industrial relations reform program. It is time the public were aware of their duplicity and coercion, with unions, not to get more jobs but to get more rorts. The ACCI has looked at Labor's policy and seen the real need and the real danger. The ACCI said that it does not care which political party is in government, as long as there are policies to enable businesses to do their business and provide jobs and productivity.
There is nothing new in Labor's policy or actions. Labor's industrial relations platform is a return to centralisation and regulation. It is a rehash of a failed past policy that nearly broke Australia and, among other things, led to $96 billion worth of debt and interest rates of over 20 per cent—I know; I saw those high interest rates and had mates who went broke because of them.
Labor would turn control of our industrial relations over to their union masters—a body that even workers are deserting. That is what all this is about. They will not back off because they are down to 17 per cent union membership and Labor, being funded by the unions, are trying to help the unions get their membership up when everything the coalition does—economic management, more jobs, better jobs for better money—is helping to drive union membership down. When it was high, there were one million people unemployed.
This is a bill designed to help not only business, especially small business, but everybody. This bill is designed to create more jobs and give more people a better lifestyle.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I note the contribution of the member of Parkes, a good unionist from New South Wales. He is a former member of the farmers union in New South Wales, and I am wondering why today he has turned on fellow unionists throughout Australia. I remind the honourable member for Parkes that I had mates who went out of business during the Fraser Liberal years. At that time, the current leader of the Liberal Party was the Treasurer of this country, and he left Australia with massive debt, double digit inflation, double digit interest rates, double digit unemployment and a negative growth rate. That was the great legacy of the current leader of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister of Australia, and I welcome the opportunity to remind Liberal members in the House today of the record of the Prime Minister.
The title of this bill says it all. It is the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002. The House might wonder how it is that we are debating a bill that was brought into this place in 2002. The former industrial relations ministers in this government are a bit like plastic dummies. You blow them up, you knock them down, and they bounce up again and keep bouncing up. I thought that the current industrial relations minister might be cut from a new cloth, but his performances in this place indicate that nothing has really changed on the Liberal side. They are still following the current Prime Minister's agenda. He has a very simple agenda, but he has not managed, in eight years, to get much of it through. He did get the GST through; that was a central plank of his agenda. He wanted to privatise the whole of Telstra, but he has not been able to do that, because of the actions of members of another place. And, of course, he has tried time and again to introduce his industrial relations system—that great Liberal race to the bottom, which we have seen over the last seven or eight years. He has not been able to get that agenda completely through this parliament, and that is the reason we have this legislation here today.
The current minister really is a bit like a plastic dummy, like his two predecessors. You knock them down and they pop up again. He has come into the House with this hoary old bit of legislation which is designed to strip away the awards of Australian workers. I say to members opposite: at the end of the day, who do you think you are driving the boot into with this legislation? It is the working families of Australia. That is whom you are doing it to. You might go home from this House on Thursday evening, go out on the golf course on Friday and forget about this pernicious legislation that you have brought into this place. But I certainly will not forget and neither will the workers of the Corio electorate. It is the same hoary old Tory agenda that you keep trotting out in this place and that we keep on rejecting. Keep on doing it; we do not mind. You only have a few more months to do it, and then we will have the reins of government and we will sort out this whole area once and for all. I note the presence in the House of the member for O'Connor, who will follow me in this debate. He is a good prime ministerial loyalist from many years back. We know his history. When the honourable member for O'Connor gets up and says what a good bloke the current Prime Minister is and how good his agenda is, we will know exactly what is in his heart. 
With this bill, the government is yet again seeking to tear away at the safety net employment conditions that have been assembled for working Australians over 100 years. This bill would further reduce matters that can be included in awards from the current 20 matters to 16 matters and would put limitations on some of the remaining 16. It follows the 1996 first wave of industrial relations amendments that restricted allowable matters to 20.
The government always comes into this place chanting the mantra of choice but, when it comes to choice for employees and choice of matters that can be included in awards, the government wants to restrict choice. Do not take any notice of what the government says about choice; it is what the government does that counts, and the government is consistently trying to restrict choice for working Australians and for workers in the Corio electorate.
After reducing the number of matters that could be included in awards to just 20 back in 1996, the government, in its failed second wave of industrial relations changes in 1999, tried to further reduce the number of allowable matters. The Senate—which, as we know, is broadly representative of the Australian community in terms of the political parties represented there—rightly rejected that legislation in its entirety. The attempt to remove picnic day holidays from awards was also in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Bill 2000. The picnic day aspect of the bill was also defeated in the Senate. In his second reading speech on that bill, the then minister—who is now the Minister for Health and Ageing—acknow-ledged that these provisions had been tried on before. He said:
The government is now in a position to introduce a further single issue bill drawn from the More Jobs, Better Pay Bill 1999.
You really have to give the government full marks for trying. This piece of legislation has been soundly rejected by the Australian parliament time and again. You would think the dummies on the other side would wake up. What they have given us in this election year is a great campaigning tool. I will make sure that every working household in the seat of Corio understands fully the implications of what the government intends to do to their wages and conditions. And it will happen again; my majority will just keep climbing. The government is at it again. It is obsessed with tearing away the award safety net that prevents the working conditions of vulnerable Australians from falling through the floor. These provisions were unacceptable in 1999, they were unacceptable in 2000 and they are certainly unacceptable now. 
Let me make some comments on major aspects of this legislation because it is very important that people understand what this government is attempting to do in this legislation. I want to make some comments about Australia's award system, that unique system of award provision in Australia that has underpinned the living standards of working people in this country for many years. This award system was established over a 100-year period. Awards ensure that conditions of employment cannot fall below a decent level. They ensure that employers cannot compete on the basis of reducing employment costs below an acceptable community standard. It is a pretty simple proposition. Even the dummies on the other side of the parliament can understand this one. There is a level of conditions that Australian workers should enjoy in the land of plenty. The traditional way of ensuring that has been the award system. 
Awards are traditionally made and varied by the relevant industrial relations commission, which makes an assessment of what is fair in all the circumstances of each case, following submissions by the affected parties. So it is not just the union movement—that great and magnificent obsession of the Liberal Party and The Nationals—that gets to argue the case before the Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire; it is all parties that have an interest in a particular issue. 
This bill subverts this whole system by simply taking away award standards through legislation, rather than giving the parties the opportunity to explain their respective cases before that independent commission. By doing this, the government further weakens the role of the independent umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission. This forms part of the concerted attack that the government has made on the Industrial Relations Commission since it came to office. In 1996, the government took away the commission's powers to settle industrial disputes and to require the parties to bargain in good faith. If a Latham Labor government is elected, one of the first things that it do will be to strengthen the role of the Industrial Relations Commission and require all parties—unions, employers and any other groups—to bargain in good faith before that commission.
The commission's power to make awards was limited to 20 allowable matters. By previous legislation the commission was required to undertake a complex and time-consuming process of stripping awards of non-allowable matters. This process would have to be repeated if this bill were passed. In the last few years, the government has blatantly disregarded the convention of making balanced appointments to the commission. It has stacked the commission with members almost exclusively from business backgrounds. This bill continues the process of undermining the commission by effectively saying to it, `It doesn't matter what you decide or what you think is appropriate for inclusion in awards; we will delete the bits we don't like through legislation.'
The bill will remove the following matters from federal awards: skill based career paths, bonuses, long service leave, notice of termination and jury service. In addition, some allowable matters would be restricted: training or education matters, the rights of unions to take part in dispute settlement procedures, and transfers from one type of employment to another. Allowances would no longer include accident make-up pay, cultural leave would be limited to ceremonial leave for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and similar types of cultural and religious observation, public holidays would only include government declared public holidays, and the scope for awards to contain matters incidental to specific allowable matters would be narrowed. I want to talk about some of these matters in great detail because they impact on my constituency—on working families in the seat of Corio.
Let us turn to the skill based career paths and training element of this bill. Removing skill based career paths and training and education matters from awards is the latest step in the Liberals' long and winding road to low skills and low wages. The Liberal way is a low road to low skills and low wages. In the 21st century the key sources of productivity growth are skills and ideas. Today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. The Howard government has failed to invest properly in skills formation in Australia and it has jeopardised future productivity growth and the prosperity that will flow to Australians from it. This was neatly summarised by the Labor senators in their report to the Senate inquiry on similar provisions in the 1999 second wave legislation. They had this to say:
The proposal to remove training and skill-based career paths from awards indicates that the Government has not properly considered its amendments to allowable award matters, or is simply motivated by an unreasonable ideological desire to downgrade the Commission and its awards.
They got the second part right. That is the real motivation of all of this. They went on to state:
As witness after witness pointed out during this Inquiry, it would be insane to remove training provisions from awards. It is not in the interests of the Australian community or the economy.
The amendment would send the wrong signal to employers and employees about the importance of training and skills formation.
For heaven's sake, we have one of the lowest levels of private sector commitment to education and training in the OECD. They continued:
Many employers and employees have spent a great deal of time establishing industry-wide training frameworks. If these industry-based structures were removed, many employers may not have the time, resources or inclination to renegotiate training and career path structures for their own workplaces.
I think that was a sensible contribution by the senators. The Productivity Commission has found that skills formation slowed down during the 1990s, making no significant contribution to productivity growth.
The Howard government wants to consign Australia to being a low skill, low wage society competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia. The government has entered vulnerable working Australians in a race to the bottom. It is a race we should never have entered and a race we should never want to win, but that is the Liberal way. Stripping skills out of the award system is callous and heartless, but again it is the Liberal way. The government is sacrificing the future living standards of working Australians.
The bill would make non-allowable any provisions about the transfer from one type of employment to another, such as the transfer of full-time, part-time or casual employees. Job security is a big issue in Australia, with 27 per cent of our work force in casual employment—that is, 2.2 million Australians—and 60 per cent of them working in the same workplace for more than a year. 
Nobody denies that casual employment can play a valuable role in providing a ready work force in peak seasonal conditions, whether it be in agriculture, tourism, hospitality or retailing. In many cases it suits employees to have a loading to compensate for no job security or leave entitlements. But in many other cases employees are employed regularly for a long time but cannot get the job security they want and need, both for peace of mind and to access home loans and other bank loans. I have working poor in my community in Geelong, people who are working as casual employees, who cannot enjoy the same access as many other Australians to the basic things that most of us take for granted.
The recently released report of the bipartisan Senate inquiry into poverty found that 21 per cent of households, or 3.6 million Australians, live on less than $400 a week—less than the minimum wage. The report said:
The prevalence of working poor households in poverty is due simply to low-wage employment. Driving this change has been the casualisation of the workforce in the last two decades and a more recent weakening of the industrial relations systems.
That is a bipartisan Senate report putting the finger on the government for its attempts to weaken the industrial relations system in this country. The Industrial Relations Commission is currently in the process of putting provisions into awards to allow regular, long-term casuals to ask to transfer to permanent employment. Employers can refuse such requests if it is unreasonable for their business. This provision is already in the metals award and the hotels award. It provides a balanced and sensible response to the issue of casual employment.
This bill would take this provision out of the awards that already have it and stop the commission from putting it into any more awards. Again, it involves this government removing choice for the work force. When the Liberal Party talks of choice it means choice for a few, not choice for all. The Industrial Relations Commission, with its skills and expertise in workplace matters, has decided that these casual conversion provisions provide an appropriate response to modern workplace issues. But the government is not only negligently ignoring modern workplace issues but also stifling efforts by other bodies that have innovative solutions to these very important matters.
I will turn to the issue of long service leave. There would not be any member of the House opposite who has not taken their long service leave at some stage, I would imagine. The proposal to remove long service leave from federal awards is, again, ridiculous. Removing long service leave would mean that workplaces would revert to relying on state long service leave laws, which vary from state to state. This could have adverse consequences for both employers and employees, depending on each particular award provision and state law.
The removal of long service leave from awards would particularly affect employers operating in more than one state. It would mean that multistate businesses that currently have one award standard for long service leave would instead have to apply several different long service leave standards depending on which state their workers are in. There are other provisions relating to the union picnic day, jury service and enterprise bargaining, but I will not make reference to them.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—Contrary to the inferences throughout the speech of the member for Corio, there is nothing in this legislation designed to reduce the remuneration of Australian workers. The only employment group to have any fears relative to this legislation are those employed in the union bureaucracy. That is not an unsubstantiated claim. Throughout the life of the Howard government, Australian workers' remuneration, measured in what they can buy for their wages—technically known as real wages—has risen every year. Throughout the period of the Hawke-Keating-Kelty government, it was openly admitted, sometimes in a boastful way, that that government had achieved a reduction in the real wages of workers. Yes, every couple of months that wonderful accord delivered them more cash, but it flowed through the economy. By the time the wife of the worker got down to the shopping centre she could actually buy less, having received an increase in wages, discounted in the first instance by the extra tax they had to pay.
The first thing we have got to understand is that this is an attempt not to achieve a reduction in the real wages of workers but to remove the various hurdles to employment. I find it quite interesting that the member for Corio said, `Who do you think you are driving the boot into?' That is not only bad grammar; that is a ridiculous statement when you realise the facts I have just put before the House. Eighty-three per cent of workers have decided it is much more attractive to deal directly with the boss than to wait for a trade union bureaucrat to go off to their mates—frequently the same people as in the past—in the Industrial Relations Commission to put all these problems in their way.
The member for Corio runs this constant campaign that has been coming from those on the opposition benches throughout this debate—hand on heart: `I'm only here to defend the workers.' Well, 83 per cent of them have said, `Buzz off.' Of the other 17 per cent, half were recorded as voting Liberal. So who are the opposition looking after? I do not know what percentage of Australian workers are employed directly in the trade union movement or associated activities such as the IRC, but they seem to be the only ones that are worried about the change in the way Australia operates.
Let me give you another fact about what happens when you start putting hurdles in employment. There has been a massive change, well recognised throughout Australia, in the availability of technology. If you have done first-year economics, it is a well-known factor that employers have always had a choice, going right back to the days of the Industrial Revolution and the Luddites—the first people who tried to stop change. An employer can use capital to buy machinery or technology, and that technology extends today, as we know from reading our newspapers and from other media, to being able to employ somebody in India to do the job in Australia for you. That is what technology is doing.
Of course, in a regime of very low interest rates, capital gets an advantage over wages. Nobody in this House is arguing for lower wages, but if there can be an easier and more productive arrangement for employing people then there is a chance that employment will get a start over capital. There is another factor in that equation; that is, if you are a small business, you frequently simply lack the capital—and lack the borrowing power because you lack the resources to back it at the bank—and/or the type of machinery you could purchase would give you productivity levels well above your customer base.
—So, lower wages for more jobs?
—So one of the best opportunities for—
—Lower wages for more jobs?
—If the member who is interjecting had two ears, he might have heard me say this has got nothing to do with wages. He of course has to worry about his own wages, as he will not be back after the next election.
—Why don't you come and run in McMillan, Wilson!
—The redistribution has caused him a little bit of trouble. I will be sorry for him, because I once claimed him as a grandson. The reality is that a small business will typically seek to employ people, because that is the nature of small businesses and they do lack that capital opportunity to buy the technology and the fancy machinery to replace workers.
In the end, as we saw the other day, there is still the good old IRC putting more hurdles between employers and the work force, giving an employer every opportunity to go home to his wife one night and say, `Look, I've had enough of this. I know we're going to take a big risk. We'll mortgage the house and we'll buy a bit of machinery so I don't have to employ any more of these people.' That is just a fact of life. We have people sitting over there who are so worried about one little employment sector—that is, the trade union bureaucracy—that they cannot see that, unless we make it more attractive to employ people, there are other options available that will be used.
That extends right down to the fact that, if everybody in this place took off their shirt, eight out of 10 of the shirts would have `Made in China' on them. Why is that? The average worker's wife does not ask too many questions about `Made in China' when she has to clothe her kids on that wage; of course she does not. The member for Corio made a big thing about abdicating our wage structures to Asia. I love this place because I love the way the Labor Party can redefine history. The protective measures that used to exist—I thought, unwisely—called tariffs, were attacked by Gough Whitlam to the tune of an across-the-board cut of 25 per cent; then, within a few days, there was a revaluation of the currency, which was a double whammy for the ability of workers to get jobs. I think it has probably been beneficial, but we all know why the Hawke-Keating government lowered tariffs and why Whitlam lowered tariffs: it was their backdoor mechanism to deregulate the labour market, because they could not, for fear of non-preselection, come into this place and bring in sensible measures of the nature we are dealing with today to free up the labour market in a fashion that made it attractive to employ workers.
Yes, a good wage and good conditions—I can prove to this House when I continue this speech later—are very attractive to workers. They do not like awards, they do not like the constrictions and, what is more, if you go back to the fifties and sixties, they did not like them then. I could never find a truck driver who wanted to work under an award; he always wanted to work on trip money. He wanted to do that and he wanted to be a small-business man in his own right. This is a situation where the Labor Party wants to put roadblocks in front of employment to protect people in one sector of employment in Australia: they are of course the trade union bureaucrats.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—It has been an extraordinary performance by the government today—a government that talk a lot about work and family but then go to extraordinary lengths in the parliament to avoid being questioned about their third-term record on work and family. I have never seen anything like it by a government. In fact, it seems a bit like the tables have been turned: we have an opposition out there setting out clear policies that are great for families, and a government that only want to play politics with national security. Things just are not what they should be.
I do not think that anyone would be surprised if the government's record did not stand up to any scrutiny—it certainly would not have stood up to scrutiny in question time—because, of course, they have no record. We have a lot of words from the Prime Minister—one minute he is in favour of paid maternity leave, the next minute he is not—but, of course, absolutely no action.
What a contrast with what Labor has presented today. Labor has presented, for the first time ever in Australia, a baby care payment for all Australian women who meet the means test. For the first time in Australia, Australian women will get the financial support that they really need when they have their babies. This is an extraordinarily exciting day for all the mothers who, for years, have been looking for a political party prepared to recognise the enormous financial pressure that young families face and the need for mothers to be able to take time off work, recover from childbirth and be with their babies.
We also know that more and more families are under enormous financial pressure and especially so when they have a new baby. At last, if a Labor government is elected, there will be substantial financial assistance for all women: women who are working, women who are at home and women who move in and out of the work force. Women who need help when their babies are born will get it from a Labor government—but nothing, of course, from the other side.
Labor's baby care payment makes no distinction between mothers in the work force and mothers who are at home. We know that mothers move constantly these days between the work force and home. We know that policies that try to categorise women as either mothers at home or mothers in the work force are not helpful.
—It is not real life.
—That is exactly right. It is not real life. It will not be a surprise to anyone here that this government wants to have everyone conform to John Howard's 1950s idea of a family: one model of a family, where the mother is at home and the dad is at work. But of course that is not the way things are anymore. We know that families are under enormous pressure, especially at the time when their lives are so turned upside down by the arrival of a newborn baby. Everybody knows, even the government itself knows, that the government's last effort to do something about newborn babies—the failed baby bonus—was an enormous flop. We also know the enormous pressure the government's family payment system is putting on families, clawing back the payments they get and penalising mothers who do move in and out of the work force. By contrast, Labor's baby care payment is for all families. There are no penalties for moving in and out of the work force—and nor should there be. There should not be any penalties for different types of families.
I have to say that just about every mum I know wants to spend as much time as she possibly can with her baby when the baby is very small. Mums do not want to have to rush back to work before they have recovered their own health and before their baby has developed some sound sleeping and feeding routines. I imagine there are a few new mums here in the parliament tonight who would agree with that.
Opposition members interjecting—
—And dads.
—Dads are obviously having trouble as well dealing with new sleeping routines. We want to make sure that all women are able to have this very special time with their baby. This should not be just for those who have managed to negotiate employer funded paid maternity leave. We know that more than 60 per cent of Australian women have no access to employer funded paid maternity leave, and we want to change that. The women who do not have access to employer funded paid maternity leave work on the factory floors, in cafes or as cleaners, hairdressers, receptionists, shop assistants—and so it goes on. The likelihood of those women who are in low-paid and casual jobs ever getting access to decent paid maternity leave without a Labor government is very slim indeed. Just like everybody else, they deserve to spend those very precious first few months with their babies and not face serious financial pressures. Those women deserve Labor's baby care payment. All these women will of course be treated equally under Labor's baby care payment. It is a very simple payment, and it is fair—unlike the baby bonus, where the more you have, the more you get. That is, of course, this government's approach in life.
As I said, this is a milestone for Australian women—a great day for Australian mothers—because Labor's baby care payment will deliver our commitment to give Australian mothers 14 weeks of paid maternity leave. This is for all mothers, whether they are working or not working. From 1 July 2005, our simple and easy to access baby care payment will give mothers $429 a fortnight for 14 weeks, tax free. That is $3,000, tax free, on the birth of their child. That payment is going to be phased in over five years, delivering the equivalent of 14 weeks pay for people on the federal minimum wage after tax by 2010. So by 2010, when they have a baby, mothers, whether they are in the work force or at home, will be able to get a payment that is the equivalent of the federal minimum wage after tax—a wonderful achievement for Australian women. When that payment is fully implemented, that will mean it reaches $5,380. It is a payment that recognises the important need to support families when their babies come along.
To maintain the value of the payment—we also know how important that is—we will index the payment to make sure that it keeps up with movements in the federal minimum wage. We will give families the option to take the payment either over 14 weeks or over a longer period of time. If families want to take it over 12 months then they will be able to do so. To make sure it is fair, we have means tested the payment according to the family tax benefit A rate. That means that all families with incomes up to $85,702 will get the full payment and then the payment will be phased out using the same phase-out as the family tax benefit part A rate has, because we want to make sure families get assistance based on need.
Family income will be assessed at the time of birth. We do not want any of the mess that is associated with this government's family payment system, which is seeing so many difficulties imposed on families because of the way in which families organise their lives these days—going in and out of the work force, sometimes working more hours and sometimes fewer hours. We do not want any of that affecting our baby care payment, so we will assess the family's income at the time of the child's birth. The payment will be very easy to apply for, will be tax free and will assist parents, who need to plan financially for that critical first year of a baby's life.
By contrast, we know some of the details about the problems with the government's baby bonus scheme. In fact, 90 per cent of the mothers who qualified for the government's baby bonus received less than $500. Under this government, 90 per cent of mothers got less than $500. Under the Labor Party's plan for a baby care payment, 90 per cent of mothers will get $3,000 in the first year. What an enormous difference with a future Labor government, who will really give enormous support to families when they really need it.
We have had the usual effort from the Treasurer, who has gone out this afternoon to find a hole in our costings—and a pretty poor effort it was on his behalf, I must say. He has tried to say that the savings from the phase-out of the baby bonus are not what we have said they are. I want to say to the Treasurer that the opposition is of course entitled to claim the amounts listed in the forward estimates of the Treasurer's own budget papers for what the government itself expects to spend on the baby bonus. But—surprise, surprise!—the government is not publishing the next two years estimates for the baby bonus.
—Why not?
—I wonder why that would be? I think it might be because the baby bonus is a complete and utter flop and the government does not want to let on that it is a total flop. Either it is a flop or it may be the case that the baby bonus is dead and nobody has been game enough to own up and tell the people who have so far been getting the baby bonus. I want to read into the Hansard a letter from Professor Peter McDonald, who actually checked the costings of Labor's baby bonus savings. I think this should put to rest any efforts by the Treasurer to make these claims. Peter McDonald said in his letter to me just recently:
In reference to the document Balancing Work and Family, Labor's baby care payment, I have examined the costings and can confirm that the costs of the proposed baby care payment are an accurate estimate of the likely costs. The savings from the abolition of the existing maternity allowance are an accurate estimate of the likely savings.
Finally, and most importantly, he said:
The calculated savings from the abolition of the baby bonus, based on several approaches to its calculation, are conservative. In other words, the savings may well be somewhat larger in fact than those shown in the document. Overall, I consider the costings and the methodology used to obtain the costings are sound.
That should put to bed any further efforts by the Treasurer. I suggest to the Treasurer that he actually get serious about making policies that might help Australian families rather than playing politics.
We know that this Prime Minister's own work and family task force have criticised their own baby bonus because, as their own document said, the baby bonus assistance was not `well timed'. They suggested it be redesigned so that it mimics the effect of a paid maternity leave scheme. The government has had this advice from its own task force for some time. What has it done? Absolutely nothing. We know that the Prime Minister went out before the election in October 2001 and said that elections were not just about the record of government, they were about how well we balanced work and family life. He said that it was so important to millions of Australians and that it was going to be the biggest social debate of our time—a barbecue-stopper. How many times have we heard that expression?
We know that the Prime Minister has not delivered anything in relation to making sure that families get the assistance when they need it. The government have no solutions whatsoever to this very tough time in families' lives. What Australian families need is Labor's baby care payment. At last we have a government in waiting—a future Labor government—that knows how to support families when they really want that support. We know that no two families are the same. We know that it is very important to acknowledge that, even though no two families are the same, each and every one of those families needs financial support on that great occasion when a new baby comes into the family. We all know that the government's policies are not doing that. Labor is saying to the government: `Get out of the way, because you clearly do not have any policies that are going to support families when they need it.' It is time that all families got a helping hand from a future Labor government at the time when their baby is born. This is why families need Labor's baby care payment—a payment that will make all the difference to new families when their baby comes along. We look forward to having the opportunity to implement it.

"Anthony, Larry, MP",NATS,2004-03-31,"—It is interesting to look at why Labor decided to launch their baby care policy today. I think there are a number of critical questions: why today, where did it come from and how is it going to be paid for? The sudden release of this policy today is interesting. The only reason this policy was released today was to cause a massive distraction from the sheer embarrassment and inept policy handling of the ALP's position—and particularly that of the member for Werriwa, the leader of the ALP—on the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. There is no other reason why this policy of the baby care payment was released today. I can just imagine the tactics committee last night, after the sheer embarrassment of the House being misled on three occasions about the credibility and the trust of the Leader of the Opposition. In a desperate move to try to put more static and more confusion out there, they suddenly released this policy. It was released in a hastily organised media stunt today in Queanbeyan, with one of their candidates there. The release of the baby care policy was meant to be a distraction, a lifeline to the Leader of the Opposition to get him off the hook for his inept and inaccurate handling of the issue of the troops in Iraq.
He has been trapped by loose lips. If he picked up the paper of choice of the people in Werriwa or anywhere in Sydney he would see the headline: `Latham trapped by his loose lips'. Of course, Labor went into damage control. They said: `Let's put a diversion out there,' just like they tried to create a diversion the night before with ATSIC. That was the only reason that the policy was suddenly released. They thought,  `We've got to try and confuse the public.' The critical issue of the element of trust and character in relation to national security was being questioned by the Australian public because the Leader of the Opposition had misled the House. One way to try to regain character, to regain trust, was to come back to his pet subject: children. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is being used as a political football today to distract from his inept handling of the issue. We have witnessed that quite clearly on the numerous occasions when he has misled the House.
It was exactly the same case with ATSIC yesterday. There is no difference. I wonder what policy the Labor Party will run out tomorrow to try to create a diversion. I have to say that the gall is breathtaking. The Leader of the Opposition misled parliament. He is in a serious position in that his character, integrity and trustworthiness are being challenged because he has reconstructed and fabricated the events of not only the last couple of weeks but last year to do with the very sensitive issue of national security. Where did they come up with this idea for a baby care bonus? It is interesting to look at it. You would think that the member for Werriwa and the ALP would be very good at creating new policy. We know they are not. Basically, the ATSIC policy which they announced the other day is something which the government has been working through very thoroughly. I am sure there will be changes made later on.
The recommendations for this came from a work and family task force document. The member for Lilley has been scurrying around befriending public servants or perhaps looking in wheelie bins, and we find out that they have plagiarised the work and family task force recommendations. It was not so long ago that the member for Lilley was very proudly distributing a leaked work and family task force document to the press gallery, but he was not actually going to release it. He has been talking about working on this particular baby payment now for months and months. What a load of rubbish! Actually, they have probably been working on this for the last six weeks, since they illegally received a work and family task force document—since it was leaked to them. And we in the government have looked at many different options. 
The Leader of the Opposition says, `We've been working on this for months.' I have to say that I reckon, in the last 48 hours, they were scrambling through the work and family task force document on the Google site. They are so slack that they could not even come up with a new name for their policy. It is actually called the baby care payment. I will not be tabling the cabinet in confidence baby care payment document, because the member for Lilley already has it. It is exactly the same: they have plagiarised from a work and family task force document and they have come up with this notion that it is new policy.
This is absolutely all about plagiarism. Again, it is about the issue of trust, integrity and character. It all started when the Leader of the Opposition, soon after he became the leader, talked about this `ladder of opportunity'. We know where that came from: it was a direct quote that was used by his arch enemy, as he colourfully portrays the President of the United States, who copied it from President Reagan, who copied it from Winston Churchill. He is very good at plagiarism. I was interested to listen to him at the National Press Club not so long ago where he was talking about this crisis of masculinity and community empowerment, which is all interesting stuff. He was saying, `We need to build stronger families to build better communities' as if it was a new revelation. Again, that is wonderful plagiarism. It was actually taken by John Winston Howard. That is our policy—stronger families and communities. But this is a new policy that he was going to pursue. He has plagiarised his raison d'etre, which is his ladder of opportunity. That was copied. We know that the work and family policy was copied, just as he is trying to mimic the Prime Minister on ATSIC and, interestingly, we see it with this announcement today. They had the gall to not even change the name.
You have to ask yourself why this sudden burst of new policy? It is pretty unusual. It is because he and the ALP know that the tactics and decisions that were made—and the Leader of the Opposition does not consult with his backbench on anything, particularly on national security—are being judged very harshly by the Australian public. We witnessed that today in the parliament, we witnessed it yesterday and I suggest that we will witness it tomorrow. And why shouldn't they be judged harshly when he has misled this parliament? He talks about integrity, truth and character, yet on the most important issue that anyone can talk about—that is, our national security—he is manipulating and reconstructing history, just as he tried to reconstruct history today with this particular baby care payment.
The federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, who I think we all have regard for because she says it as it is, says that the Labor maternity payment scheme is a start but it is not actually maternity leave. This is a welfare payment, not maternity leave. Interestingly, Labor have also decided to tie it to family tax benefits. There is some logic to that, because it is going to be means tested. It is strange, because the ALP have been bagging the family tax benefit policy since the day it was introduced—and the very element that the member for Lilley is given oxygen on is trying to discredit the family tax benefits system—yet this is the very system that they are going to be operating their baby bonus off. This is extraordinary. At one moment, Labor are prepared to bag it as a failed system; the next minute, they are quite happy to use it as the structure for their policy. That is interesting.
Again, what they say and what they do are two different things. If they are really interested in helping families with young children, they might try and pass the legislation which would give top-up payments to 35,000 families that deserve it. But here they are, twisting and turning. The government have dramatically increased payments in relation to the family tax benefits policy, which benefits 2 million adults and 3½ million children. Up to the last reconciliation in December, 72 per cent of people are either going to get paid more or their correct entitlement. We now know that Labor are going to be endorsing this policy and using it as a way of means testing for this new payment.
The critical issue is that we know why Labor put this policy out today: diversionary tactics. And, firstly, the central issue of any political party and their leader comes down to trust and integrity, and that is seriously under question. Secondly, we know that Labor have copied our policy. Thirdly, we know that they are going to fly off the family tax benefits system. Fourthly, you have to ask yourself how they are going to pay for it. How are they going to pay for this $2.2 billion? They are going to rob from Peter to pay Paul. They are going to rob from Mary to pay Susan.
Labor are going to cut Medicare; they are going to cut the employer advocate; they are going to abolish general employment entitlements, the GEER scheme; they are going to abolish Invest Australia; they are going to axe ABARE and much more. This is the central crux of their argument today—whatever the merits of it are. How is it going to be funded? It is going to be funded by removing a substantial element in the latest Medicare package which, in particular, was a safety net providing $300 to those who are concessional card holders or $700 to those who are not concessional card holders or on some type of social security payment. They are going to rob from the family with one hand when it comes to their health and give it back with another. This is just outrageous. I am surprised that they chose Medicare. If you are going to create a policy that will help families, there are many other elements you could choose, but you would not touch health. They will be reminded of this day in, day out until election day.
The other area which is extraordinary—and this I suppose shows the contempt of the Leader of the Opposition in particular and also of many other members of the Labor Party—is that they want to axe the Australian Bureau of Rural Science. They want to cut ABARE's budget by 25 per cent too. They do not care whatsoever about the welfare of Australian families that live in regional and rural Australia. ABARE, for instance, was the organisation that helped deliver and brought about the drought declarations. Here is an organisation that has swung into gear over the last couple of years to try and do some assessments to help struggling families and their kids, who are really doing it tough—and of course they wanted those drought declarations so they could get exceptional circumstances status. What is the Labor Party going to do? They say, `That's okay, you can have your kids: we will give you some more money if you have babies, but we are not going to give you anything else, because we have actually shut down some of the departments that do that assessment.' That begs the question of what consultation there has been with the backbench. Absolutely none.
—It is about a baby bonus.
—This is how you are going to fund your baby bonus. You are going to fund it by cutting Medicare. You are going to fund it by getting rid of some of these agencies. Invest Australia is another good example. That organisation has created 28 new investments, leading to a total investment expenditure of just under $300 million in the last financial year: 1,900 jobs were created. Again, they are going to axe it. `That's fine,' they say, `we're going to pay the baby bonus, but we're actually going to axe an organisation that is trying to encourage employment.' Why do we try to encourage employment? Because we are trying to give families a head start and to create more opportunities. The best opportunity you can give families, of course, is to give them a job—to give them a job and a world-class Medicare system and to put in a safety net, which we have done; and, of course, to give them educational opportunities.
As for when it comes to a job, what are they going to do? When it comes to redundancy payments, they are actually going to get rid of them. This government was the one that introduced general employment entitlements particularly—and redundancy entitlements. The Labor Party never did that. They always talk about representing the worker, and yet they are going to cut that. After 13 years they never introduced it; we introduced it. They are going to introduce something which is virtually like a payroll tax. That is what they are going to do. 
Interestingly, they talk about protecting entitlements, but they are not protecting entitlements at all. This is just about them finding a desperate way ahead last night—they cooked it up. They were in a jam: `Our credibility has been damaged. How are we going to get this policy up? We are going to find a way of raiding the cookie jar in a few other areas so that we can at least justify our financial credibility.' The haste of this decision demonstrates whether there is an actual commitment to helping Australian families. Knowingly, they are going to take money out of Medicare; knowingly, they are going to abolish entitlement schemes; knowingly, they are going to disadvantage Australians living in rural communities. Interestingly, $113 million to help fund the $2.2 billion will come from getting rid of the Office of the Employment Advocate. The Office of the Employment Advocate is the organisation that was recommended to be put in place because of the corruption within the building industry, particularly within the trade union movement. The opposition want to get rid of that office so that there can be greater unionisation—and we know that when there is greater unionisation there are more strikes, more families out of work and more kids disadvantaged.
I have to say that it is breathtaking today to see that the announcement of this particular policy has been done clearly to create a smokescreen. I think even the member for Hunter knows that. We know they are not consulting with their backbench. Interestingly, we see in a headline in the paper: `MPs demand Latham stop ignoring them.' This is a constant pattern. Let us go through it again: there was the ATSIC announcement. That again is a policy area that we have been working on for many months to try and get greater accountability. The announcement today is an absolute fraud. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—What is breathtaking is the last 15 minutes of drivel from the minister, who could not even address the issue that was in his portfolio. He could not even talk about his government's failure to act. They are the government. One of these days they should wake up and realise that. They have been the government now for quite a while. They should stop buck-passing and they should stop ignoring the families of Australia. Labor has been listening to Australian families, and we have been hearing them. We have been consulting with the people we represent. We are not just out there talking the talk; we are out there talking the talk and walking it as well. We have delivered the policy—the policy the Prime Minister has been talking about in vague terms now since the last election: he has come up with nothing. That is what the minister should have addressed today: the failure of this government to actually do anything for struggling families. We know they are struggling, we know they are under the pump and we know they are stressed about how to get by, and so we are doing something about it. They are worried, and they are worried about how to give their children the best start in life.
These strains are particularly heavy when a newborn is on its way and when it arrives. While the birth of a child is the most joyous thing, it is also a very difficult time. It is a very difficult decision to make. Parents worry about whether they can afford to forgo one parent's income—in most cases, the mother's; in my case, the father's—in those important first few months. Mothers worry about whether they are physically able to have this child: `Will I physically be able to breastfeed my child for at least six weeks—and in those first vital six weeks sometimes six, seven or eight times a day and sometimes six, seven or eight times a night as well—and then get up and go to work the next day?' That is the pressure this lack of government action is actually putting on women. `Will my workplace support my decision to stay at home or will there be harsh consequences in the long run?' These are the real-life things facing families today, particularly women. Women are choosing actually not to have children. They are summing these things up and saying, `It is all too hard and I am not doing it.' We have seen that in our plummeting birth rates. We have seen that women are deciding that they do not want to risk being discriminated against in their workplaces and they are choosing not to sacrifice careers and incomes to have babies. The Prime Minister's own cabinet report on work and family recognises this. It states:
Parents ... face an abrupt change in their finances in the period following the child's arrival. Their family income often falls substantially at the same time as they have to cope with the direct costs of having a child
That was in the report commissioned by the Prime Minister and then ignored by him and his cabinet. It is no wonder that in these pressurised times, one-third of working new mothers return to work less than 26 weeks after having their baby. This includes 12 per cent of employed new mothers who return to work after less than 13 weeks.
This is a sad and difficult reality for many new mothers and it is not good for their physical and mental health. Going through childbirth requires a period of physical recovery and respite. I can speak from the harsh reality of experience. I came back to work three weeks after my first child was born, and I came back to parliament after six weeks. I was back in this House with a brand-new baby when she was six weeks old, and it was insanity. I can say from personal experience that that was insanity.
—There were lots of aunts and uncles, though.
—There were lots of aunts and uncles. There was terrific, great support. I had my husband here, we were all together and my husband got to bond with our baby, but I was on another planet. I was so tired, I was so exhausted and I did not know what was going on. So I can tell you from bitter personal experience that you cannot do it—nor should you do it. We should not be forcing women in the work force to actually undertake that.
The second time around, when I was not in my first term in parliament, I actually saw the light. I looked at what the member for Lindsay had done in her first pregnancy, having three months off, and did the same thing. I timed it a bit better in the sitting patterns and came back when John was 12 weeks old. It was still pretty hard, but at least it was better than being up here post my first child's birth, trying to breastfeed and trying to exist in this place and still function and sound like a rational human being with a six-week-old baby. Several of us on this side of the House know from bitter experience that you should not do it. For your own physical wellbeing and certainly for your child's wellbeing you should not do it.
The early weeks are also a period of transition, and many women find them emotionally challenging. This is often a period in which, if you overstress yourself, postnatal depression falls in. There is also the question of the importance of breastfeeding for women's health as protection against breast cancer, as well as for the child's health. This has been accepted by this government. It is government policy to encourage breastfeeding in accordance with World Health Organisation standards. Australian public health targets propose that up to 80 per cent of children should be partially breastfed up to six months of age. It is so beneficial for their good start in life, particularly in cases like mine where there are allergies in the family. It really ensures that you protect against allergies and asthma if you can last that first six months. If you can keep going for even longer, as some people do, good luck to you. But the government has ignored a measure—a baby care payment—which would support new mothers in being able to continue to breastfeed.
Many fathers are also losing out. They are being forced to work long hours in an attempt to compensate their family for the mother's loss of income. This denies many men their wish to spend more time bonding with their babies. So at a time when they have a brand-new baby at home and they would love to spend some time with it and would love to spend some time supporting their partners through that difficult stage, they cannot, because they are out earning a lot more money. Even working in this place, where we earn a fairly good salary, in my household we certainly noticed when my husband's salary dropped. Even now that he is back part-time in the work force his entire salary goes on child care—we are actually in the negative with my husband working, because it all goes on child care. But you have to make these decisions. You make these life choices.
For all these reasons, our announcement today that we will introduce a new baby care payment is great news for families. Our payment will give parents some financial security so they can concentrate on their babies' wellbeing—and their own. The government has been talking about it and talking about it, dithering on, but it has done absolutely nothing. We are the ones accused of being a policy vacuum, but this government has done nothing. The Prime Minister said on radio back in July 2002:
The report is accurate in so far as it says that we are looking at a range of policies to assist families with children to better balance their work and family responsibilities. This is the biggest ongoing social debate of our time, I call it a barbeque stopper.
That was in July 2002. He trotted out another release in December 2003 and again talked the talk but did not walk the walk.
There is absolutely nothing this government has done to help, unlike the ALP, who have announced today—and not as any distraction, because most families are actually asking us to stop talking about Iraq and national security and to start talking about the things that are important to them—that all eligible mothers, in and out of the work force, will receive the payment. Unlike the government, which again and again reverts to the 1950s model of families by favouring mothers who stay at home, Labor believe in an environment which gives women a choice—a real choice—and does not discriminate against any mother for the personal choices she makes. Our payment will give mothers in paid work the financial support to take time off work, while also lifting the financial burden on families with only one income coming in.
No matter whether a mother is in paid work or working at home, a new baby means a mountain of expenses. I can tell you from recent experience that that is true. For many Australian families on low incomes those expenses are too high and they have to face the heartbreaking choice of what to go without. No parent wants to feel that they have disadvantaged their child. Imagine choosing at the moment whether to spend $500 on the pneumococcal vaccine or $500 to clothe and feed your child. You tell me if that is reasonable. Families need balance and they need hope. They do not need any more false hope and rhetoric from this government. They need a Labor government, one that will provide support when it is needed—at the birth of a child—not some blithering $500 maybe a couple of years later and at a level which is meaningful: $3,000 will be meaningful. This is great news for Australian families, and it is only the Labor Party that will deliver it to them.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—The rights of women are not, unfortunately, the purpose of this exercise today. I have not detected opposite a genuine commitment to the needs of women. This serious policy issue, which is important to women at a critical time of their lives when they are having babies, has today been turned into a diversion, thrown into this parliament at about a day's notice to shield the opposition leader. As somebody who has been through all of the things the member for Chisholm has described, with my own three children—but I will not go into that today—I am quite disgusted that this has been used as a tactic on a day like this. On a day when the opposition wish to surround the critical issue of national security with a fog of their own making, designed to obscure their muddling incompetence over the opposition leader's attitude to the troops in Iraq, they have rushed to release this policy. But I am happy to speak about it and about the important policy issues and the discussion that we should be having relating to families and the help that governments can and should give families.
I want to set on record what we have done. We have provided nearly $6,000, on average, a year in family tax benefit payments to two million Australian families. We have cut effective marginal tax rates. We have spent more than $8 billion on child care in the past six years. We have now funded 518,000 child-care places, and that is a real on-the-ground measure that makes it much easier for families to achieve the balance between work and family about which so many people speak. With the baby bonus, we have delivered an extra $170 million into household budgets. Of course, Labor says that this is all going to higher income families, and that is just plain wrong—82 per cent of payments for the baby bonus goes to people with taxable incomes of $20,000 or less a year. We have a maternity allowance of I think $842 for a single birth and a maternity immunisation allowance. I have just outlined a comprehensive set of genuinely family friendly policies, whereas Labor has decided to increase the number of dollars aimed at only one area—the baby stage of life. The previous speaker mentioned $3,000, but the payment actually rises to $5,380 in 2009-10. Interestingly, if the opposition wins government at the next election, the measure will not come in straightaway. It will not come in until the 2006 financial year.
But let us take the proposition that more money is needed to help parents and that this is a genuinely good use of dollars for social policy. I ask the question: when do parents really need help with their kids? There is a proposition that kids tend to get more expensive as they get older. We all know that teenagers cost a fortune. They want their own room, they attend parties and they go out with their friends, at great expense to their parents. School fees and particularly clothes cost a lot of money. Researchers at the University of Canberra have found that parents spend $213 a week on their 15- to 17-year-olds—almost five times what they spend on children under five.
Generally I know that parents' incomes increase over the course of their careers, but this is not the case for families whose incomes are fairly stagnant over the course of their working lives. There is a strong argument that these families actually need help when their children are teenagers. I guess these are the families that Labor should be helping. These are the families that Labor claims as their own. But instead we see Labor putting more money into the baby stage of life.
Of course it is important to support parents of new babies. There are all sorts of reasons for this, one of the main ones being that one parent often gives up an income at that time. That is why we have put in place the extensive system of family payments that we have, but the question is: should we be increasing baby and maternity payments, in line with what we have heard from those opposite? Should we be paying $5,380 for a birth in 2009-10 to someone who has a baby? Should we be taking money from other programs or uses and prescribing them for this specific purpose? If we need more money, should we be raising new taxes to pay for this? I see in the ALP's announcement of the measure today that the paperwork trumpets, almost gleefully, `Labor's baby care payment will be funded by the Commonwealth government, thereby placing no financial costs on businesses.' Implicit in this statement is the view that no-one has to worry about finding the money that the Commonwealth government gives out, because the Commonwealth just has money. So they are saying, `Don't worry. We're not going to raise taxes from businesses, we're not going to get into that sticky argument with employers about funding employer paid maternity leave, because we, the Commonwealth, are going to pay.' And that is what you see in a lot of Labor policy and that is the problem. Because the government, as we know, do have to find the money from somewhere. They have to either cut existing programs or raise taxes.
Given that this is a Commonwealth payment, I would have expected the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to be quite pleased about it, but they put out a media release just this afternoon and they are most unhappy. The media release is entitled, `Unacceptable funding conditions on ALP baby care payment'. I thought, `What has upset them about this?' Then I find that the funding basis announced by Labor means that Australian industry would still indirectly pay for this government benefit. One of the things that ACCI has said that it will cut is GEERS, under which we the government provide $2.2 billion for employees who have been made redundant. Labor says, `We'll take that $2.2 billion to pay for the baby care payment, as well as the cuts we're going to make to the Medicare safety net to pay for the baby care payment. And, of course, we're going to put another levy in place on Australian employers, which is probably going to be a 0.1 per cent payroll tax on all Australian employers, to fund an employee entitlements redundancy scheme.' So it just makes no sense at all.
This money grabbing exercise from various different programs does not present a problem to the Labor Party. It probably does not present a problem if, in the end, taxes have to go up and borrowing has to go up. But it does present a problem to us because, unlike Labor, we do not have a policy of tax, spend and interfere. We believe in keeping taxes low and allowing families to exercise choice in how they spend the extra in their pay packet. There are, of course, different philosophical points of view. Considered objectively, they are all valid. Whether you support them or not just depends on your own value system. But I do say that, if the Labor Party are going to decide for us what we do with our dollars, then maybe they should allocate them with greater care. If this is their social policy, why is it their social policy? Why are they making this particular policy? What makes this particular level of funding to this particular small group of families—at the stage when they are having babies—better than, say, a special payment to parents whose children are older or a special payment to poorer working families when their children become teenagers and put so much pressure on the family budget and on families generally? What about a special payment to parents who lose their jobs or who are recovering from long illnesses? Why this particular special payment? I say: do not add more dollars to our perfectly adequate set of payments just because it looks good, sounds good and supposedly resonates with the electorate.
There is another important reason for keeping taxes low—and this is a reason so often overlooked by those opposite. It is that lower taxes are vital for our economy. High corporate taxes drive business offshore, high individual taxes kill incentive. We need a tax system that pays for our health, education and defence and cares for our aged, but we need one that rewards effort and economic enterprise and keeps tax rates as low as possible. This government has a full suite of family payments and baby payments. As I have said, they include: maternity allowance, maternity immunisation allowance and the baby bonus. They strike a reasonable balance between the need families have at this stage of their lives—when they lose one income so often—the need for taxes to be kept at a reasonable level and the need for society as a whole to be looked after.
Here we have a measure from the Labor Party that will ultimately put pressure on government spending and ultimately has the potential to increase taxes. That means more tax out of workers' wages and less money for their kids. If elected, the Labor Party will have the opportunity to increase taxes such as the GST, supported by nine state Labor governments. It will reduce the buying power of families. If we borrow money to fund this and similar exercises, interest rates will of course increase. What encouragement is that for our typical average family to add an extension to their home—borrow some money and build an extra room for the kids? I come back to where I started, which is that this MPI has been introduced into the House under a smokescreen. The subject deserves better discussion and a more bipartisan approach.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-03-31,"—I welcome the opportunity to rise to support the member for Jagajaga's motion on the need for a new baby care payment so that families get timely financial assistance when their babies are born. We are here today to talk about baby care assistance and family assistance, not the launch of an ALP policy. This is a day when you would think that we were having an election next week. It has been a day full of electioneering rhetoric with little substance. The PM abandoned question time in order to waste—yes, waste—the precious time of this House on a motion attacking the Leader of the Opposition on a political stunt driven by the media.
Let us talk about the important issue of childbirth and supporting mothers and families during this time. The opposition has today promised to scrap the government's current baby bonus and replace it with a new means tested baby care payment that would give new mothers up to $5,380 by 2010. The opposition leader has said the payment would start at $3,000 from July 2005 but would increase to $5,380 by the time it was fully phased in five years later, assuming they win government.
The Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward, has given Labor's baby care payment package a conditional thumbs-up. She said the baby care payment, as it stands, has essentially favoured women with high incomes. However, she has also pointed out that, while the proposal is a step in the right direction in providing more support for families, it does fall short of paid maternity leave. She said, `It is not a minimum wage replacement for women and is means tested on the family income at the time of birth, which means it includes the partner's income.' In 2002, Ms Goward had recommended women get 14 weeks paid maternity leave at the federal minimum wage. She went on to say at that time, `The proposed initial payment of $3,000 falls far short of this,' and `Let's hope this proposal is the beginning of a policy bidding war, not the high point.'
It should be remembered that Australia is one of the last developed countries in the world without a national scheme of paid maternity leave for new parents. Paid leave gives women time to recover from childbirth. We have heard in this debate the problems that women face during that period—before, during and after childbirth—and especially if they are working mothers. Paid leave gives women time to recover from childbirth, to breastfeed and to bond with their baby, while keeping their attachment to their work. It is good for women, babies, their families and the community in general, yet in Australia fewer than four out of every 10 women have access to paid leave on the birth of a child. Most men have little or no special leave when their child is born. This is well short of international standards. In most OECD countries people have six months leave, and the United Kingdom has just extended its 18-week scheme to 26 weeks.
The Howard government says paid parental leave should be left to employees to arrange with their employer, but just 3.4 per cent of certified agreements contain paid leave, and certified agreements change over time, so this entitlement could be lost in future negotiations. Most Australians who have access to paid parental leave earn about $40,000 a year, are highly skilled, professional workers, and are employed mostly in large organisations. At the University of Wollongong, we had access to such a scheme. This means that the people who most need help with the additional costs of having a child—that is, those on low to middle incomes and people working for small businesses—are missing out. This is unacceptable. Australia's national government needs to play a major role if working people are to have access to paid parental leave, irrespective of their industrial bargaining power.
The Australian Greens recognise the importance of caring work. People caring for others should be supported. The Greens have developed a paid parental leave scheme that includes 18 weeks of paid leave at replacement income up to average weekly earnings and no less than the federal minimum wage; a further 34 weeks of unpaid leave, with a right to return to work to the same or equivalent position, or to work part-time; payment to full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal, contract and self-employed workers who have been employed for 40 of the previous 52 weeks, or those who are not currently employed but have been employed for 52 of the previous 104 weeks; allowing partners to share the leave and making it available for adopting a child—it is becoming more common in our society that the partner has a real role to play in those immediate weeks following the birth of a child; employers paying superannuation for the period of paid leave and being encouraged to top-up wages of those earning above average weekly wages; and a review after three years, with the aim of extending paid leave to 26 weeks, as is being done in the UK, and unpaid leave to 18 months, providing a total of two years.
Independent costing for the Greens shows that this scheme could be funded immediately by scrapping the regressive baby bonus—which pays more to the wealthy than the needy—making family tax payments more equitable and providing savings from introducing a paid parental leave scheme. That means the Howard government has no more excuses for denying Australians a decent paid parental leave scheme. It is vital that Australia's scheme meets international standards and guidelines, and that it acknowledges paid parental leave as a work entitlement, not a welfare issue. Our policy is designed to replace income for the time a parent is caring for a newborn child or a newly adopted child. Paid parental leave should not be means tested, but the payment should be assessable for tax purposes, just like wages. In this way, those who most need the income will benefit most. In summary, the Greens will continue to fight for paid parental leave as we believe it is a fundamental right of working parents, especially women, to choose to take time to spend with their children when they are first born, and we acknowledge the importance of this issue.

"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following report: Report 398—Review of Auditor-General's reports 2002-2003 fourth quarter.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The committee reviewed 34 Auditor-General's reports tabled during the fourth quarter of 2002-03 and selected three for further examination at public hearings. These were Audit report No. 42: Managing residential aged care accreditation; Audit report No. 51: Defence housing and relocation services; and Audit report No. 55: Goods and services tax: fraud prevention and control. In essence, the committee probed the operational efficiency and the maintenance of the integrity of three nationally important management systems: aged care accreditation; Australian Defence Force housing costs and availability; and goods and services tax fraud control. Rather than discussing the committee's findings in great detail, I would like to highlight the significant observations that emerged from each of the three reviews.
Aged care is increasingly important to an already sizeable and ever-growing sector in the Australian community. Accreditation of aged care homes by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency seeks to underwrite the quality standards of those aged care facilities. The aged care accreditation system experienced some early teething problems. Although accreditation of residential aged care facilities was established in 1997, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency could not commence audits until the gazettal of principles in September 1999. This left the agency with a severe time constraint which contributed to inefficiencies and to inconsistencies in judgments and decisions during the first round of accreditations. The committee notes, however, that many of the early problems associated with maintaining accreditation standards, deriving from the peaking of the agency's workload around three-year accreditation cycles, are now being resolved. The committee is satisfied that an acceptable level of consistency was achieved during the second cycle of accreditation, which is now complete.
I remind the House that this inquiry was not about the quality of aged care per se, but rather it was about monitoring systemic standards that would deliver quality improvements in aged care homes. Although evidence showed that clinical quality improvements have ensued, the committee sought to discover whether residents' quality of life had actually been enhanced since accreditation commenced. No witness could provide convincing evidence that it had. This is not to say that quality of life has not improved; it is just that no supporting data were proffered. Hence, the committee recommends that quality of life information be collected along with the clinical data for feeding into accreditation decisions. The committee is adamant though that there must be no additional costs incurred by aged care facilities in meeting these broader criteria. Nor should the accreditation process be more complicated.
I will now comment on the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the agreement between the Department of Defence and the Defence Housing Authority—an independent commercial entity established to manage the provision of housing and relocation services to Australian Defence Force personnel. The committee notes that housing classification inflexibility has meant that Australian Defence Force housing demand is not always being matched cost-effectively by commercial market supply. Review of the classifications may be necessary to resolve this issue.
The Defence Housing Authority Act 1987 requires three Defence Force personnel to sit on the Defence Housing Authority. This poses some potential for conflict of interest. I will explain my point this way. The Department of Defence negotiates with the Defence Housing Authority over housing contracts. It is conceivable, therefore, that Australian Defence Force members on the Defence Housing Authority may end up in the future having to negotiate with themselves.
The committee recommends that the requirement to have three Australian Defence Force personnel sit on the Defence Housing Authority be removed from the Defence Housing Authority Act 1987. To provide an alternative avenue for Australian Defence Force personnel to have a voice in strategic decisions affecting their housing, the committee recommends that the role of the existing Defence Domiciliary Group be expanded to include a formal consultation function with the Defence Housing Authority.
I turn now to the third review, which undoubtedly has potentially broader consequences—that is, GST fraud control. The committee recognises how fundamentally important it is to have the nation's taxation system operate free of fraudulent behaviour. This point was reinforced by the Australian Taxation Office officials who acknowledged at the hearing that containing goods and services tax fraud indeed poses a significant challenge for the Australian Taxation Office. The committee is pleased to note that Australia's goods and services tax system compares favourably with systems of similar type used overseas. This is, in the main, due to thorough preparatory research by the Australian Taxation Office of relevant international value added tax regimes. So the system is good.
The committee found, however, that GST fraud remains a major tax revenue loss area. The committee is seriously concerned with not only the revenue loss but also the potentially destructive impact on taxpayers should any laxity by the authorities in pursuing tax dues connote a wrong signal to all taxpayers. GST fraud is prevalent in the cash economy but determining the magnitude of the cash economy has proved to be difficult. The committee endorses the efforts of the Australian Taxation Office to capture tax owing on cash transactions using a variety of tools. Australian business number registration and monitoring has been particularly successful.
To date, major fraud has been heavily targeted for investigation and prosecution. The committee is pleased that minor fraud is now increasingly being captured cost-effectively using tools such as a tax evasion hotline. In addition, digital systems are being employed to risk rate GST payers and by so doing prevent fraud before it happens. The Australian Taxation Office has also upgraded its noncompliance capability and is in the process of installing a new case management system that will record and report on goods and services tax fraud. 
The committee is concerned, however, that instances of `borderline fraud' appear to be escaping prosecution because the relevant statutory definitions of `fraud' are too stringent. The Australian Taxation Office is instead forced to handle this range of fraud administratively. To give the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions greater clout to prosecute `borderline fraud' successfully, the committee recommends that the proof of fraud be eased marginally through amendments to appropriate statutes.
In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people from the several government agencies and private organisations who contributed to the reviews by preparing submissions and giving valuable evidence at public hearings. I also wish to thank the members of the committee, particularly my vice-chair, Ms Plibersek, for their time and dedication in the conduct of these inquiries.

"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following report: Report 398—Review of Auditor-General's reports 2002-2003 fourth quarter.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The committee reviewed 34 Auditor-General's reports tabled during the fourth quarter of 2002-03 and selected three for further examination at public hearings. These were Audit report No. 42: Managing residential aged care accreditation; Audit report No. 51: Defence housing and relocation services; and Audit report No. 55: Goods and services tax: fraud prevention and control. In essence, the committee probed the operational efficiency and the maintenance of the integrity of three nationally important management systems: aged care accreditation; Australian Defence Force housing costs and availability; and goods and services tax fraud control. Rather than discussing the committee's findings in great detail, I would like to highlight the significant observations that emerged from each of the three reviews.
Aged care is increasingly important to an already sizeable and ever-growing sector in the Australian community. Accreditation of aged care homes by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency seeks to underwrite the quality standards of those aged care facilities. The aged care accreditation system experienced some early teething problems. Although accreditation of residential aged care facilities was established in 1997, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency could not commence audits until the gazettal of principles in September 1999.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, I move:
That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for works in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 23 March 2004, namely: Extension of approval for the temporary vehicle barriers around Parliament House to remain until 31 March 2005.
The Presiding Officers have recently considered a number of recommendations dealing with security issues affecting Parliament House. One of these issues includes the replacement of the existing temporary vehicle barrier with a permanent arrangement. Design development of a system to replace the temporary vehicle barrier is being developed by the Department of Parliamentary Services using MGT Canberra Architects and Mr Romaldo Giurgola, the original architect of Parliament House. The design is being developed in consultation with the National Capital Authority. 
The Department of Parliamentary Services is committed to giving the highest priority to the replacement of the existing temporary vehicle barrier with a permanent arrangement. Providing that a suitable design can be developed and agreed and appropriate funding is made available, it is planned to have the permanent arrangement in place by 31 March 2005.
This motion proposes an extension of time for the existing temporary vehicle barrier until 31 March next year. Under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the Presiding Officers are responsible for works within the parliamentary precincts, and the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads is responsible for other works in the parliamentary zone. Accordingly, this motion is moved on behalf of the Speaker and the President. There are no costs associated with the proposal to extend the approval. The National Capital Authority has given works approval, and I commend the motion to the House.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 establish the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme that provides for payment of a cleaner fuel grant to importers and manufacturers of cleaner fuels. The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme gives effect to two measures in the 2003-04 budget. The first of these relates to fuel tax reform and the second to the cleaner fuels component of the Energy Grants Credits Scheme in line with the Measures for a Better Environment commitment to encourage conversion from the dirtiest fuels to the most appropriate and cleanest fuels.
Under the provisions of the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003, an entity will be entitled to a cleaner fuel grant if it imports or manufactures cleaner fuels. These reforms are part of the long-term reform by the government of existing fuel tax arrangements. The reforms establish a broad, sustainable taxation framework for fuels by addressing a number of anomalies in the current fuel tax system and providing increased long-term certainty for investors and providing time for industry to adjust.
The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill brings the administration of the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme under the administrative and compliance framework of the Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000. This aligns the administration of the scheme with that of the other payment schemes administered by the Australian Taxation Office. The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme will apply from 18 September 2003.
The Senate amendments will provide a longer excise-free period for alternative fuels, including biodiesel, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas and methanol, which will provide greater certainty for industry players and a longer period for adjustment into an excise-paying environment. These long-term reforms will establish a fairer and more transparent fuel tax excise system, with improved competitive neutrality between fuels, and the timing strikes a balance between desirable fuel tax reform and the appropriate period of adjustment for affected industries. The Senate amendments extend the excise-free period on currently untaxed fuels by three years and define the cleaner fuels for which grants will be payable as biodiesel, ethanol, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, methanol and liquefied petroleum gas.
Under the amendments, grants will be payable to fully offset excise and customs duty imposed on biodiesel from 18 September 2003 until 30 June 2011. Grants will also paid to partially offset any excise or customs duty imposed on biodiesel, ethanol, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, methanol and liquefied petroleum gas for a period of four years from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2015.
The grants will reduce in five even annual instalments from 1 July 2011 to 1 July 2015, raising the effective rate for each fuel from zero before 1 July 2011 to the final rate from 1 July 2015. This will provide greater certainty for industry and a longer period for adjustment into an excise-paying environment. The timing strikes a balance between desirable fuel tax reform and the appropriate period of adjustment for affected industries. The extension of the excise-free period will give confidence to industry proponents, who argued that the original five-year excise-free period was not sufficient time to properly establish new alternative fuel plants, particularly biofuel plants. These amendments are accepted by the government and I commend them to the House.",REPS,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,24,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I am not surprised that the parliamentary secretary has indicated that the government will be accepting the amendments, because indeed they are government amendments, which makes them quite unusual in themselves. We did not really need a repeat explanation of the purposes of the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 from the parliamentary secretary. I certainly will not be repeating it in the limited time I have available to me now. I can indicate that the opposition supported the government amendments in the Senate and therefore we will be giving our concurrence here in the House of Representatives.
As the parliamentary secretary indicated, this is quite a far-reaching bill, dealing with a number of fuel issues, but the key change which is given effect by the amendments is the pushing out of the phase-in period by another three years. I want to quickly give the House a bit of history here. Hitherto, fuels like LPG, ethanol and biofuels have been untaxed in this country. This bill initially sought to introduce a taxation regime on those fuels from the year 2008. I will not go back into the history of the original zero excise rating and its replacement by a production subsidy because of a Brazilian shipment, because I do not have time for that now.
In the budget last year the Treasurer announced that from 2008 these fuels would be taxed. He informed the House on that occasion that they would be taxed based on their energy content. That was the recommendation of the Trebeck report. What the Treasurer did not do on budget night was to provide detail as to what the tax rates would be. That caused a big problem for the LPG industry at the time. Not only was LPG being taxed for the second time—because with the introduction of the GST it had a tax imposed on it for the first time—but it was attracting, in effect, an excise for the first time. That was bad enough, but what made it worse for the LPG industry in particular was that the government did not provide rates, leaving it hanging in an atmosphere of great uncertainty.
We know that if the government were to have imposed a tax on excise on LPG and ethanol based on energy content we would have ended up with tax rates for LPG, for example, of around 25c a litre. That is fairly high and is approaching the 38c applied to unleaded fuel. There was a lot of angst over that and a great lobbying process was put into play. The LPG industry lobbied very hard. A lot of government backbenchers and members on our side were concerned about the impact of that tax on the LPG industry. Then—surprise, surprise—on 16 December 2003 the Prime Minister, who had intervened, announced that while these fuels would still be taxed on their energy content he would be discounting that by some 50 per cent. No explanation was given as to why he arrived at the figure of 50 per cent. It was an arbitrary figure, but it got him out of a very difficult political decision, particularly with respect to the LPG industry.
So the Treasurer was rolled. He indicated clearly in the budget that there would be a tax on LPG, ethanol and biofuels and that the tax rate would be determined by the energy content of those fuels. There was another upheaval on the back bench and another party room debate and the Prime Minister intervened and simply decided that the tax be energy content discounted by 50 per cent. That was the first occasion on this issue that the Treasurer was rolled.
The Labor Party gave support to the bill in the House, which gave effect to those budget changes. That was in November or December last year. The bill just disappeared after that. It went off to the Senate and we have not seen it again until this week. Why have we not seen it again until this week? Because there was another party room revolt. The ethanol industry lobbied and claimed that 2008 was too early a period in which to bring in the tax. (Extension of time granted) They argued that by the time they would have closed on their finance and built their plants they would only be up and running in 2007 and would have very limited time under the tax-free status before the tax came in. So there was another party room revolt. There was a lot of pressure from the government backbench, particularly from National Party backbenchers. The amendment in the Senate—I think it was today—was again a manifestation of that party room revolt. It was another backflip, another case of the Treasurer being rolled. The announcement now, in the amendments before the House, is that the tax on these fuels will not be introduced after all in 2008. It will now be pushed out to 2011.
As I said, the Labor Party supported these amendments in the Senate. We are supporting them now in the House. We are doing so, I have to say, without prejudice to our own policy-making processes. The industry will know exactly where the Labor Party stand on these issues prior to the next election. But, given the procrastination by the government, we were not prepared to hold this bill up any further particularly, as it goes to some very important clean fuels arrangements in the low-sulphur fuel area. So we are supporting it today but we will leave our options open in the future. The opposition support the ethanol industry. We think it has a solid role to play in regional Australia. We think it has a role to play in creating jobs and offsetting important dependency. It has a role to play in the environment. We want to be assured that it is an industry that is able to stand on its own two feet.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—Tonight I want to talk about TAFE. I want to talk about TAFE because it seems to be the poor cousin in all the education discussions being held at the moment. It is always mentioned in passing and not as an issue at the heart of further education. Further to discussions I had with some TAFE people today, I agree with their sentiments that vocational education and training are essential ingredients of lifelong learning, as are skills acquisition and the capacity of individuals to become active citizens in a democratic society. For most of you, TAFE is the vocational education system.
There are 1.7 million students undertaking vocational education and training in Australia, which is more than 10 per cent of all working age Australians. Of those students, 1.3 million are in TAFE. The thing about TAFE is that it provides for all ages and all socio-economic groups. It is entry-level training for young people, it provides further training for older workers and it gives a second chance and a recurrent education for socially and economically disadvantaged people. The advantages are that TAFE is accessible to a large number of people because TAFE can run courses through all sorts of other centres. It is able to engage with local communities. It has a close connection with industry and it is inclusive and has a commitment to quality. TAFE is also poised at the intersection of schools, higher education and adult community education and industry.
TAFE students include those who study part-time: 90 per cent; those who are in apprenticeships and traineeships: 15 per cent; those in rural and remote areas, for whom TAFE is an ideal training format: about 30.9 per cent; and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, for whom TAFE has been a good vehicle to get skills: 3.3 per cent. It plays a very important role in Tasmania, because we now have many country schools that developed vocational education and training that link in with TAFE.
I would like to see more things done. Tasmania has some very original courses that, at the moment, are not accessed by Tasmanian students because of the cost. One is the Shipwrights Point School of Wooden Boat Building, which is a stunning course that enables those who can pay to undertake building a boat from the bottom up. The end product of this course is some of the most beautiful and effective craft ever made. Just today, I heard that they have another 20 people signed up to build boats, which is becoming a problem for them because they are running out of space. I believe there would be a very useful nexus to be created with this organisation that would allow students to undertake the course and become skilled to help lots of people build boats all over Tasmania.
The other fascinating course being offered, which is once again an end product of the timber industry, is the fine furniture school in Launceston which allows students to design and build original furniture but also gives them opportunities to create replicas of past furniture glories—both useful in this day of people hunting for something a little different. Just before Christmas, there was an exhibition in Launceston that showcased some of the year's work. The items fascinated me. Most were wooden clocks based on an original design that is centuries old, one of which is still housed in Salisbury Cathedral in England. These pieces are the most beautiful and mesmerising pieces I have ever seen. Using Tasmanian timbers, cogs and bits are intricately formed to create a perfectly working clock. They look more like intricate sculptures, but they are the most incredible clocks. These pieces are worth between $20,000 and $35,000, depending on the size.
That, to me, is a very practical outcome to a skill that many Tasmanian youngsters could perfect if they got access to training. They can do this through TAFE. I believe that TAFE has a vital role to play in re-skilling our society as technological change moves on at the pace it is going. We need to be more upfront with the new courses and skills as well as retaining some of the old ones. I will be seeking greater concentration of funding for TAFE with all its programs, because it has potential for even greater things than it does today.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Education: TAFE</title>,Adjournment,25,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—Today I present to the House a petition of 2,837 signatures that have been collected by Ms Sharon Bird, the Labor candidate for the federal seat of Cunningham. Sharon has concerns about the importation of apples from New Zealand, and this petition that I table today reflects the concerns of apple growers in that particular area of Australia. Ms Bird launched the petition on 27 February at the East Corrimal fruit market and has enlisted the support of fruit shop operators in collecting signatures for this very important petition.
The importation of apples from New Zealand will be allowed if the government adopts key recommendations of the revised draft import risk assessment for New Zealand apples, which was released on 19 February. Apple growers in Cunningham and around Australia remain concerned about the potential for imported apples to bring the devastating apple and pear disease fire blight into the country. AQIS has estimated that an outbreak could cost the Australian industry $1 billion over five years.
The industry argues that the quarantine conditions recommended in this revised draft IRA may not be rigorous enough to keep fire blight out. There is also concern that growers and others have been given only 60 days to prepare a detailed scientific response to this 800-page report. I wrote to the chair of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, urging him to reopen the inquiry, and I am pleased to note that the first hearing will take place today. I congratulate Sharon Bird on her initiative in putting together this petition on behalf of people in the Cunningham electorate.
I am also pleased to note that the government has bowed to pressure from the industry and has extended the period for consultation on the draft IRA for another 60 days. The government's original timetable would have meant that growers would have had to prepare their response to the draft IRA right in the middle of the harvest. It is vital that our apple and pear industry is not exposed to the risk of fire blight and that the industry is given time to adequately assess the effectiveness of the quarantine conditions contained in the IRA.
The issues surrounding the importation of apples from New Zealand were examined back in 2001 by a Senate committee which recommended a number of important improvements to the IRA process in general and this IRA in particular. In its June 2001 report, the Senate committee said:
The committee may revisit the matters dealt with in this report following publication of the final IRA.
That is now being done, and the opportunity is there for the industry to put their concerns to the Senate committee. I once again congratulate Sharon Bird for her great initiative on behalf of her community.
The petition read as follows—
To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament.
The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House.
We the undersigned object to the Federal Government's plan to allow New Zealand Apples into Australia.
We believe this will mean:
1.	The spread of the apple disease FireBlight;
2.	Farmers forced out of business because of the disease FireBlight.
3.	Quarantine standards being lowered and our farmers sold out.
The undersigned petitioners therefore ask that you stop the import of New Zealand apples immediately and urges the Federal Government to reverse its decision.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—By way of background, in February 2003 the Australian Electoral Commissioner determined that the Northern Territory was just 295 persons short of the population needed to retain its second House of Representatives seat. As members will know, this decision came as somewhat of a shock to me, although it was predicted by me after we had been awarded two seats in the prior redistribution. Because of the way in which the statistical information is gathered and used, it was quite conceivable that we would fall below the 1.5 quota that was required to retain two seats after the subsequent election, and that is what happened.
It also came as a shock to the people of the Northern Territory. The effect of their being 295 people short of the quota was to halve their representation in the House of Representatives. That led to a range of activities, but most of all it led to arguments by me and others that we should be given some sort of guarantee about a minimum number of seats for the Northern Territory. Indeed, I did prepare a piece of legislation which would have done this, but it quickly became apparent that that was not the way to effect a decent change in public policy which would provide for some sort of certainty around the issue of a determination of the Electoral Commission in terms of seats. This is very important, because we do not want a situation to emerge where the determinations of the Electoral Commission, based on data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, are overturned because governments or oppositions do not like the result. 
I have to say that I did not like the result, and we needed to do something about it, because it became very clear very quickly that there were huge flaws in the processes adopted by the Electoral Commission through using the data from the Bureau of Statistics. There were flaws and, I think, errors in the data which was used to bring about the result which brought us back to one seat. What happened was that the government, in its wisdom, after discussions with the opposition, sent the matter off to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for consideration.
I was fortunate enough to be able to make a submission to that joint standing committee, and I will come to the details of that submission shortly. Firstly, I want to point out that this is the third time that the government have attempted to draft legislation to meet the concerns which have been expressed. On the first two occasions they simply did not get it right, because they ignored the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—I notice that the chairman of that committee, the member for Kooyong, has come into the chamber, and I welcome him and thank him for his part in providing this report.
The government's first attempt came through a private member's bill from the member for Solomon. Effectively, this tried just to put in the fix for all time and not deal with the underlying problems associated with counting the Territory's population. My first reaction on hearing the result that we were going to lose the second seat was to have a similar view: that we needed to put in legislation that guaranteed a minimum number of seats. I developed a very logical, coherent and, I think, philosophically sound argument for that position, but I was dissuaded from it by weight of the arguments of others. It became very clear that, whilst there was a guaranteed minimum number of seats provided by the founding fathers, this was not going to wash in the 21st century and that what we needed to do was not distort the basis for additional representation in the federal parliament by ignoring the population figures. It also became clear that if we used the population data differently, if we actually analysed it and looked at the way in which it was being used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, we would come up with a different position.
The government's second attempt was a variation on the first bill, but this time the government wanted to rewrite the Electoral Commissioner's determination and simply replace a `1' with a `2' for the number of seats for the Northern Territory. Thankfully, by then, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters had reported and had made three very practical recommendations to deal with the immediate problem and also how to handle the problem of making manageable population estimates for the territories into the future—as I said, third time lucky. Let me put on the record our support and the way in which we got a bipartisan position from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for its recommendations which are now part of this legislation.
The bill before us now provides, firstly, that the statistics provided by the Australian Statistician for the purpose of making a determination are to be the most recent set of statistics in a regular series compiled and published by the Australian Statistician. This removes any ambiguity about which of the latest set of statistics is to be used. Secondly, when the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory falls short of a quota for an additional seat and the shortfall is within an error margin, the Electoral Commissioner is to recalculate the entitlement. The error margin is to be added to the territory's population and the entitlement recalculated. Thirdly, the determination by the Electoral Commissioner on 19 February 2003, as it relates to the Northern Territory, is set aside. The determination made prior to the February 2003 determination, on 9 December 1999, is to apply to the Northern Territory at the next election. This will ensure that the Northern Territory has two seats in the 2004 election.
I think those recommendations provided a very constructive and creative way to overcome a problem which would have seen the representation of the Northern Territory halved in the House of Representatives. Having been the member for the Northern Territory for a dozen or so years, I can say that I am much relieved. I loved representing the whole of the Northern Territory, but it is somewhat easier to represent half the population than the total population. Mind you, I had great difficulty with the way in which the electoral boundaries have been struck.
This is a separate matter, of course; nevertheless it is relevant for me in that I made a submission to the redistribution committee saying that I thought that the electorate should be roughly divided in half so that you had two electorates which were demographically and geographically similar, roughly 700,000 square kilometres in size. We now have two electorates: one which comprises Darwin and Palmerston—the city area—and the rest of the Northern Territory in the seat of Lingiari. To give you an order of magnitude, the seat of Solomon is now 330 square kilometres. The seat of Lingiari is 1.34 million square kilometres. So you might contemplate what I have contemplated: whilst it is somewhat easier to service half the population, in terms of the effort it is not a lot easier for me, simply because of the diversity of the electorate and its size. I think that is a little unreasonable. When we come back to consider redistribution I hope that the Labor Party submits a further request that the redistribution be done along the lines that I originally proposed.
Effectively, this bill allows for the calculations of entitlements to representation in the House of Representatives to take account of the significant margin of error in the Australian Bureau of Statistics population estimates for the Territory. What we got from JSCEM was a way forward, and I am pleased that the government has belatedly acted on its recommendations. The biggest issue for me has always been how the ABS developed its population figures. I have here my submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and I have to say, without putting too fine a point on it, that the joint standing committee has taken up the concerns that I have expressed in the submission, which go to the question of the validity of the data and the methodology that were being used. The recommendations which the committee has come forward with endorse absolutely the submissions I made to the committee.
It is relevant to discuss just briefly a couple of the issues, as they will enlighten us on a number of things. The first issue is the appropriate use of statistics. The Northern Territory has a volatile population. However, the ABS's published population projections indicate that the Northern Territory population will increase relative to other states over the coming decades. These projections suggest that the Northern Territory will qualify for a second House of Representatives seat in both the near- and long-term future. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, that I was making this projection on the assumption that we might still be looking at one seat in the forthcoming election. The medium projection anticipated that the Northern Territory will have 1.55 lower house quotas by 2005 and 1.6 quotas by 2014. Since 1999 the ABS's ERP—that is, the estimated residential population figures—have been below the most conservative estimates of population growth. The accuracy of the population projections depends largely on the accuracy of the assumptions on which they are based. In the case of the Northern Territory the estimated residential population figures seem either to have been based on incorrect assumptions or to have failed to account for several key factors about population growth. As I said at the time, unless the ABS has substantially changed its methodology the inaccuracies will accompany the next set of population data.
Population projections are based primarily on rates of mortality and fertility and on international and interstate migration, moderated by past trends. In terms of volatility, interstate migration is likely to have the greatest impact on population projections for the Northern Territory, and that has clearly been the evidence over the last couple of years. The ABS population projections do not directly take into account predictions of future economic growth, for example, and the effects that it might have on interstate migration in particular.
Let me give you an example of that. At the moment there is a gas liquefaction plant being built in Darwin, which I understand employs around 1,000 people in the construction phase. Hopefully, in the near future we will see an announcement made by Alcan to double the size of its facility at Gove. The town of Gove has around three and a half thousand people. They anticipate requiring for this exercise an additional work force of 1,200 people. That immediately changes the migration rates into the Northern Territory and the population base. But the bureau's estimates do not foresee or allow for these changes in economic projections. The volatility of the Northern Territory population limits the ability to make accurate predictions of future population based on past population trends. In a small and relatively isolated population like the Northern Territory, large economic projects can have a substantial impact on the population.
The ABS is committed to providing statistics that are appropriate for the uses to which they will be put—that is, statistics that are fit for purposes under its charter. The commitment is provided in the ABS mission statement. I will not read it out, but it is very clear—it is just headed `What we believe in: ABS principles'. The ABS released estimated residential population figures for September 2002 on 18 February 2003, two days before the release of the Electoral Commissioner's determination. The ABS was cognisant of the purpose of the data it supplied to the Electoral Commission, as it released these figures earlier than usual specifically to enable the Electoral Commissioner to use them in his determination. This shows in correspondence between the Australian Statistician and the Electoral Commissioner that was obtained then by Senator Trish Crossin from the Northern Territory. In contradiction of the ABS charter at the time, the Australian Statistician told the Senate Economics Legislation Committee at estimates on 5 June 2003:
It is the people who use these numbers for their purposes who make the judgment on the best statistics to use.
When questioned about whether there might be other statistics that would better fit the purposes of the February 2003 determination, the Australian Statistician did not answer. It is possible that there are other statistics that would qualify as the latest statistics for the Commonwealth and be more accurate measures of population.
One such set of statistics could be a rolling average over a number of quarters, and this was made clear in my submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Another such set of statistics could take into account the errors associated with population estimates—and this, I am happy to say, is what the JSCEM struck on. A number of questions to the ABS were placed on notice following the estimates committee hearings in June 2003. I am not sure what the conclusion was, but I am absolutely certain that the responses that were made reinforced the view we had expressed.
I will reiterate: the Northern Territory lost its second House of Representatives electoral division seat because of a very narrow shortfall in population—295 persons. What we need to understand is that this was an order of magnitude smaller than the standard error rate associated with the September 2002 estimates of residential population figures for the Northern Territory and made those population data totally unsuitable for the Electoral Commissioner's February 2003 determination.
In the 2001 census—I know this is fairly complicated, but it is important—the net undercount found by the post-enumeration survey for the Northern Territory was found to be 7,814 people. The rate of undercount was four per cent, the largest for any state or territory, and had an associated error of 0.6 per cent, or plus or minus 1,172 persons. This means that one can be 95 per cent confident that the September 2002 estimated residential population figures for the NT lay within the range of 4,688 people, yet what we had was a determination based on the fact that we were short by 295 people. So it becomes obvious that, if you account for standard errors and use those standard errors as an indicator, you will quickly come to the position that I came to, that you need to go to the outside of the standard errors, not the inside. And that is in fact what we have seen recommended by the joint standing committee.
This error of course meant at the time that there was no statistically significant difference between the 1.5 quotas and the September 2002 ERP figures for the Northern Territory. As a result, there was no certainty as to whether the real population at the time was greater than, less than or the same as the 1.5 quota. It is possible—even likely—that the NT's real population in September 2002 was greater than the level that would be required to entitle the NT to two electorates. I am not going to go into further argument about that, but I do want to say that there has been a significant undercount historically of the Northern Territory population. There is now growing evidence that suggests that the ABS method of enumeration of remote Indigenous populations seriously underestimates the population. The ABS has admitted that enumerating Indigenous communities is difficult. However, it has shown to date, in my view, little interest in amending its data when there is clear evidence that it is flawed.
The Commonwealth funds various Indigenous health programs, based on figures from the Health Insurance Commission in recognition of the fact that the ABS data grossly underestimates Indigenous populations. HIC figures indicate the number of people resident in a region for the purposes of the delivery of health care services. These figures provide a dynamic record of a population, as the record is updated each time a person enters a clinic. I will give you an example. HIC records show that at the time of this submission there were 3,123 people in the Katherine west district—which is an area roughly the size of Victoria—whereas the ABS estimated that the figure was only 2,868.
Similarly, the ABS estimated that there were 2,000 people on the Tiwi Islands, whereas at the time the Tiwi Health Board estimated that there were 2,300 people on the islands. There were also claims of serious discrepancies in the population data from Wadeye, or Port Keats. Wadeye census data showed a 31 per cent discrepancy when compared with data from the health clinic. It is very clear on that basis that the information which was being used by the bureau was unsatisfactory. Not only were they using data which was unsatisfactory, but they were not using the latest published data available and they were not accounting for error margins.
I have stressed—and I believe it is true—that there is a significant undercount of population in the Northern Territory. I understand that it is difficult for the bureau. However, when decisions such as this are being contemplated, it is extremely important that the information which is used is accurate. The JSCEM recommended—and it is now supported by the government—that the margin of error used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which would have been 1.2 per cent of the Northern Territory, be included in the margin of error that the Australian Electoral Commission uses in its future calculation. The bill is therefore a way forward for the Territory representation. Most importantly, it is not just a political fix, as were the first two attempts by the government to address this problem. The bill now has a great deal of credibility because it goes to the root of the problem and fixes it without distorting the important principles underlining the Commonwealth Electoral Act.
In the remainder of the time, I will briefly say how this bill will work. The population estimates are based on census data updated for intercensal population changes—overseas migration, natural increases et cetera. Although census population figures are a complete enumeration of the population, there is a degree of undercount in the population figures, which I have indicated and which I do not think the bureau has satisfactorily addressed in the Northern Territory. At the 2001 census the ABS estimates that there was an undercount of 7,800 in respect of the Northern Territory. Census population figures are adjusted for the undercount estimates. Undercount estimates are derived from a post census survey, which I spoke about earlier, and as such are subject to a standard error.
This standard error is the measure of the likely difference between the survey estimate and the true value. There are two chances in three—that is, 67 per cent confidence—that the true value will be within plus or minus one standard error of the estimate. There are 19 chances in 20—that is, 95 per cent confidence—that the true value will be within plus or minus two standard errors of the estimate. The standard error for the Northern Territory undercount estimate is 1,300, thus we can be 95 per cent certain that the true value of the net undercount for the Northern Territory is within 5,200 and 10,400—that is, 7,800 plus or minus two standard errors; 1,300 times two, which equals 2,600. The standard error on the undercount estimates carries through to ABS population estimates.
This bill provides a two-stage process for taking the undercount standard error into account. The first stage, clause 48(2D) is to ascertain if it is worth while proceeding—that is, if the territories are within the required margins. The second stage, clause 48(2E) is to rework the determination calculation with the undercount standard error added to the population estimates.
Clause 48(2D) tests to see if it is worth while taking the margin of error in undercount estimates into account. Subclause (2D) applies if the margin by which either the Northern Territory or the ACT falls short of a seat is less than or equal to two standard errors. This bill also deals with the ACT, which of course currently has two seats, and once had three and which also suffers from similar sorts of issues in terms of population estimates and margins of error, although you would expect that the accuracy for the ACT would be somewhat better than for the Northern Territory, given the isolated communities across the Northern Territory.
Using the 2003 determination calculations for the Northern Territory as an example, the Northern Territory, as I said earlier, fell short of a seat by 294, which is less than two standard errors of the measure of the undercount—which was 2,600. Thus the subclause would apply to the Northern Territory. On the other hand, the ACT fell 10,550 short of a seat, which is greater than two standard errors of the measure of the undercount for the ACT—which is 2,400. Thus this subclause would not apply to the ACT in these circumstances. If clause 48(2D) applies, then clause 48(2E) allows for the population of the NT or the ACT to be increased by two standard errors of the measure of the undercount and then for the determination calculation to be redone using the increased population figures.
I know you are impressed by all that information, Mr Deputy Speaker, and you understand it all—and it is incredibly important. What we have seen here is a very constructive attempt by JSCEM to come to grips with a very technical problem and come up with a very constructive and creative way to address the problem. In doing so, what they have done is to guarantee into the future, in my view, that the Northern Territory will sustain two seats. It is unlikely to get to three for a damn long time. I can see no circumstances in the foreseeable future, using this formula, which would see the Northern Territory go back to one seat. That is incredibly important because we do not want to see a situation where the Northern Territory's representation is again halved.
I note that my friend and successor in the seat of the Northern Territory, Mr Dondas, has walked into the chamber. Mr Dondas would understand exactly what I am talking about when we discuss issues to do with population in the Northern Territory and the need to make sure that you get as accurate as possible a picture of what the population is at any point in time. This bill will be applauded by the people of the Northern Territory. I am confident it will be applauded by the government of the Northern Territory—and I am sure it will be applauded by the opposition in the Northern Territory. They know, as I know from my own experience, that we do need to make sure that the voice of the Northern Territory—a small community in numbers; albeit large in area and large in life—be appropriately loud in this place, at least in terms of making sure that we represent the whole community. We can do that best by guaranteeing into the future that we get two members in here and not just one.
I am sorry that we cannot provide the ACT with three seats into the future. But, clearly, this piece of legislation does afford them a better opportunity into the future to get three seats. Again, I think it is a very good recognition by this parlament of a way to address a technical issue very creatively, without undermining the principles which form the basis of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.
We do not want to be in a position, as we would have been had we adopted the first piece of legislation introduced by the government, of passing a piece of legislation which would have been an absolute political fix, which would undermine the credibility of the Electoral Act and which would create a precedent for future governments to intervene in a very political and partisan way in determinations made by the Electoral Commission. Whilst I might have been in the position myself of supporting that piece of legislation at the time, I am glad to say the error of my ways has been pointed out to me by the very informed decisions made by the Electoral Commission. I remind the chairman of the Electoral Commission that the submissions which I made to the Electoral Commission did contemplate the recommendations which were made by the joint standing committee, which I thank for the work it did and the excellent report and recommendations which it brought forward which now form the basis of this legislation.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—I am very pleased to follow the member for Lingiari in the debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004, because he and I have had a long association. 
—I will not tell too many stories, Warren, but in our early days here we met many times on the football field. Our respective careers took us to different states. Mine took me to Queensland and his took him to the Northern Territory, and we again met up here in parliament many years later.
I have had a long association with the Northern Territory. On Christmas Day 1974, I was a young person living in Canberra. The Director-General of Health rang me on Christmas morning and said, `Listen mate, can you get into the natural disaster headquarters? Something has happened in Darwin. We do not know what has happened, but the NDO has been mobilised. Can you get in there?' I asked, `Will I be home for Christmas lunch?' And they said, `Yeah, sure. We only want you there for an hour or so.' I got home four days later. We all know what the devastation was in Darwin, and I was tied up with the medivacs out of there and a lot of the emergency work.
Two years later, I was chief of staff to the minister for the Northern Territory, and I was vitally involved in the writing of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act, which gave the territory self-government on 1 July 1978. By coincidence, 20 years later I was back in this place as a minister for territories at a time when the government initiated a referendum in the Territory to bring about statehood, which I would have thought was a noncontroversial issue at the time. Unfortunately, the referendum question became more complicated than was intended and the people of the Northern Territory voted against becoming a state. I still hope beyond hope that that question will be resolved and that it can be done in a way that is fully inclusive and the Territory can become a state, because I think it should be. If it were a state, we would not be here talking about this bill right now.
I also want to acknowledge the presence of the member for Kooyong, the chairman of the joint committee. There is no-one in this country who has a better knowledge of electoral matters than the member for Kooyong, and his knowledge and contribution are respected by both sides of the House. This bill gives effect to the government's response to the findings of his joint committee. Not only were the joint committee's three recommendations unanimous, but the government fully supports them. 
All three committee recommendations are encompassed in the bill, and they have two unambiguous purposes. Firstly, they clarify and define the statistical processes used to calculate the number of House of Representative members each state and territory is entitled to elect. Secondly, they ensure that the Northern Territory is not disadvantaged at the next election by what the committee saw as a flawed process in the 2003 quota determination. This bill sets aside that determination in relation to the Northern Territory so that at the next election it can continue to elect two members. However, the amendment—the exception—only applies to the next election, because, if this bill is passed, future determinations will be subject to its other amendments which clarify the process of quota determination.
Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, as you are well aware, the Australian Constitution guaranteed each original state at least five seats in the House of Representatives. Subsequently, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory were guaranteed one seat each by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Subject to these minimum entitlements, a combination of the Constitution and the Electoral Act sets out a precise manner for determining the number of House of Representatives members that each state and territory can return at a federal election. This determination is based on total population figures, both for the Commonwealth and also for each state and territory. The method of calculation is quite specific—that is not the problem, and this bill in no way seeks to alter that. The problem is the lack of a definition and a time frame for the actual statistics used in those calculations. What this bill aims to do is to provide a definition and a time frame, certainty and transparency, to the statistics used to calculate how many members each state and territory is entitled to elect to the House of Representatives.
What highlighted this lack of certainty—this lack of definition and transparency—in the present processes was the February 2003 determination. In 2003, the Australian Electoral Commissioner found that Queensland, because of its increased population, should gain one extra seat and that South Australia and the Northern Territory each should lose one. What this meant for the Northern Territory was that at the next federal election it would be entitled to only one member instead of its current two, as the member for Lingiari pointed out, to represent a population of approximately 200,000 people. The Electoral Commissioner determined that the Northern Territory was 295 people short of the quota for two seats.
While 295 may seem to many to be a small number of people, the shortfall has a very big meaning for the Northern Territory. We are talking about a shortfall of 295 people in an estimated—I stress the word `estimated'—population figure for an area of over 1.3 million square kilometres. To put this in perspective, we are talking of an estimated shortfall of 295 people in an area roughly twice the size of New South Wales. If we could be certain that this quota was calculated on reasonably accurate published figures then I would say that, even though representing the interests of the whole of the Northern Territory is an enormous job for one person, the referee—the Electoral Commissioner—has spoken; he has made his calculations according to law; and we would have to abide by his findings. However, it is not as simple as that, which is why this decision resulted in an inquiry.
The loss of the Northern Territory's second seat by such a small margin generated much public discussion, and, as a result, in July 2003 the Special Minister of State requested that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquire into and report on guaranteeing a minimum of two House of Reps seats each for the ACT and the Northern Territory. The Joint Committee reported in November 2003, with, as I said, three unanimous recommendations. The first two recommendations define and specify particular statistics and processes to ensure uniformity and fairness in determining future quotas for each state or territory. The third recommendation was:
That the 2003 determination be set aside by government legislation to the extent that it applies to the Northern Territory.
That is, the committee recommended that, just for the next federal election, the Northern Territory be allowed to elect two members to the House of Representatives. The amendments contained in this bill should eliminate the need for such an exception in future, because a quota will be calculated using more specific figures and transparent processes.
As I have already said, the government fully supports all three recommendations of the joint standing committee and has drafted this bill specifically to legislate those recommendations. However, I must stress that the committee did not support a legislative guarantee of two seats for each territory regardless of its population, and nor does the government. In fact, the committee reported:
The existing basic principle for determining the number of Members to be elected by the Territories should not be disturbed. It is, however, also important that any systemic disadvantages imposed on the Territories in comparison with the original States be addressed whenever they are identified.
That is the crux of the matter: the committee identified systemic disadvantages to the territories in relation to statistical calculations, and has made simple recommendations to overcome them. The problem is not in the legislatively defined processes for calculating the quota; the problem is in the estimated population figures used in the calculations. With this bill, the government seeks to rectify the lack of definition which has now been recognised.
The committee was concerned about the method by which the `latest statistics of the Commonwealth' are obtained and about the absence of legislative definition. It found that, without such definition, the Australian Statistician and the Australian Electoral Commissioner `are given a degree of unintended discretion when deciding which statistics will be used'. For instance, there is no stipulated time frame for the figures—they could be the latest figures, the last ones published or even last year's figures. There are no directives on whether the figures have been published or not; and there are no directives on what error margin is used for the estimates or on publication of the calculations.
Using population figures from different dates can of course give different results. For example, in the February 2003 determinations, the Australian Bureau of Statistics provided the Electoral Commissioner with the September 2002 population figures despite the fact that, at the time, even the June figures were still unpublished. If the June figures had been used, the NT would have retained its second seat because the estimated June population was higher than that for September.
This bill seeks to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act so that the Electoral Commissioner is required to ascertain relevant populations on the reference day—the first day after 12 months from the first sitting of the House of Representatives of the new parliament. It specifies the statistics and it specifies the day. It also requires the statistics to be published. The commissioner must use:
... statistics ... that the Australian Statistician has, most recently before the reference day, compiled and published in a regular series ...
The other aspect of the population calculations which concerned the committee were error margins. Because we do not have a census every election, populations can only be estimated. Even the Australian Bureau of Statistics has acknowledged that there is greater unreliability in the population estimates for the territories than those for the states, largely because of the difficulty in deriving accurate estimates from smaller populations. This was covered by the member for Lingiari. The error margin for the Northern Territory is up to three times higher than that for the states and six times higher than the error margin for the whole of Australia.
The shortfall of 295 for the Northern Territory last year is well within that error margin. That is why the joint committee recommended that in future, if the quota shortfall for a territory is within the margin of error acknowledged by the ABS, the Australian Electoral Commissioner should use the population figure at the top of the margin of error to determine that territory's entitlement. It should use the higher figure.
If this bill is passed, and I am sure it will be—if the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 is amended to specifically define population calculations for House of Representative quotas—then the 2003 problem will not arise in the future. Not only does this bill ensure fair representation for the Northern Territory at the next election; it ensures that the quota calculations for each state and territory will be based on published statistics, in a particular time frame, with the Australian Statistician advising the applicable margin for statistical error.
It is not that anyone thinks that the Australian Statistician or the Electoral Commissioner do, or ever have done, the wrong thing—far from it—but it safeguards everyone concerned to have the base statistics for quota calculations defined, published and transparent. It ensures that justice and fair play are not only done but seen to be done. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I support the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004 for the reasons outlined by the member for Lingiari and because it is a step in the right direction. It restores a reasonable outcome for the Northern Territory. But I am extremely concerned that the system we are establishing here, improvement though it is, is still not fair to the people I represent, the ACT voters. However, it is an improvement so I will support it. The voters of Canberra get the worst deal in Australia in terms of voting rights, and I will continue to campaign about that until it is corrected.
The situation in the Northern Territory was outlined by the member for Lingiari and I will not take up the time of the House by repeating that detail but will simply say that I think we have here a very pragmatic proposition dressed up in high principle. But it is actually very pragmatic and I support it for recognising issues that need to be recognised. I had a discussion in an entirely different context with the Statistician, Mr Trewin, when I was shadow Treasurer. In the course of that conversation, just by coincidence, we got on to a discussion which led to his raising his concerns about the margin of error for the Northern Territory in assessments around the census and derivations from it, including for electoral purposes. So that the committee has recognised that pragmatic point is correct. I would not originally have thought that was something that needed to be done. As I say, my conversation with the Statistician was not in the context of knowing that this bill was to be considered—that discussion was more than 12 months ago—but I do accept that he legitimately holds that view. I respect the ABS as a fine institution and Mr Trewin seems to be doing a very good job at its head.
—Canberra would not have lost its third seat if this had been in place. 
—That is not my point, although it is a valid one. The other pragmatic point—I do not regard saying that something is pragmatic as a criticism—is that I think the committee has erred in favour of representation instead of against. When there is a choice to be made about whether or not people should get more representation, within reasonable limits we should decide in favour. So I think those two things are correct.
I recognise that for the last 20 years we have had an established system of determining representation for states and territories which was designed—I strongly supported it when it was designed and in principle I still do—to overcome past mistakes, to put it politely, or past behaviour and to set down within the constraints of the Constitution a fair proposition that means that nobody can fiddle with electoral representation. That is an important part of our political system and one of the key elements of its integrity. I support all that.
But the problem is this: when you have a well intentioned system that for the most part delivers a fair result within the constraints of the Constitution, which I do not propose we should contemplate changing, but which continually provides an unfair result in one area, we have to look at it. A constituent of mine who is, of course, very well known in this area, Professor Malcolm Mackerras, is very critical of the committee's report—I do not share all his views—and argues that the territories prior to this bill and the ACT subsequent to it are still treated unfairly and that we need to deal with this matter. One vote, one value is not about saying, `We want a system that treats everybody as though they are the same'; we want a fair outcome. 
Let me just talk about the outcome we are achieving as a result of this bill. I support the bill; I support erring in favour of giving the Northern Territory the second seat. Not only will I vote for this bill but also I am happy to come in here and speak in support of it. But on the last figures that I got—I thought this bill was going to come up a few weeks ago, so as my figures are from 2 March they are four weeks old—the total enrolment for the Northern Territory was 108,325, and it will get two seats. In my seat there are 112,000 voters. There are more voters in my seat than in the two seats that will be created in the Northern Territory. That is a travesty of one vote, one value.
People in Western Australia used to pass laws deliberately to have a two to one ratio, and that was a rort. This is not a rort. This is a properly constructed system which was done with good intentions and it produces an unfair result. In round figures, my seat is 113,000 and the seat of my colleague the member for Canberra is 107,000; the combined number comes to just under 220,000. That means we could have, in fact, four ACT seats which would be the same size as the two seats being generated here for the Northern Territory.
I do not support that; that would not be a fair outcome. It would be nice for my voters but it would not be fair, so I do not support that. I do not want anything gerrymandered in favour of my constituents—I just do not want the system to turn out badly for them. Let me point out what would happen if there were three seats in the ACT. On the figures as at 2 March, the average enrolment for those three seats would be 73,161. For example, in the state of Western Australia the smallest seat, the seat of Moore, has 73,000 enrolled voters. In Tasmania, the smallest seat, the division of Lyons, has 64,000, and in all the other states with the exception of South Australia the 73,000 would not trigger the redistribution provisions in those states for being disproportionately low. We are 50 per cent over what is the situation in any other state or territory, 100 per cent over in the case of the Northern Territory and 60 per cent over in the case of Tasmania. 
One vote, one value is about the fact that everybody's vote should be as equal as we can make it in determining the outcome of the election in the country. Broadly, we do that in Australia better than most countries in the world, and one of the reasons has been the 1984 amendments, which were very good amendments, and the continuing scrutiny and monitoring of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and its bipartisan performance over the years. Those things are great strengths in our system. But we still have to face up to the embarrassing reality that we continue to provide, as a result of an ostensibly fair system, an unfair result. You cannot go on shrugging and saying, `Well, it's unfair; bad luck.'
—What do you propose?
—It needs a bit more work. There are a few propositions. Malcolm Mackerras has a proposition that says that the only fair way to deal with the territories is in fact to deal with them by number of voters rather than by population because the population figures will never work out one vote, one value but dealing with it by number of electors will. I think that would solve today's problem but I am not convinced yet that it is an ongoing solution. But it is an interesting proposition that says that we need to look at the long-term consequences, because the projections of population as I see them suggest that the problem in the ACT is going to get worse, not better. In 2006, after the next census, the range of population in the other states and territories is between 95,000 and 140,000 people per constituency and in the ACT it will be over 165,000. 
If I thought this was a one-off, I would just shrug and say, `That's what happens; sometimes you fall a little bit below, sometimes you end up a little bit above.' As someone who previously had their seat abolished as a result of one of these changes, one simply lives with the consequences. You cannot have a rule that says some people can win but nobody can lose; it cannot work like that. But you have here an ongoing outcome that is proving to be systemically unfair, although not intentionally. It may well suit the current government that it is unfair to my constituents, because they continue to commit that arch-folly of voting for the Labor Party, but it is not a system designed to derive this outcome. It is, however, a system that does derive this outcome. 
I simply want to flag this and say that nobody is addressing it because everybody is hiding behind the fact that we set this system up with good intentions and, nationally, it is providing a fair outcome. We have recognised an anomaly in the Northern Territory and we have dealt with it pragmatically in a manner which I am prepared to support and which will, at the margin, improve the circumstances for the ACT. I accept that, because our margin of error, while not as high as in the Northern Territory, is higher than the national average. It will not be sufficient to resolve the anomaly that exists, but as it is an improvement and as it deals generously to the voters of the Northern Territory—erring in favour of representation rather than against it—I am happy both inside my party and publicly to vote for it and to speak for it.
But we have to address this situation. Nobody I have ever spoken to has any qualms about the fact that the federation compact gave a guarantee of minimum representation to all the states but, in effect, to Tasmania. I certainly have no qualms about that. It is part of the federation compact. It is not consistent with one vote, one value, but it is a decision into which we all entered with our eyes wide open and nobody would wish in the slightest to interfere with it. But looking at this generous proposition that is being laid down for the Northern Territory, I cannot stand idly by and allow the value of the vote of the people who do me the great honour of sending me here to represent them to be continually undervalued, valued at significantly less than the vote of anybody else in this country. I am going to continue to raise it. I think that to rush in and say that A or B is the best answer is to be too glib about a complex question. I regret the fact that the committee continues not to, in my view, adequately recognise this. 
I have raised issues in the past that are of the pragmatic character of the ones that are being raised here today, and I would still like to see those addressed. They do not breach the principle of one vote, one value. They are consistent with the way in which the Constitution operates, and those are issues that need to be considered. For example, while the Constitution refers to populations—that is, the catchment area from which voters are drawn and not voters—it does not deal with the ACT in that manner, because part of the catchment area for voters for the ACT is Norfolk Island, and they are not counted as part of the population for the ACT. I appreciate they have a special character, and there is an argument against that proposition because of the unique voting circumstances on Norfolk Island, but if we are talking about pragmatic propositions that do not breach the principles and project fair outcomes, I continue to put that proposition. It does not have the support of my party, let alone the joint standing committee—and I do not criticise people who come down on the other side of that particular point. It is simply that they continue to come down, on the balance of all the decisions, in a manner that leads to an unfair outcome for the people who send me here to represent them. I cannot quietly accept that.
There is the Mackerras proposition and, while I have always been a critic of Malcolm about his predictions and what might happen in elections, I respect him as an analyst of the statistical circumstances with regard to elections. He is always accurate in that, and he has a proposition which warrants serious attention. I am content for people to pursue better alternatives, but we have a continuing anomaly and I will not stand idly by and allow it to be perpetuated. However, having said that, I reiterate my support for the proposition. I indicate my continuing concern about the broader consequences of the structure as it is operating, but this pragmatic set of proposals which errs in favour of enhancing the representation of the citizens of the Northern Territory should be supported.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—I am pleased to be speaking on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004 today. I start by paying credit to the member for Solomon. The opportunity for the Northern Territory to maintain two representatives in the House of Representatives has arisen because of his efforts. The member for Solomon, who is here today, has put in a big effort into this, and I think it is entirely appropriate.
I lived in the Northern Territory from 1986 to 1993 and have a strong attachment to it because of its unique character and its great promise as a rapidly developing frontier of Australia. The thing about the Territory is that you never know what is going to happen next. No other place in Australia has the character of the Northern Territory. Therefore, I believe it does deserve consideration. 
The Northern Territory is not readily understood by people in other parts of Australia—the pressures that apply, the unique factors that come into play and the character of the place. The member for Solomon, when speaking about this issue, said that the creation of two seats in the Northern Territory would `carry the Territory across the momentary statistical glitch that threatens to again disadvantage the occupants of 1,346,000 square kilometres of the mainland'. He said:
Territorians do not seek unusual or inappropriate consideration.
We do not complain that we are not counted at the time of a national referendum in the same way that other Australians are counted.
We do not complain that we have no right to trial by jury, nor that the Commonwealth retains unusual powers within the Territory that it does not have in the states and that the states would not concede to.
We contribute, on a per capita basis, some three times the average export earnings of the states. Territorians have always punched above their weight.
Those comments go some way to illustrate the Northern Territory's unique circumstances and the added burden Territorians carry. Trial by jury and being counted along with other Australians at the time of a national referendum are things that we should be delivering to all Australians. I accept the words of the member for Fraser, who said that we have to continue to work our way towards improving the electoral system, ensuring equal representation and constantly striving to deliver the same rights to Northern Territorians as those enjoyed by other Australians.
Some places in Australia have certain innate advantages. Someone like me—I live in Ipswich and come to Canberra—would probably challenge what the member for Fraser said. Because people in Canberra are at the seat of the nation's power they have a certain degree of influence, an ability to impact on what goes on in this place—something that Ipswichians have to fight to do. People who live even further away in the Northern Territory would probably have an even bigger battle. This bill is about recognising the needs of people above statistics.
The amendments clear the ambiguity on which statistics are to be used in determining the electoral entitlements of the states and territories. Because there is an apparent shortage of 295 people in the Northern Territory, the quota for representation was to have been cut to one member of the House of Representatives. Under this bill, if the shortfall is within the margin of error, the Electoral Commissioner can redetermine the entitlement.
I note that both members of the House of Representatives who are Northern Territory members support retaining two seats in the Northern Territory, and it is very good to see that. You might infer from the suggestion that the number of seats in the Northern Territory is going down that the population of the Northern Territory must be falling. That is not the case. It is simply that, at this stage in its history, the rate of growth is slower than elsewhere in Australia. But the thing about the Northern Territory, as I said before, is that things come in waves. They come from out of nowhere; they can come and be gone before you even realise. Development up there happens in big waves.
In the period that I was in the Northern Territory, from 1986 to 1993, there was very little movement in the population and there was a real struggle in those times by the government up there to maintain and promote activity and to get it to happen. But the next wave did happen. It started almost as soon as I was out the door; I do not know whether I had anything to do with that, but as soon as I was out the door, along came the cavalry, figuratively and actually. A cavalry regiment turned up there, and development really kicked off. The place really took off. When I went back there some time later, I just could not believe that Palmerston, where I had lived, had gone from being a kind of a village into a full-blown urban area with all the services that you could expect elsewhere within the greater Darwin area. Of course, things could go straight back to a slow rate again. That could happen.
There is no question that development is happening in the Northern Territory, and I think it is absolutely essential that we recognise the fact that it is moving forward, that its needs are always diverse and challenging, and that to go back to one member would be a retrograde step. In some of the reports I saw on this matter, the question was raised: what is the cost of an MP in the Northern Territory? The cost of having an MP in the Northern Territory is apparently about $800,000 for four years, and establishing a separate office for a new electoral division in the Northern Territory costs about $200,000. So this might cost around $1 million. I think that is a very small price to pay to ensure that people in the Northern Territory are aware that there is a commitment by all Australians to the development of that area. 
I think the people of the Northern Territory know that anyway, because over the years we have provided many unique points of recognition of the Northern Territory. The member for Solomon pointed that out when he spoke on this issue. He pointed out that in 1922 parliament first enacted special legislation to allow the Territory to send a representative to attend the Commonwealth parliament, even though they did not have a right to vote. In 1936 they first allowed that member to vote, but only on matters relating to ordinances of the Territory. In 1958 they were allowed a vote on any proposed law or matter relating solely or principally to the Northern Territory and, finally, in 1968 that person was granted full voting rights. There were two senators elected in 1975, and in 1978, as has been mentioned by the member for Fairfax, the Northern Territory gained self-government. Each one of those steps has been a recognition of the development and the people of the Northern Territory. And this process is going to keep going on, as the member for Fraser quite rightly pointed out earlier on in this debate. We are going to have to continue to revise our attitude towards the Territory, and also towards the other territories of Australia, and we are going to have to continue to focus on the needs of those areas and maintain a special interest in and awareness of them.
Let me point something out. I listened to the member for Fraser, and he really focused on the question of the need for one vote to have one value. I am a Queenslander, and the very question of one vote, one value achieved some prominence in Queensland back in 1989 or thereabouts. There was quite a focus on the so-called gerrymander that existed at that time, when there was not one vote, one value in Queensland. We have now progressed to a new system that seeks to keep votes in the state of Queensland as equal as possible. It is an important principle, and I think everybody agrees with that. It is important, though, to recognise that for people who are in far-flung areas—and the member for Lingiari underlined this when he said how difficult it is for him to cover the massive seat that he deals with—there are added pressures and they do need added resources.
But there is a problem in Australia because we do not have entirely one vote, one value. The member for Fraser argued that we are doing a lot better than most other places but it still is not equal. In fact, in the five largest states the average enrolments at the 2001 election ranged from 80,428 in Western Australia to 87,429 in Victoria. However, Tasmania's guaranteed five seats, due to its status as an original state, meant that Tasmanian seats averaged just 66,335 voters. The member for Fraser highlighted the fact that in his electorate there are over 110,000 electors. So at one end, under the current system, without even taking into account the effect of this piece of legislation, you can go straightaway from 66,000 voters—I think the member talked about 64,000 in the seat of Lyons—to 110,000 or more at the other end of the scale. 
I recognise that when you look at the situation in Tasmania, if you are going to change it, you are talking about constitutional change. In order to continue to progress Australia we should not avoid discussion about problems that may exist within the original Constitution. If that situation is not going to be rectified and if we are not going to come to a situation where those five seats in Tasmania start approaching much more closely the norm, it is only an injustice as far as people at the other end of the scale are concerned that their votes are worth only half as much.
The entitlement quota which decides representation is based on the Commonwealth population minus territories divided by 144, which is twice the number of state senators. The number of electorates in each state and territory is then decided by dividing the population by the quota. If the remainder is more than one-half, the state or territory is entitled to one more member. Of course, as we have found out, if it is not one-half—exactly 0.5—it is not so entitled. If we go back over history and look at the situation for the Northern Territory, we see that the entitlement quota in the Northern Territory in 1991 was 1.377; in 1994, 1.428; in 1997, 1.4540; in 1999, 1.5239—obviously, we go from one to two at that point; and then, going to the question that we are addressing here, it fell back in 2003 to 1.4978. As has been revealed in this discussion today, the number of people who make up that small number spread over that vast area of the Northern Territory is 295. If you set loose 295 people in the Northern Territory, which is otherwise almost completely bare of population, I defy you to find a single one of those 295 people, because it is a massive area—one-sixth of the size of Australia. There is just no way you could do it. It is obviously entirely within the statistical margin for error, as has been revealed in the report that has been done for the House on this matter. It is just commonsense that we should make the change that is now proposed. 
One of the points that I would like to come to was touched on slightly by the member for Lingiari. I took from what he was saying that he was concerned that within the Northern Territory there are now two seats of completely different character. He said that his seat is much bigger than the other seat. He seemed to think that it is necessary that that be corrected in some way. Having lived there, I honestly cannot see how you could possibly do it.
The area of Darwin is a dense urban area—in many respects, just like any other urban area in Australia. The rest of the Territory is a broad completely decentralised, remote area. It is impossible to compare the two. As has been pointed out many times during the debate, Lingiari has a 50 per cent Aboriginal population. The next biggest Aboriginal population in any seat in Australia is 14 per cent in Kalgoorlie. There is a huge gulf between those two areas.
The essential character of Lingiari increases the diversity of this place. I think it is important that we do have a diversity of seats and that people come into this place from very different backgrounds so that we accurately reflect the character of Australia. If we just turn everyone into a homogenous sludge and have everybody with a little bit of rural, a little bit of urban, a little bit of black, a little bit of white and a little bit of everything else that goes around, the debate is going to be very confined. We need people to accurately reflect a much broader view of the population.
If the member for Lingiari was suggesting that we somehow cut Darwin in half and then tack it onto the rest of it, I can understand that he may have some desire, because he has such a large area to cover, to reduce it and therefore cover it better, but it is still going to be a huge area. I think that the diversity that is represented by those two seats is a symbol of the fact that our parliament is able to bring together different views and is able to work those different views into something that adequately reflects an Australia whose image and identity is diverse and complex but which, in the end, knows how to work together and produce a successful outcome.
I am very pleased that the efforts of the member for Solomon in relation to this have come to a successful conclusion. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has done an excellent job in bringing into focus the very important core issues of this debate. The fact that Australian Demographic Statisticsdoes not, as initially claimed, contain all the estimated resident population figures used for the determination of entitlements is something that is a bit of a revelation, and I acknowledge the efforts of the chairman, the member for Kooyong, in bringing that to light—the committee has done an excellent job.
As a parlament we now have a much better understanding of the way in which the AEC have sought to access that information. They have at times used information that has not been published and they have sought much more current information from the publishers of the Australian Demographic Statistics. That is precisely why on this occasion the Northern Territory, as far as 2003 is concerned, dipped below the entitled amount. If they had gone on the published figures—the ones for June rather than September—there would never have been this debate today.
Within the joint committee there were, I think, two different versions of the reason why we should be adopting this change. Both of them are very good. One is the margin of error reason, and I think that is excellent. The other is the one I have just referred to; that is, that the published statistics should have been the June figures—in other words, the latest published ones, not the ones that are still on the drawing board or in a draft form or have been recently collected. It is important that they are the figures that have been published. Those are the two versions. It is like having two different equations that produce exactly the same outcome.
It is really good in this place that, on this particular debate, we have gone all around the bushes and we have come up with the same outcome. So whether you are a Northern Territorian or someone from Canberra—like the member for Fraser—or your background is more one of an historical concern for the Territory, such as mine or the member for Fairfax's, the fact is that we are seeing here a very positive advent in the history of the Northern Territory in determining that there should be a second seat and that, under the current forecasts, that second seat will continue to be entitled. Therefore, we wish the Territory well in its future development.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I rise to support the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004, or, as it might be colloquially known, the `Dave Tollner preservation bill'. I am particularly happy to support this bill because, as the member for Lingiari outlined, its purpose is to preserve the second seat in the Northern Territory, which is currently held by the member for Solomon—so it will preserve the seat of Solomon for reasons of principle.
The seat of Solomon is named after the Hon. Vaiben Solomon, who was Premier of South Australia for a week in 1899. In those days, of course, the Northern Territory was incorporated in the mandate of South Australia. As far as I know, he was the only Jewish Premier of an Australian colony or state. Solomon must have been quite a character, because, in a typically erudite article, Sir Zelman Cowan, writing on the life of Solomon, said that Solomon allegedly walked down the streets of Darwin after a bet stark naked—not the typical behaviour of a Premier.
The reason the government wants to save the seat of Solomon, however, is not to honour Vaiben Solomon. It obviously has a political motivation in wanting to preserve the honourable member for Solomon and, after due deliberation and advice by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, to see that there are, justifiably, two seats in the Northern Territory. This will ensure that the member for Solomon has a seat to contest at the next election, even if on current polling there is some suggestion that the opposition might win it.
If this bill were not passed, the honourable member would have to go head to head with the honourable member for Lingiari in a reunited Northern Territory seat. That would be, in my view, the political equivalent of going up against a very large and hungry Territory crocodile in a very small waterhole. We on this side of the House support this bill but are also a little cynical about the government's motives for introducing it. As a result of this bill being passed, the Northern Territory, which at the last election had 110,000 enrolled voters, will have two members in this House while, as the member for Fraser very eloquently pointed out, the Australian Capital Territory, with 220,000 enrolled voters at the last election, will also have two members.
If the Northern Territory seats were to be reunited, it would create a seat of more than 110,000 voters, and we are told that this is far too many for one member to represent. But, in the 2001 election, the division of Canberra, as the member for Fraser pointed out, had 108,000 voters and the division of Fraser had 111,000. There will be even more at this year's election. In the presence of the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I suggest that this does present anyone who is interested, as I know he and the committee are, in fair representation in this place—one vote, one value—with an ongoing problem that should be addressed.
The opposition do not begrudge the Northern Territory its two seats, particularly since we are confident that at the next election Labor will win both. But it seems obvious that, if the Northern Territory is entitled to two seats, then the ACT should be entitled to three. The honourable member for Solomon is getting an act of parliament that will preserve his seat, while the honourable members for Canberra and Fraser will be left representing more voters than any other member in this House.
There are more serious reasons why this bill is important and why the opposition is supporting it. The bill gives effect to the unanimous recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, of which I am Deputy Chair and the honourable member for Kooyong, who is here, does a fine job in chairing, particularly on this inquiry into territory representation. The committee tabled its report on territory representation last December. The committee report followed the announcement in February 2003 that the Northern Territory was to lose one of its seats at the next election because the population of the Northern Territory fell short of a quota for a second seat by a mere 295 people. 
When the committee conducted its inquiry, we were disturbed to learn of an ambiguity surrounding the way in which the Electoral Commission determines the number of seats to which each state and territory shall be entitled. The Constitution says that `the latest statistics of the Commonwealth' must be used to determine the population of each state and territory, but this term was not defined anywhere, as our inquiry established.
This gives the Australian Statistician and the Australian Electoral Commission a degree of discretion in deciding which quarterly population figures will be `the latest statistics of the Commonwealth'. This discretion was not intended by the framers of the Constitution or the Electoral Act. I believe that this bill, our investigation and the committee's report have done a lot to refine and improve our consideration of electoral matters in this specific area. The bill will take out that discretion, which could have been used for political benefit. There was no suggestion that it was, but by removing this discretion we remove that possibility.
The Northern Territory was deemed to have lost its entitlement to two seats because its population was 295 below quota, as I said. But it is perfectly possible that using the next quarter statistics from the ABS or the previous quarter's figures the Territory would have kept its second seat. Allowing the AEC to decide which set of figures to use in effect gives the AEC the power to manipulate the electoral process. We are not suggesting that the AEC went into it with that motivation but certainly the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters and now the government—as indicated in this bill—and the parliament do not want to leave open that possibility to anyone.
For the 2003 determination in the Northern Territory the Electoral Commission requested a special version of the September 2002 population figures even though at the time the preceding quarter's—June 2002—population figures had yet to be released. If the June 2002 population figures had been used the Northern Territory would have retained its second seat. The AEC argued that the September figures were `the latest statistics of the Commonwealth', the expression required to be used as the criterion for determining the AEC's decision. Not surprisingly, however, many people expressed reservations about the process used by the AEC. Critics argued that `the latest statistics of the Commonwealth' should be read to mean the latest published statistics of the Commonwealth, not the latest statistics the AEC had specially prepared for its own use.
When this bill first came before the House earlier this year the government tried to dodge this issue by bringing in a bill which simply said the Northern Territory would keep its two seats without dealing with the problem that the committee inquiry uncovered. I welcome the fact that the government has now decided to respond to the committee's recommendations to improve the process of determining representation in this House.
The bill in its present form clarifies this situation in three ways: by requiring the Australian Statistician to publish all of the population estimates used by the AEC to make a determination of entitlements; by requiring the Electoral Commission to use only those published figures and also to publish the results of its determination, including the calculations involved; and by requiring the AEC to take into account the margin of error surrounding a territory's population estimates when a territory falls short of a quota. If a territory is short of a quota the AEC is to use the population estimate at the top of the margin of error to determine the entitlements. In other words, where there is any doubt about whether a territory is entitled to a seat the territory is given the benefit of that doubt. It does not guarantee the territory two seats, as the member for Fairfax pointed out, but it does give it the benefit of the doubt.
I must say that the very eloquent speech of the member for Fraser brings the apparent double standard in the representation of the two territories into even sharper focus. In my view at some stage the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters will have to address this problem and make recommendations to the government. This provision for the margin of error seems a fair one and Labor supports it. It is possible, incidentally, that if this provision had been applied in 1998 the ACT would have retained its three seats.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004 will give effect to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters regarding territory representation in the House of Representatives. I want to congratulate the other members—the members for Fairfax, Blair, Fraser, Lingiari and Melbourne Ports—for their participation in a debate on what is a quite complex and technical area.
The government's initial response to the committee's report was to introduce legislation to implement one of the committee's three recommendations and to announce that it would address separately the other two recommendations. As chairman I think I speak on behalf of all committee members in saying that I am extremely pleased that, rather than continuing down that path, in this bill the government seeks to implement all of the committee's unanimous recommendations. These recommendations are designed to improve the transparency and certainty of the process, take into account the margin for error in the population estimates used in the process and set aside the 2003 determination of the Electoral Commissioner that the Northern Territory should lose one of its seats in the House of Representatives.
The principles and formula for determining state and territory entitlements to seats in the House of Representatives are prescribed in section 24 of the Constitution and section 48 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Each of the original states is constitutionally guaranteed a minimum of five seats. The Commonwealth Electoral Act guarantees the ACT and the Northern Territory a minimum of one seat each.
Application of this formula in February 2003 meant that the Northern Territory was deemed to be just 295 persons short of the population needed to retain the second seat it had gained for the first time at the 2001 election. This prospective loss of a seat prompted calls from the territory to be guaranteed two seats in the House of Representatives, the introduction of a private member's bill by the member for Solomon and, subsequently, a reference from the Special Minister of State to the JSCEM.
The committee was asked to inquire into and report on increasing the minimum representation for the territories to provide a minimum of two seats each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives, and the committee held public hearings in both territories.
The formula used to determine entitlements to seats in the House of Representatives is strictly a matter of arithmetic, based on the population of the states and territories. The formula produces electorates of different population sizes across Australia. As we heard from the member for Fraser, this causes some angst. The Northern Territory has benefited in the current Parliament by having two seats with substantially fewer electors than the national average, half the population of ACT seats and fewer even than the five constitutionally guaranteed Tasmanian seats. In this sense, increasing the Northern Territory's minimum number of seats as a matter of guarantee would have entrenched this benefit.
Various social and economic arguments were made for increasing the minimum guarantee for the territories and the member for Blair has passionately advanced a number of these in the course of this debate. Unfortunately, the committee did not regard such arguments as decisive. The committee did not consider that the current formula for determining the territory's entitlements should be departed from. In other words, subject to the guaranteed minimum of one seat each, the ACT and the Northern Territory should be entitled to representation in the House of Representatives according to the current formula. Maintaining the formula is fundamental to minimising the opportunities for manipulating the number of territory seats, which is essentially controlled by the parliament.
However, in the course of the inquiry two important issues emerged. First the inquiry revealed a lack of clarity in the process for determining population estimates of the states and territories and, second, a significantly higher level of uncertainty in the population estimates of the territories than that of the states.
Under the Constitution the population figures to be used in the determination formula are those shown by `the latest statistics of the Commonwealth'. Neither the Constitution nor the Electoral Act defines what `the latest statistics of the Commonwealth' means. The 1986 predecessor of the present committee framed the recommendations leading to the current formula in the Electoral Act. There is a recollection from that committee that there was an expectation that the formula would be based on the latest published quarterly statistics.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics does in fact produce and publish estimated resident population figures for each state and territory in each quarter. However, the absence of a legislative definition of `latest statistics of the Commonwealth' provides the Australian Statistician and, to a lesser extent, the Electoral Commissioner with a degree of unintended discretion when deciding which statistics will be used for the determination.
This was an issue in relation to the 2003 determination. In October 2002, when the Electoral Commissioner asked the Australian Statistician for the `latest statistics of the Commonwealth' for the February 2003 determination, neither the June 2002 nor the September 2002 quarterly figures had been published. At the date of the determination, the June 2002 figures had been published. However, a special arrangement between the AEC and the ABS for early publication of the September 2002 quarterly statistics meant those later figures were used. If the June 2002 figures had been used, the Northern Territory would have retained its second seat.
The absence of a legislative definition of the `latest statistics of the Commonwealth' and the unintended discretion it permits were matters of concern to the committee. Senator Robert Ray pointed out:
The danger is that it is open to manipulation.
He continued:
I am not alleging that there is any conspiracy here; I am saying that we are open to dangerous ground here that I never understood before.
Senator George Brandis, for his part, said:
... there is a dangerous element of discretion left as to when the statistics are called for, which exposes the AEC to the possibility that it could be alleged that the timing of its call under section 47 was being manipulated.
Moreover, contrary to the impression conveyed in the evidence that the process involved the ABS providing whatever population statistics they had available, it is clear that the AEC has closely monitored the evolution of the quarterly figures and has at times pressed for later quarterly figures to be provided to it on the basis that getting more recent figures than the last published quarter's was particularly sensitive. The committee also discovered that the published quarterly ERP figures did not contain all the figures that are provided to the Electoral Commission by the Australian Statistician for the purposes of the determination.
In order to make the process more transparent and certain, the committee unanimously recommended that the Australian Statistician in future be required to include in the published quarterly ERP figures estimates of the populations of the territories of Jervis Bay, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island, which are required by the Electoral Commissioner in making the determination of Territory representation. To inject an additional level of certainty and transparency into the process, the committee also recommended—and the government has agreed—that the date on which the Electoral Commissioner is to take note of the latest published statistics of the population of the Commonwealth should be precisely specified in the Electoral Act and that the full details of any adjustments and calculations involved in making the commissioner's determination should be published. The bill amends the Electoral Act to achieve these outcomes.
The second area of significant uncertainty in the present determination process identified by the committee was that the population estimates provided by the Australian Statistician for the determination of representation in the House of Representatives are subject to a margin of error. The population estimates are based on the population counts obtained from the previous census. Immediately after the census an estimate is made of the net undercount—that is, the net number of people missed in the census count. The net undercount is added to the census count to produce a population estimate. Witnesses expressed concern about the population estimates for the Territory and the methodology used to estimate the population. There were conflicting opinions as to the efficacy of the population counts, particularly in remote and Indigenous communities, and questions about determining the percentage net undercount to be applied to the whole Northern Territory.
What the committee has called the `margin of error' in its report is the margin of error surrounding the estimated net undercount figures—that is, the number of people by which the net undercount could actually be over or underestimated. The committee heard that for the Northern Territory it could be 95 per cent confident that the estimated net undercount at the 2001 census was within 1.2 percentage points, or 2,600 people, above or below the estimated undercount.
The significance of the margin for error in the net undercount is that, when the net undercount is applied to the census figures, the margin for error in the net undercount carries through to the adjusted census figures and hence to the quarterly population estimates that are used to determine state and territory entitlements to representation. For the Northern Territory, this means that its estimated population is actually an estimated population range—that is, the estimated population figure supplied by the Australian Statistician plus or minus 2,600 people at a 95 per cent confidence level. Similarly, the ACT's estimated population at the 95 per cent confidence level is actually a population range of plus or minus 2,400 around the estimate of population provided by the Statistician.
Information provided to the committee indicated that the Northern Territory has the largest net undercount of the jurisdictions at four per cent of the population; the Northern Territory has the widest error for margin in its net undercount, at 1.2 percentage points; the ACT has a margin for error of 0.8 per cent—up to twice the equivalent rate for the states; and the error margin for Australia as a whole is 0.2 per cent—one-sixth of the error margin in the Northern Territory. It is clear that the population estimates for the Northern Territory and the ACT are less reliable than the population estimates for the states because of the difficulty associated with deriving an accurate estimate from a smaller population.
The territories' entitlements to seats in the House of Representatives are determined by the result of dividing the population of the territories by the quota calculated under the Constitution. When the division returns a remainder greater than one half of the quota, a territory is entitled to an additional House of Representatives seat. In most circumstances, error margins would have no impact on the result because the population shortfall from the number required to retain or gain another seat is usually much greater than the margin for error. However, where the shortfall is within the margin for error, the committee has recommended that the Electoral Commissioner take into account the margin of error and use the population figure at the top of the estimated population range for that territory in making the determination as to the territory's representation. 
The logic of the committee's position is set out in its report which was tabled on 1 December 2003, and it was neatly summarised by the member for Fraser. In brief, in the context of determining parliamentary representation, it is appropriate to use the highest number in the estimated population range because, if the highest number would qualify a state or territory for an extra seat, and if that number was in fact the real population, choosing a lower number in the range may deprive that state or territory of a seat in the parliament to which they are entitled. The government's acceptance of this recommendation is embodied in the bill now before the House. This will prevent a recurrence of the situation where, in the case of the Northern Territory, in the 2003 determination, the shortfall in population was less than the error margin in the population estimate, yet the determination was that the Territory would lose a seat in the House of Representatives. I think it is also worth noting that, had this applied to the loss of an ACT seat after the 1996 election, the ACT would have retained three seats.
The committee's third recommendation was that the Electoral Commission's 2003 determination be set aside by government legislation, to the extent that it applies to the Northern Territory. As the member for Blair highlighted, some committee members believed that the margin for error for the Northern Territory creates significant doubt as to the outcome of the 2003 determination and believed that the estimate of the Territory's 2003 population should have been the estimated resident population figure at the top of the margin for error. To redo the determination on this basis would result in the Northern Territory retaining its second seat. Other committee members believe that it was the intention of the parliament that the latest statistics of the Commonwealth be the latest published statistics at the time of the determination, not a special version or early release of the ERP figures and, for the 2003 determination, the published figures that should have been used were the June 2002 ERP figures. If the June 2002 ERP figures had been used, the Northern Territory would have been entitled to two House of Representatives seats. Despite these two approaches to this issue, all committee members agreed with the recommendation which has been accepted by the government and given expression in this bill.
I have set out as logically and straightforwardly as I can the committee's thought process in arriving at its recommendations. I am very proud of the work of the committee, including the territories representation inquiry. I have to say that the committee's conclusions were based on where logic took us. I want to thank all members of the committee for their commitment to seeking to resolve matters which come before them in a nonpartisan fashion and with intellectual integrity and logic, as well as the practicality that the member for Fraser highlighted.
I thank the coalition members of the committee, Senator George Brandis, Senator Brett Mason, John Forrest and Sophie Panopoulos, and the Labor members, Deputy Chair Michael Danby and Daryl Melham. I thank in particular Senator Robert Ray, a founding member of the committee in 1983, for contributing the benefit of his enormous experience and insight and his recollections of what the parliament intended in introducing the provisions which the committee was considering. I also thank Senator Murray for his dispassionate evaluation of the evidence and positive contribution to the committee's inquiry, not least because, given the make-up of the House of Representatives, the Democrats were absolutely unlikely to derive any partisan political advantage from whatever recommendations the committee made.
I do not know and I do not think anybody knows which major political party will benefit from the implementation of these recommendations by winning the seat in the Northern Territory in the next election. I certainly hope that it will be the member for Solomon, because he does deserve to win it. Over time I expect that the benefit will be pretty equal between the two major political parties. What I do know, however, as someone who has fought partisan politics very hard, is that ultimately Australian politics is founded on playing hard to win within a fundamentally fair system. There were some unintended shortcomings in the electoral system regarding the territories—shortcomings not so much to the detriment of the political parties but to the detriment of achieving fair representation in the House of Representatives for all the people in the states and territories. This bill will remedy this, and future political contests, for all their uncertainties, will be played on a fairer playing field for the people of Australia. I commend the government for its support of the committee's recommendations. The implementation of these recommendations will enhance the integrity and transparency of the determination of representation in the House of Representatives, a matter which is absolutely fundamental in our system of representative democracy. I congratulate the member for Solomon for his efforts, and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I rise to speak in support of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004. In doing so I indicate the Labor Party's support and express on behalf of the parliament our appreciation of the committee responsible for bringing forward this bill, because it has sought to attend to the special problem in the Northern Territory in an ethical and responsible way rather than as a short-term political grab, which was the original intent of the bill before the House going to electoral issues in the Northern Territory. I say that because I think it is very important that we pay proper attention to the issue of democracy and the need for proper and fair representation for all Australians. The very nature of the bill before the House is about guaranteeing that integrity in terms of electoral issues into the future. The Northern Territory is entitled to a fair hearing in the Commonwealth parliament, and this bill is about not only a fair hearing for the Northern Territory in the Commonwealth parliament but also a very public statement by this House that, in handling problems which confront us in the Northern Territory, we are not going to be opportunists. We are going to guarantee that very important principles going to the strength of our democracy always prevail.
The bill as it has been put to the parliament is truthfully—and I think it is accepted on all sides of the House—a vast improvement on the bill that was first presented to the House as the means of addressing the issue of Northern Territory representation. The initial bill did little except simply change the Electoral Commissioner's determination that the Northern Territory should have the benefit of two elected representatives. Having worked in the Northern Territory on and off over an extensive period, I understand the special challenges that confront representatives in the Commonwealth parliament who have responsibility for the Northern Territory. I believe that the initial bill ignored what the Labor Party and a significant number of coalition members believed were practical recommendations arising from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters' assessment of the proposal to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act.
The bill, in its original instance, did nothing to address issues associated with the ways such a determination is made, nor did it address the issues associated with data collection used in such determinations, which I believe is fundamental to the debate before the House this morning. There was a welcome wake-up call for all of us, prompted by the opposition, from the Howard government on these matters. The bill that we are now debating satisfies those concerns, and appropriately so. The recommendations of the committee are practical resolutions to ensure that the process of electoral redistributions is more transparent and that the resolutions or outcomes give certainty about the integrity of the process used in determining redistributions in the Commonwealth. But the government—and, more appropriately, the member for Solomon—in drafting the original bill chose only to address the ruling that abolished the seat it currently holds in the Northern Territory. It was about political considerations rather than the integrity of the Commonwealth electoral system, which, as far as I am concerned, must always stand above political considerations.
I believe that the member for Solomon should be grateful to his colleagues on both sides of the chamber for intervening in his wishful attempt to save his political career. Quick political fixes, in terms of the future and strength of our democracy in Australia, are unacceptable. The bill before the House rejects the original proposal by the member for Solomon, and correctly so. Labor's position on this is clear: it is not about interfering in the process of redistributions for political gain—that is not, and should not be, the role of the parliament; it is about setting the right parameters to ensure the integrity of our electoral processes and encouraging fair and equal representation for all Australians.
As I have already mentioned, I believe this goes to the heart of our democracy in Australia and the integrity of our electoral system. While I welcome efforts that strengthen these values, it also relates to the excesses—disguised as entitlements—bestowed upon those of us privileged enough to be given the opportunity to represent our constituents. It gives weight to calls made by me and some of my federal colleagues about the need for transparency in the way that we politicians go about the job we are elected to do and about the need to clean up the issue of parliamentary entitlements—which is also about electoral integrity. I think we will agree that, in order to do our job to the best of our ability, we have to have the resources to do so—we are entitled to have staff to help us with our consultations, we need adequate financial resources to keep constituents informed on policy that affects them and we need to be able to get back and forth from Canberra for parliamentary sittings to ensure that our constituents are represented.
But I want to raise something today which I think is also an important consideration of the bill before the House today on Commonwealth electoral representation, and it goes to the largesse perpetrated in some cases, which I believe is simply beyond comprehension and simply unacceptable to Australian taxpayers. I therefore want to raise fairly and squarely today the overly generous printing allowance that parliamentarians have an entitlement to. I think it is a disgrace that each and every one of us has a printing allocation of up to $125,000 a year to spend—that is, members of parliament can spend $28.25 million each year on printed material. And that is only after the opposition and the Greens joined forces last year to reduce that entitlement from $150,000 per annum—the limit that the Howard government proposed. In essence, we forced the government to retain the limit at $125,000. At a time when we are lectured day in and day out about the need to control the budget purse strings and ensure that they are tight, I contend that it is unacceptable that the Howard government allows this entitlement to continue untouched. The printing entitlement is, at best, grossly generous and, at worst, a blatant misappropriation of taxpayers' money—in essence, for the political gain of incumbent members of parliament. We talk about the electoral system. Where is integrity in the parliamentary process when, by way of entitlement, parliamentarians are given such an excessive amount of money to spend at will?
 (Ms Corcoran)—I interrupt the member for Batman and ask him to come back to the bill.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, this is related to electoral laws in Australia. It is about time we as members of parliament in debating the integrity of the electoral system in Australia also raised associated issues and the overly generous entitlements which enable us in some ways to rort the electoral system in Australia. This is related to my views on the overgenerous entitlements that we receive as members of parliament such as the gold pass—
—Is the member for Flinders seeking to ask a question?
—I am, Madam Deputy Speaker.
—Is the member for Batman prepared to accept a question?
—Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker.
—My question for the member for Batman is whether or not there are any members of the opposition who used the maximum entitlement in the past year or whether the entire opposition demonstrated its position by refusing to abuse the maximum entitlement.
—Firstly, you cannot go beyond the maximum entitlement. But I actually have some figures relating to the use of the entitlement over recent years.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have a problem finding any relevance of this at all to the bill we are currently debating. It has to do with the representation of the territories and has nothing to do with printing entitlements.
—I reminded the member for Batman of this a little while ago. I would like him to come back to the bill. Because I allowed the question, I will give him a minute to answer the question and ask him to then come back to the bill.
—This question is very important because it goes to electoral integrity. Let us deal with the use of entitlements, starting with the calendar year 2001. The average spending by members on printing was just under $98,000. For government members it was just under $129,000 and for opposition members just over $62,000. The truth is that in total government MPs in marginal seats spent more than $5.8 million on printing in 2001, or more than one-quarter of the total printing expenditure across the whole House of Representatives. I add that the extraordinary misuse of this printing entitlement by government MPs is over and above the hefty public funding entitlements of $1.7 million—we should not forget that it is taxpayers again paying the bills—paid to their parties for those seats, the 24 highest spending seats in the electoral campaign. In essence, it is double dipping. With respect to misuse of these entitlements it is interesting to note that in 2001 the government selectively chose to use this material to the disadvantage of one member of parliament.
—I ask the member to come back to the bill now, please.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I appreciate questions such as this because it is about a factual debate; it is about the misuse of entitlements. I will continue to raise these issues inside and outside the House in the same way as I will continue to campaign against overly generous entitlements such as the gold pass for retired MPs. It is about time we members of parliament led the campaign to clean up the electoral system in Australia. 
The issue I raise about the Northern Territory and the misuse of parliamentary entitlements which are overly generous goes to the very integrity of the bill before the House today because it is about whether or not we have a strong democracy and whether or not taxpayers' money is being misused to undermine the strength of that democracy. I am prepared to take more questions on this because all the facts speak for themselves. It is interesting to note, when you compare expenditure in the calendar year 2001 against expenditure in the calendar year 2002—and I understand why the member opposite is sensitive—
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I was not one of the worst offenders, but that is not the point I raise.
—Are you asking a question or raising a point of order?
—My point of order is this: you cautioned the member on no fewer than three occasions and he has defied your ruling. I am sure the government does not mind debating the issue in the appropriate debating forum, but this debate is about electoral matters in the Northern Territory.
—Thank you, member for Hinkler. I did give the member for Batman time to answer the question that was asked. I have now brought him back to the bill and I ask him to stay on the bill.
—On that point of order, the title of the bill before the House, which I am entitled to speak on, is the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004. The issue I have raised actually goes to representation in the House of Representatives and the operation of the electoral system in Australia. I am entitled to raise these issues because the bill is about the Commonwealth electoral system in Australia. That is the way the House has historically operated with respect to debates on the title of a bill. I believe I am totally in order, and I will continue to raise these issues because they are about the integrity of the Commonwealth electoral system.
The issue raised by the question went to expenditure. I have dealt with the average expenditure in the year 2002, and I think taxpayers would be entitled to know this.
—On a point of order, that is the fourth time you have cautioned the member, and he has returned to it. The subtitle of the bill is `representation in the House of Representatives'. It is clearly associated with the Northern Territory and, perhaps peripherally, with the ACT, but it is certainly not to do with entitlements.
—The member for Batman has actually drawn a link to the bill; it is very slight. I would ask the member for Batman to assist the chair and come back to the bill.
—With respect, I represent the constituency of Batman in the House of Representatives. That is no different from representing a constituency from the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory. The operation of democracy in terms of our entitlements is the same whether we are talking about my entitlements, as the member for Batman, or whether we are talking about a person representing a seat in the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory. That is why it is important, I think, that I draw attention to the average expenditure in the year subsequent to the election in 2001.
—Member for Batman, this bill is really about the representation of the Northern Territory. I would ask you—
—But it is the title of the bill that counts, with all respect, Madam Deputy Speaker. That is the way the House has always operated in debate. It is not related to the Northern Territory. It is related to the Commonwealth electoral amendment—
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I think the honourable member for Batman is drawing a long bow. There can be no doubt about what this bill is about—no doubt at all. The member for Batman should probably read the bill first—
—The member for Solomon will resume his seat. Member for Batman, if you could draw your remarks to the Northern Territory, I would appreciate it.
—Without a doubt, Madam Deputy Speaker, I understand the importance of this bill. It is about saving the member for Solomon's backside. He was on the outside looking in on the basis of the original determination of whether or not there should be one or two seats in the Northern Territory. I understand his sensitivities to these issues, because he wants to use the entitlements I am talking about to try to guarantee his re-election as the member for Solomon at the forthcoming federal election—which goes to the debate. It is about Commonwealth representation in the House of Representatives and the potential misuse of entitlements, such as printing entitlements, to guarantee that people are returned through the use of those entitlements. That takes me to the average expenditure for 2002. It is interesting to note the huge difference between 2001 and 2002.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member is clearly defying your ruling, which has been given five times now. I ask that you call him to order.
—Member for Batman, I appreciate the time you have taken to try to draw the link. I think we have got past that. I would ask you to wind up, please.
—I have got three minutes, 17 seconds to wind up—
—You have got three minutes to talk about the Northern Territory.
—I will wind up when it suits me and in accordance with my rights as a member of this House. As I have indicated, this bill is about the integrity of the operation of the Commonwealth electoral system in Australia. I support the determination made by the committee and its recommendations before the chair.
But I must say that, in the operation of the electoral system in Australia, Australian citizens believe there is a huge difference between having access to the proper entitlements while in the parliament to enable us to do our job properly and represent our constituents, and having access to generous and unnecessary entitlements for the purposes of guaranteeing our re-election. There are a range of issues that I will continue to campaign on with respect to reducing those entitlements because I do not think it is appropriate that they exist in the Commonwealth electoral system. This bill is about the integrity of the Commonwealth electoral system. I understand the sensitivities on the other side of the House with respect to exposing this misuse.
—On a point of order, Madame Deputy Speaker. If the member persists in ignoring your order, could I at least ask if he will answer my question, which is on the topic that he is talking about?
—The member for Batman is getting closer to the bill. I would appreciate it if he would stay on this side of the narrow line.
—If you allow me, I will link it to the question. But I tell you what: I will be wiping the smile off his face if I go through it seat by seat. It makes very interesting reading. It has been released publicly and I will continue to speak on it.
But, as I have said, these issues are important. We have to make sure that in considering bills such as the one before the House today we guarantee the integrity and fairness of the Australian electoral system. Yes, there is a requirement for equity in representation and a need to guarantee proper representation to the people of Australia. But there is also an obligation on the House when considering bills such as the one originally proposed by the member for Solomon to maintain the integrity of that system. It is time that we as politicians in maintaining the integrity of that system front up to the excesses that exist in the system, the benefit of incumbency and the rorts that exist for existing members of parliament. There is an onus on the House to clean up its act and to actually stop those rorts and return to taxpayers some of the money used to pay for those rorts for better purposes. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—I am delighted to rise to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004, particularly in the presence of my friend and colleague the member for Solomon. Representative democracy is built on three pillars: firstly, on the pillar of transparency—and I will come back to that, hopefully before the member for Batman flees this chamber; secondly, on the basis of representation, which focuses on the question of a right of all to participate and on the capacity for fairness and evenness in the value of that vote across this country; and, thirdly, on the important role of governments to exercise responsiveness. There must be a fair electoral system involving transparency and representation and there must be a responsive government. Those are the elements and the pillars of democracy and this bill deals directly with two of those three pillars. It deals with the question of transparency and it deals with the question of representation.
In looking at the question of transparency I want to note in response to the words of the member for Batman that if he is concerned about financial probity in this House there is a very simple step which he as a member of the shadow cabinet—the alternative government of Australia—could take, and that would be to terminate the Centenary House lease, which is currently drawing down $36 million of taxpayers' funding in what is not just a rort but something which skates—
 (Ms Corcoran)—The member for Flinders should come back to the bill.
—remarkably close to an abuse of the system.
—Madame Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not see how Centenary House has any link or relationship to the bill. In the same way that the members of the government were referring to relevance in the previous speaker's contribution, I do not see how this could be in any way relevant at all to the bill before us.
—I think that is the moral problem you have.
—The member for Flinders has been asked to come back to the bill.
—I will address the bill. I just note in passing that the failure to associate Centenary House with representative transparency is a significant moral problem. This bill seeks to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. It gives effect to the government's support for the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into territorial representation and in particular into representation of both the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in the House of Representatives. That inquiry focused on three broad recommendations. The first two relate to transparency and certainty, and focus in particular on the process for calculating the representative entitlement for each state and territory in the House of Representatives. The genesis for this bill was the fear that the Northern Territory might be palpably underrepresented; that is what drove the origins of and the thinking and research behind the creation of this bill. The third recommendation which confronted the drafters of this bill was that this bill will go to maintaining the representation of the Northern Territory on the basis of two seats for the forthcoming federal election and term of parliament. It does this for a series of reasons and, in considering those, I want to deal with the bill's background, its importance and some of its core provisions.
Turning to the background to the bill, on 19 February 2003 a determination of the Electoral Commissioner, under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, provisionally reduced the Northern Territory's representation in the House of Representatives from two members to one. The reason that is a problem goes to one of the core elements of adequate representation for a population which is essentially bifurcated between an enormous rural constituency and a concentrated urban constituency—two distinctly different constituencies with thoroughly different needs.
The Electoral Commissioner's decision had a series of challenges about it. Firstly, it did not deal with the question of geographical size and the distinction, as I have noted, between Darwin's urban population and the regional population of the rest of the Northern Territory, with its particularly high Indigenous component and the special needs of that group. Secondly, there was a missing element in terms of factoring in population growth and that the Northern Territory will again be entitled to two seats at the next determination of state and territory entitlements. Thirdly, there was a lacuna—a gap or a hole—in that the Northern Territory's population fell short by 295 people of a second quota to retain its existing two seats.
That gap is easily explicable by citing two factors. Firstly, there was a seasonal blip, or a seasonal change, in the timing of the assessment of the population; and, secondly—and this relates directly to one of the challenges faced with a high Indigenous population—there is a significantly lower rate of return of census figures from the Indigenous population than from the broader population. So the people who were most likely to have been disadvantaged by this ruling would inadvertently—and with no criticism of the Electoral Commissioner—have been the Indigenous population. It is a function of that society, and the challenge that we face, that the Indigenous population is less likely to return census forms. By the very nature of the process there will be gaps. An Indigenous population is free flowing. Its members live in remote and rural parts of Australia and many of them will choose not to return the census, even if they have been dealt with directly.
Under those circumstances, reducing the quota of seats for one particular election would have been inappropriate; it would have actually been a misrepresentation and an underallocation for the Northern Territory against the real numbers of the Indigenous population and Territorians generally. Thirdly, it would have been a one-off move which would have been rectified by the next election in any event. For all of those reasons, there was a problem which needed to be dealt with.
In that situation this bill is important because it achieves the intent of the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It does so not just by making specific rulings for the Northern Territory but also by establishing core principles in relation to transparency and representation. In doing that, it ensures that statistics are to be provided by the Australian Statistician for the Electoral Commissioner's determination and that these must be the most recent set of statistics compiled and published in a regular series by the Australian Statistician under the Census and Statistics Act 1905. That removes an existing ambiguity about what comprise the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. Also it includes having statistics in an electronic form, and that is a very important step. With regard to transparency, the Electoral Commissioner must make and publish his or her calculations and any necessary adjustments. They have to make and publish their own calculations within a designated time frame. In that way, the calculations are subject to scrutiny and review. Ultimately, that answers the question about transparency, as the number of representatives that a territory or a state has is fundamental to the degree and quality of representation of the individuals within that territory.
In looking at this bill, I want to return to the beginning. As I set out, for me there are three pillars to the notion of democracy. Firstly, there is adequate representation. Secondly, there is transparency in that process, ensuring that representation is appropriate. Thirdly, there is responsiveness, and that is a general question relating to the way in which governments govern—that is, whether they rule for themselves or for the common good. That third part is not an element of this bill. This bill, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004, deals directly with the questions of transparency and representation. For those reasons, I am delighted to commend this bill to the House and to offer my support to my friend and colleague the member for Solomon.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2004-03-31,"—According to the explanatory memorandum to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004, this legislation removes an ambiguity about which is the latest set of statistics to be used in determining the number of people in each of the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory federal seats. That sounds simple enough, and this bill is being debated in the Main Committee because it is regarded as noncontentious, having been based on a unanimous and multiparty report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.
While I do not oppose the legislation, I wish to point out some potential democratic shortcomings in the outcomes reached. In February 2003 the Australian Electoral Commissioner determined the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen by electors in the two territories. He was working to section 48 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which determines:
At least one member of the House of Representatives shall be chosen in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory ...
The quota for representation in the territories is arrived at by dividing the number of people in each territory by a quota the same as that used to decide the number of seats in the states. According to that formula, South Australia was to have one less seat, while the Northern Territory was also set to lose a seat and return to the status of representation it had prior to the 2001 election. In effect, the current status of one Country Liberal seat and one Labor seat would return to a one-seat territory. This resulted in a flurry of activity, culminating in the inquiry by the committee and the introduction of the so-called Tollner private member's bill to guarantee two House of Representatives seats in the Northern Territory.
According to my understanding of the joint committee report, there was no support for two seats being guaranteed for each of the ACT and the Northern Territory regardless of their population relative to the states. That was, I understand, inherent in the report. There was nothing set in cement; it was to clarify the process and to afford decisions to be made on the most up-to-date information. Again, that is fair enough. The committee also sought to remove the degree of unintended discretion afforded to the Australian Statistician and the Electoral Commissioner in deciding which quarterly population estimates are to be used in the `latest' statistics of the Commonwealth used to determine state and territory entitlements to House of Representatives seats.
Additionally, though, there is provision for greater error margins in population estimates of the territories. One can understand this in the case of the Northern Territory but I wonder why the ACT should be any different from the state error margin. I presume it is because of the uncertainty of public service tenure or circumstances such as that, but I would suggest that there are marked differences in the demographics, population trends and movements, temporary absenteeism and so on in the Northern Territory vis-a-vis the Australian Capital Territory. I think they are special and different cases and I really wonder about the error margin that is employed in both circumstances.
Some have asserted that the ACT is more entitled to three House of Representative seats than the Northern Territory is to two seats. Based on democratic principles that each vote should have as close to possible equal value, whatever that vote is, then the argument can be made that the ACT is entitled to three seats and the Northern Territory just one, although such an outcome would see 110,000 people in the Northern Territory seat and just under 70,000 in each of the ACT seats. This is significantly more in the case of the Northern Territory and significantly less in the case of the ACT than the average number of electors in House of Representative constituencies in the states.
By interfering with the Electoral Commissioner's assessment of the right to seats in this place, we are risking the politicising of our electoral redistribution process. I hear some say, `What's new?' While it is certainly not a case of gerrymandering, we have seen instances around Australia in the last century, particularly in Queensland, where gerrymanders have been part and parcel of Australian political life. The electorate, far wiser now perhaps than they were a decade or two ago, are adamant that they want as close to proportional representation as we can achieve.
I am an unwavering proponent of proportional representation in our lower houses as the only way of delivering proper and fair representation to the electorate. This kind of legislation that we are looking at certainly increases representation for the Northern Territory, but how proportional is it vis-a-vis the rest of the nation and how does it compare with that representation we have allocated to the ACT? Would there have been as much will to adjust the formula for setting representation in the territories had the government of the day—coalition or Labor—been faced with the possibility of ensuring that the relevant territory had an extra seat hostile to the political colour of the government of the day? It is an interesting question.
It is interesting also to note a table prepared by Associate Professor Malcolm Mackerras detailing what he sees as the rightful seat allocations should the territory formula be based on the number of electors and not the total population. The number of electors is used in determining federal House of Representative distributions in the states, even though section 24 of the Constitution says the distribution should be made on total population. According to Mackerras, based on the number of electors in each state and territory, New South Wales should be unchanged with 50 seats, Victoria should have one more at 38, Queensland should have one more at 28, Western Australia one less at 14, South Australia should retain its 12 seats, Tasmania is entitled to four and not five House of Representative federal seats, while the ACT should have three and the Northern Territory one based on the way the formula is supposed to work.
I have not checked the mathematics of all that and I do not pretend to totally understand error margins and two standard errors of the net undercount or, indeed, the gross undercount but, if Mackerras's maths are right, we have a democratic problem with this bill. Finally, as an aside, I note the comment from the member for Batman on the bill and the electoral entitlements and note the sensitivity of all members, and I look forward to some policy initiatives from both the opposition and the government in the lead-up to the election—maybe some movement on Centenary House as well, and printing and political donations.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Tollner, David, MP",CLP,2004-03-31,"—I welcome the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004, as do all those in the Northern Territory. The decision last February by the AEC to reduce the level of representation of the Northern Territory from two seats to one in the House of Representatives was a massive blow to everyone in the Territory. It came as hard news for many of us. The member for Kooyong, the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and all members of the committee deserve praise for the way they conducted themselves and for their analysis of statistical matters.
My thanks go to all those, from all over Australia, who gave submissions to the committee; to the people from the Northern Territory who attended meetings to give evidence and who made submissions; to the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party leader at the time, Denis Burke, for his well thought out submission; and to Senator Nigel Scullion for the work that he has been doing in the other place. Special mention deserves to be given to Senator Trish Crossin for the vital evidence she provided to the committee in order for it to make its decision. The Special Minister of State, Eric Abetz, also deserves thanks for bringing the bill on and drafting it in accordance with the findings of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.
There is one person I have not mentioned in the long list of people that I have thanked—that is the member for Lingiari. I am disappointed to say that, from the word go, the member for Lingiari is a Territorian who seems to have laid low on this issue. I do not know his reasoning for this, but earlier on he said that, although he had predicted it, the decision by the AEC to remove the Northern Territory's right to have two representatives here in Canberra came as somewhat of a shock. I find that odd: he predicted it and was then shocked when his own prediction came true. 
I have worked with the honourable member for Lingiari ever since the decision was made. About 12 months ago I was concerned when I heard him say in a radio interview in Alice Springs that, as far as he was concerned, there was no chance of the Territory retaining two seats. He had given up the ghost and was intending to start campaigning in the seat of Solomon because he believed that the Northern Territory would be brought back to one seat. He also said this morning that he had the idea of introducing a bill similar to my private member's bill, but that, after consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, he had changed his mind and realised the error of his thinking. I do not know how the member for Lingiari's logic works on this. Had I not put in a private member's bill, there would have been no inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and it would not have made any decision on whether or not the Northern Territory should have two representatives. 
The member for Lingiari made a ludicrous point about thinking of introducing this bill and then changing his mind after the joint committee convinced him that he was wrong. I have heard from members opposite that this has been a `save Dave' campaign—saving the seat of Solomon. I find that quite remarkable in many ways—firstly, because this is the most marginal seat in Australia after the redistribution. For anyone to believe that the government could somehow save a seat that is the most marginal seat does not bear thinking about. Secondly, all my efforts in this matter have been to save Lingiari. It is Lingiari that needs saving. 
I made an oral submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Matters on 29 August last year. I noted the special nature of the seat of Lingiari, which is that it is the only seat in Australia that has a majority or near majority of Aboriginal constituents. To abolish the only Aboriginal seat in Australia would be a massive blow to Aboriginal Australia. The only seat that comes close to that level of Aboriginal constituents is Kalgoorlie, which has an Aboriginal population of 14 per cent. Leichhardt, Maranoa, Kennedy and Capricornia do not even come close to Kalgoorlie. The seat of Lingiari is a real standout. It is interesting to note that in the inquiry process not once did the member for Lingiari stand up and argue the case for his own constituents.
—He must have been got at by the Labor Party.
—I think he had been got at—by sheer bone-laziness. The member for Lingiari never talked about his own constituents. He never said that his constituents deserved representation in the House of Representatives. In fact, when speaking to this bill this morning, the member for Lingiari reinforced his view that the Northern Territory should be split down the middle, for whatever reason. He seemed to think that two halves are better than one urbanised electorate versus one electorate predominantly containing Aboriginal constituents. He would want to see the electorate split down the middle, thereby dispersing Aboriginal constituents into the mostly urban white population of Darwin and Palmerston and thereby taking away their voice. That is disgusting. The member for Lingiari has been a sell-out through this whole process. I have said that on other issues in the past. He is not backward in selling out his own constituency. 
Throughout this process, as members may recall, the member for Lingiari paid an extended visit to the United States of America. He went over there for three months, observing the UN in action. Goodness knows what he was observing. He was probably observing debates on saving endangered sea slugs or something of that nature—who knows. In fact, the member for Lingiari never set foot in this place in five months when his seat and the representation of Territorians in the federal parliament were under threat. He turned up only in the last couple of weeks, when he said, `The member for Solomon was not even around to see the bill tabled.' I used to have a mate like that. He would turn up when the work was done. We called him Blisters. That is the sort of thing the member for Lingiari does. We could call him Blisters Snowdon—he always turns up when the work is done and then blames everyone else. It is interesting.
It is interesting to hear the people on the other side say that, for some reason or other, I am scared to run an election campaign against the member for Lingiari. You have to be joking. Look at the bloke's form. It has me beat how he can continue to stay elected with form like that—nicking off to the USA and wanting to divide the Northern Territory down the middle. He has his main office sitting in the middle of my electorate, not his electorate.
—You're kidding.
—No. His main office sits in the middle of my electorate. He has three-quarters of his staff working in the middle of Solomon, not in Lingiari, and members opposite say that somehow I am scared to run an election campaign against the member for Lingiari. They have to be joking.
Many speakers this morning have talked about the notion of one vote, one value and how that somehow links to rights and equity for all Australians. I draw members' attention to the fact that we have never really had one vote, one value in Australia. On that point Mr Snowdon says that the idea of guaranteeing a couple of seats to the Northern Territory is now an outdated concept. I find that surprising, because it is currently in our Constitution. From the date of its inception in 1901, the Federation has recognised that Australia is a large and diverse country and that the principle of one person, one vote would disadvantage and even disenfranchise the large and less populous regions of this great nation. That is visionary. That shows that if we go down this road of one vote, one value all of the power will eventually be tied up in Sydney and Melbourne. I think you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, what it is like being in the north and in rural or regional Australia, where we have to fight very hard to have our voices heard in this place.
—It still has one vote, one value.
—I take the interjection on board. Every state is guaranteed five House of Representatives members. What is not guaranteed is the Northern Territory having any level of representation, and the idea that somehow or other the Northern Territory should not be guaranteed any level of representation seems reprehensible. It seems to be a commonly held view among a lot of people. But I remind the House that back in 1922, when parliament first enacted special legislation to allow the Territory to send a representative to attend the Commonwealth parliament, that person had no right to vote. They could turn up and observe. In 1936, the Commonwealth changed the rules again, when parliament first allowed that member to vote in this chamber, but only on matters directly relating to the ordinances of the Northern Territory. In 1958, the elected member for the Northern Territory was allowed to vote on any proposed law or matter relating solely or principally to the Northern Territory, and then in 1968 the member for the Northern Territory was granted full voting rights. In 1975 we, along with the ACT, were allowed to elect two senators to the upper house, and then in 1978 the Northern Territory was granted self-government by the Commonwealth.
The point I am making is that the Northern Territory has never been treated as a state. We have never been treated equally, as the member for Blair said in his speech. We do have the right to a trial by jury. We are not counted in the same way as other participants in the Federation are counted when it comes to referendums. The Territory simply misses out. My original view, and I will maintain that view, is that the Territory should be guaranteed two seats. I will continue to lobby for it. The Northern Territory is a creature of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth can make these changes and should make these changes.
Finally, to wind up, I will signal that I will continue to fight for better representation of the Northern Territory. That takes me to the point of statehood. Only when the Northern Territory becomes a state will we have the same rights and responsibilities as all other citizens of Australia. The Commonwealth can do that. The Commonwealth do not have to wait for referendums. They do not have to wait for the people to say, `We're ready.' The Commonwealth can do it themselves with the stroke of a pen and declare the Northern Territory a state. It is contained in chapter VI, section 121 of the Australian Constitution, which says:
New States may be admitted or established. 
121. The Parliament may admit to the Commonwealth or establish new States, and may upon such admission or establishment make or impose such terms and conditions, including the extent of representation in either House of the Parliament, as it thinks fit. 
That is something that should happen almost immediately. The Commonwealth should get on with the job and make the Northern Territory a state. In all respects, the Northern Territory operates as if it were a state. There are very few areas in which you can say the Northern Territory does not operate as a state. Since 1988, it has been treated the same financially as the states. I hear constantly people saying, `Oh, you get so much more in the Northern Territory than the rest of us.' That may or may not be true, but it is the same system of allocating funds that is used Australia wide for all the states. I call on the Commonwealth to make statehood happen in the Northern Territory.
I will conclude by again thanking my colleagues for their support throughout this process, by thanking the opposition for their support of the bill, and by thanking the chairman and all members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, all of those who gave submissions and all of those who support this very worthwhile bill.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—The government are pleased that we have had this debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Representation in the House of Representatives) Bill 2004. The government would like to thank all of those honourable members on both sides of the House for their very strong support for this sensible piece of legislation, which will guarantee for the next election the Northern Territory having two seats in the House of Representatives. I was particularly interested in the contribution made by my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Solomon, who has been an outstanding representative for the northern part of the Northern Territory during the period that he has been in office, since the last election. I can see why the Australian Labor Party were supporting this legislation. They obviously want two seats so that there is some prospect—however limited—that the honourable member for Lingiari might have an opportunity to continue to serve in this place after the next poll. Given the information provided to the House, however, by the member for Solomon, whereby he indicated that I think a substantial portion of the staff of the member for Lingiari happen to be based in an electorate office within the electorate of Solomon, one could understand if the people of Lingiari at the next poll were to choose a representative of the Howard government to represent them in the federal parliament.
It is important not only that Northern Territory representation in this chamber is maintained at two seats at the next election but that there should be more transparency and certainty in the process used for determining the representation for the states and territories. The government would particularly like to thank the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for their detailed consideration of this matter and for their unanimous report after they inquired into territory representation in the House of Representatives in December 2003. As honourable members would be aware, the government does support all of the recommendations of the committee on these particular matters.
There has been a substantial contribution made to the debate by members on both sides of the House. It was good to see that members in the opposition and the government do in fact support the principles contained in this bill. When I heard that the Electoral Commission, through a calculation, was going to ensure that the Northern Territory had only one seat—by a very small number of voters; I think it was fewer than 300 voters that were going to deprive the Northern Territory of the second seat—I thought it was very logical that the joint standing committee sat down and, in a bipartisan way, worked to achieve an equitable outcome which will ensure that the people of the Northern Territory of Australia continue to be represented by two members in this place.
There will be increased transparency and certainty following the passage of this bill. I noted the comments made by the member for Lingiari, and I am pleased to be able to assure him that the process in the bill will provide certainty and clarity for the determination of representation through the use of the latest published population statistics. That is a very important point. This bill incorporates the government response to the JSCEM report. The bill introduced in February this year only addressed the determination for the Northern Territory. That bill was an effective way to restore two seats for the Northern Territory and to ensure that action by the Australian Electoral Commission since February 2003 was legal. The margin of error calculations proposed were to take account of errors in the population statistics.
The member for Fraser, being as he is a representative of the Australian Capital Territory, was not quite as enthusiastic about the bill as some other members. But he did support the bill. He said that the bill was not fair to the Australian Capital Territory, but he supported the pragmatic solution for the Northern Territory. I want to point out to the member for Fraser, who is not currently in the chamber, that the proposals in the bill on margins of error will apply to both the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and the use of the latest statistics applies to all states and territories and introduces fairness to the determination system.
I think all of us, regardless of what side of the parliament we are privileged to represent, do want to see an electoral system with integrity. We want to make sure that, when the votes are tallied on polling day, the party, or parties, declared to be the winner are in fact the people for whom the Australian people voted. It is a basic tenet of democracy that you should have a fair and equitable outcome, and that is why I am particularly pleased to see this bill before the chamber. It fixes up a glitch in the system. Integrity of the electoral system is obviously an ongoing challenge, and the government will have certain bills shortly with respect to that particular matter. This bill addresses a glitch with respect, in particular, to the Northern Territory and the next election. But, as I said in response to the member for Fraser, the bill does apply to both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
The member for Fairfax, my parliamentary neighbour and colleague from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, spoke on behalf of the bill, and I thank him also for his support. I emphasise in response to the remarks he made in the chamber that the bill introduces clarity and certainty for the entitlement determination with the latest population statistics. It is very important that, when a determination is being made, the latest population statistics are used. In response, also, to his speech, I point out that the bill does not guarantee a minimum of two seats for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
I can understand the very strong advocacy by the member for Solomon on behalf of the Northern Territory; I can understand that he would want the Northern Territory to become a state and he would obviously want increased representation for the people whom he is privileged to represent in this place. I know that he is a very good and effective representative—and I can understand that you are going to speak very strongly on behalf of your constituents. But the matter of statehood for the Northern Territory is some distance down the track. Personally I believe that the Northern Territory will ultimately become a state, but I imagine that the people of the Northern Territory would have to vote for that matter in some sort of referendum. In the most recent opportunity they had, they decided that they did not want to be a state at this stage. But the fact that they are not a state does not diminish the quality of the representation provided for the Northern Territory by the honourable member for Solomon.
The member for Melbourne Ports does support the legislation, but I am a bit disappointed in him because he suggested that he was somehow cynical about the reason for the introduction of this bill. He seemed to suggest that in some way it was designed to advantage the Northern Territory. That is not the case. He obviously will be voting for the legislation because he knows it might give the member for Lingiari a chance of hanging on—because if there were only one electorate in the Northern Territory then the member for Lingiari would no doubt be destined for parliamentary retirement. The member for Melbourne Ports claimed that the ACT should be entitled to three seats. That is a view of the member for Melbourne Ports which is not necessarily shared by everyone else in this place. But this bill does remove the unintended discretion in relation to statistics used for entitlement calculations and it does provide the government's response to the JSCEM report tabled on 25 March 2004.
The member for Blair spoke very strongly in support of the legislation. He has had substantial involvement in the past in the Northern Territory and is well qualified to comment on the Northern Territory. I understand also that he spoke very highly of the work of the honourable member for Solomon in the Northern Territory. The member for Blair is clearly a very erudite and keen observer of the situation there.
On behalf of the government, I would particularly like to compliment the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Kooyong. His committee dealt with very complex and technical issues. The fact that the committee was able to achieve unanimous outcome does speak very well not only of the virtue of the matters contained in this bill but also of the willingness of members on both sides to sit down. It is also proof positive of the effective chairmanship of the honourable member for Kooyong.
The member for Batman could not resist the temptation to introduce a tiny bit of politics; he tried to criticise the government over the previous bill. I want the member for Batman to understand that the government has given consideration to all of the issues raised by the committee and this bill is a comprehensive response. The member for Flinders also spoke very strongly in favour of the bill. The member for Calare was less enthusiastic—but the member for Calare is not enthusiastic about a lot of things the government or the opposition seek to achieve, although he usually votes with the opposition, I note, in most divisions in the House of Representatives.
The committee unanimously recommended that the Electoral Commissioner's determination of February 2003 be set aside by government legislation to the extent that it applies to the Northern Territory. The committee also recommended that the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918—the Electoral Act—be amended to provide that the Electoral Commissioner use the latest published population statistics in making his calculations, publish his calculations and any relevant adjustments within a certain time period and take account of the margin of error in these statistics when calculating the representation of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
The government considers the most effective way to implement the committee's recommendations is through legislative amendments to the Electoral Act. These amendments will not only provide greater transparency and certainty to the Electoral Commissioner's determination processes but also set aside the Electoral Commissioner's determination of February 2003 to the extent it applies to the Northern Territory and revert to the Electoral Commissioner's 1999 determination that provides two seats for the Northern Territory. The legislation will ensure that actions taken by the Australian Electoral Commission since February 2003 for enrolments in the Northern Territory are legal. Upon commencement of the legislation, two divisions will be created for the Northern Territory. The Australian Electoral Commission has advised there will be no change in the boundaries of the current divisions of Lingiari and Solomon. Determination of state and territory representation in this chamber after the next election will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I thank members for their contributions and I commend this bill to the chamber.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2004-03-31,"—I would like to speak briefly on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 and indicate Labor's support for it. Essentially this bill is a tidying-up piece of legislation. It amends 22 acts and corrects minor drafting errors—updates references where there have been changes of names of organisations that are referred to. I am assured by the Attorney that it increases efficiencies and reflects current practices. Despite having some pride that I can normally stretch myself to a little more creativity than the Attorney, I think in this instance his page-and-a-half in speaking on this bill will be significantly longer than I can manage to speak on it given that there is very little controversy and it is obviously important that this parliament updates its acts as required and ensures that any inconsistencies, out-of-date provisions or drafting errors are corrected. Labor certainly supports this bill.",REPS,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,29,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-03-31,"—At the outset I would like to thank the opposition, in particular the honourable member for Gellibrand, for their support of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which is an important step forward. The bill will amend a number of acts relating to law and justice. The amendments correct minor drafting errors, clarify the operation of certain provisions, update references to organisations and other acts, and update legislation to increase efficiencies and reflect current practices.
The amendments correct cross-references, remove redundant references to organisations and courts that no longer exist or are no longer relevant to Australia, update definitions and remove spent provisions. The bill also includes amendments that improve efficiencies for Australian diplomatic and consular missions overseas, the Australian Government Solicitor and the Federal Court. Other amendments update legislation to reflect current practices in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the National Native Title Tribunal. This is a non-controversial bill, which I commend to the chamber.
