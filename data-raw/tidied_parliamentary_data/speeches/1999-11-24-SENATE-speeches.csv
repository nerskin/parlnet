"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-24,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 16:
(16)	 After subclause 15(1); insert:
	 (1A)	 In paragraph 15(1)(ba), the  conservation council  of a State includes any of the following organisations:
		 (a)	 the Queensland Conservation Council;
		 (b)	 the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales;
		 (c)	 Environment Victoria;
		 (d)	 the Conservation Council of South Australia;
		 (e)	 the Tasmanian Conservation Trust Inc.;
		 (f)	 the Conservation Council of Western Australia Inc.
This is one of those core amendments proposed by the Democrats to the proposed Wood and Paper Industry Council of the opposition. I say `core' in the sense that at its very heart it is designed to focus very strongly on environmental and ecological aspects of the council. In particular, it seeks to ensure:
. . . the  conservation council  of a State includes any of the following organisations:
		 (a)	 the Queensland Conservation Council;
		 (b)	 the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales;
		 (c)	 Environment Victoria; 

		 (d)	 the Conservation Council of South Australia;
		 (e)	 the Tasmanian Conservation Trust Inc.;
		 (f)	 the Conservation Council of Western Australia Inc.
As I stated yesterday, it is to their great credit that much of the more enlightened debate which has occurred within the whole process of the regional forest agreements has come from such organisations. It is imperative that these organisations be represented on any such industry body, for their particular expertise and advocacy. I commend the amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-24,"—I support the amendment, because it does bring onto the proposed wood industry or forest management council the very important conservation interest. As I said last night, this cannot be underestimated. If you look at the opinion polls you will find the majority of Australians line up with environment groups in wanting an end to the destruction of native forests in this country. Yet, with the exception of a person from the Australian Conservation Foundation and someone to represent the important interests of the forest based tourism industry being members of the council, in accordance with the amendment that we passed yesterday, that interest is missing on this council which is going to look at the management of the forest industries in the future. There is a whole range of logging interests on this council. To reflect balance in our democratic system there needs to be a range of interests representing other aspects of forest management for the future. This Democrat amendment provides for and specifies the inclusion of representatives from each of the states which are most affected by logging.
I draw the committee's attention to a graph, which I have distributed to leaders in the House, which points, for example, to information about the skyrocketing export of whole logs out of Australia to be processed downstream overseas. This is basically an export of jobs and value adding—that is, profits. It is occurring on a massive scale. These figures show that in the last year, in 1999, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the 
 amount of whole log exports from plantations in Australia increased by 90 per cent.
If you go to the wharves of Burnie, for example, or to Georgetown in my home state of Tasmania you will see the whole logs piled up to be sent off to Korea and elsewhere. These logs should instead be going to the sawmills of Australia as part of domestic use. They should be creating jobs in this country. The profitability coming out of them being processed for various end uses ought to be accruing here in Australia. At the same time, of course, they have this massive capacity to save us logging native forests.
But under the mismanagement of the regional forest agreements, native forest logs are being used for domestic purposes and the plantation logs, which could provide for our domestic purposes, including such uses as framing for new houses in Australia, are being exported overseas. It is crazy. It is a lose-lose situation. We lose the value added from our plantation resource and we lose our
native forests. It is no wonder that Australians are opposed to this. The lesson was learned in Queensland, where the Beattie government took into account the plantation resource in coming to a decision on the regional forest agreement, and a much better outcome was the result.
But in Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia, for example, plantations have been ignored. We have got this absurd situation where a regional forest agreement was based only on looking at how to cut down native forests. The prudent and feasible alternative—the plantations—was totally ignored by Prime Minister Howard and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill. That is gross mismanagement of the forest source that belongs to all Australians. I would ask that the graph I have provided the committee, headed `Exports of Softwood Plantation Saw and Veneer Logs Tasmania and Australia', be incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The graph read as follows—

Source: ABS Trade Statistics
—I thank the committee because the graph is illustrative of the point that I am making.
The other point that needs to be brought in here, because it is an urgent one, is the situation which will arise when the World Trade Organisation meets in Seattle next week. This has massive ramifications for the management of forests in our own country, but you will not hear anybody else bring this up in this debate. Decisions are being made offshore which affect our forest industries, and they will not be brought up in the council as constructed here unless the representatives, as outlined in this Democrat amendment, are 
 on that council and can express their alarm. The World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle will have proposals before it for increasing the logging of the world's remaining forests, including Australia's. According to a report just released by the US trade representative and the Council of Environmental Quality, an increase of 9.2 per cent in logging of Australia's forests is predicted by 2010 as a result of the support of the global logging agreement which is to come before the World Trade Organisation in Seattle, supported by the United States.
Where are we debating this? What is Australia's position? I ask the parliamentary 
 secretary: what is Australia's position on the proposed world global logging agreement which will come before the Seattle meeting next week? Can the committee be informed of these things?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-11-24,"—I refer to what I said last night. The council that the opposition has put up is proposed to be constructed in such a way—and, after the debate we have had in the Senate, will be constituted in such a way—that at least three people will be representative of the interests of environmentalists with the ACF, scientific interests or, as Senator Brown proposed last night, tourism related forest industries. So we do accommodate those interests. It can, I think, be very strongly argued that we do not go far enough. That is the argument that has been put up today. But, as I said last night, the structure and the composition of what we have proposed is something that we have discussed at length with other parties, and we do not see it as being open to us at this stage to pick up the Democrat amendment.
That is the issue of substance. As to the issue of the technicalities of the amendments, I think we have a problem. Your amendments in this block basically go to the constitution of the council but also to some machinery aspects about deputy chairpersons, the provision of minutes, and so on. The problem we have is that your amendment No. 16 is actually predicated on amendment No. 12 having passed in a previous debate. Amendment No. 12 has not passed. We have already debated the issue of representation from the conservation councils of each state, and that was negatived yesterday evening. Were we to pass amendment No. 16 as you propose, we would have legislation which is inherently inconsistent. Not having endorsed the concept of conservation council members going on the body, we now, in this part of the debate, discuss the nature of those members that you want to put on the body. So, basically, I suggest to you that, having negatived amendment No. 12, we should not be proceeding with at least half this block of amendments.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-11-24,"—I ask Senator Greig whether it is possible to move his amendments Nos 18 to 24 together, when we get there. I would like to put in that request.
—Okay, when we get there. The question is that Democrat amendment No. 16 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-24,"—Chair, just three minutes ago I asked Senator Troeth, through you, to inform the committee about the Australian government's position on a proposed global logging agreement to be discussed at the World Trade Organisation talks in Seattle next week. I want to hear from the government what the position is because there is an enormous latent interest within the Australian public about the matter. It is not right that global agreements like this are struck by the Howard government, or by anybody else, or enjoined by the Howard government, without the community being acquainted with the arguments for and against and the ramifications. We know, for example, from the furore over the endangering of the Atlantic salmon industry in Tasmania by the imports of salmon from Canada and elsewhere, how easily moves in the world forum can lead to major economic and other impacts here in Australia without the industries being aware.
It is absolutely critical that Australia's position on any world or global logging agreement be flagged a week before the Seattle meeting. It is incumbent upon Senator Troeth, who has carriage of this matter for the government in this committee today, to tell the committee what the position of the Howard government negotiators in Seattle is going to be.
—The question is that Democrat agreement No. 16 be agreed to. Those of that opinion, say aye.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-24,"—Chair, it is totally unsatisfactory for Senator Troeth to sit there and refuse to give the information that I am seeking. It is totally unsatisfactory. This is a parliament, a place for debate; and debate has to be based on information. This is a critical matter. One has to assume from this one of two things: either 
 that effectively the minister dealing with this matter has no information and does not know—which is totally unacceptable—or that the Howard government does not want its position made public—which is equally reprehensible.
It is totally unacceptable that a committee like this is met by total silence on an important issue like this. You will know, Chair, that there is nothing that you or I can do to evince this information from Senator Troeth on behalf of Senator Hill, Mr Wilson Tuckey—the minister for forests and so-called conservation—or the Prime Minister. What is happening here is that the government is refusing to meet the public interest by providing this information in the parliament. That is to be condemned as a total dereliction of the government's responsibilities.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-11-24,"—Can I follow that up? Although we are not agreeing with Senator Greig and Senator Brown on this particular point, he has asked quite a relevant question. I ask the advisers either to give Senator Troeth an answer so that she can read it out in the Senate or else to put a new set of batteries in so that we know that she is alive this morning.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-24,"—I am not prepared to allow this to just float by, because I and my constituency are very alarmed about the prospects of an agreement being signed or enjoined by Australia in Seattle next week with a total lack of public debate here in Australia. We are talking here about the effect on our forests of the removal from Australia of its right to have defence mechanisms—including trade barrier mechanisms—in respect of the movement towards complete integration of the world economy. We need to know, the nation needs to know, why the government believes this is the right way to go. And you cannot do that by sitting in silence, by not even agreeing to the fact that a logging agreement is coming up as part of the Seattle process.
I agree with Senator Bolkus that the parliamentary secretary should at least get some advice and put it before this committee. I ask her to give a commitment that she will find out what Australia's position is as far as a 
 world logging agreement goes and provide it to this committee before this debate finishes. That is a matter of a simple phone call to Senator Hill or to Mr Tuckey or to Prime Minister Howard's office. This is a critical matter. We are talking about what Australia is doing in a world forum on trade, which has massive implications not just for trade but for this nation's environment and, I might add, for the environment of forests right around the world.
Is the Howard government saying that Australians do not care? Or is it simply saying that Australians ought not be informed of this matter? Isn't this just another case of the government secretly taking up the cudgels for the big logging interests which put large amounts of money into its election coffers? It is totally unacceptable that the government stays silent on this issue. It is totally unacceptable that Senator Troeth, the parliamentary secretary, is not even prepared to seek the information that this committee has a right to have at this juncture. She and the Howard government stand condemned for this anti-public attitude.
—The question is that Democrat amendment No. 16 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-24,"—by leave—I move:
(17)	 Subclause 15(3), omit ""by the Minister"", substitute ""jointly by the Minister and the Minister for the Environment"".
(18)	 Subclause 15(4), omit ""Deputy Chairperson"", substitute ""2 Deputy Chairpersons"".
(19)	 At the end of subclause 15(4), add:
	 ; (c)	 conservation interests
(20)	 After subclause 15(6), insert:
	 (6A)	 A person represents conservation interests if he or she is a member of the Council appointed under paragraph (1)(ba), (ca), (da), (ja) or (jb).
(21)	 Omit subclause 15(7), substitute:
	 (7)	 The Chairperson and the 2 Deputy Chairpersons must each represent a different interest mentioned in subsection (4).
(22)	 Omit subclause 15(8), substitute:
	 (8)	 After each 12 months in office, the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson must rotate positions.
(23)	 Subclause 16(1), omit ""The Deputy Chairperson"", substitute ""A Deputy Chairperson"".
(24)	 After subclause 16(1), insert:
	 (1A)	 As far as practicable, the 2 Deputy Chairpersons must act in the office of Chairperson on an alternating basis.
(25)	 Subclause 21(7), omit ""5"", substitute ""10"".
(26)	 At the end of subclause 21(10), add ""and publish them on the Internet within 14 days after each meeting"".
These remaining amendments are largely administrative and technical. In that sense, they do things such as replace the term `by the minister', referring to the forestry minister, with a term which jointly includes the minister for the environment, again in 
 keeping with the Democrats' ethos of ensuring that environment and ecological issues remain paramount within the proposed council. It also expands the notion of deputy chairperson to two deputy chairpersons, ensuring that there is greater flexibility within discussions and the opportunity for people to participate.
The rest are largely technical, and I have spoken to them on a previous occasion. The final amendment, No. 26, is one which I am most keen on—that is, to ensure that the committee would be obliged to publish its findings on the Internet within 14 days after each meeting. We live in an increasingly technological age where so many more people are referring to Internet technology. I think that particular amendment is in keeping with where we as a nation are going but it also facilitates, I believe, the transparency in terms of what the proposed council would and should be doing.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-24,"—I support these Democrat amendments, which are to improve the functioning of the proposed Wood and Paper Industry Council, which in turn is to advise government on the management of Australia's forests. I agree with Senator Greig that it is important that the minutes of the meeting, the proceedings of the meeting, are available on the Internet so people can see what is going on there. That is a very sensible move.
I will be interested to see what the government's reaction to that is because what we have just seen in the Senate is a total dereliction of the government's responsibility to the Australian public. If the government is not prepared to say what it is doing in terms of signing a world logging agreement in Seattle next week, what can we expect in terms of its wanting this wood and forest products council to be open and transparent? There is a big question about transparency, and that is the public interest. It is the government's responsibility to tell the public what is going on. I again challenge the government to tell the Australian people what is happening in Seattle.
A letter from Australians for Animals and other groups is going to the Prime Minister at 
 this eleventh hour regarding this really important meeting in Seattle. It says:
At the coming World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle, proposals to increase logging of the world's remaining forests have serious implications for Australia. According to a report just released by the US Trade Representative and the Council of Environmental Quality, an increase of 9.2% in logging of Australia's forests by 2010 is predicted as a result of support of the Global Logging Agreement which will be presented to the WTO by the US.
A 9.2 per cent increase in logging in Australia! The letter goes on:
We are writing to urge you—
the Prime Minister—
to ensure that Australia opposes any Global Logging Agreement at the upcoming meeting.
Of particular concern is a plan being pushed by the US administration and others to accelerate the liberalization of trade in wood products through the elimination of tariffs via Accelerated Tariff Liberalization (ATL) and non-tariff measures (NTMs).
We are concerned that US administration's negotiations over trade in wood products may lead to increased logging while at the same time removing key environmental protections such as export bans and eco-labelling. We are concerned that thorough analysis of the impact of such initiatives on global carbon storage, forest protection and biodiversity has not been completed.
It is like, `Sign the treaty before you know the consequences.' The letter goes on:
The world's forests are presently being logged at unsustainable rates with disastrous effects on global warming.
We urge you, as Prime Minister, to oppose the Global Logging Agreement at the WTO. Furthermore, we oppose the elimination of NTMs that threaten this country's ability to write and enforce the laws most needed to protect our environment and our communities.
Specifically, we urge you not to agree to any measure that would prohibit the following NTMs:
Raw Log Export Bans—These bans seek to ameliorate the devastation that massive exporting has had on our ancient forests and on the survival of the small local mills at the heart of many state's economies.
It is a two-stage process. What is happening in Australia, as I have explained earlier, is that, this year, 600,000 tonnes of plantation logs are being exported overseas while the 
 logging industry is saying, `We need to cut down native forests to supply logs to our sawmills.' So the profits and jobs go overseas out of the plantations and the Australian forests, which people want protected, are devastated in this lose-lose situation.
The second non-tariff measure that is of concern is eco-labelling and forest certification. The letter states:
Such laws allow consumers to be better informed in identifying and purchasing environmentally friendly products.
Is this agreement that Australia is apparently being asked to sign on to—and, as far as I know, may be promoting—going to prevent such eco-labelling? Eco-labelling enables buyers to see where wood products are coming from and selectively refuse to buy those that are part of the destruction of forests in this country and elsewhere around the world. A third point that is of concern is invasive species safeguards, and again the letter states:
The most effective way to prevent bioinvasions of forests is to prevent the entry and spread of invasive species.
Is that going to be prevented under a global logging agreement? The letter goes on:
Our concern that the WTO threatens these vital laws is well founded. Every environmental law that has been challenged at the WTO has been found ""illegal"" and the guilty nation has been forced to eliminate the offending law.
We are not talking about theory here; we are talking about what has already happened under the World Trade Organisation. For example, the United States put a ban on the import of shrimps because a bycatch of shrimps were rare and endangered turtles which were being killed. The United States were told by the courts that they could not, under the World Trade Organisation, keep up such a prohibition. Bad luck for the turtles. The letter continues:
The United States has been forced to weaken the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act due to losses at the WTO. We believe environmental protection legislation has been considerably weakened in Australia as a result of this country's ratification of the WTO.
Witness the failure of the government here to ban the import of salmon products which 
 endanger the Atlantic salmon industry, for example. The letter goes on:
According to the US study, by 2010, the ATL will have the following impact on forests allowing a significant increase in logging.
World timber harvests—
that is the destruction of forests, if you like—
are predicted to increase by 0.5%. This small increase masks dramatic increases in some countries. Timber harvests are predicted to increase in Australia (9.2%), Chile (0.5%),—
with its vast nothofagus forests—
China (1.4%),—
where the forests of Tibet are being marauded—
Finland (11.0%), Indonesia (4.4%), Malaysia (2.6%), New Zealand (3.8%)—
one presumes that there is a large plantation quotient in that one—
and Sweden—
likewise—
(7.6%).
We ask you to remove the ATL for wood products from the negotiations and explicitly oppose the inclusion of wood product NTMs in Seattle and in subsequent rounds of negotiations. We ask that the Australian government endorse and fund an immediate and comprehensive assessment of the impact of past and current WTO Agreements on forest ecosystems—
that of course involves wildlife—
and forest protection laws in the light of the RFA's and future contractual arrangements for Australian forests.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue.
I hope those citizens are in a position to thank the Prime Minister. What I cannot do here today is thank this parliamentary secretary representing the government and the Prime Minister in this chamber. When I have sought information on what is going to happen next week, which vitally affects Australia's interests, I have not been met by an honest response from Senator Troeth of, `I'm not going to give the Australian public that information,' but she has sat in her seat and refused to even rise and utter a syllable. That is not acceptable.
A democracy functions on information. As I said before, there can be only two explan 
 ations for this: firstly, the parliamentary secretary does not have the information, in which case a phone call would get it; or, secondly, the government does not want the Australian public to know what will go on in Seattle next week. If you ask me, that is the answer. The opportunity is here again for Senator Troeth to get up and tell the Australian public what is going on in Seattle as far as the global logging agreement is concerned. The public deserves to know.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-11-24,"—I was hoping that the parliamentary secretary would be rising. Will you answer that, Senator Troeth?
Well, I indicate to Senator Greig that, as I mentioned earlier, we cannot support most of these amendments. In fact some of these also are dependent on amendments that you moved earlier, Senator Greig—amendments that were defeated. Can I suggest to you that you propose amendment No. 26 separate to the others. This is the amendment dealing with publishing of minutes on the Internet, and that is one we can support. It is not dependent on other amendments that have gone before us and failed before us.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-24,"—Madam Chair, I am not clear on what the procedure is, but if you could facilitate amendment No. 26 being put separately, I am in accord with that.
—The question is that Democrat amendments Nos 17 to 25 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-24,"—I just let it finally be put on the record that Senator Troeth—backed by one other government person in the chamber at the moment, and in the absence of the environment minister, Robert Hill, who has been absent throughout this critical debate—has refused to supply the information I have requested on the World Trade Organisation or to even honour the obligation to this chamber to say that she will get that information and provide it. I find that situation extraordinary and reprehensible.
—We have been debating Democrat amendments 17 to 26. I shall now 
 put them in two groups—Nos 17 to 25 and No. 26. The question is that Democrat amendments Nos 17 to 25 be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.
—The question now is that Democrat amendment No. 26 be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—The question now is that opposition amendment on sheet 1617, as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-24,"—Let me sum up by saying that we have here an amended forest and forest products council. It is not what the Greens would have established. The Democrat proposals were far better and would far better represent the interests of the Australian people. But I believe that it will at least allow discussion of what is going on in the logging industry and maybe get past some of the secrecy of the past, although I think Senator Troeth's performance here today shows that secrecy is still a bulwark of the forest industry's methodology, through government, of rapid destruction of Australia's forests, hopefully with the minimum of pain from public reaction.
This is a critical issue. Wherever we can we need to be informed about what is happening in the forests of Australia. In summary: the government brought forward the regional forest agreements. It was originally a Labor government and now it is the Howard government saying that this was peace in our time. As recent events, not least in Western Australia, have shown, that is far from the case. The government cannot take a vital national asset like the wild and ancient forests of this nation and place them on the altar of quick profit making woodchip industries—and that is what this debate is about—in the face of opinion polls showing that 70 or 80 per cent of people do not want that to happen and glibly say, `Well, this is the process which is going to meet everybody's expectations.' It does not. It is an outrageous outcome.
The tallest forests in the Southern Hemisphere in my home state of Tasmania are to be logged from end to end under the Howard 
 government's agreement with the Bacon Labor government in Tasmania. It is anti-jobs; it is anti-economy in Tasmania, where the majority of jobs in the forest industries these days is in the service and tourism industry, taking people to see these wonderful forests; and it is anti-environment. You cannot expect it in New South Wales, where thousands of hectares of forests which are the habitat of koalas are targeted under this legislation for destruction. You cannot expect it in Western Australia where, as Senator Greig has been saying, threatened species like the chudditch, the native tiger cat, are having their habitats serially reduced under these totally unnecessary regional forest agreements which fail to take into account the massive plantation base in Australia which can provide all our wood requirements and provide it right now. You cannot expect it in Victoria, where a wild and scenic forest like Goolengook, since the signing of the regional forest agreement, has been illegally logged under the Kennett government and environment minister Tehan, who simply put through a bill and retrospectively made their illegal activities legal.
This is legislation which flies in the face of public sentiment in this country. It is legislation which does service to massive donors to the big political parties—I am talking about the woodchip corporations and logging corporations. It is legislation which sells out future generations because it diminishes the already much diminished forest domain in Australia. It is legislation which is going to drive species to extinction. It is legislation which is going to sully pristine rivers and catchments supplying populations downstream and other industries. It is legislation which is going to deprive Australians of jobs because as the forests diminish so do the service industries which increasingly are dependent upon them.
Let me repeat that in Tasmania 2,000 people are involved in destroying native forests—unnecessarily, because the plantations can supply our needs and the plantation logs are being exported whole to Korea—but 3,000 jobs are dependent on keeping the forest intact for the tourism and service industries, which are creating jobs at the same time as the woodchip industries are shedding jobs due 
 to automation and aggregation. This legislation has all sorts of hidden costs and long-term opportunity losses. It is extraordinary that this legislation is going to pass the parliament against the public interest.
The Howard government should hang its head in shame. I guess it shows its cavalier attitude to the public that there are only two members of the government in this chamber at this moment. I guess it shows its disdain for the critical issue of the forest environment, including the wildlife that Australians love and want to see protected, that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill, has absented himself throughout this long debate. I find that a total dereliction of his responsibility to that portfolio, to those forests and to the Australian people. This is a black moment for Australia's forests, for Australia's environment and for public sentiment in this country.
Maybe the conservatives opposite ought to look at what is happening in New Zealand at the moment, where there has been a surge for the Greens in the weeks leading up to next Saturday's poll, and recognise that this is not just a one-off and that, when it comes down to it and other issues are talked out by the big parties, quality of life, a fair go and environmental excellence do count. In New Zealand the Greens are still fighting against unnecessary and wanton logging of forests on the South Island; and that matters to young people—it matters to all people. If I were a New Zealander in this country—and apparently there are 100,000 of them—I would make sure I got to the polling booth before next Friday to cast a vote for the Greens to ensure they do get across the five per cent line and get seats in parliament and are able to speak up for environmental and other issues which the Nationals in New Zealand have held in such disdain over recent years.
This government thumbs its nose at public sentiment on issues such as forests, in the way it has done today, at its own long-term peril. That does not concern me near as much as the peril of the forests themselves. These regional forest agreements usher in an age of unbridled and unprecedented destruction. It is almost incredible that we could be legislating 
 here today to open the way for the greatest rate of destruction of Australia's wild forests and wildlife at a time when we have less left before than in all of human history. And it is so unnecessary, because we have that plantation base which can meet all of Australia's wood product needs, including its export woodchip requirements. Those plantations were built up over past decades using taxpayers' money. They were put in in the expectation that they would meet a need for Australia as the demand grew. What we now know, from independently assessed factual material, is that those plantations can meet all our needs. This destruction of native forests and wildlife is so unnecessary, but that is what the Senate is being asked to give its stamp of approval to.
In Tasmania last week, the Labor and Liberal parties got together and passed a motion—there was one dissenter, Green MP Peg Putt—calling for no amendments to this legislation at all. How far out of touch with public sentiment are the big parties on this matter? Let me say a word of commendation for the movement that is obvious with the Labor Party at a national level. It has no doubt been fostered by the enormous public reaction against the continued woodchipping of forests in Western Australia as well as in the eastern states, but it is to be encouraged. My word of advice to the Labor Party is that, at its national conference in Hobart next year, it should come up with a new suite of environmental policies which involve ending the unnecessary destruction of wild forests in this country. That will give it a plus with the Australian people when they next go to the polls.
In the meantime I make this commitment as an Australian Green: I will continue to fight in this place for the protection of Australia's wildlife and its forests and its ecosystems. I will continue to fight against this prejudiced and ill-informed destruction involved in the passage of this legislation. I have never seen a situation like that which I saw this morning where, on a matter which is of global importance—that is, Australia's role in Seattle next week—not only did the government refuse to give information, but the government repre 
 sentative failed to get out of her seat and make a commitment to inform the Australian people. This whole process is reprehensible; it is anti-public as well as anti-forests. I hope it is the government and not the forests that ultimately end up being the receivers of the damage from this totally unacceptable process.
We live to fight another day. It is obviously up to the people of Australia to tackle governments and oppositions on this matter. The issue is far from over. I, for one, will continue to fight for our forests as long as I draw breath in this place.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-24,"—This proposal by the opposition for its Wood and Paper Industry Council is certainly a far cry from what we Democrats had advocated and had fought for throughout the duration of this debate. It now stands on record that we Democrats principally fought to improve on the council with our particular arguments for environmental and ecological advocacy. These were best encapsulated by our attempt at passing Democrat amendment (2) relating to the objectives of the council. This would have sought to alter the functions of the proposed council so that it would be obliged to pursue certain objectives, the first of those being ecologically sustainable forest management in all RFA regions—not unremarkable, I think. Secondly, the council would have had to pursue the objective of increasing the areas available for conservation purposes. Given the overwhelming public opinion in favour of that, I find it difficult to understand why that too could not be supported. The third objective would have included protecting threatened species, some of which we have spoken of by name. The one which I am most familiar with is the native cat, or chudditch, in my home state. It is in grave danger of extinction in that state.
Further, there would have been a focus on protecting wetland areas and areas of important ecological diversity. Again, that is nothing too remarkable. Our proposal to alter the objectives of the council would also have ensured that the principles of ecologically sustainable development for forest industries were also a part of that council. I find it 
 astonishing that that could not have been supported.
The Democrats fought also to ensure that the conservation council should have included the notion that every state ought to have representation on such a council, in part through the participation and advocacy of groups such as the Queensland Conservation Council, the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales, Environment Victoria, the Conservation Council of South Australia, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and the West Australian Conservation Council. That too was rejected.
I think it is very sad that, in the question before us about one particular industry council advocated by the government and another proposed by the opposition, both fall far short of any serious attempt to consider our forest industries, such as they are, as to any extent focusing on those things that most people really care about within the forests—that is, their protection, the animal and bird life living within them and the actual vegetative diversity that the forests themselves constitute. I was particularly appalled that no real recognition was granted to the notion of consideration and protection of threatened species within such logged areas of native forests.
On the question before us, what is it that we do? Senator Brown has said on a previous occasion that he can count. I too can count, and I can see that at the end of the day one of these industry councils is going to be successful. The question in front of us, therefore, with any semblance of ecological imperative and advocacy is: on which do we decide? To that end, the Democrats have decided with great reluctance that we will support the opposition's amendment in relation to this council.
In doing so, I am pleased to place on record that we Democrats fought as best we could in trying to vastly improve on the proposition before us. We are sincere and passionate about protecting our native forests. We too will live to fight another day, but for now I remain confident that we have argued on every point that we could in making what we see as a proposition for a bad council better to some small extent. I am very pleased that 
 I have been able to represent the concerns of the many passionate Western Australians so keen on protecting the native forests in that state. We certainly did what we could. In summing up, I am saying that we support this amendment with great reluctance. It is a great pity that Labor could not have approached this issue with more sincerity.
Amendment, as amended, agreed to.
—Senator Brown, I think your amendments on sheet 1619 have been overtaken by the passage of this. We now move to the final questions. I recall from the debate several weeks ago when we started that we said we would actually divide these questions. The first question is that the committee does not insist on its amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives. The second question will be that the committee agrees to the additional amendment made by the House of Representatives as amended. I now put the first question. That question is that the committee does not insist on its amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-11-24,"—We are nearing the end of a debate which the opposition has made clear will not result in a bill to which the government can agree. For reasons that I have already explained at length, the government cannot accept the opposition's proposals for parliamentary scrutiny and potential disallowance of the regional forest agreements. To do so would result in widespread disruption and unemployment, particularly for small sawmills and their contractors—the very people who the opposition claims to represent.
When the bill was last before the Senate, Senator Murphy, who for some inexplicable reason is not here today, challenged me to explain why these things would happen. `Scaremongering' was the term that Senator Murphy and the opposition used. Let me therefore bring home to you once again what you are trying to do to these small sawmills and their employees. The opposition amendments propose that an RFA is not an RFA until it has undergone a parliamentary scru 
 tiny process and potential disallowance. Under current regulations, exports of woodchips would not be allowed after 31 December 1999 unless an RFA was in place. The government has announced that it will recommend that these regulations be extended to 31 March 2000. I acknowledge that the opposition has indicated it will support this extension, which is consequent to delays arising out of the Victorian election.
The opposition amendments would prevent any RFAs from being finalised by even the extended date, except possibly those signed before 31 March 1999. As a result, were your amendments to be accepted, woodchip exporters would immediately cease accepting sawmill waste, which would in turn jeopardise the financial viability of small sawmills in particular. If you want further confirmation of that, ask NAFI, ask the woodchip exporters, ask the Forest Protection Society or even ask the CFMEU. They will tell you exactly the same thing.
It is the opposition's intransigence on this issue which will be solely responsible for this bill being laid aside. The opposition's position will become even more absurd when all the RFAs are signed and the 31 March deadline is reached because then the effect of the opposition amendments will be to invalidate all the RFAs. In case the opposition believes that the woodchip regulations can be indefinitely extended, let me tell you that the government has no wish to join the opposition in making a farce of the RFA process, nor would further extensions be supported by the Labor government in Victoria and New South Wales.
Finally, throughout this debate the opposition has repeatedly claimed that arrogance, stubbornness or refusal to negotiate on the part of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation has prevented an outcome to this debate. Let me state for the record that the government and the minister have always been willing to negotiate sensible amendments to this legislation. The opposition has rejected those approaches. It is now exposed as an opposition which opposes for opposition's sake, an opposition which has no policy other 
 than opposition and an opposition which has betrayed its own constituency.
To those opposite who have been preaching negotiation and compromise, particularly senators and members of the other place from Tasmania—and I do note that there are no opposition senators from Tasmania present in the chamber today—I say: make sure that you advise your constituents of the truth when you return to your states for the summer recess. I can assure you that the government will make sure that the timber states and the electorates are fully aware of the way in which you have denied them the security, the certainty and the optimism for their future to which they are entitled.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-11-24,"—We have heard it all before. It is a bit rich for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, having sat here mute all morning and having not once answered a question put to her by opposition or Independent senators, to suddenly find a voice—a voice that has been scripted for her by Mr Tuckey, her master's voice. Senator Troeth, why did you wake up so late? What have you been doing for the last two hours?
—Where were you for the rest of the debate?
—I have been here all morning; I was here all night. Senator Troeth, you were sitting there like a dummy without batteries, saying absolutely nothing.
—Order! Address the chair, please, Senator Bolkus.
Senator Troeth interjecting—
—And what have you come up with now? You have come up with rhetoric that we have heard time and time again and that does not wash in the community. This has been a truly pathetic contribution from a parliamentary secretary who, as a former Premier of Victoria used to say, should not be here. Is this the best the government can do in its defence? We have here two sets of amendments proposed by the Senate that go to the two particularly important aspects of this debate.
If you are concerned about the logging industry, you need to be concerned about the sustainability of it and its resource. You cannot just go out there and promise that tomorrow will never come, as Mr Tuckey does. You have to be concerned about the sustainability of the resource, and you have to be concerned about where the industry is going. This government has not shown any such concern. This government is sitting on its hands while job after job is being lost. If you look at the figures of employment in the industry, you see that this industry needs direction.
That is why we have put up the proposal for an industry council—a proposal that the government has opposed. You cannot have it all ways, Senator Troeth. You cannot just sit there and watch jobs going away, claiming that you are in support of jobs, without trying to give some focus to this industry. In giving that industry focus, we are concerned about sustainability. What is wrong with recognising that in this legislation we are giving industry—and, let me say, a lot of people across the community have problems with this—a 20-year blank cheque?
In those circumstances, is it incumbent on the parliament to show some responsibility or do we turn a blind eye to, for instance, what is happening in Western Australia? If you are concerned about the national forest policy, as you claim to be and as we are, you need to be sure that those policy elements are being put into effect. You cannot just say, `Righto, Richard Court, do what you like.' You cannot say to the states, `Do what you like,' and you cannot say to the industry, `Do what you like.' You have to say, `We have a policy that we are pursuing.' We need to ensure that the policy elements are being pursued.
The accountability mechanism is all about on the one hand recognising that this is a big give to the industry sector—much more than most people in this community can chew—and on the other hand saying, `We want to ensure that we don't have the bodgie process that has continued in WA.' That is what this needs to be about. You are isolated because, in the state of Western Australia, this minister—who cannot get on with anyone— 
 cannot even get on with his own state party colleagues. It is now incumbent on the Prime Minister to move Wilson Tuckey. We need to put an end to division in this sector. We need to get people working together, and there is absolutely no way that this rabid minister is capable of doing that.
—Order! Senator, please do not reflect upon a member of either this place or the other place.
—I withdraw. But I could put on the record everything that his own state parliamentary colleagues have said about him, which would be much worse than calling him `rabid'. You cannot end the division, give sustainable direction and get people working together with Wilson Tuckey. This minister is a red rag to a bull, and you know it very well. If he cannot fix up his own backyard in respect of Western Australia, he has Buckley's in respect of this.
The victims in all this are not parliamentarians of one side or another; the victims of Wilson Tuckey's rabid behaviour are people working in the logging industry. You cannot keep on feeding these people with the bulldust that this minister continues to feed them. You have to give them something substantive, and that is why we say that it is a bit belated for the parliamentary secretary to enter this debate.
—It's belated for you! Where were you in the 25 hours of this debate?
—Well, she has found a voice! Who put the batteries in? Would someone put their hand up? Someone has finally put the batteries in the bunny—how about that.
—She's a wind-up job!
—She may very well be, Senator Quirke.
—Order! Would you please stop reflecting upon honourable members in this place or the other place.
—Let me close on this particular point: repeated rhetoric from a rabid minister does this debate no good. If you really want policy outcomes, look at a way of 
 implementing the national forestry statement. If you want to do that, these two sets of proposals that the Senate looks like endorsing today are the way to go.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-24,"—The committee should insist on the amendments; that is the least that we can do. The extraordinary thing that Senator Troeth contributed to this debate, at the outset of her winding-up comments, was that this government cannot allow parliamentary scrutiny of what is going on in the forest industry in this country. That says it all. What an extraordinary, anti-Australian sentiment that is! Over $200 million of taxpayers' money can be fed into the woodchip corporations' interests through the regional forest agreements and the Prime Minister can fly to several states to sign agreements with premiers for the destruction of forests over the next 20 years—which will involve a massive loss of Australian heritage, people's rights and opportunities for businesses and job creation—but the government does not want parliamentary scrutiny.
Senator Troeth is saying that, as far as the forests are concerned, the parliament should be abolished. The next step from that—because we are getting very close to where the government stands here—is to hand the matter across to the woodchip corporations. That would do away with the public good, the public interest and the workers' interests, almost as rapidly as the woodchip companies are putting workers out of jobs, and leave things to these big donors to the government's election coffers who are calling the shots for these regional forest agreements and this legislation. I remind this committee about clause 7 of this legislation—put in last at the request of the woodchip corporations' lawyers. It is the compensation clause.
If this government cared two hoots about jobs in the industry, it would have made sure that such a clause endorsed those jobs and made it incumbent on the woodchip industry, if it is to keep shedding jobs at the record rate that it is doing at the moment, to compensate the workers losing their jobs or at least reskill them. Many of these people are in regional areas and they do not have other opportunities. But that is not the case here. Since the 
 regional forest agreement was signed by Prime Minister John Howard in Perth in Tasmania two years ago and he mouthed off about jobs, 500 Tasmanians in this industry have effectively been sacked. The last batch that I read about included men with families and commitments. They have log trucks worth between $250,000 and $500,000, which are mortgaged, and they are members of the Forest Protection Society—this front for the woodchip corporations and a society in which, no doubt, a number of members opposite have paid-up membership as well.
Did that protect them? Did the Prime Minister's signature on the forest agreement in Tasmania protect them? No, it did not. They have been sacked by North, which is always in the business of downsizing. Its aim is to get rid of jobs to maximise profit—a profit extracted from the Tasmanian forests at a loss to everybody. So here we have a dozen men who said, `We went to the forest protests against the greenies'—which means against the majority of Australians—`and we packed up and went to support the woodchip corporations. We thought this would give us security and we were told that the regional forest agreement guaranteed our jobs. We joined the Forest Protection Society funded by the woodchip corporations and we thought that this was our ticket to an assured income so we could send our kids to school and have the things that people want to have in this country.'
But the ink is hardly dry from the Prime Minister's pen and the pens of leaders like Premier Bacon and Deputy Premier Lennon in Tasmania and these guys are being sacked. Who is raising a word of support for these workers? Where is Deputy Premier Lennon? Where is Premier Bacon? Where, indeed, is Prime Minister Howard when these members of the Forest Protection Society are being destroyed as far as their livelihoods are concerned? They are being put on the rack. They are losing not only their trucks but their houses as well. Senator Robert Hill is not here to listen to this or to answer for it. I can tell you something else: Senator Troeth, the most junior person possible that the government has to take carriage of this legislation, 
 is not going to get up and answer for them either. When it gets down to it, they do not care two hoots. There is a much more important factor at play here: the political donations coming in from those corporations profiting from our forests.
The whole process is corrupt and insidious. It eats away at the fabric of democracy in this country and the livelihoods of such people as I have just described. These people are, on the one hand, given these glib assurances by PR machines and greenwash and then, on the other hand, when they have given the support that was required for the political fix, they are dumped. For 15 years I have been calling on the Tasmanian parliament and this parliament for the rights of these workers to be guaranteed. If you are going to insist on destroying Australia's forests and you say that the argument is jobs, then guarantee it in legislation like this. But neither the government nor the Labor Party has done that. What is guaranteed instead is the woodchip corporations' profit. Clause 7 says that, if any future federal minister intervenes to protect one stick, one tree or one valley of Australia's heritage forests, the woodchip corporations—which never paid a red cent for those forests—will be compensated for the value of the forests were they to be cut down and the product exported to Japan.
So the Australian taxpayers are left in the situation where their forests, if they are to be protected in the future, have to be bought from the woodchip corporations. Talk about land rights! It is wholesale ownership of the forests by the woodchip corporations at the behest of weak-kneed politicians, with this insidious money pouring into coffers process going on in the back rooms. It is disgusting and reprehensible.
But the outcome here will not matter because I am saying so. Senator Troeth will not get up and countermand me. She simply says, `Go and get confirmation that these mild amendments before us today will threaten jobs.' But who do you go and ask? Do you go to some independent arbiter? What is Senator Troeth's backstop? From her own mouth she tells us. She says, `Go to the woodchip corporations to get justification for 
 what is happening here. Go to the Forest Protection Society'—this front for the woodchip corporations funded by the woodchip corporations which, without any protest of any significance, allows its workers to be dumped in the way I have just described—`or ask NAFI.'
Let me tell the committee what NAFI is, seeing that the minister has not. NAFI is the National Association of Forest Industries. What is it made up of? It is made up of the woodchip corporations. So what Senator Troeth, the fount of wisdom in this debate, is saying backs up my argument: she is saying `the woodchip corporations, the woodchip corporations, the woodchip corporations'.
How come the Australian people do not count? How come, at a time when we know that the plantations can supply our needs, the public sentiment for protecting forests is being ignored in this matter? This is a prescription for this government, at the behest of the woodchip corporations, to throw away what has been its responsibility for 20 years and to say to any future government that picks up that responsibility, `You intervene, and the woodchip companies get compensated with millions of dollars out of the taxpayers' purse,' for simply not sending the chainsaws into Australia's wild forests which the woodchip corporations never paid a cent for. What an extraordinary situation. It is totally reprehensible, totally irresponsible and totally against the public interest because it is so unnecessary.
We could have a win-win situation here. We could be exploiting our plantations and protecting our native forests. But, as the graph I gave to the committee this morning shows, that is not an option. We get the plantations and we export them as whole logs to create jobs and add value; that means profitability elsewhere. So much for regional Australia, which the government says it is defending. It is doing nothing of the sort. This is a fix not for regional Australia; it is a fix for the woodchip corporations located in downtown Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. It is a fix for the big profit getters, the big shareholders involved in those woodchip corporations, 
 including several banks—Westpac being one of them.
Regional Australia is being dumped by this legislation and this fix; the workers are being dumped. Since Prime Minister Howard signed that document in Tasmania two years ago assuring jobs, 500 Tasmanians have been shown the door by the woodchip corporations and the logging industry—500. If that figure is wrong, let us hear from Senator Troeth what the right figure is. Instead of stopping the haemorrhage of jobs which has occurred since the woodchippers arrived in Tasmania, this accelerates the process. It is a total fraud against the public interest, and the government stands indicted for this legislation.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-24,"—The Democrats remain resolute with our position on this and argue that the Senate must insist on its amendments. I am very conscious of the fact that so many, particularly Western Australians in overwhelming numbers, are not simply asking but pleading with the Western Australian Democrats and other Western Australian senators to do whatever they can if not to reject the RFA in total—which I think would be best in light of the clear wishes of Western Australians—then just to improve on it wherever possible. Of particular interest to Western Australians—and it is something they are passionate about—is the RFA process in Western Australia. It has been a complete debacle from start to finish and it continues to embarrass the state government which, in turn, continues to run and hide from every question put to it on the whole process.
Western Australians were particularly delighted that one of the amendments made in this chamber with the critical support of the Democrats was to allow a disallowance of regional forest agreements signed post 1 March. This, of course, would include Western Australia, where so many people are hopeful of going back to square one on that issue and having a serious and legitimate attempt at creating an opportunity to have a logging industry in Western Australia that is both sustainable and ecologically responsible.
I really have nothing further to say other than to make it utterly and entirely clear that 
 we will be insisting on the amendments. As I stated in the previous debate, we do not think the amendments go nearly far enough. But it is clear that both the government and the opposition are largely of one mind on this process and that Democrat influence in this instance is limited in terms of making a bad bill better. But, at the very least, we do insist on the amendments that were first proposed to the House of Representatives.
—I now propose to put the two questions separately and without further debate. The question is that the committee does not insist on its amendments disagreed to by the House of Representatives.
—Madam Chair, I just draw the committee's attention to the requirements under standing orders for the declaration of pecuniary interest in any matter.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-11-24,"—Senator Evans, having just been called to the division, has now returned to his office to obtain his papers. I am happy to `entertain' the time that is available until he gets here, if that is the right word.
—Tell us how many people will be on social security now as a result of your vote in the—
—That is a very interesting point. If the chair will permit me, I will address aspects of Senator Abetz's point. Of course, the only reason they would be is that the position that the government is taking would be to hold the state of Tasmania to ransom over Western Australia. The RFA legislation, as amended by the Labor Party's position— 
—You are holding Tasmania to ransom.
—Senator Abetz, if you are going to interject, do so from your own chair, please.
—And then do not interject—if I might say so, Mr Acting Deputy President—because it is disorderly. In terms of the position that Senator Abetz has taken, the fact of the matter is that the Western Australian RFA has in effect been rejected by Premier Court; and now we have a situation where Senator Abetz is voting to hold the state of Tasmania to ransom over the Western Australian RFA—a most curious position. I must say that it was curious that Senator Abetz would invite me to comment on that matter straight after a vote had been taken, and that is the reason that I did so; but perhaps I will return to that matter later.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-11-24,"—I rise to speak on the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999  and the associated package of social security bills. In doing so, I commend Senator O'Brien for his worthwhile contribution to the debate. The Labor Party has some concerns about the approach adopted by the government in relation to these bills—they are allegedly all about simplification—and about where that approach will take us; but, on the whole, we have decided to support that approach and support passage of the bills.
We do have some serious concerns about some of the more minor measures contained in the bills—measures which, in our view, restrict appeal rights and access to appeal for clients of Centrelink and for people seeking social security benefits in this country. For that reason we will move a series of amendments, consistent with our policy on previous social security bills, to protect those appeal rights.
This debate has to be put into the context of the government's and the minister's recent attempt to limit access to welfare in this country. We all know that the minister, in her self-proclaimed seminal address on welfare, set out an agenda for attacking benefits paid to people such as those on disability support 
 payments and sole parenting payments. The minister was pulled into line quite severely by the Prime Minister. Both the speech and the discussion paper—which has now been released—have been severely sanitised in order to reflect a more open approach and one that is less judgmental.
It is very clear that the minister's agenda has been seen through. We know that it is about reducing access to social security. It is an agenda of cutting and reducing income support benefits wherever possible, an agenda restricting access to benefits and turning the whole social security system against the very people it is supposed to be supporting. The minister seems to justify her approach in all these areas by claiming that many recipients are frauds and should not be receiving the benefits that they currently access. Her modus operandi is to blame the recipients of income support and then cut their benefits. The agenda is dressed up as mutual obligation but it is generally just about reducing the benefits, and there is nothing `mutual' about the obligations that are imposed. The government has in fact cut the services and benefits that it provides as part of its obligations.
The minister seems incapable of thinking about income support without talking about fraud and welfare dependency. According to the briefings given to journalists prior to her seminal address, she is keen to cut the disability support pension and single-parent payments. The minister is actively inciting the politics of envy against these two vulnerable groups in society. I know from talking in recent times with groups representing those people that there is a great deal of concern about the government's agenda.
The paper tabled on 9 November on welfare dependency indicates that the government wants to reduce disability support pensions to the level of the Newstart allowance—which represents a reduction of over $1,000 per year to some recipients of the DSP. People receiving the DSP would also be required to meet the more stringent activity tests. The paper indicates that the government wants to significantly lower the children's age at which the parent payment cuts out, potentially lowering it from 16 years to just five years. The paper 
 indicates that the government wants to withhold a proportion of the Newstart allowance, unless the recipient meets certain obligations.
The whole intent and direction of the government's policy on welfare is clear. It is very much a narrow exercise in cutting costs. There is no discussion on how we might improve our welfare system and better assist those in need in our community. Labor support an objective analytical review of welfare dependency issues, but we are highly cynical of the government's approach. We are highly concerned that the language, precedents and government track record all lead you to the one outcome from this whole debate: cutting costs by reducing benefits to recipients.
In terms of the specific bills, the Social Security (Administration) Bill contains significant changes to the obligations of people receiving payments from Centrelink. I wish to discuss some of those changes and some of Labor's concerns. The current act allows Centrelink to issue notices requiring recipients of payments to notify changes in circumstances and events relevant to their eligibility. The standard time limit for notification is 14 days. The bill proposes a number of changes to the system. Rather than having a simple, easily understood time limit of 14 days, there will now be a range of time limits, depending upon the information required.
If a person is providing Centrelink with information about a compensation payment, the time limit will be seven days. If a person is giving information about most other matters, the time limit will be 14 days. If Centrelink thinks there are special circumstances, a delegate of the secretary can specify a time limit of between 15 and 28 days. I remind the Senate once again of the government's claim that these bills are about creating a simpler social security system. It does not seem to me that this will add to a simpler social security system.
Currently, we have one standard notification period that is understood by most clients, and it is proposed to replace it with a raft of different requirements, depending on the circumstances of the individual client. Indeed, some clients will have to keep track of a 
 range of different time limits for different types of changes in circumstance. A person receiving compensation payments as well as Centrelink payments will have 14 days to notify a change of address but only seven days to notify even the slightest change in compensation payments. How does the government expect ordinary people, the customers of Centrelink, to keep up with that sort of complicated system?
This is particularly an issue with Centrelink's clients from non-English-speaking backgrounds. There would be an understandable source of confusion out there on just when changes should be notified to Centrelink. No doubt the minister will claim credit for cracking down on welfare fraud when Centrelink recovers money overpaid to recipients because they have inadvertently failed to comply with the new, complicated arrangements.
Another significant aspect of these bills is the imposition of time limits for the review of decisions. These bills will bar people from appealing against Centrelink decisions outside the limit of 52 weeks for internal review by an authorised review officer and 28 days for a review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The government has proceeded with these changes despite the advice of a number of agencies with expertise in the area. Those agencies rightly point out that many social security recipients have literacy, numeracy and language barriers resulting from having a limited formal education, having a disability or being from a non-English speaking or Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background. It takes time to arrange translations into community languages or plain English. Not surprisingly, many low income people face situations of crisis—for example, homelessness, illness or domestic violence. Under these circumstances, it is unreasonable to provide a short period within which to appeal a decision.
There is no clear reason for the changes being proposed yet again by the government in these bills. There are already restrictions on the amount of arrears a person can receive if they do not appeal within the time limit. Currently, if a person appeals later than 13 
 weeks after the original decision, they can receive arrears only from the date on which they lodged their appeal. In a submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into these bills, the Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services argued that these changes were necessary because of the requirement of the Archives Act that records be destroyed 12 months after a person stops receiving payments.
It is important to note, however, that the Archives Act does not require records to be destroyed once they are 12 months old. They need only be destroyed 12 months after the person last received social security payments. In the overwhelming majority of cases, people who are seeking review of decisions continue receiving social security payments of one kind or another. This means that the department may very well have access to the relevant documentation. In situations where the department is recovering a debt from a person who is no longer receiving payments, the Archives Act allows for records to be retained until the debt is repaid. In most cases, debtors ask for decisions to be reviewed before the old debt has been fully repaid, so once again the Archives Act in no way justifies a reduction in the time limits for review of decisions.
The government would have us believe that the time limits of 52 weeks for a review by an authorised review officer and 28 days for a review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal are quite reasonable. But this simply shows how out of touch the government and the minister are with the reality of ordinary people's lives. There are many cases where these time limits could cause grave injustice. For example, where a person receives a sizeable lump sum compensation payment, they may be precluded from receiving social security payments for some years. At the time a person receives a lump sum compensation payment, they are less likely to challenge a decision about a preclusion period as they have little need for social security in the short term. Several years down the track, however, their circumstances may be very different and they may need that financial assistance. Even where the preclusion period was incorrectly 
 calculated by the original decision maker and even though the person would have no entitlement to arrears, they would have no right to review of the original decision once the 52-week time limit had expired. Once again, these changes will punish the most disadvantaged—the homeless, those from non-English speaking backgrounds, indigenous people and people who have had limited access to education.
The Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services noted that the changes in time limits for review of decisions were in line with the recommendations of the review  conducted  by  Dame  Margaret Guilfoyle. This is hardly a persuasive reason for such dramatic change. These changes will mean that people who are entitled to social security payments will not be able to obtain them because of a legal trap established by the government. The opposition cannot in good conscience allow those changes to proceed without challenge. We will be moving amendments to these bills in the Senate to remove the time limits for review of decisions. This is not the first time the government has attempted to impose time limits for review of decisions. The same changes in relation to the  Social Security (Family Allowance and Related Matters) Legislation Amendment Bill 1999  have already been rejected by the Senate.
The way the Social Security Appeals Tribunal hears appeals will also be affected by this bill. Along with seeking to restrict access to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal by imposing a 28-day time limit, through these bills the government seeks to make significant changes to the way the SSAT deals with appeals. Firstly, the government wants to allow the SSAT to determine appeals without hearing oral evidence from the parties. This will cause significant inequalities, for it favours people who are able to express themselves clearly in writing. Once again, the victims will be the disadvantaged, people from non-English speaking backgrounds and people with limited literacy. While the government admits that a significant proportion of the population do not have adequate literacy skills, they are removing the right of 
 people to present their submissions orally to the SSAT.
Allowing the SSAT to determine appeals without hearing oral evidence is an extraordinarily discriminatory provision. Even for those with good literacy skills, the idea of determining appeals on the basis of purely written evidence presumes that Centrelink clearly communicates the reasons for decisions and that people are able to understand the law well enough to respond appropriately in writing. These assumptions once again demonstrate the government's ignorance of the circumstances of many people who require the assistance of Centrelink.
The Social Security Appeals Tribunal is designed to operate in an informal manner, with expert members from legal, welfare or administrative backgrounds, so as to draw out the relevant information without expecting the applicant to present cogent, well-argued legal submissions. Applicants are clearly disadvantaged in any dispute with Centrelink officers who apply the Social Security Act on a daily basis. The only way to help alleviate this disadvantage is to allow applicants to appear before the tribunal and present evidence in an informal setting. Any change to the current system of face-to-face hearings will clearly prevent some applicants from gaining their full legal rights. Labor will also be seeking to amend these provisions of the bills to ensure that people retain access to the oral provisions of the SSAT.
Another concern that the Labor Party has with these bills is the requirement of the SSAT to refer back to Centrelink any new evidence presented to the tribunal unless it is satisfied that the applicant had reasonable grounds for not providing the information to Centrelink. Currently, the SSAT can receive and take into consideration new evidence and make an informed decision on the spot about the relevance of that evidence. What the government is proposing will complicate that process and require the SSAT to refer any new evidence back to Centrelink if it is judged that it should have been presented earlier. It is difficult to understand the rational for this clause. The then Department of Social Security suggested to the Guilfoyle review:
. . . this would encourage applicants to disclose all evidence as early as possible in the process.
It is not clear how applicants are expected to know about this rule. Most applicants are new to the tribunal and, therefore, have no understanding of the legislation that determines the tribunal's role. Most people will find out about this rule only when they find their appeal being referred back to Centrelink, which is far too late in the process.
The only thing that this change will achieve is more delays in finalising decisions, many of which involve people in dire financial circumstance who are after speedy, efficient and fair decisions. Making the process more complicated, bureaucratic and legalistic will only undermine access to justice and discourage people from exercising their rights to appeal to an independent tribunal. As a result, Labor will be moving amendments to oppose this proposed change.
It is important that we look at the context within which the provisions of this bill are being debated. Only two weeks ago we had a Senate inquiry into the minister's refusal to come clean on her welfare agenda. The minister, as I said earlier, has an agenda of cutting benefits, restricting access to income support and turning the system against the very people it is supposed to support. These bills reflect further that negative agenda. As a result, we have restrictions on the time allowed to appeal decisions, the removal of the right to present oral submissions to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and a range of other changes that will adversely affect income support recipients. All of the proposed changes I have noted will act to disadvantage income support recipients, and none of the changes are, in our view, justified.
Also, in the context of recent reports about the efficiency of Centrelink, both from the Ombudsman and from the Auditor-General, which highlight inadequacies in Centrelink's capacity to correctly process information to provide accurate assessments, it is important that we are very vigilant about anything that seeks to restrict access to appeal for the clients of Centrelink. Recent evidence points out that all at Centrelink is not as well as the government would have us believe and that 
 the systems and service are not as perfect as the minister would sometimes contend. Clearly, the billion dollars taken out of Centrelink's resources and the staff cut of 5,000 in the last couple of years are having an effect on its ability to service its client base.
In the context of the cutbacks to Centrelink and the independent reports about efficiency and administration problems inside Centrelink, we ought to be very wary about restricting the rights of Centrelink clients to appeal decisions. That gives us extra reason to be cautious. Because of those concerns, Labor will be moving amendments to protect those appeal rights in line with the arguments and the suggestions contained in my contribution today. I look forward to the committee stage and to gaining support, once again, for maintaining those appeal rights. The Senate supported similar amendments in the package of family assistance bills earlier this year, and I hope senators will again see fit to protect those appeal rights when we move those amendments.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-11-24,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the three pieces of social security legislation that are now before the Senate, relating predominantly to administrative matters and consequential follow-on matters. As senators would be aware, these three bills are quite sizeable. Despite the number of pages within them, the eventual effect of their being passed, at least according to the government, is that the Social Security Act will be about 500 pages less than it is now. That outcome, of itself, is something to aim for as long as that reduction in the number of pages is not at the cost of the entitlements or protections for the less well off in the Australian community.
The bills, as a whole, are predominantly aimed at simplifying the various technical rules by standardising them and trying to ensure consistency across provisions. That is an aim that the Democrats have long advocated. One has only to look at the Audit Office's report that was released the other day to see the problems that can occur due to excessive complexity in social security legislation. The Audit Office reported a very high mistake 
 rate, over 40 per cent, in the assessments made by Centrelink officers of people's claims for special benefit, and some of that was due to the inadequacies in the process and to the complexities of the particular payment.
That would have to be of concern to everyone in the Australian community, certainly to those who try to access the income support system. It is hard to see how the Australian community can fully understand their entitlements under the social security system if Centrelink staff have trouble figuring it out. That is not meant to be a criticism of the staff. As I have indicated a number of times, I believe the cuts to the number of staff at Centrelink have added very much to the strain they are under in terms of the load they have to carry along with the continuous changes to social security legislation throughout the year, which, as senators who have to debate and consider such changes would be aware, are many, frequent and often complex.
That number of continual changes obviously makes it difficult for staff to keep up with the current entitlements, and the Audit Office report detailed a number of flaws in the process and in the assistance that is provided to staff to help them with their job of accurately conducting assessments. I am pleased to see that Centrelink has taken on board the recommendations of the Audit Office in relation to the administration of special benefit, and hopefully that will go some way towards addressing that problem.
It is also worth emphasising that we do conduct this debate on these bills in the context of the government indicating that they are going to make the welfare system their next major area for so-called reform. I think `reform' is a much abused and misused word these days. It is basically becoming equated with change. Originally, I think, the dictionary meaning of reform suggested that it is meant to be some sort of positive change. Clearly, it would be very hard to see how a lot of the reforms the government have proposed in recent times, particularly in the area of workplace relations, could be a positive change for the majority of the Australian people. It is certainly change, but it is change for the 
 worse rather than for the better in many instances. So I think we need to be careful when using the word `reform' that it is not, again, giving false illusions of positive change when it may potentially mean very negative outcomes for a significant number of people.
Nonetheless, the government have clearly indicated that welfare will be the next big area they will look at in terms of policy modification with a general reassessment of the whole outlook and operation of our welfare system. We need to keep that context in mind when we look at any social security legislation that comes before this place.
Unfortunately, as I said in this place the other day, I believe the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, has done herself a disservice by not being open about the construction and detail of her original discussion paper she was going to release when she spoke at the National Press Club at the end of September. Her ongoing refusal to release those details makes it difficult to come to any conclusion other than that there is a hidden agenda on the part of the government. There is no other possible reading to make of the minister's action, given that her department officials suggest there is supposedly very little change between the original so-called drafts of the discussion paper and what was finally released. It is obviously hard to see why the original so-called drafts would not be released if there was so little difference between them and the final product. It is difficult to see how there could be any possible confusion by having different documents in the public arena if there is such little difference between them.
It is no wonder that that, therefore, leads people to be concerned about the hidden agenda, particularly given the fact that many people in the press gallery have clearly indicated that briefings were provided by the minister's office quite specifically detailing the contents of that proposed discussion paper—that is, it was aimed at reducing entitlements for sole parents and reducing entitlements for people on a disability pension. I think the government are taking the Australian people and the rest of the Senate for mugs if they think we are not going to 
 have pretty clear suspicions, to put it mildly, that that is a desired outcome of the government in terms of proposals they may be putting forward in the future.
Nonetheless, it is worth noting comments such as those made by the Prime Minister just yesterday in his statement about raising funds to assist with the cost of our defence forces in East Timor. He specifically stated that further cuts would not be made to welfare spending in Australia. That is a welcome statement and, as a member of the Senate, I will be very keen to ensure that we are able to help him keep to that statement.
When we are considering legislative changes, we need to consider the context in which such changes are being made. Obviously, that is the policy context and the agenda of this government in relation to social security legislation. In that context, I think unfortunately we need to be doubly careful that we do not allow changes to be made that will potentially reduce people's entitlements.
In that context, there are a few measures within this bill that the Democrats have some concerns with, and we have expressed those in our committee report on this legislation. I will not go into them in detail here because we can address them in the committee stage of this debate. The predominant concern is the government's intention to put a restriction on the time available for people to have a review of or appeal against a decision made by the department regarding their entitlements. That was considered and debated in this place in relation to the family payments legislation at the end of June. At that time, I indicated that I was not convinced by the government's argument as to why we needed to put in place time limits and I was not convinced it would not lead to some people being disadvantaged, some of them—a small number but, nonetheless, still some people—potentially quite significantly. Having had further time to examine that, the Democrats are still far from convinced, particularly in terms of the time limit for review applications by the SSAT.
Returning to the example of the Audit Office report—which shows the extent of errors made by Centrelink officers in their assessments, some of which have only come 
 to light as a result of the Audit Office's report—it highlights again why it is important to not put too small a time line on the ability of people to appeal or have reviews made of decisions of the department. Despite the fact that some of those decisions made by departmental officers result in people receiving more than they are entitled to rather than less, that is of no comfort to those people once the mistake is identified because, in many cases, those people will then have an overpayment raised against them and will be required to pay it back, even though the initial error was the department's. For people on small and minimal incomes, it can be quite difficult for them to have a reduction in their income in order to pay back money that was overpaid to them due to a departmental error. Again, that highlights why the time limits that have been put forward by the government are not necessary and are more likely to lead to some people having reduced opportunity to access their proper entitlements under social security legislation.
Having said that, it is worth commending the government for their efforts to simplify the legislation by ensuring that there is greater standardisation of some of the technical rules and other administrative provisions and by reducing overall the size of the Social Security Act. Our hope, as part of the ongoing community discussion as well as the reference group the minister has established in relation to welfare policy, is that the issue of further simplification of our Social Security Act is given significant priority because it is something the Democrats strongly believe still needs to occur.
Again, simplification should not be used as a smokescreen for reducing people's entitlements or bringing people down to the lowest common denominator. That has been attempted by governments of both persuasions in the past, where so-called simplification proposals have also had the very real and major side effect of reducing some people's entitlements. So it is crucial to ensure that simplification is not used, wittingly or otherwise, as a way of reducing some people's entitlements.
It is pleasing to note that this particular legislation does not have that outcome overall 
 in the majority of the changes and that it does lead to a simplification of the legislation without reducing most people's entitlements in any way. Hopefully it will also assist the hardworking Centrelink social security staff in their ongoing important role of assessing and implementing the Social Security Act and ensuring that the Australian community do receive their appropriate and adequate entitlements as part of ensuring that we have a proper, complete and hole-free social security safety net in this country.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY (ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-11-24,"—I have much pleasure in taking this legislation through the house for Senator Newman. This package of bills gives effect to the government's commitment to implement a simpler and more coherent social security system and comprises an element of Family and Community Services portfolio budget for 1999-2000. The package in the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999  also gives effect to some recommendations of the Guilfoyle report. I point out two of those: giving the Social Security Appeals Tribunal the ability to consider matters without having to convene an oral hearing if it considers that a review may be conducted adequately without an oral hearing; and establishing a 12-month time limit in which a customer may lodge an application to a Centrelink authorised review officer to appeal a reviewable decision.
Senator Evans, when he was speaking, intimated that we were restricting access for social security recipients to welfare. That actually is not correct. What we are doing is looking to introduce reasonable time limits for people to appeal a decision. The merit review system in the Family and Community Services portfolio is the only system without time limits. In other portfolios and in the portfolio I represent with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs there are time limits. It would seem to me that in order to conduct business in an orderly fashion in a way that is predictable, to work out how many backlog years appeal tribunals have, you need some sort of order in the system. To have no time limit is, I think, 
 unreasonable. It would seem from what senators on the other side and the Democrats are saying that they are not going to support this concept, and I fail to see how they can justify that.
There was a comment about what happens to people who have problems and cannot appeal in time. Well, there is scope to extend the time limit in special circumstances. Although these are not codified, there will be circumstances in which people will not be able to apply in time and they will be taken into consideration. I think it is unreasonable of the opposition and Democrats not to go along with these amendments that would make the system more orderly.
Senator Bartlett mentioned the issue of the Auditor-General's office and special benefits. Yes, the Auditor-General did bring out a report indicating that over a period of six months $1.5 million had been overpaid to people on special benefits. It is an unusual payment. I think there are about 11,000 people on special benefits. I am drawing now on my knowledge as chairman of the committee in the last parliament. Individual information has to be taken into account. It is a payment of last resort. When the Auditor-General looked at that there was no-one who should have received a payment who did not. There were some who received payments when some of their income was not taken into account. Centrelink and the government have realised that things should be done about that and have responded, even prior to the Auditor-General's report being tabled. But that pales into insignificance when you think that in our second year in government Senator Newman came into this chamber quarter after quarter reporting on the savings in overpayment and fraud in social security, savings that were being made in a system which minister after minister in the previous Hawke and Keating governments had said was tight, taut and terrific and in which there were no more savings to be made.
In the second year in government we were saving $47 million a week—I just want to say it clearly for those few who might be out there listening in radioland: $47 million a 
 week—in overpayments and fraud. They were not people who should have been receiving money but who were not getting it; they were people who were failing to tell Social Security they had a job, people who were defrauding the system. Quarter after quarter Senator Newman comes into this chamber and adds to that. We do not keep rolling over. Each year it is coming off a lower base of fraud. I think at the moment we are saving something like $19 million a week in fraud and overpayment on the previous year. That came off a lower base because we had actually eliminated a lot of fraud on overpayment.
I do not think I ever saw a Democrat in estimates pursuing issues of social security. I do not think I saw a Democrat once while I pursued Labor mercilessly in social security on issues where there was poor administration, poor management. So for Senator Bartlett to come in here and go on about the Auditor-General's report is a bit rich. I know he was not here then, but his colleagues were not assiduous in pursuing the Labor government when it was mismanaging social security.
The other thing I have to take issue with is that he continues to peddle the myth about what was in the draft paper that Senator Newman was going to present at the National Press Club. It will get to the point that governments will not be able to have any draft papers because they will be demanded to be looked at. So if you have a draft paper and you want to discuss it with people, you are going to be hindered because of the sort of nonsense that is carried on. You have been told over and over again, you have been told by officers of the department before Senate committees—and they are not given to giving wrong information—that the content is the same but that there were some stylistic changes. So it is just wrong to keep peddling the myth that there is something more in there, some sinister objective.
Senator Newman is putting out a paper to ask what we are going to do to ensure that we have a sustainable social security into the future. As the baby boomers age, as the dependency level changes—with the reduced 
 number of young people and the increased number of older people—what are we going to do to ensure that we can maintain a viable social security system? That is what Senator Newman is on about—the future. The Labor Party has no policies; the Democrats are living in the past. Senator Newman is looking to the future to determine how we can have a sustainable and fair social security system.
The Democrats come into the chamber and peddle nonsense about what was and was not in the draft paper and nitpick about the Auditor-General's report. The Democrats were never ever in estimates pursuing the Labor Party about the gross mismanagement of social security. It was a mismanagement that, in our second year of government, produced $47 million of savings every week. I say that in public meetings and people cannot believe me. They look at me as though I have lost the plot, thinking that I must really mean $47 million a year. I don't. Every year, on top of that, she has managed to make savings, by taking back from people money that they should not have received, money to which they were not entitled. We were borrowing a billion dollars a year from that generation of young people sitting up there in the gallery, from their future money, to pay for social security fraud. A billion dollars of Beazley's black hole in the budget was being borrowed to pay for social security fraud.
The Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 consolidates all the machinery and most of the administrative provisions relating to social security law. The  Social Security (Administration and International Agreements) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999  amends and repeals provisions of the Social Security Act 1991, consequential upon the enactment of the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999. The  Social Security (International Agreements) Bill 1999  consolidates existing social security international agreements into a separate act. I commend the bills to the chamber. I thank honourable senators for their contribution.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-11-24,"—Today I conclude a series of speeches relating to the future of regional Australia. I will start by stressing what I said earlier this year on Wednesday, 25 August, which was that the big challenge for rural and regional Australia, particularly given the opening up of the economy and the move towards deregulation and globalisation, is to 
 come up with effective strategies to assist the bush to survive in the new global environment.
I would also like to re-endorse the findings of the McKinsey report of 1994, which outlined the direction that should be taken in rural and regional Australia. The principles of that report were basically that leadership was vital at the business and regional level and that the role of government had to shift from being a doer and director to being a change leader in a region's economic development. The essence of these processes is to engender and maintain in regional leaders a self-help attitude. The vital question that remains, therefore, is this: how to empower our rural and regional communities to leverage their own future development.
I am proud to say that the Howard government is in fact the first government in the history of this country to call a regional summit to discuss the implications of this very basic question, particularly for government policy. That summit occurred from 27 to 29 October in Parliament House in Canberra this year. There were 282 delegates from the community and from government and business. They met over a three-day period to discuss problems and opportunities for regional Australia.
The Prime Minister gave the keynote address and expressed his commitment to a whole of government approach for `a better understanding of areas where we can make a difference and where we can make a contribution'. He emphasised the notion of a social coalition at the heart of the regional summit. This is about encouraging coalitions or partnerships between government, business and communities to find realistic solutions to the challenges faced by rural, regional and remote Australia.
The Deputy Prime Minister illustrated how the partnership could work in practice by using the example of call centres and going through the process of how they can be established in regional centres rather than in capital cities. Firstly, governments at both the federal and state levels need to provide the necessary infrastructure and services so that modern telecommunications services can be 
 put in place. Secondly, there has to be a commercial commitment from business by promoting the placement of call centres in country communities of an adequate size. Thirdly, the local community—starting with the local councils—has to ensure that the required skills are, and continue to be, available within the local work force. This cameo is a very good illustration of how the recommendations of the McKinsey report would work in a practical way through partnership between the community, business and government.
At the regional summit there were over 30 key speakers from communities, business and industry. There was a reference group of six, which was chaired by the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, and there were 12 expert facilitators assisting working groups that were structured around the 12 key themes of the summit. These themes were communications; infrastructure; health; community wellbeing and lifestyle; government—local, state and federal roles—financing and facilitating entrepreneurship; value adding to regional communities and farming industries; new industries and new opportunities; community and industry leadership; education and training; philanthropy and partnerships; and sustainable resource management. Some inescapable facts came through the summit process. Bringing together the findings of those 12 groups, the overwhelming conclusion was, of course, that we live in times of very rapid globalisation, that technology is going through an almost daily revolution and that, therefore, the future certainly is not what it used to be—as was stated by one of the participants.
Significant demographic trends have emerged in rural and regional Australia over recent years, and many of these are disturbing in nature. One is the coastal drift, where a very large proportion of faster growing municipalities and smaller towns are located on the eastern seaboard and south-west coastal areas of Australia. The second is the rise of `sponge cities'. In increasing parts of Australia, there are regional sponge cities like Toowoomba in Queensland, Wagga in New South Wales—
—What is a sponge city? 
—Senator, I will tell you in a minute. The third one I was going to quote is Horsham in Victoria—which I am sure you are well familiar with, Senator Patterson. A sponge city occurs where the regional centre grows and the towns and villages in the surrounding districts decline. It is a phenomenon that is typical right across Australia and is perhaps our greatest challenge in rural and regional policy. To take a New South Wales example, Dubbo's population has risen by 53 per cent from 1976 to 1997—up by half in just over 20 years—but this has been at the expense of the surrounding municipalities: in Warren, the population is down by 15.8 per cent over a similar period; in Coolah, down by 13.5 per cent; in Coonabarabran, down by 6.9 per cent; and in Wellington, down by seven per cent.
We have a picture in rural and regional Australia where the small centres are becoming smaller but the bigger regional centres are becoming larger. The total drift is not all into the big cities, such as Sydney, completely: it is also into these bigger towns which, particularly in New South Wales, are doing quite well. It is the ones at the next level down, such as Coonabarabran, that are not doing well; and that is where our challenge is.
The next rather disturbing trend is the age profile. The summit showed three essential things happening here. Young adults in the 15 to 34 age group are still moving to the city for work, education and training opportunities. Older and retired adults over 65 keep moving out of regional rural areas and into the bigger towns or to the city for better access to health care as well as leisure facilities. The third trend—and this is perhaps a hopeful trend in many regional areas—is that the adults in the 35 to 64 age group are gradually being drawn back into the country areas to raise their families and take advantage of a perceived better rural lifestyle. KPMG Consulting's Population growth report for 1999 estimates that in the last 22 years some 200 rural shires in Australia have lost population. At a state level, Victoria, for example, has lost about one-third of its rural residents since 1982, with knock-on effects for services like banks 
 and schools and a lingering sense of alienation in the regions.
The core message that came out of the summit, and formally endorsed in its communique, was that there are no magic bullets or quick fixes, particularly given the constant changes in the global economy and technology. Communities that have committed themselves to identifying and capitalising on their natural strengths, resources and assets have been the ones to successfully reinvent themselves. Regional communities that are very keen to include and invest in their youth are the ones that are often committed to working in partnerships with government and business at all levels; they want to resource the necessary skills, learning, education and training to develop their younger adults.
The communique statement said that governments must accept responsibility for facilitating adequate provision and maintenance of basic infrastructure and that regional Australians ought to have more equitable access to essential services, including telecommunications, power, energy, water, transport, health and education. Above all, regional, rural and remote Australians want to shape their own futures on a journey in partnership with business and government at their own local level. They are unanimous in not wanting a top down or a one size fits all approach from the big smoke.
John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, summed up the mood of the summit for a bottom-up approach, as well as the practical realities facing Australia in the new millennium, when he said in his closing speech on Friday, 29 October 1999, that:
. . . the political mantra of the new Century will be, ""It's local stupid"" rather than ""It's the economy stupid'.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-11-24,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. I refer to the 
 minister's statement in the Senate yesterday when he said:
In August of 1998, the then Department of Industry, Science and Tourism sponsored the proposal to secure APEC badging and invited other APEC economies to cosponsor the event.
Is it not true that APEC's Industry, Science and Technology Working Group, of which Australia was at the time `lead shepherd' or chair, gave approval to Australia's proposal for APEC endorsement of the event? Did this not enable the government and in fact the minister's own department to strongly influence the working group's work program, including the decision to grant APEC approval to the government's own proposal for official endorsement?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>APEC Technomart III</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-11-24,"—I do not know why the minister could not answer my previous question when his own department's annual report for 1998-99, released just last week, states:
. . . through the year . . . Australia took the role of Lead Shepherd for the Industry, Science and Technology Working Group, which enabled the Government to strongly influence the Working Group's direction and program.
I have a supplementary question: Is the minister simply incompetent or is he trying to hide the fact that his own department strongly influenced APEC's decision to give APEC approval to a conference which disastrously failed and which was run by a company that is now in liquidation?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>APEC Technomart III</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1999-11-24,"—I am not sure that I can add much to what I said yesterday. The facts are all on the table and were all on the public record at the time the matter was being handled by Minister Moore. In August 1998, the then Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, having been approached by the private sector managers, initiators and overseers of the proposed Technomart seeking its support—
—It wasn't Technomart then.
—It was a Technomart; it was not badged. They sought APEC badging and the department's sponsorship of that matter at that time back in August 1998. The department invited other APEC economies to cosponsor that event. That went through the normal APEC channels and APEC badging was secured. That was welcomed by the then minister, by the Queensland government and, of course, by the sponsors themselves.
It was all above board, as I said yesterday. It was always presented to the APEC working group on the basis that it was an initiative of the private sector to have a Technomart and that it would help and be good if the thing had APEC badging. That was done through the normal channels and was all above board. It was always on the basis that it was private sector managed but that the governments, both the Queensland and the federal governments, would hopefully provide financial 
 sponsorship to what was a private sector initiative.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>APEC Technomart III</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1999-11-24,"—I have no idea where this is really going. We have never hidden the fact that the department, through the officials who attended these APEC working group meetings, did strongly urge and support the proposition that APEC badging be given to this event. There is nothing hidden about that whatsoever. It is a perfectly proper thing for the department to have done.
This event did offer the opportunity for very significant promotion and showcasing of Australian technology. My department and the Queensland government did place considerable store in the professionalism and experience of the people in PacRim. They had good reason to do that and had every reason to believe there was every prospect this would be a successful conference. It is regrettable that it was not, but there is nothing wrong whatsoever with the departmental officials strongly supporting APEC endorsement of the event.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>APEC Technomart III</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1999-11-24,"—My question without notice is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Will the Assistant Treasurer inform the Senate of evidence of the continuing strength of the Australian economy? How will tax reform further help Australian families?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Performance</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-11-24,"—I thank Senator Gibson for that important question. Senator Gibson is well known for his particular concern and interest in the economy and for the important role he played in the tax reform program. There are a number of factors which underlie the current strength of the Australian economy. Unemployment has fallen by 0.3 per cent to 7.1 per cent. Since coming to government, we have created just under 600,000 jobs. We have continuing low inflation. We have interest rates at dramatically lower levels than the record highs under Labor, and we are seeing continuing strong growth.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Would Labor senators who are consistently shouting please cease doing so.
—Last night I went to the ACCI dinner with a number of colleagues, including Senator Conroy and Senator Collins. Senator Conroy, I might say, was in his black tie clobber, looking very bourgeois indeed—not the typical clobber you would wear to a TWU function!
Yesterday saw the release of the ACCI's survey of small business which showed that general business conditions in the small business sector improved over the most recent quarter. The survey also showed that the small business sector is optimistic, with the index for the next period at almost 66 indicating that business conditions should continue to improve.
However, while the economy is in good shape, it is important that we now put in place the measures which will ensure that the Australian economy is on a sound footing for the next century. We need to ensure that the 
 benefits of reforms flow through to Australian families and Australian workers. That is why on 1 July next year the government will deliver the largest tax cut in Australian history. Many families will benefit in the order of $40 to $50 per week. I think I am right in saying that Labor opposed tax reform; Labor opposed the tax cuts. Our business tax reforms are also an absolutely essential element of the reform process, and we are going to give Australia an internationally competitive company tax rate and also an internationally competitive capital gains tax regime.
The Labor Party is all over the place on this reform, as on others. Mark Latham was opposed to the very important capital gains tax changes that were debated in the caucus yesterday. Frankly, Madam President, if you had heard some of the debates in the other place this morning, you would know that the Labor Party on this issue, as on so many other issues, is all over the place. Where does Labor stand on any major issue? That is the hardest question anyone can ask in this parliament, because we do not know and the Labor Party does not know either. This government is presiding over clear policies for Australia which are helping to create a very sound economy which is delivering real benefits to Australian families and Australian workers.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Performance</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1999-11-24,"—My question is to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron. Will the minister please inform the Senate of the government's ongoing efforts to tackle the tragedy of indigenous family violence in our communities?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indigenous Australians: Domestic Violence</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-11-24,"—I thank Senator Ferris for the question, for her continued interest in this problem and for the initiatives she has 
 taken in her own state. Indigenous family violence is an issue of enormous concern to the Commonwealth government. The distress, the heartache and the despair of family violence touches the lives of so many people in the wider community. It should be of grave concern to the nation that some women and children continue to experience appalling levels of physical and psychological abuse.
The incidence of violence in indigenous communities is disproportionately high and must be given priority and attention by indigenous communities themselves and by all levels of government. The most recent reported incident occurred only last weekend, where media reports indicate alcohol related violence forced 12 medical staff to evacuate a community. It is absolutely unacceptable for women and children, in particular, to live their lives in such threatening and dangerous circumstances.
That is why, in collaboration with ATSIC, I proposed at the Ministerial Council on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs meeting in September that governments around Australia commit themselves to a national coordinated strategy to address the problem. I got that commitment from the states and territories, and I congratulate them for their support. As a follow-up to that agreement, on Friday I will convene a working group with representatives from each state and territory, ATSIC, the Torres Strait Regional Authority and communities themselves. This meeting is the first step in progressing and implementing a national strategy aimed at putting a stop to the abuses suffered by indigenous women and children.
The states and territories are primarily responsible for addressing family violence. However, the federal government is so concerned about the problem that I am pleased to announce today that the Commonwealth will devote $6 million from the $25 million Partnership Against Domestic Violence program to target family violence in indigenous communities. I would like to acknowledge the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Senator Jocelyn Newman, for her support in making 
 this initiative possible and for her own interest in this particular aspect of her portfolio.
Since 1990, indigenous deaths from family violence have been almost 30 per cent higher nationally than indigenous deaths in custody for the same period. Almost half—46 per cent—of all hospital separations among females for intentional injury are indigenous women. Among indigenous women, intentional injury accounts for more hospital separations than does diabetes or cancer and almost as many for infections and parasitic diseases. A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare study highlighted that, in 1998, indigenous children constituted 17.4 per cent of the total national number of children on care and protection orders. In other words, depending on which state or territory they lived in, indigenous children were five to eight times more likely than other children to be subject to abuse and neglect. It is a very shameful story.
In order to get a firmer understanding of the many factors involved from a community perspective, I held a roundtable in July this year, bringing people who live and work with this problem on a daily basis—all indigenous people who are concerned about this problem—together. This discussion highlighted the need for community ownership of the problem and community involvement in solutions. The Commonwealth has taken a leading role in this issue and has demonstrated its commitment to addressing this serious problem. It is important that this issue be not politicised. It is a very important action that we have taken, and I believe it will lead to a solution, or at least an attempt at a solution, based on community involvement.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indigenous Australians: Domestic Violence</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer

The answer read as follows—
SENATOR EVANS  asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 29 September 1999:
(1)	 (a) Has North Shore Diagnostic Centre applied for Medicare rebates for a new magnetic resonance imaging unit at St. Leonards since May 1998; if so, on what date did it commence operation: and (b) has the centre applied for any other new units: if so, when, and where are these units located.
(2)	 In the application to the Health Insurance Commission (HIC), on what date is it claimed that the contract for the purchase of each unit was signed.
(3)	 Have these new units been approved by the HIC to receive Medicare benefits on the basis that each contract was signed prior to 12 May 1998.
(4)	 Has each of these new units commenced making claims on Medicare; if so on what date was the first claim made for each unit.
SENATOR HERRON —The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	 (a) and (b) No. Under the scheme of the Health Insurance Act and the regulations made thereunder, applications for recognition of eligible equipment are lodged by individual providers not by practices.

The responses read as follows—
Senator Faulkner and Senator Conroy asked me some questions yesterday regarding APEC Technomart III which I took on notice.
I now seek leave to table the response to the Honourable senators questions 

Question 
Did the Federal Government give any other support to PacRim Technomart in relation to APEC Technomart III before the June 1999 contract was signed?
What other support, financial or in-kind, did the Federal Government give to Ms Maestracci or PacRim Technomart in organising APEC Technomart III?
Response
For more than a year, beginning at least with my predecessor's media statement of 9 October 1998 welcoming APEC badging, the Federal Government has been completely open about its sponsorship of APEC Technomart III. The Government supported APEC endorsement and continued to support the event within APEC economies. This was an important part of sponsorship of the event and this has never been denied.
Following the Commonwealth securing APEC badging, the Queensland Government also welcomed APEC endorsement.
The former Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and the Current Minister for Industry, Science and Resources filmed promotional videos for the event, the Prime Minister wrote a letter of support for Technomart, and the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources wrote a letter of support for the Venture Capital Forum.
As part of its sponsorship of Technomart to APEC economies, the Department of Industry, Science and Resources assisted PacRim in three ways;
.	 helping to arrange information briefings through Australian posts, both before and after the contract was signed;
.	 raising Technomart, through Australia's Senior Official, at APEC's second Senior Officials' Meeting held in New Zealand in May 1999; and
.	 facilitating the promotion of APEC Technomart at other expositions, for example Oztech  99 held in Chinese Taipei in April 1999.
Question
1.	 When the Federal Government proposed to APEC that Australia should host APEC Technomart III and when Australia subsequently provided progress reports to APEC, was Ms Maestracci nominated as the project overseer?
2.	 Did she not represent Australia and the Federal Government in that capacity?
3.	 Can the Minister confirm that, while Australia's nominated APEC Contact for APEC Technomart III was Ms Judith Maestracci from PacRim Technomart Inc. the nominated contacts for all other participating APEC economies were government officials 
 from each country's respective industry department?
Response
1.	 Ms Maestracci was nominated Project Overseer of the APEC Technomart III project because she was the Project Manager for the organisers for the event.
Each APEC project has a Project Overseer. The Project Overseer is defined within APEC as a ""person, institution, corporation or executing agent who is responsible for supervising the project and reporting on its progress to the relevant APEC fora"" It is by no means unusual in the APEC Industrial Science and Technology Working Group for a Project Overseer to be from the non-government sector.
Each APEC economy has nominated contact points within the working group. This contact point is the general point of contact for all projects within that economy and for other matters relating to working group activities. Contact Points from all economies are government officials.
2	 Ms Maestracci represented PacRim, not Australia and not the Federal Government.
3.	 The Australian contact point for the relevant working group was and still is, an official from my Department.
Each APEC project has a Project Overseer. The Project Overseer is defined within APEC as a ""person, institution, corporation or executing agent who is responsible for supervising the project and reporting on its progress to the relevant APEC fora"". It is by no means unusual in the APEC Industrial Science and Technology Working Group for a Project Overseer to be from the private sector.
Ms Judith Maestracci was the private sector Project Overseer for the private sector APEC Technomart III project. The role of Project Overseer includes acting as the contact for technical aspects of the particular project and Ms Judith Maestracci was the  technical contact for this project.
In her capacity as Project Overseer, Ms Maestracci was a member of the Australian delegation to the March and August 1999 Working Group meetings, where she promoted Technomart to APEC officials, and she presented a progress report at the August 1999 meeting.
At all times Ms Maestracci represented PacRim and not the Federal Government.
It is common in APEC for a Project Overseer to be from the non-government sector. 

For instance:
.	 the Project Overseer for Thailand's ""Gender Stocktaking of IST WG Projects"" Project is from the Women's Action and Research Institute, and
.	 the Project overseer for Australia's ""Gonococcal Antibiotic Susceptibility"" project is from the  WHO Collaborative Centre for STD and HIV, which is based at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney.
Question
Regarding the 16th APEC Industrial Science and Technology Working Group meeting in Hong Kong in March 1999: Did the Australian Delegate list include four senior officials from the Department of Industry Science and Resources, including one senior official acting as `Lead Shepherd' using APEC terminology. Did the Australian delegate list also include Ms Judith Maestracci from PacRim Technomart?
Response
The Australian delegate list to the 16th Industrial Science and Technology Working Group meeting comprised four officials from the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, including one senior official acting as ""Lead Shepherd"". It also included an official from the Department of Health and Aged Care.
In addition to government officials, delegations to the Working Group include individuals from academia and the private sector. These delegates do not represent the government of their economies.
The Australian delegation to the 16th Industrial Science and Technology Working Group meeting included two such non-government delegates—Ms Maestracci of PacRim Technomart and the Chairman of the International Relations Committee of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>APEC Technomart III</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,answer

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-11-24,"—I indicate that the opposition supports the government's proposed alterations to the routine of business and the days and hours of meeting. We do so with a number of assumptions built in, based on a number of assurances that have been given to the opposition with regard to the proceedings of the Senate. Our intention is to try to avoid the situation where an extra week of sitting time would be required. We are doing what we can to facilitate the proper consideration of government business and allow for proper debate of government business.
A list of bills has been prepared by the government indicating their priorities. We understand that there will be no additional bills—without extraordinary circumstances arising—to those in the list provided and that every effort will be made to facilitate the business of the Senate by the reconsideration of some of the ambit in the government's claim that has been put to us.
We indicate to the chamber that our interest is to ensure that the Senate operates effectively and that we are able to conclude the business of the chamber within a reasonable period of time, with due regard to the government's program and with due regard to the consideration of the importance of the issues that are presented to us. We understand that those commitments have been given and we agree to this motion on that basis.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-24,—I have indicated to the opposition that I may have difficulty being here throughout Friday due to a prior commitment. I am in the unusual position where pairing arrangements do not exist. I know the opposition has taken this matter up with the government. I would hope that some remediation of that position can be found.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-11-24,"—So far as I am concerned, it is desirable not to be sitting up until 23 December. If we sat for another week, that would put us 
 into the week before Christmas. I have been here for too long to suffer any more of those times we have had sitting right up to the death knock. I think this change is desirable all round. I commend all parties, particularly the government, for attempting to smooth the way so that the essential pieces of legislation that are required by 31 December go through. There is one there that is not required, and six hours has been set down for it. I would have thought perhaps 20 hours might have been a better guess. I understand that, in any event, from the government's point of view, it is not necessary for that legislation to go through by 31 December.
I congratulate the government, the opposition, the Democrats and the Independents for what has been achieved. As Senator Brown said, there are problems because of this change, just one being that it is very difficult to get home on Friday night, as the airlines seem to be pretty packed. Nevertheless, we will overcome that problem somehow.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-11-24,"—I thank all senators for their support. I know it is less than desirable to be adding another day with less than 36 hours notice. We recognise the problems of senators. The Democrats have some people missing. We understand Senator Brown's problems, and we genuinely appreciate his accommodation on this occasion. We will seek to work with the opposition and the other parties to ensure that Senator Brown's views are reflected in the votes of the chamber. I think, based on his voting record, it will not be too hard to make an assessment of where that vote will be cast.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—As was suggested by the interjection, perhaps he could give his proxy to Senator Harradine, and Senator Harradine could promise him to ensure that the proxy is cast in the right manner. It seems to work quite well in the WA Liberal Party from time to time, and I am sure it will work here.
—Who do you give yours to—Crichton-Browne? 
—No, I have lost his address! More seriously, Senator Carr did raise an important matter and that is we do seek these extra hours for the reasons that Senator Harradine has put forward. We want to avoid the oft repeated spectacle of the Senate sitting up until Christmas Eve, almost competing with Santa Claus and the reindeers in the skies over Australia to get home on the night. We think we have an achievable program. It has been pared down significantly. Even since our meeting yesterday, another significant bill will be taken off that list. I do not think it is the one that Senator Harradine is referring to. Senator Harradine, we have to be very ambitious in everything we do in Australia. We need to aim high. When we are managing government business, we aim very high and I thank all senators for allowing us to achieve so much in the legislation that has been passed for the good of all Australians.
I just say, in response to Senator Carr's point about the list that was provided to leaders and whips, that I did make the point in private discussions yesterday that it may be necessary to add some bills. They will not be major packages. I am not sure whether I exactly agree with Senator Carr's grasping at the words `extraordinary circumstances'. There have been extraordinary circumstances on previous occasions. I cite, for example, the Kosovo refugee bill—that was an extraordinary circumstance. There were some announcements made yesterday about Timor by the Prime Minister. I am not sure if any legislation will flow from those announcements, but it would not be unusual, and there may be other circumstances.
We will give the opposition and all the other parties as much notice as possible if anything comes up. I do not have anything particular in mind, other than those. But if anything does come up, I just want to make it quite clear that we are not going to try to pull any swifties or add any big packages to the list. There are always, over a period of two or three weeks in the governance of a country like Australia, contingencies that apply, and I want to make it clear that we have those in mind. I thank all of our colleagues for their support on this issue.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1999-11-24,"—Last Sunday I was privileged to attend the opening of a very special house for recovering substance abusers in suburban Adelaide. The house is a former Housing Trust property and was generously made available by the Hon. Dean Brown, the Minister for Human Services in South Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his support in this initiative. I am the voluntary Chair of the Australian Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation program, which assists with the administration of the house.
The house's opening on Sunday was particularly significant for all of us. It is committed to providing the best possible care for 
 those addicted to drugs and provides a supportive environment for those who want to live drug free. We currently have more than a dozen young men and women who are rebuilding their lives with the support of a dedicated team of professionals and volunteers. In words and in song, some of these people told their stories at the opening ceremony in simple yet moving messages of great relevance to the wider community.
There is no doubt that, as a society, we need to better understand that individuals addicted to drugs may also be our daughters, our sons, our brothers, our sisters, our mothers, our fathers, our relatives and our friends. We now know that to abandon these usually young men and women to their addiction deprives them of the opportunity to contribute to our society in a far more meaningful way. It also leaves them open to a high risk lifestyle, facing both health hazards and the inevitable entry into a life of crime, with the subsequent terms of imprisonment and everything that follows from such a deprivation of personal freedom.
The Prime Minister's announcement last week of the diversion program is another valuable step in our Tough on Drugs initiative. It recognises that, for the first time, offenders who have not offended before can have the opportunity of treatment and education, which is indeed preferable to falling victim to the tangles of the criminal justice system. Together with the additional funding for education initiatives announced today by Minister David Kemp, this government is recognising that there are no simple solutions to this very complicated issue.
South Australia will use its share of the $4 million additional funds announced today to contribute to state funding and implement a whole school community approach supported by professional development for teachers. Implemented just a few years ago, these initiatives would have been of great assistance to some of the residents at our house of hope. Its establishment is a tribute to the work of Ann Bressington, a dedicated and tireless advocate for a fresh approach to the challenge of education and treatment for substance abusers. 
This house is named for her daughter, Shay Louise Bressington, who was tragically defeated by heroin but whose spirit lives on in the enthusiasm and courage of the residents who took part in our ceremony last Sunday. Each of our young people at Shay Louise House are on the naltrexone program to assist in their recovery, but they and we know that taking a pill every morning is only one aspect of the life building program that they are engaged in.
Relief and rehabilitation from substance abuse require a multifaceted approach. There is no right or wrong path. It is simply a case of different strokes for different folks. But I must say that the current cost of naltrexone tablets of around $250 a month makes life pretty difficult for many of the young people resident in our house. Rehabilitation centres such Shay Louise House and the variety of policies offered by the federal government's drug strategy recognise that flexibility in treatment against a background of support for the individual and their family offers the best chance of success. As our dedicated counsellor and colleague Peg told the gathering on Sunday, our clients are a little like roses. Eventually, some of them have the most beautiful flowers, despite the thorns we see on their bare branches when they arrive. These young people, like the rose bushes, need a safe, warm and caring environment, the right amount of nurturing and the chance to grow and fully take their place in the wider community. Shay Louise House is the first in a series of rehabilitation centres that we hope to establish around Adelaide to offer hope and healing to some members of our society who need it most.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Shay Louise House</title>,Adjournment,26,1,speech
