"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-08-29,"—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Could the minister explain to the Senate why Australia did not join the UK, the USA, New Zealand, France, Germany and 10 other nations in the multilateral diplomatic protest against the Japanese whaling program, in Tokyo on Monday last week?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Whaling: Japan</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-08-29,"—Madam Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. In light of the minister's response, can the minister confirm that the Prime Minister personally intervened to prevent Australia's participation in the diplomatic protest against Japanese whaling—fearing negative consequences for our trade relations with Japan—in direct contrast with the personal intervention by the UK Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair; the President of the USA, Mr Bill Clinton; and the New Zealand Prime Minister, Ms Helen Clark?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Whaling: Japan</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-29,"—We made our representations against the whaling program separately. Australia is strongly opposed to the Japanese whaling operation, both in the Southern Ocean and in the northern Pacific. As you know, Madam Deputy President, we do not accept the explanation that the whaling is scientific. We believe there are ways in which you can garner all the information for future conservation of the species without resorting to lethal methods. We strongly protested the recent expansion—sadly, it is an expansion—of the Japanese whaling take in the north Pacific this year, which takes new species of whale, including the sperm whale, and increases the numbers taken. It is totally unnecessary, and we would like Japan to cooperate and to desist. We were party to a resolution of the International Whaling Commission seeking that objective of Japan.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Whaling: Japan</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-29,"—I have just stated the position of the Australian government, which is obviously the position of the Prime Minister. The Australian government is opposed to the Japanese whaling take. Anybody who saw the leadership of Australia in the recent International Whaling Commission resolution—and, in particular, our efforts to persuade the international community to support a sanctuary in the South Pacific—would see that without any doubt. The fact that we achieved practically two-thirds of the votes of the International Whaling Commission was a great achievement in itself. I take this opportunity to thank the member states from across the world that supported the proposition that was advanced by Australia in partnership with New Zealand. Australia has a long and proud record, at least in recent years, of fighting the Japanese whaling effort and will continue to fight it.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-08-29,"—In relation to a question put to me by Senator McKiernan, I have obtained further information on the Wesley Institute for Language and Commerce. Reports in the media that students would not receive their funds are incorrect. The Wesley Mission has guaranteed that it will refund all moneys owed to students of the WILC. The funds are protected by the notified trust account established by the Wesley Mission in accordance with legislative provisions. As indicated previously, the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs is working closely with state governments, in particular, the New South Wales government, in relation to this. The department was present at a meeting of these agencies with overseas students on 25 August, which was arranged by the Wesley Mission following the closure of the Wesley Institute for Language and Commerce. The agencies concerned are working together to facilitate the transfer of WILC students to providers offering comparable courses.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-08-29,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in February 2001:
	(a)	alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of the petrol price rise on households and Australia's reliance on fossil fuels and to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of transport including:
	(i)	promoting, expanding and upgrading public transport,
	(ii)	developing alternative fuel options,
	(iii)	restructuring motor vehicle regist-ration charges, and
	(iv)	promoting more fuel efficient and cleaner motor vehicles;
	(b)	the amount of windfall tax revenues over and above that forecast in the 2000-01 Budget that the Commonwealth and the states are likely to receive as a result of the rise in world petrol prices;
	(c)	the extent to which petrol companies will be able to pass on the 1.5 cents a litre savings from tax reform and over what time-frame;
	(d)	whether the subsidy scheme for regional motorists is adequate and is working effectively so that the city/country petrol price differential is not increased, and what alternative strategies can be implemented to reduce the cost of rural and regional transport;
	(e)	whether oil companies and retailers have used the opportunity presented by higher petrol prices to increase their retail and wholesale margins; and
	(f)	the extent to which government purc-hasing policies can encourage the domestic manufacture of fuel efficient, energy efficient and zero-emission pas-senger vehicles.
In recent days much has been made of increased petrol prices and its alleged causes. This has clearly become a political football, and I think many of the core issues at the heart of this debate have been lost. Specifically, I am interested this afternoon in talking briefly about what we as a community, as a government and as citizens in general can do to not be so reliant upon the use of petrol—particularly in cars—what alternatives exist and the opportunities that we as a Senate have to explore those. 
I was reading in recent days an article in Perth's Sunday Times, which was an interesting profile piece looking at three supposedly typical Perth suburban consumers of petrol. I note there was no reference to rural citizens in there, and that is a point I can address later. The article dealt with those people who lived and worked in the city and who were responding to the recent increased prices for petrol. Understandably, there were mixed reactions, but clearly the public sentiment was against increased prices—as you would expect. People do not like paying more for anything, regardless of what it is.
However, in one of these profile pieces, I noted with interest, the newspaper told of one particular citizen from Ballajura—a suburb roughly 10 kilometres from the city centre—who, in response to higher petrol prices, now rides his pushbike to work. I am not suggesting for a moment that this response is available to everyone or is a practical decision for everyone. But what I think it does show is that reliance on fossil fuels and easy access to cars, in particular in cities like Perth, lead to an unquestioned dependency on this form of transport while at the same time reducing the effectiveness of public transport through lower demand or lower usage thereof. It can very much be a catch-22 situation. We find that poor public transport availability and options can lead to car dependency, and that in turn minimises government and consumer responses to public transport infrastructure. In Australia, unlike some but certainly not all other countries, we have developed a culture whereby access to cars and fossil fuels is seen as a right—as something that governments must facilitate. It is very difficult for governments of whatever persuasion to resist or challenge that notion, given the mood of the electorate. But as a nation we really must come to terms with the fact that petrol cannot be seen as an essential commodity like milk and orange juice and yet be cheaper than both. Again, I am not suggesting that the answer to cleaner air, greenhouse gas reduction and vehicle choked cities is simply to make petrol highly priced—far from it. But we really must as a country look seriously at developing stronger public transport options and alternative fuels. I know that my Senate colleague Senator Allison wishes to speak more on that particular point.
As petrol prices begin to affect the hip pockets of Australians, the emotive response that petrol prices must be lowered must be sensibly countered, I think, with a more reasoned response of saying, `Well, let's look at other options to petrol and to cars.' If we are going to have a debate about the cost of fuel in Australia, then it is imperative that we look to the future and that we look to the long term, to the big picture and to the transport sector as a whole rather than simply hold the narrow view of the cost of fuel in isolation. We must look at alternatives to a reliance on imported petroleum, and we must ensure that our transport infrastructure is sufficient to provide for the needs of our people into the new millennium. Governments rather than wringing their hands should be leading by example, particularly by way of what types of vehicles they purchase to run their fleets and the types of fuel they use. As my colleague Senator Allison said earlier today in question time, government fleet purchases last year totalled some 80,000 passenger vehicles or 14.6 per cent of all vehicles purchased. If the government decided to make the switch to LPG, to CNG or to hybrid vehicles such as those made by Toyota and developed by Holden, the refuelling infrastructure would expand to accommodate those vehicles as they filtered down to the second-hand market. We have to look at ways of providing motorists with the cheapest, cleanest, greenest transport options that we can. We must look at ways of reducing our greenhouse emissions and at policies that will help us meet our commitments to reducing the impact of global warming.
Senator Hill has already acknowledged—just last month, in answer to a question from my Democrat colleague Senator Bartlett—that automotive emissions are now amongst the fastest growing of all CO2 emissions in this country. Total road transport emissions increased by 18.2 per cent over the period between 1990 and 1998, a figure that we as a nation must dramatically improve upon. The Australian Democrats are keen to identify ways of improving our record rather than embarking on a one-track witch-hunt into fuel prices. Senator Lees has already made the point that we must make provision for the possibility that the days of relatively cheap fuel are behind us.  
The terms of reference I have prepared with my colleagues will examine not only the taxation component of petrol but also how those taxes can be spent to provide better transport infrastructure that will ultimately benefit all Australians. We must develop alternative fuels. We must ensure that public transport is improved to the point where people can be guaranteed a safe, reliable, practical and clean service. We must look at the possibility of restructuring motor vehicle registration charges. We must look at how the states are spending the GST revenue returned to them, and how public transport can be improved with this extra revenue. We must look at how rail transport, and particularly very fast train technology, can be improved and expanded to take pressure off our airports. We must look at how fuel companies are passing on savings from tax reform and over what time frame, and how effectively subsidy schemes work to reduce rural and regional transport costs. We must look very closely at how Australian technology can be exported to the world, and how we can revitalise our manufacturing sector by building green-friendly cars. It seems rather strange that we can export cars that use a lot of energy, yet we fail to see how much more opportunity there will be in the longer term if we get in on the ground floor of this sunrise industry. We must look at how we as a nation can take higher fuel prices as a challenge and an opportunity to use innovation to bring eco-friendly project cars into production. I would like to think that such innovation—the development of an automotive industry and an alternative fuels industry that can deliver cheaper petrol—is something that can be supported by both government and opposition.
In response to recent concerns over petrol prices, Labor senators have argued for yet another inquiry into petrol pricing and the petroleum industry. To do so would constitute the 49th such inquiry. However, the fact remains that petrol prices have risen by 20c a litre because of higher world oil prices. This has in turn has led to a further 2c a litre rise in GST, and endless inquiries will not change the cause and effect. A far better approach, we believe, is a serious look at public transport alternatives, where that is possible, and a review of alternative fuel options. We have got to start thinking `outside the square'—to use a current business term—and look beyond the short-sightedness of vehicles and fossil fuels. To that end, we propose:
That the following matters be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in February 2001:
	(a)	alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of the petrol price rise on households and Australia's reli-ance on fossil fuels and to achieve a red-uction in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of transport including:
	(i)	promoting, expanding and upgrading public transport,
	(ii)	developing alternative fuel options,
	(iii)	restructuring motor vehicle registra-tion charges, and
	(iv)	promoting more fuel efficient and cleaner motor vehicles;
	(b)	the amount of windfall tax revenues over and above that forecast in the 2000-01 Budget that the Commonwealth and the states are likely to receive as a result of the rise in world petrol prices;
	(c)	the extent to which petrol companies will be able to pass on the 1.5 cents a litre savings from tax reform and over what time-frame;
	(d)	whether the subsidy scheme for regional motorists is adequate and is working effectively so that the city/country petrol price differential is not increased, and what alternative strategies can be implemented to reduce the cost of rural and regional transport; 
	(e)	whether oil companies and retailers have used the opportunity presented by higher petrol prices to increase their retail and wholesale margins; and
	(f)	the extent to which government purc-hasing policies can encourage the domestic manufacture of fuel efficient, energy efficient and zero-emission pas-senger vehicles.
That is the proposal in essence as I have outlined. I believe it is worthy of support. I am very conscious of the fact that we Democrats are so keen to try to shift the debate such as it has been on petrol pricing thus far around to a focus on our reliance on fossil fuels and on the fact that there are alternatives which can be explored and need to be explored and, if we are serious about cleaner cities and a better environment, that must be properly addressed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-08-29,"—Petrol prices in Australia today are too high because OPEC has pushed up the crude oil price. But petrol prices in Australia today are too high because of the way in which this government extracts a usurious tax and in particular because of the way in which the GST applies to petrol prices, and that is the real issue. The way that this Democrats inquiry is heading—the Democrats having colluded with the government just a moment ago to kill off a genuine inquiry moved by the Labor Party—is to cover up the fact that the government is price gouging at the bowser, pushing up prices for Australian motorists. It is to cover up the fact that the Democrats with the government are complicit in this chamber for foisting a GST on Australia, and they do not want the analytical attention of a properly constituted Senate inquiry to reveal that fact to Australians. The Australian Democrats, in their quietly presented, well-modulated tones, try to draw a red herring across the path.
There is simply an honourable disagreement that there ought to be a better way. I do not deny the importance of alternative fuels; I do not deny the importance of energy conservation; but the real issue for Australia, the one that confronts this parliament and this chamber, is the high price of petrol, the anger at the pump—and what is the government going to do about it? To pretend it is about alternative energy or about increasing the cost of automobile registrations is to deny the fundamental point. Labor will not be supporting this inquiry. We will not lend our name to this mischievous behaviour and we will insist that the truth and the facts come out in a properly documented way so that the political debate over who is responsible and where the true costs lie can be properly exposed and so that ordinary Australian motorists can see who is responsible and have laid out for them as an inquiry alternatives to deal with their problem. They want relief and they want action; they do not want talk. They want to know the facts, the alternatives and then what the government is going to do about it.
This is a motion which denies reality. Let me go to a number of fundamental points about where the Democrats claim to have stood. There are five points to be made. Fact one, on 13 August 1998 in his address to the nation, the Prime Minister John Howard said:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
Fact two, the Australian Automobile Association, a reputable independent organisation representing Australian motorists, says that this government will earn $1 billion of extra revenue this financial year as a consequence of the rake-off that they make over oil price increases, and $140 million of that will be a rake-off due to the GST. 
Fact three, petrol prices in metropolitan Australian bowsers are now pushing $1 a litre, and in country Australia, where you fill your tank more often, where you travel longer distances and where you do not have access to public transport, the prices are well in advance of that. In the city of Kalgoorlie in my own state of Western Australia, petrol is $1.11 per litre at the bowser; at Exmouth in my same state it is $1.19; and on the major arterial highway linking Western Australia to the rest of this nation, at an important way stop called Cocklebiddy, it is $1.33.4 per litre. It is no wonder the tourist organisations in that region are saying, `Retired Australians who cart their caravan around this nation as their superannuation aren't coming. They can't afford the petrol prices.' The damage is more pervasive to rural communities than ever before.  
Fact four, 3c per litre of those price increases that we have endured in this nation since July are due to the GST alone. Who is complicit? The two parties that a few minutes ago in this chamber knocked off the Labor Party's real inquiry: the government and the Democrats. And fact five, yesterday Meg Lees, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, said in a press release, `We are addressing the future. We are not talking about the past.' Never mind the crime that has been perpetrated on Australian motorists, never mind bringing to account the Prime Minister, who said before the election, `The GST will not increase the price of petrol.' Since when have the Democrats renounced their intention to keep the bastards honest? Why are they not doing that now, or have they become the bastards themselves and they need this chamber to keep them honest? 
There are a number of points that I need to make as to why we oppose this motion. Firstly, what about truth in politics? The Prime Minister made his commitment, he was backed by the Treasurer on 7 September and he was backed by the Liberal Party campaign headquarters on 6 September—all of whom said the GST will not increase prices. What about a bit of truth? We need a dinky-di inquiry that will get at the facts, not some inquiry that will go on a frolic about alternative fuels and look at relief that might occur some time next century or at a much higher cost to Australian motorists. Australians want redress now, not at some future time.
This inquiry that is being proposed by the Democrats will do nothing about the windfall gain to government revenue that I referred to earlier. Lachlan McIntosh, of the Australian Automobile Association, puts that gain at $1 billion. The NFF in a press release today put it at $400 million. The RAC in my home state of Western Australia put it at $660 million. What are the facts? How much rake-off is this government earning as a consequence of the higher prices? The inquiry that is being proposed by the Democrats will not answer that question. What about the widening gap between city and country prices? As I have said, at metropolitan bowsers petrol is $1 a litre; in the bush, it is anything up to $1.33, and last night on the ABC, in some parts of Western Australia, it was reported to be $1.68 a litre.
—What!
—It was reported on the ABC last night, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Ian Campbell, was present and did not argue the case. The prices between country and metropolitan Australia are widening because of the formula the government has used here, and they are set to widen even further. As I said, country motorists fill their tanks more often. They travel further. They do not have the alternative of public transport. They certainly do not have the easy alternative of alternative fuels. And they get hit hardest, yet the gap is widening. What about all of those promises to regional Australia from this government? What about a tax on a tax? Where is the principle here? The main components of the cost of petrol at the bowser are the cost of buying the crude, refining it and shipping it to the bowser, the cost of the excise applied by the government—which is a tax on petrol—and then the cost of another tax on that total, which is the GST, a tax on a tax. One of the fundamental principles of taxation law is to avoid governments taxing taxes in order to extract a higher gain. Why aren't the Australian Democrats concerned about that principle? Why don't they want to inquire into its effects here? Is it because they are complicit, that they voted for a tax on a tax?
What about the half million dollars of Australian taxpayers' money that the government paid to reduce petrol prices in the bush? There is now a substantial allegation that it has been pocketed by the oil companies and has not gone to help consumers at all. What about that? It has been investigated by the ACCC, but should not this parliament that approves of the outlays by the government at budget time have some look at this as well? We are responsible for voting for budget bills. Should we not examine whether this $500,000 of taxpayers' money has simply been soaked up by the oil companies?  
What about the central question here? How much is the true windfall? As I have said, it is $1 billion according to the Automobile Association, $400 million according to the NFF and $660 million according to the RAC. But why can't we call the government to an inquiry and get them to open their books and show us the facts so we can see what the windfall is? That is the investigative role of Senate committees. Why do the Democrats prevent us from doing that? Why does this motion for an inquiry into alternative fuels obscure our ability to get at that detail? That is a question for the Democrats that Australians want to know the answer to and, if they will not give it, if they obstruct it and if they want to have a cover-up with the government, they will eventually pay the political price.
What about the lie that the government tax is necessary to cover indexed pension payments, when of course pensions as outlays are indexed and the revenue on petrol is also indexed? That is the lie that has been put into public debate and that is the justification, but no-one says—and certainly no-one from the government says—that the index on the GST is being moved upwards by the OPEC oil sheiks whereas the index on pensions is being moved upwards by the inflation rate and the rate of growth in petrol prices has been 30 per cent in the last couple of months whereas the rate of inflation in this country is around three per cent. No-one explains that. An inquiry is necessary to get to the bottom of who is telling the truth there. Certainly Mr Howard is not, and his explanation to the House of Representatives that you need to index petrol prices in order to pay pensions is a fraudulent misrepresentation of the economic truth of this matter, and any economist will say so. Why don't we have an inquiry to look at that?
Why don't we have an inquiry to look at the options? I have said Australian motorists are hurting because of the higher petrol prices, and the government says, `Bad luck. There's nothing we'll do about it.' This is a chamber of a federal parliament with national responsibilities, and we are elected here to have other ideas from the government. Why don't we look at it? Why don't we examine the options? Why are the Democrats voting with the government to prevent the Labor Party from having an independent, dinky-di, fair dinkum look at who is telling the truth here and what the options are for relief by a committee drawn from this chamber which would have the Democrats on it, the government on it and us on it? The anger out there in ordinary Australia is an anger because they are unnecessarily paying higher prices. They are not convinced by the argument that the government does not intend to do anything about it, but they do want to hear from their parliamentary representatives about what the alternatives are. An inquiry can properly produce carefully considered options for government action and recommend them.
Why are the Democrats preventing us from doing that? We know why the government are—because they just line up behind their leader, although in their own caucus room backbenchers are speaking out and objecting to what the Prime Minister is saying, and they are demanding all sorts of changes. Does the government not want an inquiry because government backbenchers who are speaking out might find a forum where their voices might be heard? Here is a fundamental question of Australian democracy. There is no doubt people want something done and there is no doubt the government and the Democrats are now obstructing a logical and reasonable course of action for the alternatives to be carefully presented to the Australian community.
This is a sloppy motion. This is a desperate motion to change the issue and get away from the real issues. This motion is beside the point. It is a cover-up in order to avoid the issues. Our objection to it is: let us do what Australians want and have a proper inquiry. This motion is extremely odd when taking into account what Senator Lees said and what the Prime Minister said to her at the time both the government and the Australian Democrats agreed that Australians would have to suffer under a GST. Back then, you will remember the press conferences, the Prime Minister and Meg Lees in bed together, waving around this package of so-called changes that are `good for you'. What were those changes? The Prime Minister, in his letter of 28 May 1999 to Senator Meg Lees, said that there would be measures in that package on greenhouse gas abatement programs and on greenhouse of national environmental significance. He also said that there would be incentives to switch to lower sulfur diesels and that there would be a program to bring forward the introduction of new petrol vehicle and fuel standards. He said that there would be a program to maintain the current price relativities between diesel, CNG and other alternative transport fuels and that clean fuel credits would be given. He said that there would be a subsidy program for conversion for CNG vehicles, LPG vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, et cetera. He said that there would be 100 per cent excise credit for rail transport and oil cycling infrastructure. They are all things that we thought had some purpose. We did not want a GST, but at least those things had some purpose. 
If you look at the terms of reference of the inquiry that the Democrats have put in this chamber, you will see that they want to inquire into exactly those things. It raises the question: did they get the deal they thought they got? Are they now the disgruntled suitors who have been left at the church unable to get the package up, and do they want an inquiry to get their deal back again? Is this what this is about? You had one bite of the cherry back in May last year when you foisted a GST on us. Now you want to avoid a proper inquiry into petrol prices in order to inquire into the issues you tried to get John Howard to agree to but he sold you out back then. That is not the purpose of this debate. Petrol prices are too high, the government is making a significant rake-off, and there is one central, simple question: what is the government going to do about it? For us in this chamber facing our parliamentary responsibilities, what can we do to give voice to the public opposition to petrol price increases and ensure that the government hands back some of this windfall gain to Australian motorists?
Last night I had the chance to participate in a state-wide current affairs program on the ABC in Western Australia. Let me run through, lest this chamber is in any doubt, what the anger is like out there in the Australian community. From the farmers organisation in Western Australia, Collin Nicholls said, `Farmers are facing a 40 per cent increase in their budget and, because their markets are determined by world commodity prices, they can't pass it on.' The farmers are angry. The WA Transport Association said, `Petrol prices reflect in every good or commodity we buy that is on the supermarket shelf. Not only are high prices hurting our members, but they are hurting Australian consumers as well.' The Transport Workers Union said, `Our members, who are owner/drivers, are going out of business but can't sell their rigs because petrol prices are too high but the contract prices have not risen to offset them.' The Premier of Western Australia said in this hook-up that he wants the federal government to freeze the excise.
The RAC in Western Australia said, `The real cost of the government's rake-off is $660 million.' The ACCI said, `There is a need for an inquiry to look at options on road funding.' The independent fuel outlet said that they were not making a profit. Shell Oil said that it was not. But Larry Graham, the Independent member for the Pilbara, pointed out that Shell had boasted a 14 per cent increase in earnings internationally and 150 per cent increase in total profits. The Motor Traders Association of Western Australia is holding a public rally to protest. And what does this chamber do? Let's look at alternative fuels. Let's not answer any of that white-hot anger in the electorate. It is about time that we got real in here. We are answerable to the people of Australia. They are angry. They want something done. It is our obligation to have a proper inquiry, not an ersatz, flimsy, failed cover-up like this will be, in which the government, as one of the conspiring parties in the GST, and the Democrats, as the other conspiring party in the GST, use their numbers in this chamber to block proper debate, proper accountability, proper examination and the proper formation of resolutions to the problem.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-08-29,"—We have just been treated to what can only be described as a Senator Peter Cook rant for 20 minutes. Listeners to this broadcast would have been interested to tune in and wonder what the Labor Party were going to do about the high level of oil prices which we all deplore. 
—You just voted down our proposal. 
—Senator Cook, again you have worked yourself up into a lather. At the end of the day, you have to come out with some policies. You have to say what you are going to do. Senator Peter Cook has drawn attention to the high level of oil prices which we all know about, which we all deplore and which affects all countries, including Australia. I think we are all concerned about the impact of those high oil prices. What was Senator Cook's solution to them in his remarks? Senator Cook complained about the GST. The Labor Party now supports the GST. The GST now forms part of the Labor Party's policy.
—No, it does not.
—Yes, it does. I will mention the R word, seeing that I am being provoked. You did say that there would be a roll-back. What sort of roll-back, Senator Cook? Let us say that you had a 50 per cent roll-back, at a minimum. At a minimum, the Labor Party have a GST plus a 50 per cent roll-back. What would that cost revenue? That would cost revenue $12 billion. The fact of the matter is the Labor Party have stopped speaking the R word because they know that every time they speak it their vote goes further down. My first point is this: we are all concerned about the high level of oil prices. We recognise that the high level is a result of trends on world markets. This government have made their views known in the appropriate fora about our concern and about the adverse impact these prices can have. The Labor Party's solution is to blame taxes. The Labor Party solution claims that in fact the current level of oil prices is due to taxation.
—It is in part.
—Let us take the interjection from Senator Mackay—in part. If that is the case—and I do not accept that—what is the Labor Party's solution? Is the Labor Party's solution to cut the level of taxes on fuel? Senator Mackay is going to speak, and I suggest that we all listen very carefully to see whether Senator Mackay can outline which taxes she proposes to cut. Senator Cook has complained about the GST, but the GST is Senator Cook's party policy.
—No, it is not. Tell the truth.
—Senator, all I am saying is, if you feel there is an effect which you do not like, what is your policy on it? Is this part of the roll-back? The Labor Party's policy is to have a GST and a roll-back. Senator Cook, you have been complaining in your remarks about the goods and services tax. We are going to listen to Senator Mackay, and the question is whether she takes up your complaint and whether this is a part of the Labor Party roll-back. It is a fair question. The Labor Party has complained about the level of fuel excise. So the question is: is the Labor Party going to cut the level of fuel excise? It is a fair question because you have got yourself into the same mix-up that you got yourself into during the GST debate. Remember you were so opposed to the GST and you fought it tooth and nail for 1½ years, but come 1 July the GST is a part of your policy. As the Treasurer has so often said, `The Labor Party says the GST is so bad but it proposes to keep it.' What happened at the polls? All of this effort to leverage the polls collapsed. You were revealed as being a total fraud. The Labor Party was revealed as being totally fraudulent. The public asked, `How can the Labor Party be opposing the GST when at the same time it is a part of its policy?'
It is an astonishing thing that we are seeing the same fraud in relation to petrol prices. The Labor Party—again for cheap political motives—are pretending to the public that the high level of prices is due to various taxes. We do not accept that. But if that is the Labor Party position, surely one would expect the Labor Party to have a position on the application of the GST on fuel. Surely the Labor Party would have a position on the excise levels on fuel. Surely the Labor Party would have a position on the indexation of excise. It is not unreasonable to say that. Let me make a prediction: Senator Mackay will stand up and pretend the solution to all of this is yet another review. We have had 40 reviews. 
—So what? None of them have worked.
—I know it is embarrassing for you because the public are perceiving again the total fraudulent approach of the Labor Party. If the Labor Party is trying to blame the government for high prices because of various taxes, what is the Labor Party's position on the excise tax, on the indexation of excise and on the GST? The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party does not have a position on any of those things. What is the Labor Party's position in relation to fuel prices? To have a review. It will hide behind a review because of its total lack of policy, as we have seen in so many areas.
Senator Cook, I think the public will treat you ultimately in relation to this issue with the same contempt that they treated you in relation to the GST debate. I think the public will ask, `What is the Labor Party on about? Why is it impossible for the Labor Party to reach a sensible policy on any issue? The Labor Party's claim that the high price of oil is the government's fault is totally false. What is the Labor Party going to do about it?' The Labor Party wants a 41st review. It is a pathetic position from a pathetic party. The government will not have a bar of it. What did the Labor Party do when it was in office in relation to fuel? Let us just get a few facts on the table. Under the Labor Party, the excise rate rose from 6c per litre to 34c per litre. That was Labor Party policy while it was in office—to raise excise. I make the point: the excise rate rose from 6c per litre to over 34c per litre.
—The barrel price is $15, not $30.
—Senator Cook, you do not even understand what you are yelling out about. You raised the excise from 6c per litre to 34c per litre, and you are not proposing to change the excise rate at all. If I am wrong, Senator Mackay will be speaking after me and she can correct this.
—You are wrong.
—Fascinating! If Senator Mackay says that the Labor Party proposes to change the excise rate on fuel, that will be of considerable public interest, Senator. It will cost a few dollars—let me make that point—but it will be of great interest. When Labor were in office, not only did they raise the excise on fuel very substantially—almost sixfold—but they also brought in indexation of excise in 1983. That was Labor Party policy. That was the Labor Party policy when the inflation rate was rising in the order of over five per cent per year during the Labor term in office—far more than the current rate—
—But that was your policy, Senator. I point out that the Labor party did have policies on fuel. Those policies were to raise taxes on fuel and excises. That is exactly what they did. That was the Labor Party position. So the Senate naturally treated the Labor Party proposal with contempt. The Labor Party should come out and say what their policy is on fuel—and not a review! How long have you been in opposition? Can you have a major policy on some issue of public importance? Is it possible for that party over there—that discredited party, whose front benches are laden down with former Keating ministers—to reach a policy position in any particular area?
—You have raised the issue constantly in question time about the price of fuel. Surely the Labor Party can have a position—and not just yet another review. Let me make it clear: the government is very concerned about the level of petrol prices, and the GST is not the reason for the high level of petrol prices. In fact, the excise was reduced by 6.7c a litre. I think that is the first time the excise on fuel has ever been reduced; and it came down under this government. The petroleum refining industries expected to achieve savings of some 1.5c per litre. The GST has not contributed to the rise. In fact, the rise in fuel prices has come about because of the rise in oil prices on world markets. The cost of a barrel of oil—let me make this clear—has risen from some $A17 a barrel in January 1999 to around $A55 a barrel in late August this year. So there has been a very substantial rise on international markets in the price of petrol. 
Let me say that we are concerned, as I think all Australians are, at the high prices of fuel. But let me also point out that, under the former government—Senator Mackay, you may not know this—the real price of petrol in current dollars rose to over 100c per litre in Sydney in 1985. This has happened before.
—What are you going to do about it? Nothing.
—First of all, you analyse what the real cause is; and the real cause is the rise in fuel prices on world markets. The government, along with other countries is making its views known to OPEC on the—
—The higher the cost, the bigger the tax.
—Can I make the point that what we are doing is making our views known, along with other countries, in the international fora that can have some impact. What is the Labor Party going to do about it? Senator Mackay, we will wait breathlessly for your speech, to see what in fact you propose to do. Your thesis is that this is due to taxes. You are wrong, but that is your thesis. 
—In part.
—Well, let's say `in part due to taxes': this is your thesis. So what are you doing in relation to taxes? You are doing nothing in relation to taxes. This is the humbug of the Labor Party. It is another totally fraudulent position. The first fraud that the Labor Party inflicted on the Australian public is that it was opposed to the GST—but it now forms part of its policy. The next fraud the Labor Party is on about is that somehow the high prices of fuel are due to taxes. So what is the Labor Party going to do about it? It is not going to change anything. It is a total humbug, a total fraud.
—You defeated our motion. Wake up!
—No, sorry; you are going to do one thing about it. You are going to have another review. The first 40 reviews apparently did not solve the Senator Cook problem, so we are going to have yet another review, and that is no excuse. For a change, why doesn't the Labor Party attempt to develop a policy on an issue of public importance?
—You couldn't care less!
—`They could not care less,' says Senator Mackay.
—You couldn't care less about regional Australia!
—Well, I think the public would be very interested to know, Senator Mackay, that you could not care less. But we do care, Senator Mackay. What governments do is tackle the real issues and the real causes and do not attempt to grandstand like the Labor Party has attempted to grandstand today. But again, we will listen to Senator Mackay. Okay; Senator Mackay says that the high price of petrol is `in part'—as she says now; the Labor Party's position has changed a little bit from Senator Cook—
—No, it hasn't! It has been exactly the same.
—We have always said that.
—Well, if it is `in part due to taxes', what is the Labor Party position on those taxes?
—We oppose the GST—remember?
—Hold on! This is part of the roll-back. The question is: what is the Labor Party position on those taxes? Let me make a prediction to this chamber. Senator Mackay will not make one comment on that. There will be no comment on the roll-back of the GST on fuel. There will be no comment about cutting the excise on fuel. There will be no comment on the indexation of excise on fuel. There will be no comment on any of those three areas, Senator Mackay. There will be not one comment, and the public will be entitled to think that the Labor Party is a total humbug on this issue, a total fraud—which you were in relation to the GST and which you are now on petrol prices. 
As my remarks in this debate are now coming to an end, let me say that we will not be supporting the motion proposed by the Democrats. We feel that we agree with the first position of Senator Meg Lees in relation to an inquiry, and I have made my views known. Let me conclude my remarks by just reading a comment that was made by the Prime Minister in the other place yesterday. It is worth repeating in this chamber. These are the Prime Minister's comments:
I say very plainly to the Australian people that I do not like higher fuel prices and that I understand how sensitive the Australian people are to them. But these higher prices have been due overwhelmingly to world factors. Can I say to those who sit opposite, and to people anywhere else in the Australian community who are calling for a discretionary reduction in excise, that they are really saying that either you run down the surplus and thereby put upward pressure on interest rates or you cut payments for schools, for roads, for health and for all the other vital things that the government provides. The government will not be responding to those irresponsible calls. They are not based on fact. They seek, rather, to exploit understandable public concern about the price of petrol. 
The Prime Minister concluded his remarks thus:
I say again to the Australian public that I share its concern, but the culprits lie amongst the oil producing countries of the world; they do not lie on the front bench of the government.
The government is, as always, taking a very responsible approach to this important public issue. I suspect that when we listen to the views of Senator Mackay on behalf of the Labor Party we will find them as vacuous as the Labor Party can be on so many other issues of public importance. In the end—let me make a prediction—Senator Mackay will say nothing about cutting GST, nothing about cutting excise, nothing about dealing with what she sees as the indexation issues. What Senator Mackay will be saying is `Gosh! What we need is the 41st review on petrol!'",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-08-29,"—What we heard from the ALP was, indeed, a diatribe. Senator Cook excelled himself. It is not often that I agree with Senator Kemp, but I do in this case: we have heard a load of humbug. In fact, Senator Kemp, I need to correct you: it would be the 49th inquiry into fuel prices per se. The ALP say they want a properly constituted Senate inquiry. Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you and to the ALP: Senator Cook has obviously not read the terms of reference. Of course this is a properly constituted Senate inquiry. The fact that it goes to more than the question of `How can we bash up the government and the Democrats over the GST?' obviously does not suit the ALP. They want an inquiry where they can run around the country, speaking the same message over and over again: this is terrible, and it is all to do with the GST—and we know that that is not the case. In fact, it is quite a nonsense.
I was absolutely amazed and floored to hear Senator Cook say, `We don't want all this extraneous material from the Democrats in the terms of reference—this business of alternative fuels.' He actually said that Australians do not want to wait for the next century, another century, for alternative fuels. I think that indicates where the ALP are coming from. This is where their real credentials are on the environment. This is how much they care for greenhouse gas emissions. This is how much they care for pollution. This is how much they really care about the cost and fuel efficiency of the vehicles we run in this country.
I would remind the ALP that they left office with emission standards in this country five years behind those of other industrialised countries around the world. If we are going to start talking about the tax arrangements and the great benefits that the Democrats have managed to achieve through that tax package, then I will remind the ALP about the mess they left behind and the sort of pollution we suffer as a result of allowing our fleet to become very old, polluting, dirty and disgraceful.
Senator Kemp says, `We want to look at what has happened to the cash and whether the petrol companies have, in fact, pocketed that money.' Let me just carefully read through the term of reference which would allow us to examine that. It is reference (c)—and it is a pity that Senator Cook is not here as he could be listening to this. Reference (c) states: 
... the extent to which petrol companies will be able to pass on the 1.5c a litre savings from tax reform and over what time frame ...
Senator Cook says that what he wants is to look at the options for relief. Let me go to the very first term of reference, reference (a), which states:
... alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of petrol price rise on households.
It is plain enough to me that this allows us to look at options. That is what Senator Kemp says he is interested in: looking at options for relief. He wants a dinky-di inquiry. That seems to be pretty dinky-di to me. It is going to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry. That committee is not dominated by the government. The problem is that the ALP do not chair that committee, it is chaired by the Democrats—and that is obviously a major problem for the ALP. So we cannot have a dinky-di inquiry obviously if it is not under the control of the ALP.
Let us look at something else that Senator Kemp said we desperately need to inquire into: the windfall. The terms of reference again deal with this question of the windfall, and I will read them out. Term of reference (b) states:
... the amount of windfall tax revenues over and above that forecast in the 2000-2001 budget that the Commonwealth and states are likely to receive as a result of the rise in world petrol prices.
What more could you be wanting? The word `windfall' is there; it is actually in the terms of reference already. Senator Cook would have us believe that this is some nonsensical inquiry that is being put up by the Democrats that does not address the issues that people are interested in. He passes it off as some silly notion—`The Democrats are again getting carried away with alternative fuels; we all know that's airy fairy stuff.' Certainly the ALP's record, in this place at least, has shown that they are not much interested in that whole question.
There are some other important parts of this inquiry that I will spell out again because, obviously, Senator Cook did not read this effectively. Term of reference (d) states:
... whether the subsidy scheme for regional motorists is adequate and working effectively ...
so that the city-country petrol price differential is not increased. And:
... what alternative strategies can be implemented to reduce the cost of rural and regional transport.
Term of reference (e) is whether:
... oil companies and retailers have used the opportunity presented by higher petrol prices to increase their retail and wholesale margins.
So these terms of reference go to the core of the problem. But, instead of that, the ALP just wants an opportunity to bash the GST in the normal fashion.
I really want to talk in this debate today about the opportunities for us to look at alternative fuels, because the Democrats happen to think that that is important and that it is the way forward. As I said earlier in taking note of an answer and as I said in my question today to Senator Ellison, there are enormous opportunities for us to cut the fuel consumption of individual vehicles by 50 per cent. The average motorist spends $2,500 or thereabouts a year on petrol for their vehicle. The opportunities just to shift to LPG using the Ford Falcon dedicated LPG vehicle are 50 per cent. Over the last few weeks, we have been talking about minor increases. Of course, it means a lot of money to those people who travel long distances, but let us get real about this. The real opportunities are for us to reduce those imposts and reduce the cost to motorists by 50 per cent. What we need to examine in this place is what sort of leadership governments can show in order to deliver on those cost reductions.
Let us look at something we can actually have some control over. We do not have control over the OPEC nations. We cannot determine what the cost of a barrel of oil will be when it comes into this country. These are not measures which we can do a great deal about. Certainly reducing the one point whatever it is cents per litre that might be attributable to the GST in petrol is not going to make much difference to the hip pockets of ordinary Australians. But if you take $2,500 and reduce that by half then we are talking big money. 
It is not just LPG that offers those advantages. CNG is a very important fuel, and it is important because it is not tied to petroleum prices. It is important because it is an indigenous fuel. It comes out of the ground in Australia. It is pumped around our country. It can be tapped for transport purposes. All we need is the infrastructure to put it in place. We need the refuelling depots. We need to make sure of that before we ask Australians to commit to switching over to this new fuel, which is cost effective and extremely good for reducing emissions, both pollution and greenhouse gases. It would be extremely good if we turned our minds in this country to how we can encourage those fuels.
—Why didn't you get the government to agree to this in the negotiations?
—Senator Conroy interrupts, as he usually does, and points out that there were opportunities during the tax debate, and the Democrats indeed took those opportunities. We will have buses and trucks converted to compressed natural gas. In fact, there is $75 million for that measure alone. But more needs to be done.
—Why didn't you get a better deal?
—It would have been very good, Senator Conroy, to have achieved everything, but we are now asking you, the ALP, to help us to achieve what needs to be done at this point. But you are not interested. For you, this is of no concern. You just want business as usual. Senator Cook says, `In the next century we will think about alternative fuels.' You say, `There's no need for us to bother with that now. Let's just take the populist line. Let's just tap into people's concerns about increased fuel prices, not worry about the future and not worry for the next century about the fact that we have alternative fuels in this country that we could tap into tomorrow.' It needs leadership; it needs government action. Let us look at how we can do that with this inquiry. But, no, the ALP is not interested.
Let us have a look at some of the recent statements put out by CSIRO. This is topical today—we had a rally outside today by the very good scientists from CSIRO. Let me just mention a couple of things that were said in a recent press release. It stated:
Australia may need to cut greenhouse emissions by 50 to 85 per cent of today's level, to meet its long-term obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, two senior CSIRO scientists said today.
That is certainly consistent with the messages that have been coming to the global warming inquiry: that the Kyoto protocol is only the very first step and that we have to take drastic and serious measures. That means not continuing business as usual for the next century. The CSIRO suggest a couple of strategies. They suggest four altogether that would work to help us curb our greenhouse emissions. The first is:
... to obtain more energy from less fuel across the whole fossil fuel energy cycle, from production through to power generation
The third is:
... to gradually switch to low-carbon or carbon-free sources of energy, like hydrogen and renewables
That is what we need to examine. In the transport sector, which uses so much of our energy in this country and is such a big contributor to greenhouse, how can we look at alternative fuels which will assist us to do that and reduce the cost?
—Why didn't you get the government to set up an inquiry when you could?
—You might learn something, Senator Conroy, if you listen. The Australian Greenhouse Office says:
The Australian transport sector accounts for 72 million tonnes of Australia's total net greenhouse gas emissions, representing just over 17 per cent of Australia's total emissions. About 87 per cent of these emissions come from road transport, including cars, trucks and buses. 
Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector are also the fastest growing emissions of any sector, rising by 18 per cent from 1990 to 1997. The Bureau of Transport Economics projects that, without reduction measures, emissions from the transport sector will rise by 38 per cent between 1990 and 2010. 
That is what we want to see dealt with. The Democrats are interested in solving the problem of greenhouse gas emissions in this country. We can do this by changing to alternative fuels and by weaning ourselves off the total dependence that we have on fossil fuels. Remember—and Senator Cook should note this—they are not going to last for another 100 years. We are running out of oil reserves in this world, and Australia just cannot keep consuming petrol, diesel and petroleum products at the same level that we currently are. It is absolutely critical that we start looking at alternative ways forward.
It is disappointing that the government has chosen not to support our terms of reference. I would have thought the government would be well informed by the sort of inquiry this might turn up. The ALP does not want any sort of inquiry at all—unless it can simply attack the GST; that is all it is interested in. There are fantastic opportunities for us to achieve great savings, both in greenhouse emissions and in cost. I will mention a couple of hybrid petrol and electric engines which are currently either in production or available elsewhere. We can look to the United States now, we can look to Europe and we can look to various parts of the world that have governments that are prepared to put in place regulatory arrangements which encourage the use of those vehicles.
The Honda Insight has an ultralight one-litre lean burn VTEC engine that works in tandem with a brushless DC electric motor. It achieved world low consumption figures of 3.85 litres per 100 kilometres and a highway rating of 3.36 litres per 100 kilometres. It conserves fuel with an automatic idle stop system. It has a highly rigid and ultrasafe body that is around 40 per cent lighter than an equivalent steel body. Is it available in Australia? No. Will it be available in Australia? Probably not. It is available in the US, it is available in Europe and it is available in Japan. No doubt it could be imported into Australia, but it would cost a great deal of money to do so. Ford's Think City was on display here at the Melbourne International Motor Show. It is a zero emission two-seater powered by a liquid cooled three-phase alternating current induction motor. It accelerates from zero to 50 kilometres per hour in seven seconds, and it has a top speed of 90 kilometres per hour. It plugs directly into any standard 220-volt 16-amp or 10-amp outlet for recharging. That will be available in the US in the next two years, but there are no plans to have it available in Australia.
The Toyota Prius is another hybrid vehicle. It uses half the petrol and emits only half the carbon dioxide on a typical city drive cycle. It is powered by an electric motor, power for which is supplied by a 288-volt battery pack and a fuel efficient twin cam multivalve petrol motor. It has a Corolla sized exterior dimension and a 1992 Camry sized interior. Toyota—and I congratulate them on doing this—have brought seven production models of the Prius to Australia for evaluation. I have driven in one. It is a very quiet vehicle and a very pleasant vehicle to travel in. But there are no plans to go into production in Australia. Again, we have to ask ourselves why. What is it in this country that has not been able to encourage any of our car manufacturers, apart from Ford with LPG, to get these vehicles into production, on the road and available to motorists in this country so that we can save on fuel costs, so that we do not need to worry about OPEC and so that we do not need to be concerned so much about greenhouse emissions and pollution?
I have just mentioned a few of the many innovations available to reduce fuel costs, to reduce emissions and to reduce greenhouse gases in this country. We need to look at why Australia has not been able to get these vehicles onto our roads, why we in Australia still have very large cars and why other countries—like Japan—have chosen to impose variable registrations, for instance, to encourage people to update their vehicles so that they run cleaner and more fuel efficient cars on the road. The UK has recently announced a grant scheme of £1,000 for people who purchase electric vehicles. There are schemes of this sort all around the world in places where we really do care about the burning of fossil fuels, places where the reality of energy security and the reality of air pollution are real. Australia can learn much from the examples of those overseas countries. This inquiry would have been a good opportunity to look to the future in this country instead of to the past, to look beyond the last few months and what has been agreed in tax arrangements and to go into the next century that Senator Cook talks about—not with one's head in the sand, not imagining that we can go on doing the same thing, but looking at a real future for transport in this country that is much more cost effective than the ALP has been able to deliver to us so far. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-08-29,"—I was interested in Senator Allison's contribution in relation to allegations that the Labor Party are running a populist line. I think that is true. If you go to regional Australia to talk about this issue and to see what is happening in regional Australia, there is major concern among the populace. There is major concern among the people who are being, and who will be, impacted by petrol prices. Isn't it peculiar that these Democrat terms of reference arose only very recently? After the Labor Party had mooted an inquiry for some time, all of a sudden the Democrats came up with this. The Democrats are entitled to accuse us of being cynical, but at least our suggestion of an inquiry was out there for a considerable time.
I also note with some interest that the person who would be chairing this inquiry if the government were prepared to support it, Senator Woodley, is not here. Senator Woodley knows, probably more than anybody in the Democrats, the difficulties faced in his home state of Queensland and in regional Australia. I would obviously be interested to hear his views, but not everybody can speak. But one thing I have always respected about the Democrats—and I mean this most sincerely—is their absolute, unwavering commitment to accountability and transparency. Even when it has been extremely uncomfortable for the Labor Party, the Democrats have been supportive of that. Even when it has been to our detriment and we have not wanted it, the Democrats have insisted on accountability and transparency. I congratulate people like Senator Murray for his work on commercial-in-confidence. But the problem is that, when you are actually part of the decision, you have got to be held accountable for that decision. This is the difficulty, and this is why the Democrats are not prepared to support this.
We had an unbelievably undignified and ungracious response from Senator Kemp, who clearly had not done any preparation at all on this absolutely critical issue. If I were a person out in country Australia listening to that contribution, I would just be astounded at the lack of compassion that he showed to people in regional Australia who are genuinely suffering. This is not a game; this is serious. If you go out to regional Australia—and a lot of us do—and talk to people about how they are currently suffering in relation to petrol, if you look at the conditions that people are living under and the way the GST has impacted on regional Australians, and if you go to my home state and Senator Brown's home state of Tasmania and have a look at what is a regional microcosm of how the GST has impacted, it is extremely illuminating. 
I noted, with some interest, that Mr Peter Costello—it was in the newspaper clips recently—has spent the grand total of 10 days in regional Australia from 1996 to the end of 1999. I wonder why that would be? I wonder why Peter Costello would not want to go to regional Australia? I can tell you; I am out there all the time. If I were Peter Costello, I would not want to go either because he would not get out of there alive, given the initiatives this government has taken in relation to regional Australia. There are people in this chamber who know it, and there are people on the back bench of this government who know it. You know it—why aren't you doing something about it? This government is in office, so you have got the capacity to actually do something. The GST is this government's tax; it is not the Labor Party's tax. You are sitting around complicit, blaming the oil sheikhs, as Senator Cook said, and doing absolutely nothing. I think it is a total disgrace. As somebody who actually lives in regional Australia, I think it is outrageous that Senator Kemp gave it that sort of perfunctory treatment and clearly put no preparation whatsoever into his speech. 
Senator Cook moved a motion which would have allowed us to explore all these options, the alternatives that Senator Kemp talked about in what I thought was his fairly tawdry response. Senator Greig has yet to have this delightful experience—she says with heavy sarcasm—but the Democrats should try to come to the regional services estimates and try and get some answers and some genuine transparency from the government about what is going on in regional Australia. Try and get some answers out of the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Ian Macdonald, about what is happening in regional Australia. You will get none. They are not doing anything. That is the point. The government are doing absolutely nothing. 
Senator Woodley knows this because he sat there and listened to the absolute obfuscation from this minister for hours and hours as he simply stonewalled the questions. The Labor Party does not care too much about Senator Macdonald stonewalling questions, but I think, as a government minister, he should have a bit of a go at defending his own government in regional Australia. We asked a number of times whether there had been any impact—or would be, prospectively, any study of the impact—on regional Australia from the GST. Not only has there not been a study; there was never planned to be one and nor will there be one. I find it extraordinary that, when you have a tax that is clearly going to impact on one section of the community disproportionately, the government are not even prepared to have a look at it prior to its implementation. I find that unbelievable. We asked about the implications of the national competition policy—nothing. We asked about the implications of various budget cuts—nothing. They denied they even existed. It is just a joke, it really is. One thing people in regional Australia are not is stupid. They are not stupid, and they are not going to buy this.
The bottom line is this: regional Australians pay a lot more for everything. They pay a lot more for clothes, they pay a lot more for transport, they pay a lot more for food, they pay a lot more for health and education services—such as they are these days, courtesy of this government—and now they pay a lot more for petrol. The Labor Party are not asserting that the GST is the reason for the massive increase in petrol prices. We are asserting that the GST is in part a contributor to it. That is what we are saying the government should look at. We want to look at the commitment John Howard gave that prices would be substantially lower, and we want to have a look at some remedial strategies. We cannot do that now. Way back in the dim, dark days when John Howard actually made it out to regional Australia, with his hat on, he made a statement which has become famous as the Nyngan declaration. He said that every time there was a cut in regional Australia a red light would be flashing. The red light has basically been on high beam, especially in relation to this one, because people in regional Australia are paying more.
Let us look at some genuine empirical examples of what is happening in relation to petrol in regional Australia—in places I have recently been to—comparing pre-GST prices with the amount of increase contributed by the GST. Many of these regional cities are also areas of high unemployment, in fact, some of the areas of highest unemployment in Australia—cities like Bundaberg, for example, where I was last week. In the March quarter small area labour market figures, unemployment in Bundaberg was 14.4 per cent—so much for the growth economy in Bundaberg. Petrol prices in Bundaberg pre GST were 81.5c a litre and have now risen to 89.9c a litre. The GST component of that by our calculations is 2.14c. So in a place with one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia petrol prices are increasing exponentially, and the GST is a contributor to that. It is not the only place. Very similar figures can be found in nearby towns, and I am going to go through them because I think it is important to have this information on the record.
Let us look at Gladstone: pre GST, 87.5; August—now—91.6; GST, 2.29c. That is our calculation. If we are wrong, I invite the government or the Democrats to correct us. That is our calculation based on the formula that everybody else seems to be using—except the government, which is in major denial. What is the unemployment rate in Gladstone? It is 10.4 per cent—double-digit. So big petrol hikes and a major impact as a result of the GST. Why doesn't the government just come out and say that what it wants to do is basically kick regional Australia while it is down? Let us look next at Rockhampton: pre GST, 82.5; August, 96.9; GST impact, 2.78c—or close to 3c, which everyone seems to be accepting; unemployment rate, 11.8 per cent. Turning to Townsville, I noticed that the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government did a pretty good job today of defending the higher diesel prices in his home state or home base of Townsville. This is the regional services minister defending the higher prices of that product where he is based. Looking then at Townsville: pre GST, 80; today, 92.9; GST on our calculations, 2.4c; unemployment rate, 14 per cent. 
Let us look at Queanbeyan, which is not very far from where we are: pre GST, 84.9; now, 97.7; GST, 2.85c—close to 3c; unemployment, 8.4 per cent. That is better, but still above the national average. They are the figures for Queanbeyan—a stone's throw from here. Turning next to Grafton in regional New South Wales: pre GST, 88.9; now up to 96; GST in our estimation is about 2.7c—so that is 3c. This is now—of course, because of the nature of the GST, this will go up. Unemployment in Grafton is running at 10 per cent. Looking now at Lismore: 87.9 pre GST; now, 95.9; GST component on our calculations, 2.67c; unemployment rate, 11.5 per cent. How on earth are these people going to be able to afford to drive to actually get to jobs? Turning finally to Ballarat: 79.9 pre GST; now, 93.3; GST component on our calculations, 2.45c; unemployment rate, 10.4 per cent.
These towns that have been impacted by the GST are the very same towns that are paying more for everything else in relation to the GST. The GST is a flat percentage rate of tax—the higher the original price, as Senator Cook explained to everybody, the more tax you pay. That is axiomatic and that is a fact. Not only that, but the higher prices go, the more GST you will pay. Some of these regional centres are coping with record unemployment levels in a so-called boom economy and now they are being hit with record price increases. I do not want to be alarmist, and I will say it again: we are not asserting that the GST is wholly and solely the cause in relation to petrol prices; we are saying that it is a part of it. We are saying this is additional revenue the government did not expect and we are saying that it is going to increase because of the nature of the GST. Anybody would agree with that, except for the government, which simply denies that it is happening.
This is the inevitable outcome, in terms of petrol and regional Australia, of what is an intrinsically inequitable tax. This is what happens when you apply a flat percentage tax indiscriminately. Today the Victorian Road Transport Association commented on the impact of similar increases in the price of diesel fuel. In many regional areas diesel is now more than a dollar a litre. This represents an increase of 34c since the government set the level of its diesel fuel rebate at 24c a litre. This means, as we said in question time today, that regional Australians are at least 10c a litre worse off, so bang goes your diesel fuel rebate. The Victorian Road Transport Association said:
... nothing moves without a truck, and that cost will flow to the community.
That is absolutely correct, and that is what is happening out there. According to them, about 5c a kilometre has been added to transport costs, which will translate into supermarket price rises of about 2.5c. This is on top of the GST—on top of prices in the supermarket that have already risen as a result of the GST. Fuel prices, as we know, are going to go up because of what is happening in the global situation, and nobody disagrees with that. The government are continuing to deny reality, but they are also ignoring their own backbenchers. I suppose why wouldn't you really, when you look at how successful they have been in lobbying the government in relation to regional Australia.
Earlier this year on ABC radio the Prime Minister said—and I was amazed when we found this quote when we were undertaking research for this contribution: 
... one of the distinguishing features of the tax package is that it is going to result in sharply lower fuel prices than would otherwise be the case in rural and regional Australia.
So on the ABC he was not even asserting that it would be a zero-sum gain; he was saying that prices were going to be sharply lower. Extraordinarily, Senator Kemp came into the chamber during question time yesterday and said that, after the GST was applied, petrol prices had fallen. Senator Conroy is from Melbourne, and even in the middle of Melbourne, surely, petrol prices have gone up. I think one of the backbenchers today from the coalition made it extremely clear that the differential is increasing, but of course now urban Australians are being pinged too. This is an extraordinary statement from the Prime Minister coming on top of his comment that `the GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist'. I am not quite sure who he defines as `the ordinary motorist'—maybe it is the politicians who drive Comcars, I do not know. But certainly the ordinary motorist is doing really badly and not doing really well.
Let us have a look at some of the backbenchers who have complained. Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert—whose main city is Townsville—has written to Peter Costello about the harsh conditions being imposed on the people in his electorate under the government's policies. Good, you write a letter—that is going to get some action, I do not think. He has also expressed his concern about the impact of future inflationary increases on the price of petrol. We have not even seen that yet—that is, the inflationary aspects of the GST. But we have already seen petrol prices increase by approximately—maybe more, maybe less—3c a litre because of the GST; additional revenue this government had not counted on that is going to increase exponentially. Peter Lindsay has called on the government to freeze the inflation-linked increase in excise because of the rising prices. That has been ruled out by John Howard, the Prime Minister.
Paul Neville, the member for Hinkler—who I have to say was ardently pursued by the media in relation to this last week and was completely missing in action; Hinkler covers the cities of Bundaberg and Glad-stone—has, with other coalition back-benchers, called for a look at the reallocation to roads of the revenue raised by the GST from petrol. Just think about this for a minute: what he is saying is, `Let's put some more money from the petrol excise into roads.' What is the point of having roads if you cannot afford to drive on them? What is the point of having new roads if you cannot afford the petrol to put in your car? One of the things that is happening in my home state of Tasmania today is that people cannot afford to buy their fuel and are stealing petrol. There is a major problem in Tasmania of people actually stealing petrol. That is the nature of the Tasmanian economy when you have an increase in this sort of thing.
Some of the people in this chamber ought to wake up and go out into regional Australia and have a look at what is actually happening. It is an absolute disgrace. The National Party, particularly, should be ashamed, in that they purport to represent the regional Australians. That is what they are supposed to be here for. It is absolutely outrageous. We are proposing to have a look at a proper scheme that looks at the issue of the increased revenue from the GST. What is absolutely astounding is that the government is still saying the GST has no impact on petrol prices. That is not right. I reassert what I said in the chamber the other day, that those who assert that the GST has had no impact on petrol prices are lying. Those who make that assertion are lying.
I sat down with a service station operator in Bundaberg, and he went through it with me and explained how it all operated. It is there—in Bundaberg it is about 3c. He went through his books with me. This guy's business is now in jeopardy. He is likely to have to close up as a result of that. He joins the end of a very long queue of regional Australian businesspeople who are having to close up as a result, one way or another, of the application of the goods and services tax. There is no way to really overstate this. I really would invite senators who have not been out to the places that I have talked about to go and talk to these people. Many of us on this side of the chamber travel around regional Australia. Last week I went to Eden-Monaro. I was in McEwen. I was in Hinkler. Obviously, I talked to a lot of people outside those electorates as well. I do not just visit marginal seats, by the way. Those three happen to be marginal. 
—Richmond and Page.
—And Senator George Campbell was in Richmond and Page. People are absolutely furious about what has happened with the GST and petrol. They are not furious because of the hip-pocket nerve, as Senator Greig talked about; they are furious because it is going to impact on their day-to-day lives—in terms of what they can afford, in terms of what they can buy their families and in terms of what they can do in relation to their quality of life.
We have lost the opportunity. We have had this inquiry out there for a long time. It is not being supported. I honestly think—I do not know how Senator Greig would have voted, had he had his time over again—the GST is a disaster for regional Australia. The people of rural and regional Australia do not regard it as funny. They do not regard it as something that should be used as a political football. They just want a quality of life. They just want things fixed so they can have a decent education system, a decent health system and enough money to put some petrol in their cars.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-08-29,"—I was enticed by the contribution of the Democrats to make a contribution on the Democrats' motion. It was very interesting listening to the comments that they made in support of the motion that they have moved here today. I have to remind the Democrats that we find ourselves debating this motion, as we debated the motion that we proposed—for a proper inquiry, I might say—because of the situation that they placed this country in. It was they who took the step to join the government and impose a GST upon the Australian public. There is no doubt about that. They now seek to make all sorts of excuses for the consequences that they have foisted upon the Australian public.
We have pursued this issue on the basis that the government made a promise to the Australian public. They made a very clear promise, both prior to and after the election, that the GST would not increase the price of petrol. In fact, some ministers—one being the Minister for Finance and Administration—said that the price of petrol would go down as a result of the GST. We all acknowledge that world crude oil prices go up and down, and they do impact upon the price of fuel at the retail end. There is no doubt about that. That is not in question. What is in question here is: what has the government done with respect to the tax changes it made and the Democrats supported? That is what is in question. We have consistently had a government saying from the outset, as I said, prior to the election and subsequently, that petrol prices will not increase—in fact some, as I said, said it would decrease—as a result of the GST. We know that is simply not true.
I took steps to ring the Australian Taxation Office yesterday and asked them for some information. I asked them: if we still just had excise on petrol, what would be the current rate of excise today, excluding the GST, in terms of a tax on fuel? It is clear, abundantly clear, that there is a difference in the tax take on fuel today of almost 3c per litre. That is what the government and the Democrats have foisted upon the Australian public. That is a fact. The Treasurer was one of those who said, both prior to and after the election, that the GST would not add anything to the price of fuel, and he has continued to say it. As late as 23 August the Treasurer in an interview with Steve Liebmann on the Today show said:
The GST didn't add anything to the pump price.
I do not know what sort of calculator he has got, but he wants to get it checked because it has got a 3c per litre mistake in it somewhere. That is exactly what the difference is. As a result of the GST, we have got an additional three per cent tax take on petrol at the retail pump end, the end that affects the ordinary motorist and the Australian public. The Democrats' proposition in their motion reads:
(a)		alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of the petrol price rise on households and Australia's reliance on fossil fuels and to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ... 
As was pointed out by Senator Cook, the Democrats entered into an agreement on the GST, and part of that agreement related to an alternative approach. I have not heard the Democrats, in all the time since the introduction of the GST, stand up in here and make any comment about alternative policies or about what sorts of policies they locked the government into to bring about a population less reliant on fossil fuels. There has not been one speech—that is the truth of the matter. I have not heard Senator Greig or anyone else at that end of the chamber get up in here and make a speech in this respect. I heard Senator Allison talk about the ECOmmodore. Of course it is going to happen. But why didn't you lock the government into a stronger commitment to the development of a car like the ECOmmodore? No, we will not find that in any document or agreement between the Democrats and the government on the introduction of the GST—not one iota.
I go to the question of leaded petrol. Back in 1993 there supposedly was a 2c differential between leaded and unleaded fuels. I made a few inquiries recently to check out how things are progressing, because, as I understand it, there is a timetable for the expiration of the use of leaded fuels. My inquiries proved to be very interesting. I come back to the Democrats' position. I know for a fact that in Western Australia you can no longer buy leaded fuel; you can buy non-lead replacement fuel. If it is the case in Western Australia, why isn't it the case in the rest of the country? Where have the Democrats been on that? Why didn't they lock the government into that? If they are so concerned—as they say we are not—about emissions, why didn't they get that sorted out? They did not come in here and make a song and dance about that, because they failed in every effort.
While I am talking about leaded fuel versus non-leaded replacement fuel, who gets to keep the difference in the case of the non-lead replacement fuel now used in cars that would normally run on leaded petrol? The difference, which was only ever intended to be 2c a litre, now is approximately 2½c a litre. I wondered why the government should keep that excise, but the government does not get the excise anymore. The companies keep that money. I suppose they would argue that they keep it because of additional production costs. Where in his motion does Senator Greig deal with any of these issues? Unlike the motion that we put up, which goes to the very heart of the issue confronting the Australian public today, there is nothing in Senator Greig's motion that would give any comfort to the Australian public that the Democrats are genuine about getting to the nub of this issue. They have referred this matter to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, which they chair. Point (b) of the motion reads:
(b)		the amount of windfall tax revenues over and above that forecast in the 2000-01 Budget that the Commonwealth and the states are likely to receive as a result of the rise in world petrol prices;
There are two things about that. One is that excise on fuel is a fixed amount and comes about as a result of CPI increases. The CPI increase has to be greater than one per cent for there to be an increase in the excise on fuel. The only real effect on the Australian motorist as a result of the increase in world oil prices is at the retail end, and that is as a result of the GST.
I listened with some interest to the Prime Minister in the other chamber yesterday when he said, `Well, you've got to establish firstly whether or not there is a windfall.' He said that we—that is, the opposition—`seemed to think that there is a windfall, but in fact there is not a windfall.' He said this was because `our costs are greater'—I think it was by a factor of two to one—`in terms of the pension increases, et cetera.' I have a little bit of difficulty with that because excise on fuel does not increase unless the increase is greater than one per cent. It has increased, since the introduction in 1994, in excess of 24 times. There have been a number of occasions when it has not increased at all. Pensions increased. They increase, as I understand it, with any movement in the CPI—that is a fact. This again is a bit of a fudge on the part of the Prime Minister, supported by the Democrats. It amazes me. Senator Allison is saying that we want a beat-up on the GST. Of course we want a beat-up on the GST. Why wouldn't we? The coalition of Democrats, National Party and Liberals have put in place something which was a con on the Australian public. It has been proven to be a con because they now feel they are caught in a trap. The Democrats are caught in a trap and they are looking for a way out. I have to say that not even this motion will get them out of the trap that they are in. 
The public are not that gullible. They were gullible enough to accept your credentials before but they are not going to be gullible on this occasion. Senator Greig has proceeded to put up a proposition that for all intents and purposes is only aimed at looking at alternative policies. Senator Greig: in terms of your credibility on environmental matters, I would have thought that you would have had all of the alternative policies in your back pocket, that you would have been able to produce them and that you would have been able to argue very reasonably why they should be in place. But we have not heard that at all. If I go to paragraph (c) of this proposition, it states:
	(c)	the extent to which petrol companies will be able to pass on the 1.5 cents a litre savings from tax reform and over what time-frame;
As I understand it, the ACCC is looking at that, and I think they are having some difficulty. I do not want to be disrespectful to any of my colleagues on the rural and regional committee but, as a senator who sits on other committees, we sometimes face great difficulty in actually getting our hands on the facts. We sometimes need the advice of experts with regard to getting some of these matters properly fleshed out. 
Paragraph (d), which is another little gem, states: 
	(d)	whether the subsidy scheme for regional motorists is adequate and is working effectively so that the city/country petrol price differential is not increased ...
But it has already increased. That is another fact. I would say to the Democrats: make a few phone calls and check a few fuel prices. You will soon establish the fact that the gap has widened between the city and country prices. I would suggest that $500 million—if that was the amount of money to go into this scheme—is not sufficient. Why? Because the GST has added almost another 3c a litre to the cost of fuel. 
All of these claims that have been made by the government and the Democrats with regard to the benefits of the GST in respect of fuel—whether it is at the retail end, being sold for general motorists, for the transport industry or for any other aspect of industry—have not come true. The Democrats have to wear it. They have to accept that they locked themselves into a situation with this government who pulled a con on the Australian public. That is what they have to accept. 
First the Democrats came in here and voted down an opposition motion that went to the very heart of what is at question here because they knew that it would confront them and highlight their inadequacies to the Australian public over this issue. They then come in here with this mickey mouse proposal that will achieve absolutely nothing. And that is what they want: another smokescreen. I thought for a minute, when I listened to Senator Kemp, that the government were going to support it. I am still not sure that they are not, because some smokescreen is better than no smokescreen. I know that the government are looking for somewhere to hide and they may well try to hide in this Democrat proposition. That is a reality. 
As we have heard from Senator Lees, and again from Senator Kemp today, there have been numerous inquiries—Senator Kemp said 40; Senator Allison corrected him—and this would be the 49th. Well, the Democrats' one would not be the 49th because that would not be an inquiry at all. But, if you had proposed what we proposed, we would have had the 49th inquiry, which would have been a worthwhile inquiry. So what if we have had 48 others! They were probably very worthwhile inquiries about different aspects of the fuel industry. I have to admit that I have not taken the time to go and check what each of those inquiries actually was about.  
—If you are so interested in petrol prices, you should.
—I take the interjection from Senator Bartlett. I assume he has and I hope that, if he gets up to speak, he will be able to tell us what each and every one of them is about.
In closing, we have a responsibility to ensure that the government delivers on the commitment that it gave to the Australian public. We have to do that because that is what the Prime Minister said he would do on many occasions. He said, `We will deliver on our commitment.' The facts of the matter are that the government and the Democrats are not delivering on commitments on petrol that they made to the Australian public. That is a fact. This proposal, smokescreen that it is, should not be supported. We should get a proper inquiry going to establish some real facts as to the problems associated with the price of fuel. Nobody would disagree that world oil prices are a factor. We have to establish the facts—but we do not have to establish them, because we know the GST has increased the tax take on fuel by at least 3c. We have to look at the revenue take and what capacity there is to give some relief to the Australian public.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-29,"—Just as Senator Murphy was inspired to speak by the Democrats, likewise he has generated some extra enthusiasm for me to clarify this situation for him, because I think it is important to ensure that it is clear. Despite all the protestations from the ALP that this whole exercise is not just another opportunity for them to get onto their bandwagon of bashing the GST, it is quite clear from their contributions—including Senator Murphy's—that that is precisely what it is about. Despite all of the ALP speakers acknowledging that world oil prices are a significant contributor to the increase in petrol prices around Australia, what do we have in their terms of reference? Paragraph (a), GST; paragraph (b), GST; paragraph (c), GST; paragraph (d), GST. That is all they want to focus on for another whole inquiry.
—You voted for it.
—I know everyone wants to relive their youth, relive the golden days and pretend that we are back when we were younger, but the GST is here and we have got to live with it. Sorry, but it is here. Speaking, as I am sure you would know, as one of those Democrats who did not vote for the GST, I came to terms with the fact that it was going to be a fact more than 12 months ago. I would rather live in the present and look to the future. Much as I would like to relive my youth, I am stuck with now and we have to look forward. My reliving my youth is not going to help the Australian public in terms of their concerns about petrol prices.
If we are serious about addressing the legitimate concerns of the Australian public about petrol prices, we need to look at the reality now and what we can do about it. As speakers have acknowledged in amongst all their various comments, the vast majority of the current petrol price rise is due to world oil prices. We know the Prime Minister did not meet his commitment to reduce the level of excise. That was a commitment and a power totally and only within the government; it was nothing to do with the Senate or the Democrats.
—Was that a core promise?
—I do not know whether it was core or not, but it was obviously broken and everybody knows that. Senator Cook himself said that, as did all the other Labor speakers. The Democrats have said that. It is quite clear that the Prime Minister did not meet his commitment to lower the rate of excise adequately. The whole country knows that. Why do we need a Senate inquiry to confirm that the Prime Minister did not keep his promise, something everybody already knows? Senate inquiries are about trying to establish facts, not confirming things that everybody already knows. They are about trying to find answers and solutions to address a problem, not just reinforcing complaints about something that everybody already knows. They do actually cost a fair bit of time and money. If an inquiry were set up in the context of suggesting that it would address a public concern or problem, then it would be misleading. Indeed, we would provide false hope to the public if we set up an inquiry that was not framed in a way that would provide a solution or at least some answers or suggestions. It is quite clear that the ALP are not serious about that, otherwise they would be supporting this Democrat motion. 
There is plenty in the terms of reference here for Labor to run all their stuff about the Prime Minister not keeping his promise. There is plenty of stuff in there where you can run all the GST stuff you like, but it also provides an opportunity to acknowledge that we are likely to be stuck with high fuel prices even if we were not stuck with a GST because of world oil price factors. That is something we should try to look at to see what we are going to do about it. Do we increase subsidies to reduce the price? Do we provide extra assistance for people in the bush? Do we put extra resources into reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and international exports of oil so we have less of an impact when the world oil price goes up? Forecasts are that the world oil price will go up significantly higher again, and you will still be there complaining about the GST. That is not going to help anybody very much; in fact, it is not going to help anybody at all, and it is certainly not going to help any of us in terms of dealing with our dependence on world oil prices. The whole point of trying to address the concerns of the Australian public is to try to ensure that we actually find solutions for this problem of overall price rises.
—You're doing a Basil Fawlty: don't mention the GST.
—I've mentioned the GST a number of times. I am quite happy to talk about the GST, but I do not talk about the GST as being a—
—Move on.
—I am quite happy to move on. The whole point is that we recognise the GST as part of the tax system now. You want to move on, as you repeatedly say, but you will not get rid of the GST and you are not even going to put forward any commitment to reduce the level of excise, stop indexation or anything like that. It is completely pointless to simply focus on the GST as though somehow or other it is to blame for everything. What we need to do is to examine proposals that will address the clear problem of the likely long-term, ongoing increase in the price of petrol—and that would be a fact whether the GST was there or not.
This is something, despite Senator Murphy's protestation, that the Democrats have spoken long and loud on for many years. He obviously, for whatever reason, does not immediately listen in every time the Democrats make a speech. I cannot imagine why that is, but obviously it is not the case. We will have to notify him every time we make speeches now so he can make sure he hears all of our contributions on transport policy, petrol prices and the need for alternative fuels.
—He will be hanging on with bated breath.
—I know Senator Conroy listens in every time, and that is why he never misrepresents our position on anything. Clearly some others do not listen, but these are policy positions the Democrats have pushed for many years. We have policy platforms. They are on our web site now and they were put forward at the last election. We have policies on transport, petrol pricing and all sorts of issues to do with reducing our reliance on petrol imports and moving to alternative fuels. Much as it may shock others, we do not suggest that we know all the answers to everything, and we think it would be appropriate to tap the expertise in the broader Australian community about other ideas for reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and, indeed, reducing the impact on our Australian economy every time world oil prices go up. It clearly reduces our independence and our control over our own future if we are subject to and vulnerable to things that we have no control over as a nation, such as international oil prices. That is what this whole issue is about and that is what this inquiry is focused on.
Even so, our terms of reference would still provide plenty of scope for the ALP to continue to get evidence, get witnesses and make speeches to their hearts content about the great evils of the GST, if that is all they wish to contribute to the whole debate. The fact that they are not interested in broadening it out to long-term solutions gives a clear indication that they are not serious about the issue and that they see it simply as a short-term political opportunity. I think that is a great shame because this is a serious problem—one that quite legitimately concerns the Australian public and has significant economic concerns and one that we should be trying to find solutions to rather than using it for political point scoring. It is a bit unfortunate that we as a Senate have not been able to move forward in a positive way on this issue of concern. Obviously we will have to look at other mechanisms to try to constructively address the concerns of the Australian public and the impact that this issue will have on the Australian economy and our environment.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-08-29,"—I did not have any intention of speaking in this debate until I had an opportunity to look at Senator Greig's motion that is before us. I have an opportunity to make a contribution in light of what I see as—and I take on board the word already used—the `smokescreens' in Senator Greig's motion. In particular, the Democrats are trying desperately to hide behind the fact that they are in this up to their necks—the predicament that the Australian motorists and the Australian transport industry are in at the moment because of the rising fuel prices that will affect Australian households, not only directly by filling up their cars but also indirectly by those increased transport costs that Senator Mackay outlined today, and the inability and resistance by the government to do anything about this.
I want to go to the parts of the motion that I find intriguing. Are the Democrats saying that there is no need for an inquiry into the government's broken promises in relation to fuel? If so, I do not know how they can justify the inquiry in the terms that they have outlined here today. In relation to the issue of saying that Australia has a reliance on fossil fuels and that we should be attempting to reduce this reliance, in our lifetime that reliance will not reduce at all. Probably in our own children's lifetime that dependence will not reduce at all. This is a furphy, and it has been run by a lot of well-meaning people but people who just do not wish to confront the issue—that is, that our technology and our transport systems, whether public or private, are dominated and will continue to be dominated by diesel fuels. 
One of the angles that the Democrat's motion is trying to run is that if we increase the price of diesel fuel then at some point or another that might discourage people from using their own private motor vehicle transport or, if you listen to Senator Allison, get heavy vehicles off the road—that people will switch to public transport, whether buses, trams or trains, and that goods will be delivered by trains. That will not happen in either my lifetime or my children's lifetime. That thinking is in cloud-cuckoo-land. To Senator Allison's credit, she has been to a number of industry functions at which she has not only advocated that heavy vehicles should be fuelled by ethanol, CNG or LPG but also suggested fuelling vehicles with canola oil. As I understand it, when she put that idea to one of the major road transport bodies, they really did think she may have overstepped the mark and, indeed, may have been out of her league. As I said, I think the people who are advocating this position are well meaning but not very well informed. 
If you look at the issue of public transport in terms of price rises in petrol or diesel, you will find that, no matter how much you increase the price of diesel or petrol, there is insignificant movement in the patronage of public transport vehicles, whether trains or buses. It just does not move. That is not the answer to what the Democrats see as urban congestion and emissions. The answer, as town planners will tell you, has to do significantly with urban density. Even that does not work. From reading some studies, even if we substitute cars for trains that are accessible and close by, there is only a five per cent decrease in the amount of private car usage. So in this country, and in most Western countries, we have a dependence on cars that we have had for some generations and that we will have for some generations to come.  
It is disingenuous of the Democrats to come in here today and argue that we should use a magic wand to come up with the answers to public transport. In their view—and they think this is correct—if we continue to increase the price of petrol and diesel, that will discourage people from using their own private transport to transport either themselves or their goods. They are living in cloud-cuckoo-land. Every objective survey I could point to—and if I had an opportunity I could get the names of the surveys—will indicate differently. People are not discouraged from using private transport no matter how much the price of diesel or petrol goes up. 
As Senator Mackay eloquently put it today, the Victorian Road Transport Association said today in their press release that the price of goods supplied to people in shops and other commodities throughout the state of Victoria will increase substantially over the next period. And why is that? Because of the government's policies. What will affect that? Inflation. This is something over which the government have control. Our original motion by Senator Cook urged the government to take action, to nip this in the bud, to protect themselves from inflationary effects that may occur as a result of these decisions. However, by the government voting down our motion today, they will not be able to have these issues fleshed out and they will not have the opportunity to act under the guise of a Senate committee report, if it went that way.
I also point to part (a)(ii) of the Democrats motion, `developing alternative fuel options'. If the Democrats are accusing Labor of having a 48th or 49th inquiry into petrol or diesel, I could accuse them of not being forthright and honest in relation to the number of inquiries there have been into alternative fuel options. There is major pressure in Europe and North America about fuel standards. There is a huge debate under way in California about low sulfur fuel. I want to point this out: on fuel quality, early indications are that low sulfur diesel needed to meet the emission standards that are being sought—that is Euro 4 or Euro 5 emission standards—will probably add 10c extra a litre. So even if we embark on a situation where we are going to reduce the amount of sulfur in diesel, we are going to increase the price by at least 10c a litre for that diesel. And there are no alternative or economically viable schemes coming along to replace the dependence—whether or not we like it—we have on diesel and petrol.
Under this inquiry that is being sought by the Democrats, we are being asked to investigate a situation where we will be advocating increased diesel prices over the next few years, and this will occur because of our commitment to meet the standards over the next few years. Let us not live in fairyland, cloud-cuckoo-land or anywhere like that. The Democrats know exactly what they are doing, and they are doing it for the wrong reasons. There are no viable reasons for what they are advocating. Behind this is their dislike of private transport, whether it is by car or by truck. That is what is really behind this. Their misguided logic is this: increasing the price of fuel—whether petrol or diesel—will discourage private passenger use and will discourage companies from using trucks to transport their goods. That will not occur, as I said, in my lifetime or in the lifetime of my children, because we are dependent on it.
The next part of the Democrats motion—(a)(iii), `restructuring motor vehicle registration charges'—goes to show how much research, I imagine, the drafters of this motion did. Earlier this year, the National Road Transport Commission made recommendations to the Australian council of transport ministers in relation to charges for heavy vehicles. Mr Acting Deputy President, you may be aware that in 1995 in this country there were 10.2 million passenger and light commercial vehicles, 340,000 rigid vehicles and 600,000 articulated vehicles. The NRTC reported to the Australian council of transport ministers and made some recommendations. As I have pointed out, this is in relation to the Democrats motion at section (a)(iii), `restructuring motor vehicle registration charges'. This year the NRTC has recommended: for two- and three-axle vehicles, a proposed increase of two to four per cent; for B doubles, a proposed increase of 15 per cent; and for three- and four-axle articulated vehicles, a proposed increase of 30 per cent. And, as I understand it, the states are in the process of implementing this recommendation. So we have already dealt with (a)(iii). 
Once again, I come back to what might be an obsession of the Democrats, and that is mistakenly thinking that, by their actions, they are going to discourage people from using private vehicle transport or from using heavy vehicles or light vehicles to transport goods. That will not occur. This is, as I have stated, a misguided—but probably well-meaning—attempt by people who really have not concentrated on the issue and looked at how they might address this dependence that we have on private motor vehicles.
If you look at it, it is a city-country divide. In the motion there is also a reference to looking at a subsidy scheme or some sort of differential between city and rural motorists. I remind the mover of the motion that, earlier this year, or it could have been last year, a High Court case was taken by Mr Ha against, I think, the South Australian government. The South Australian government deliberately did some cross-subsidisation—I think that is what it was—of South Australian rural motorists. The High Court struck down that differential. I think you may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that at some stage Peter Costello was looking at some sort of means by which to apply some differential between country and city operators. He has not been able to do it. Constitutionally, he will not be able to do it. It is bunkum for the Democrats to come in here and put forward this motion that we should be investigating it. Investigate it all you like, it will not change. Mr Costello and the coalition have done their best to see if they can do something like this. It cannot be done. If we are going to talk about people being fair dinkum, maybe the Democrats themselves should look at how they are going to operate on this. If this is a means by which they can slither out of supporting our motion and go back to their cafe latte set in Sydney or Melbourne and say, as they jump into their Jags, `We have done our best,' then good luck to them. If we are serious about trying to redress the difficulties that Australian families and companies are facing with these hikes in petrol and diesel prices, then the only way forward would have been for the Democrats to support our motion today.
I want to finish on one other thing that concerns diesel prices and the issue that the Democrats are trying to raise about social issues and increasing public transport. In the diesel grants rebates scheme that the government put forward, even though they were made quite aware of it, almost all urban buses operated by private bus companies are excluded from being able to make application to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. On 1 July their bus fares would have gone up because they are not in the zone that would attract the rebate. They are not in that zone. So much for their concern about trying to encourage people to move from private car usage to public transport. This is not a genuine motion; this is what I said earlier it is: an opportunity for them to slide out of their responsibilities.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-08-29,"—I will not take much of the Senate's time. I think what has needed to be said has, in fact, been said and I would only be going over what the Senate has already heard. The reason that matters are referred to committees—normally speaking—in this chamber is in order for the committee members and, through the report of the committee to the chamber, the whole of the chamber to understand the facts of a situation. The purpose of referring matters of major public policy to committees is also to allow persons affected to come before the committee and give the committee their experience as to how they are affected.
In this particular instance, those who are affected really are those least able to bear the burden. I am referring particularly to working families, those who are almost on the breadline. These are the ones that will mostly be affected. There will be others, of course, affected directly. Regional Australia, as has been said during the debate quite frequently, will be particularly affected—not least of all, my own state of Tasmania. Spare a thought for the truckies, for those people in the transport industry. They are working extraordinary hours at the present moment. I use the word `extraordinary' because we have all seen and studied the figures relating to deaths of persons who are in the transport industry. The pressure is on them at the present moment, and they do not need this further burden. 
This afternoon we have had the proposition by the opposition and the proposition by the Australian Democrats. An attractive part of the proposition by the opposition was that it had a reporting date in early December. One of the purposes of referring a matter to a committee is to come up with a report, based on facts, which will provide a self-evident path which the government and others would follow in order to achieve the objective outlined by the committee's report. In the opposition's proposal, the opposition did have a number of matters to be investigated and into which the committee would inquire—and to most of which, frankly, the answers are already known. But it would have been a useful exercise, I think, to focus the attention of government and others on what is actually occurring. I notice that the proposition did not mention the word `excise' by name—although subparagraph 1(e) would have been able to be utilised, I suppose, to get from the Labor Party what its view is about the whole issue of the excise. Nonetheless, I did vote for the opposition's proposal, and the reason I did so was that I thought it did at least focus on the issues as they are now.
The Australian Democrats motion, which we are discussing, does not have the sort of immediacy that I think is required. Nevertheless, it does raise issues, including the alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of petrol price rises on households, and it goes into the question which is on a lot of people's minds: Australia's reliance on fossil fuels and the effect on greenhouse gas emissions. I must say, though—to be quite frank—that, for the people that I move amongst, that is not high on their thinking at the present moment. Their thinking is, `How are we going to make ends meet this week, as a result of a hike in fuel prices?'
I was hoping that the Democrats and the opposition might have come to some sort of agreement on the matters in question, because some of the things raised by the reference we are currently considering would be very worth while inquiring into. I must express my regret that there was no agreement. But having some sort of an inquiry is better than having none, because the matters will be canvassed and, no doubt, whether the proposers like it or not, certain people will come before the committee and give evidence on some of the matters that are pressing more on the minds of the public than are some that are specifically mentioned for inquiry.
After all of that—not that it will make a great deal of difference—I also will be voting for the proposal. But I really believe that that should not be used to sidetrack a government or used to lessen pressure on the authorities to do something about this matter immediately. A lot of the people I am thinking of just cannot cope with further rises. Some suggestion was made—I think it was by the minister—that there are likely to be further price rises caused by international factors within the next few months. We all realise, of course, that this is a matter largely about which the government has little control. But there are other areas—and I am not going into them as they have all been canvassed—where the government does have the opportunity to ameliorate the problem, the very real and big problem, that is faced by the community, particularly those who are most vulnerable.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-08-29,"—I take this opportunity to sum up briefly, mercifully. In closing this debate, I must say that I share some of Senator Harradine's disappointment that some kind of accommodation could not have been met. I do not believe that the proposal we put forward was unreasonable. Throughout much of the debate—such as it was—I heard time and time again from Labor senators their particular preference for going down the path of some kind of inquiry in terms of investigating petrol price rises, their cause, how the money is being accumulated and where it is going. Yet I remain convinced that those things are covered in items (b), (c) and (d) of our motion, and I cannot see why Labor could not bring itself to support that. 
Senator Cook spoke first and accused me of having a reasonable and carefully moderated voice. I do not know quite how to respond to that, other than to say that I have yet to be convinced that apoplexy is the way to go. He argued also, as I have said, that what we Democrats ought to be doing and what the Senate ought to be doing is going down the path of Labor's repeated call for yet another review. There have been so many reviews that I do not know why Labor does not just go the whole hog and have a musical! But 49 is, I think, enough. It is not enough simply to have a review or, for that matter, simply to have a Senate inquiry: we must act on the recommendations thereof. I wonder how many of these 49 reviews remain in dust jackets on shelves, waiting for their 50th counterpart.
Senator Kemp spoke and gave us 26 minutes of roll-back and two minutes of why the government would not be supporting the Democrats motion. Mr Acting Deputy President, I share your concern: to this point in time, I still do not understand why the government, nor do I understand clearly whether or not it was, was in fact cementing its position of opposition to this motion.
My colleague Senator Allison picked up on the points which I had noted in listening to Senators Cook, Mackay and others about the question of what was happening to the windfall tax revenue. Senator Cook seemed particularly agitated by that point, and again I come back to items (b), (c) and (d) in the Democrats motion, which I believe would have adequately covered that.
Senator Mackay made reference to Senator Woodley and made a point of noting that he was not here. For the record, Senator Mackay, I should point out Senator Woodley's keen interest in this issue, particularly for his rural and regional constituency in Queensland. But he did, in fact, have another engagement and, to the extent that I can, I extend his apologies.
Senator Mackay spoke also of rural and regional disenchantment. I have no doubt that that is very real in Tasmania, as it is in other parts of Australia. But one of the key reasons that we Democrats have proposed this motion and phrased the terms of reference in the way we have is that maybe—maybe—we can address some of that. One of the points that I have tried to make strongly here today is that, once we acknowledge—and we really should acknowledge—the reality that petrol prices have increased and that there is an unexpected windfall of revenue for the government, why cannot we use some of that revenue more sensibly in rural and regional areas?
Senator Cook made the point, for example, that where his electorate office is in Kalgoorlie there is very poor public transport. I think that is what he said from memory; it was a while ago. Perhaps if we could reasonably and realistically use some of this unexpected revenue quite specifically to upgrade and improve the public transport that exists in rural and regional Australia, that would be one of the things that this committee could and should address.
Senator Murphy, who is now in the chair, then spoke, goading us Democrats as to why we did not lock this in in the GST deal. We could not get everything. We got an awful lot, but we could not get everything. My rhetorical question to you is: what did you do in 13 years of government? Where were the alternative fuel policies then? Where was the public transport infrastructure then? As Senator Lees said quite rightly at the time—and it is worth echoing—the Democrats were able to achieve more in 13 days of negotiation with the government than was achieved in 13 years of negotiation with previous ALP governments.
Senator Bartlett then spoke. He also seems to have a reasonable and carefully moderated voice—monotone, some would argue. He reiterated his passion for environment issues, and there is no doubt that he is sincere about that. More importantly, I think he spoke quite honestly about the fact that we must simply recognise that this is the scenario we have, that this is the GST ANTS package we have, that this is the global political climate we have and that we need to respond to that reasonably. Shrill calls from the Labor Party—for purely political reasons—for an immediate reduction in petrol prices as we enter what is effectively an election year are simply unacceptable when the issues are more serious and deeper than that, as Senator Harradine indicated. 
Senator Hutchins spoke, sounding a little like a cracked record, as he was following three or four of his colleagues. He made a point which I must take issue with, and that is that the Democrats have a particular dislike or disapproval of private transport and that our passion for this issue was driven by that. I must refute that and say that it is not the case. We acknowledge the reality that many Australians enjoy the use of personal and private transport, but that is no reason to become complacent. The point I made in my opening remarks to this motion is that we should not simply take it for granted that a car must be available for everyone and that fossil fuels are here to stay. We must—I repeat, must—look at sensible public transport options and alternative fuel provisions. Senator Hutchins suggested that better public transport with alternative fuels simply will not occur because that is not part of the Australian mindset, but that is not enough. We Democrats argue that greater leadership is required here.
Finally, Senator Harradine spoke, particularly with regard to the committee process, and I share some of his concerns about that. Senator Harradine seemed to feel that a greater sense of immediacy was required in addressing this issue. In response to Senator Harradine's concerns—unless I misunderstood him—that those people who may want to present themselves to the committee process or to provide submissions to it will in part be disenfranchised working people, I suggest to Senator Harradine that, that being the case, if we keep the reporting date as the first sitting day in February then we keep that relatively slow social period over Christmas and the school holidays and the slow working period of January-February and the new year. That will perhaps provide some opportunity for those people to participate in the committee process. They might not be able to do so if we were to hasten this to a November reporting date.
In closing, I reiterate my party's position and its clear preference for these terms of reference on fuel policy to proceed in the way that we have outlined and I have spoken to. I believe the issues, particularly the issues of public transport and alternative fuels, are worthy of serious debate, not just here and now but in the committee process. The end result should be that we do something serious about it. We do not want this to become yet another dusty report on a shelf somewhere. I commend this motion to the Senate and believe it is worthy of support.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Greig's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-08-29,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in February 2001:
	(a)	alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of the petrol price rise on households and Australia's reliance on fossil fuels and to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of transport including:
	(i)	promoting, expanding and upgrading public transport,
	(ii)	developing alternative fuel options,
	(iii)	restructuring motor vehicle regist-ration charges, and
	(iv)	promoting more fuel efficient and cleaner motor vehicles;
	(b)	the amount of windfall tax revenues over and above that forecast in the 2000-01 Budget that the Commonwealth and the states are likely to receive as a result of the rise in world petrol prices;
	(c)	the extent to which petrol companies will be able to pass on the 1.5 cents a litre savings from tax reform and over what time-frame;
	(d)	whether the subsidy scheme for regional motorists is adequate and is working effectively so that the city/country petrol price differential is not increased, and what alternative strategies can be implemented to reduce the cost of rural and regional transport;
	(e)	whether oil companies and retailers have used the opportunity presented by higher petrol prices to increase their retail and wholesale margins; and
	(f)	the extent to which government purc-hasing policies can encourage the domestic manufacture of fuel efficient, energy efficient and zero-emission pas-senger vehicles.
In recent days much has been made of increased petrol prices and its alleged causes. This has clearly become a political football, and I think many of the core issues at the heart of this debate have been lost. Specifically, I am interested this afternoon in talking briefly about what we as a community, as a government and as citizens in general can do to not be so reliant upon the use of petrol—particularly in cars—what alternatives exist and the opportunities that we as a Senate have to explore those. 
I was reading in recent days an article in Perth's Sunday Times, which was an interesting profile piece looking at three supposedly typical Perth suburban consumers of petrol. I note there was no reference to rural citizens in there, and that is a point I can address later. The article dealt with those people who lived and worked in the city and who were responding to the recent increased prices for petrol. Understandably, there were mixed reactions, but clearly the public sentiment was against increased prices—as you would expect. People do not like paying more for anything, regardless of what it is.
However, in one of these profile pieces, I noted with interest, the newspaper told of one particular citizen from Ballajura—a suburb roughly 10 kilometres from the city centre—who, in response to higher petrol prices, now rides his pushbike to work. I am not suggesting for a moment that this response is available to everyone or is a practical decision for everyone. But what I think it does show is that reliance on fossil fuels and easy access to cars, in particular in cities like Perth, lead to an unquestioned dependency on this form of transport while at the same time reducing the effectiveness of public transport through lower demand or lower usage thereof. It can very much be a catch-22 situation. We find that poor public transport availability and options can lead to car dependency, and that in turn minimises government and consumer responses to public transport infrastructure. In Australia, unlike some but certainly not all other countries, we have developed a culture whereby access to cars and fossil fuels is seen as a right—as something that governments must facilitate. It is very difficult for governments of whatever persuasion to resist or challenge that notion, given the mood of the electorate. But as a nation we really must come to terms with the fact that petrol cannot be seen as an essential commodity like milk and orange juice and yet be cheaper than both. Again, I am not suggesting that the answer to cleaner air, greenhouse gas reduction and vehicle choked cities is simply to make petrol highly priced—far from it. But we really must as a country look seriously at developing stronger public transport options and alternative fuels. I know that my Senate colleague Senator Allison wishes to speak more on that particular point.
As petrol prices begin to affect the hip pockets of Australians, the emotive response that petrol prices must be lowered must be sensibly countered, I think, with a more reasoned response of saying, `Well, let's look at other options to petrol and to cars.' If we are going to have a debate about the cost of fuel in Australia, then it is imperative that we look to the future and that we look to the long term, to the big picture and to the transport sector as a whole rather than simply hold the narrow view of the cost of fuel in isolation. We must look at alternatives to a reliance on imported petroleum, and we must ensure that our transport infrastructure is sufficient to provide for the needs of our people into the new millennium. Governments rather than wringing their hands should be leading by example, particularly by way of what types of vehicles they purchase to run their fleets and the types of fuel they use. As my colleague Senator Allison said earlier today in question time, government fleet purchases last year totalled some 80,000 passenger vehicles or 14.6 per cent of all vehicles purchased. If the government decided to make the switch to LPG, to CNG or to hybrid vehicles such as those made by Toyota and developed by Holden, the refuelling infrastructure would expand to accommodate those vehicles as they filtered down to the second-hand market. We have to look at ways of providing motorists with the cheapest, cleanest, greenest transport options that we can. We must look at ways of reducing our greenhouse emissions and at policies that will help us meet our commitments to reducing the impact of global warming.
Senator Hill has already acknowledged—just last month, in answer to a question from my Democrat colleague Senator Bartlett—that automotive emissions are now amongst the fastest growing of all CO2 emissions in this country. Total road transport emissions increased by 18.2 per cent over the period between 1990 and 1998, a figure that we as a nation must dramatically improve upon. The Australian Democrats are keen to identify ways of improving our record rather than embarking on a one-track witch-hunt into fuel prices. Senator Lees has already made the point that we must make provision for the possibility that the days of relatively cheap fuel are behind us.  
The terms of reference I have prepared with my colleagues will examine not only the taxation component of petrol but also how those taxes can be spent to provide better transport infrastructure that will ultimately benefit all Australians. We must develop alternative fuels. We must ensure that public transport is improved to the point where people can be guaranteed a safe, reliable, practical and clean service. We must look at the possibility of restructuring motor vehicle registration charges. We must look at how the states are spending the GST revenue returned to them, and how public transport can be improved with this extra revenue. We must look at how rail transport, and particularly very fast train technology, can be improved and expanded to take pressure off our airports. We must look at how fuel companies are passing on savings from tax reform and over what time frame, and how effectively subsidy schemes work to reduce rural and regional transport costs. We must look very closely at how Australian technology can be exported to the world, and how we can revitalise our manufacturing sector by building green-friendly cars. It seems rather strange that we can export cars that use a lot of energy, yet we fail to see how much more opportunity there will be in the longer term if we get in on the ground floor of this sunrise industry. We must look at how we as a nation can take higher fuel prices as a challenge and an opportunity to use innovation to bring eco-friendly project cars into production. I would like to think that such innovation—the development of an automotive industry and an alternative fuels industry that can deliver cheaper petrol—is something that can be supported by both government and opposition.
In response to recent concerns over petrol prices, Labor senators have argued for yet another inquiry into petrol pricing and the petroleum industry. To do so would constitute the 49th such inquiry. However, the fact remains that petrol prices have risen by 20c a litre because of higher world oil prices. This has in turn has led to a further 2c a litre rise in GST, and endless inquiries will not change the cause and effect. A far better approach, we believe, is a serious look at public transport alternatives, where that is possible, and a review of alternative fuel options. We have got to start thinking `outside the square'—to use a current business term—and look beyond the short-sightedness of vehicles and fossil fuels. To that end, we propose:
That the following matters be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in February 2001:
	(a)	alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of the petrol price rise on households and Australia's reli-ance on fossil fuels and to achieve a red-uction in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of transport including:
	(i)	promoting, expanding and upgrading public transport,
	(ii)	developing alternative fuel options,
	(iii)	restructuring motor vehicle registra-tion charges, and
	(iv)	promoting more fuel efficient and cleaner motor vehicles;
	(b)	the amount of windfall tax revenues over and above that forecast in the 2000-01 Budget that the Commonwealth and the states are likely to receive as a result of the rise in world petrol prices;
	(c)	the extent to which petrol companies will be able to pass on the 1.5 cents a litre savings from tax reform and over what time-frame;
	(d)	whether the subsidy scheme for regional motorists is adequate and is working effectively so that the city/country petrol price differential is not increased, and what alternative strategies can be implemented to reduce the cost of rural and regional transport; 
	(e)	whether oil companies and retailers have used the opportunity presented by higher petrol prices to increase their retail and wholesale margins; and
	(f)	the extent to which government purc-hasing policies can encourage the domestic manufacture of fuel efficient, energy efficient and zero-emission pas-senger vehicles.
That is the proposal in essence as I have outlined. I believe it is worthy of support. I am very conscious of the fact that we Democrats are so keen to try to shift the debate such as it has been on petrol pricing thus far around to a focus on our reliance on fossil fuels and on the fact that there are alternatives which can be explored and need to be explored and, if we are serious about cleaner cities and a better environment, that must be properly addressed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-08-29,"—Petrol prices in Australia today are too high because OPEC has pushed up the crude oil price. But petrol prices in Australia today are too high because of the way in which this government extracts a usurious tax and in particular because of the way in which the GST applies to petrol prices, and that is the real issue. The way that this Democrats inquiry is heading—the Democrats having colluded with the government just a moment ago to kill off a genuine inquiry moved by the Labor Party—is to cover up the fact that the government is price gouging at the bowser, pushing up prices for Australian motorists. It is to cover up the fact that the Democrats with the government are complicit in this chamber for foisting a GST on Australia, and they do not want the analytical attention of a properly constituted Senate inquiry to reveal that fact to Australians. The Australian Democrats, in their quietly presented, well-modulated tones, try to draw a red herring across the path.
There is simply an honourable disagreement that there ought to be a better way. I do not deny the importance of alternative fuels; I do not deny the importance of energy conservation; but the real issue for Australia, the one that confronts this parliament and this chamber, is the high price of petrol, the anger at the pump—and what is the government going to do about it? To pretend it is about alternative energy or about increasing the cost of automobile registrations is to deny the fundamental point. Labor will not be supporting this inquiry. We will not lend our name to this mischievous behaviour and we will insist that the truth and the facts come out in a properly documented way so that the political debate over who is responsible and where the true costs lie can be properly exposed and so that ordinary Australian motorists can see who is responsible and have laid out for them as an inquiry alternatives to deal with their problem. They want relief and they want action; they do not want talk. They want to know the facts, the alternatives and then what the government is going to do about it.
This is a motion which denies reality. Let me go to a number of fundamental points about where the Democrats claim to have stood. There are five points to be made. Fact one, on 13 August 1998 in his address to the nation, the Prime Minister John Howard said:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
Fact two, the Australian Automobile Association, a reputable independent organisation representing Australian motorists, says that this government will earn $1 billion of extra revenue this financial year as a consequence of the rake-off that they make over oil price increases, and $140 million of that will be a rake-off due to the GST. 
Fact three, petrol prices in metropolitan Australian bowsers are now pushing $1 a litre, and in country Australia, where you fill your tank more often, where you travel longer distances and where you do not have access to public transport, the prices are well in advance of that. In the city of Kalgoorlie in my own state of Western Australia, petrol is $1.11 per litre at the bowser; at Exmouth in my same state it is $1.19; and on the major arterial highway linking Western Australia to the rest of this nation, at an important way stop called Cocklebiddy, it is $1.33.4 per litre. It is no wonder the tourist organisations in that region are saying, `Retired Australians who cart their caravan around this nation as their superannuation aren't coming. They can't afford the petrol prices.' The damage is more pervasive to rural communities than ever before.  
Fact four, 3c per litre of those price increases that we have endured in this nation since July are due to the GST alone. Who is complicit? The two parties that a few minutes ago in this chamber knocked off the Labor Party's real inquiry: the government and the Democrats. And fact five, yesterday Meg Lees, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, said in a press release, `We are addressing the future. We are not talking about the past.' Never mind the crime that has been perpetrated on Australian motorists, never mind bringing to account the Prime Minister, who said before the election, `The GST will not increase the price of petrol.' Since when have the Democrats renounced their intention to keep the bastards honest? Why are they not doing that now, or have they become the bastards themselves and they need this chamber to keep them honest? 
There are a number of points that I need to make as to why we oppose this motion. Firstly, what about truth in politics? The Prime Minister made his commitment, he was backed by the Treasurer on 7 September and he was backed by the Liberal Party campaign headquarters on 6 September—all of whom said the GST will not increase prices. What about a bit of truth? We need a dinky-di inquiry that will get at the facts, not some inquiry that will go on a frolic about alternative fuels and look at relief that might occur some time next century or at a much higher cost to Australian motorists. Australians want redress now, not at some future time.
This inquiry that is being proposed by the Democrats will do nothing about the windfall gain to government revenue that I referred to earlier. Lachlan McIntosh, of the Australian Automobile Association, puts that gain at $1 billion. The NFF in a press release today put it at $400 million. The RAC in my home state of Western Australia put it at $660 million. What are the facts? How much rake-off is this government earning as a consequence of the higher prices? The inquiry that is being proposed by the Democrats will not answer that question. What about the widening gap between city and country prices? As I have said, at metropolitan bowsers petrol is $1 a litre; in the bush, it is anything up to $1.33, and last night on the ABC, in some parts of Western Australia, it was reported to be $1.68 a litre.
—What!
—It was reported on the ABC last night, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Ian Campbell, was present and did not argue the case. The prices between country and metropolitan Australia are widening because of the formula the government has used here, and they are set to widen even further. As I said, country motorists fill their tanks more often. They travel further. They do not have the alternative of public transport. They certainly do not have the easy alternative of alternative fuels. And they get hit hardest, yet the gap is widening. What about all of those promises to regional Australia from this government? What about a tax on a tax? Where is the principle here? The main components of the cost of petrol at the bowser are the cost of buying the crude, refining it and shipping it to the bowser, the cost of the excise applied by the government—which is a tax on petrol—and then the cost of another tax on that total, which is the GST, a tax on a tax. One of the fundamental principles of taxation law is to avoid governments taxing taxes in order to extract a higher gain. Why aren't the Australian Democrats concerned about that principle? Why don't they want to inquire into its effects here? Is it because they are complicit, that they voted for a tax on a tax?
What about the half million dollars of Australian taxpayers' money that the government paid to reduce petrol prices in the bush? There is now a substantial allegation that it has been pocketed by the oil companies and has not gone to help consumers at all. What about that? It has been investigated by the ACCC, but should not this parliament that approves of the outlays by the government at budget time have some look at this as well? We are responsible for voting for budget bills. Should we not examine whether this $500,000 of taxpayers' money has simply been soaked up by the oil companies?  
What about the central question here? How much is the true windfall? As I have said, it is $1 billion according to the Automobile Association, $400 million according to the NFF and $660 million according to the RAC. But why can't we call the government to an inquiry and get them to open their books and show us the facts so we can see what the windfall is? That is the investigative role of Senate committees. Why do the Democrats prevent us from doing that? Why does this motion for an inquiry into alternative fuels obscure our ability to get at that detail? That is a question for the Democrats that Australians want to know the answer to and, if they will not give it, if they obstruct it and if they want to have a cover-up with the government, they will eventually pay the political price.
What about the lie that the government tax is necessary to cover indexed pension payments, when of course pensions as outlays are indexed and the revenue on petrol is also indexed? That is the lie that has been put into public debate and that is the justification, but no-one says—and certainly no-one from the government says—that the index on the GST is being moved upwards by the OPEC oil sheiks whereas the index on pensions is being moved upwards by the inflation rate and the rate of growth in petrol prices has been 30 per cent in the last couple of months whereas the rate of inflation in this country is around three per cent. No-one explains that. An inquiry is necessary to get to the bottom of who is telling the truth there. Certainly Mr Howard is not, and his explanation to the House of Representatives that you need to index petrol prices in order to pay pensions is a fraudulent misrepresentation of the economic truth of this matter, and any economist will say so. Why don't we have an inquiry to look at that?
Why don't we have an inquiry to look at the options? I have said Australian motorists are hurting because of the higher petrol prices, and the government says, `Bad luck. There's nothing we'll do about it.' This is a chamber of a federal parliament with national responsibilities, and we are elected here to have other ideas from the government. Why don't we look at it? Why don't we examine the options? Why are the Democrats voting with the government to prevent the Labor Party from having an independent, dinky-di, fair dinkum look at who is telling the truth here and what the options are for relief by a committee drawn from this chamber which would have the Democrats on it, the government on it and us on it? The anger out there in ordinary Australia is an anger because they are unnecessarily paying higher prices. They are not convinced by the argument that the government does not intend to do anything about it, but they do want to hear from their parliamentary representatives about what the alternatives are. An inquiry can properly produce carefully considered options for government action and recommend them.
Why are the Democrats preventing us from doing that? We know why the government are—because they just line up behind their leader, although in their own caucus room backbenchers are speaking out and objecting to what the Prime Minister is saying, and they are demanding all sorts of changes. Does the government not want an inquiry because government backbenchers who are speaking out might find a forum where their voices might be heard? Here is a fundamental question of Australian democracy. There is no doubt people want something done and there is no doubt the government and the Democrats are now obstructing a logical and reasonable course of action for the alternatives to be carefully presented to the Australian community.
This is a sloppy motion. This is a desperate motion to change the issue and get away from the real issues. This motion is beside the point. It is a cover-up in order to avoid the issues. Our objection to it is: let us do what Australians want and have a proper inquiry. This motion is extremely odd when taking into account what Senator Lees said and what the Prime Minister said to her at the time both the government and the Australian Democrats agreed that Australians would have to suffer under a GST. Back then, you will remember the press conferences, the Prime Minister and Meg Lees in bed together, waving around this package of so-called changes that are `good for you'. What were those changes? The Prime Minister, in his letter of 28 May 1999 to Senator Meg Lees, said that there would be measures in that package on greenhouse gas abatement programs and on greenhouse of national environmental significance. He also said that there would be incentives to switch to lower sulfur diesels and that there would be a program to bring forward the introduction of new petrol vehicle and fuel standards. He said that there would be a program to maintain the current price relativities between diesel, CNG and other alternative transport fuels and that clean fuel credits would be given. He said that there would be a subsidy program for conversion for CNG vehicles, LPG vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, et cetera. He said that there would be 100 per cent excise credit for rail transport and oil cycling infrastructure. They are all things that we thought had some purpose. We did not want a GST, but at least those things had some purpose. 
If you look at the terms of reference of the inquiry that the Democrats have put in this chamber, you will see that they want to inquire into exactly those things. It raises the question: did they get the deal they thought they got? Are they now the disgruntled suitors who have been left at the church unable to get the package up, and do they want an inquiry to get their deal back again? Is this what this is about? You had one bite of the cherry back in May last year when you foisted a GST on us. Now you want to avoid a proper inquiry into petrol prices in order to inquire into the issues you tried to get John Howard to agree to but he sold you out back then. That is not the purpose of this debate. Petrol prices are too high, the government is making a significant rake-off, and there is one central, simple question: what is the government going to do about it? For us in this chamber facing our parliamentary responsibilities, what can we do to give voice to the public opposition to petrol price increases and ensure that the government hands back some of this windfall gain to Australian motorists?
Last night I had the chance to participate in a state-wide current affairs program on the ABC in Western Australia. Let me run through, lest this chamber is in any doubt, what the anger is like out there in the Australian community. From the farmers organisation in Western Australia, Collin Nicholls said, `Farmers are facing a 40 per cent increase in their budget and, because their markets are determined by world commodity prices, they can't pass it on.' The farmers are angry. The WA Transport Association said, `Petrol prices reflect in every good or commodity we buy that is on the supermarket shelf. Not only are high prices hurting our members, but they are hurting Australian consumers as well.' The Transport Workers Union said, `Our members, who are owner/drivers, are going out of business but can't sell their rigs because petrol prices are too high but the contract prices have not risen to offset them.' The Premier of Western Australia said in this hook-up that he wants the federal government to freeze the excise.
The RAC in Western Australia said, `The real cost of the government's rake-off is $660 million.' The ACCI said, `There is a need for an inquiry to look at options on road funding.' The independent fuel outlet said that they were not making a profit. Shell Oil said that it was not. But Larry Graham, the Independent member for the Pilbara, pointed out that Shell had boasted a 14 per cent increase in earnings internationally and 150 per cent increase in total profits. The Motor Traders Association of Western Australia is holding a public rally to protest. And what does this chamber do? Let's look at alternative fuels. Let's not answer any of that white-hot anger in the electorate. It is about time that we got real in here. We are answerable to the people of Australia. They are angry. They want something done. It is our obligation to have a proper inquiry, not an ersatz, flimsy, failed cover-up like this will be, in which the government, as one of the conspiring parties in the GST, and the Democrats, as the other conspiring party in the GST, use their numbers in this chamber to block proper debate, proper accountability, proper examination and the proper formation of resolutions to the problem.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-08-29,"—We have just been treated to what can only be described as a Senator Peter Cook rant for 20 minutes. Listeners to this broadcast would have been interested to tune in and wonder what the Labor Party were going to do about the high level of oil prices which we all deplore. 
—You just voted down our proposal. 
—Senator Cook, again you have worked yourself up into a lather. At the end of the day, you have to come out with some policies. You have to say what you are going to do. Senator Peter Cook has drawn attention to the high level of oil prices which we all know about, which we all deplore and which affects all countries, including Australia. I think we are all concerned about the impact of those high oil prices. What was Senator Cook's solution to them in his remarks? Senator Cook complained about the GST. The Labor Party now supports the GST. The GST now forms part of the Labor Party's policy.
—No, it does not.
—Yes, it does. I will mention the R word, seeing that I am being provoked. You did say that there would be a roll-back. What sort of roll-back, Senator Cook? Let us say that you had a 50 per cent roll-back, at a minimum. At a minimum, the Labor Party have a GST plus a 50 per cent roll-back. What would that cost revenue? That would cost revenue $12 billion. The fact of the matter is the Labor Party have stopped speaking the R word because they know that every time they speak it their vote goes further down. My first point is this: we are all concerned about the high level of oil prices. We recognise that the high level is a result of trends on world markets. This government have made their views known in the appropriate fora about our concern and about the adverse impact these prices can have. The Labor Party's solution is to blame taxes. The Labor Party solution claims that in fact the current level of oil prices is due to taxation.
—It is in part.
—Let us take the interjection from Senator Mackay—in part. If that is the case—and I do not accept that—what is the Labor Party's solution? Is the Labor Party's solution to cut the level of taxes on fuel? Senator Mackay is going to speak, and I suggest that we all listen very carefully to see whether Senator Mackay can outline which taxes she proposes to cut. Senator Cook has complained about the GST, but the GST is Senator Cook's party policy.
—No, it is not. Tell the truth.
—Senator, all I am saying is, if you feel there is an effect which you do not like, what is your policy on it? Is this part of the roll-back? The Labor Party's policy is to have a GST and a roll-back. Senator Cook, you have been complaining in your remarks about the goods and services tax. We are going to listen to Senator Mackay, and the question is whether she takes up your complaint and whether this is a part of the Labor Party roll-back. It is a fair question. The Labor Party has complained about the level of fuel excise. So the question is: is the Labor Party going to cut the level of fuel excise? It is a fair question because you have got yourself into the same mix-up that you got yourself into during the GST debate. Remember you were so opposed to the GST and you fought it tooth and nail for 1½ years, but come 1 July the GST is a part of your policy. As the Treasurer has so often said, `The Labor Party says the GST is so bad but it proposes to keep it.' What happened at the polls? All of this effort to leverage the polls collapsed. You were revealed as being a total fraud. The Labor Party was revealed as being totally fraudulent. The public asked, `How can the Labor Party be opposing the GST when at the same time it is a part of its policy?'
It is an astonishing thing that we are seeing the same fraud in relation to petrol prices. The Labor Party—again for cheap political motives—are pretending to the public that the high level of prices is due to various taxes. We do not accept that. But if that is the Labor Party position, surely one would expect the Labor Party to have a position on the application of the GST on fuel. Surely the Labor Party would have a position on the excise levels on fuel. Surely the Labor Party would have a position on the indexation of excise. It is not unreasonable to say that. Let me make a prediction: Senator Mackay will stand up and pretend the solution to all of this is yet another review. We have had 40 reviews. 
—So what? None of them have worked.
—I know it is embarrassing for you because the public are perceiving again the total fraudulent approach of the Labor Party. If the Labor Party is trying to blame the government for high prices because of various taxes, what is the Labor Party's position on the excise tax, on the indexation of excise and on the GST? The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party does not have a position on any of those things. What is the Labor Party's position in relation to fuel prices? To have a review. It will hide behind a review because of its total lack of policy, as we have seen in so many areas.
Senator Cook, I think the public will treat you ultimately in relation to this issue with the same contempt that they treated you in relation to the GST debate. I think the public will ask, `What is the Labor Party on about? Why is it impossible for the Labor Party to reach a sensible policy on any issue? The Labor Party's claim that the high price of oil is the government's fault is totally false. What is the Labor Party going to do about it?' The Labor Party wants a 41st review. It is a pathetic position from a pathetic party. The government will not have a bar of it. What did the Labor Party do when it was in office in relation to fuel? Let us just get a few facts on the table. Under the Labor Party, the excise rate rose from 6c per litre to 34c per litre. That was Labor Party policy while it was in office—to raise excise. I make the point: the excise rate rose from 6c per litre to over 34c per litre.
—The barrel price is $15, not $30.
—Senator Cook, you do not even understand what you are yelling out about. You raised the excise from 6c per litre to 34c per litre, and you are not proposing to change the excise rate at all. If I am wrong, Senator Mackay will be speaking after me and she can correct this.
—You are wrong.
—Fascinating! If Senator Mackay says that the Labor Party proposes to change the excise rate on fuel, that will be of considerable public interest, Senator. It will cost a few dollars—let me make that point—but it will be of great interest. When Labor were in office, not only did they raise the excise on fuel very substantially—almost sixfold—but they also brought in indexation of excise in 1983. That was Labor Party policy. That was the Labor Party policy when the inflation rate was rising in the order of over five per cent per year during the Labor term in office—far more than the current rate—
—But that was your policy, Senator. I point out that the Labor party did have policies on fuel. Those policies were to raise taxes on fuel and excises. That is exactly what they did. That was the Labor Party position. So the Senate naturally treated the Labor Party proposal with contempt. The Labor Party should come out and say what their policy is on fuel—and not a review! How long have you been in opposition? Can you have a major policy on some issue of public importance? Is it possible for that party over there—that discredited party, whose front benches are laden down with former Keating ministers—to reach a policy position in any particular area?
—You have raised the issue constantly in question time about the price of fuel. Surely the Labor Party can have a position—and not just yet another review. Let me make it clear: the government is very concerned about the level of petrol prices, and the GST is not the reason for the high level of petrol prices. In fact, the excise was reduced by 6.7c a litre. I think that is the first time the excise on fuel has ever been reduced; and it came down under this government. The petroleum refining industries expected to achieve savings of some 1.5c per litre. The GST has not contributed to the rise. In fact, the rise in fuel prices has come about because of the rise in oil prices on world markets. The cost of a barrel of oil—let me make this clear—has risen from some $A17 a barrel in January 1999 to around $A55 a barrel in late August this year. So there has been a very substantial rise on international markets in the price of petrol. 
Let me say that we are concerned, as I think all Australians are, at the high prices of fuel. But let me also point out that, under the former government—Senator Mackay, you may not know this—the real price of petrol in current dollars rose to over 100c per litre in Sydney in 1985. This has happened before.
—What are you going to do about it? Nothing.
—First of all, you analyse what the real cause is; and the real cause is the rise in fuel prices on world markets. The government, along with other countries is making its views known to OPEC on the—
—The higher the cost, the bigger the tax.
—Can I make the point that what we are doing is making our views known, along with other countries, in the international fora that can have some impact. What is the Labor Party going to do about it? Senator Mackay, we will wait breathlessly for your speech, to see what in fact you propose to do. Your thesis is that this is due to taxes. You are wrong, but that is your thesis. 
—In part.
—Well, let's say `in part due to taxes': this is your thesis. So what are you doing in relation to taxes? You are doing nothing in relation to taxes. This is the humbug of the Labor Party. It is another totally fraudulent position. The first fraud that the Labor Party inflicted on the Australian public is that it was opposed to the GST—but it now forms part of its policy. The next fraud the Labor Party is on about is that somehow the high prices of fuel are due to taxes. So what is the Labor Party going to do about it? It is not going to change anything. It is a total humbug, a total fraud.
—You defeated our motion. Wake up!
—No, sorry; you are going to do one thing about it. You are going to have another review. The first 40 reviews apparently did not solve the Senator Cook problem, so we are going to have yet another review, and that is no excuse. For a change, why doesn't the Labor Party attempt to develop a policy on an issue of public importance?
—You couldn't care less!
—`They could not care less,' says Senator Mackay.
—You couldn't care less about regional Australia!
—Well, I think the public would be very interested to know, Senator Mackay, that you could not care less. But we do care, Senator Mackay. What governments do is tackle the real issues and the real causes and do not attempt to grandstand like the Labor Party has attempted to grandstand today. But again, we will listen to Senator Mackay. Okay; Senator Mackay says that the high price of petrol is `in part'—as she says now; the Labor Party's position has changed a little bit from Senator Cook—
—No, it hasn't! It has been exactly the same.
—We have always said that.
—Well, if it is `in part due to taxes', what is the Labor Party position on those taxes?
—We oppose the GST—remember?
—Hold on! This is part of the roll-back. The question is: what is the Labor Party position on those taxes? Let me make a prediction to this chamber. Senator Mackay will not make one comment on that. There will be no comment on the roll-back of the GST on fuel. There will be no comment about cutting the excise on fuel. There will be no comment on the indexation of excise on fuel. There will be no comment on any of those three areas, Senator Mackay. There will be not one comment, and the public will be entitled to think that the Labor Party is a total humbug on this issue, a total fraud—which you were in relation to the GST and which you are now on petrol prices. 
As my remarks in this debate are now coming to an end, let me say that we will not be supporting the motion proposed by the Democrats. We feel that we agree with the first position of Senator Meg Lees in relation to an inquiry, and I have made my views known. Let me conclude my remarks by just reading a comment that was made by the Prime Minister in the other place yesterday. It is worth repeating in this chamber. These are the Prime Minister's comments:
I say very plainly to the Australian people that I do not like higher fuel prices and that I understand how sensitive the Australian people are to them. But these higher prices have been due overwhelmingly to world factors. Can I say to those who sit opposite, and to people anywhere else in the Australian community who are calling for a discretionary reduction in excise, that they are really saying that either you run down the surplus and thereby put upward pressure on interest rates or you cut payments for schools, for roads, for health and for all the other vital things that the government provides. The government will not be responding to those irresponsible calls. They are not based on fact. They seek, rather, to exploit understandable public concern about the price of petrol. 
The Prime Minister concluded his remarks thus:
I say again to the Australian public that I share its concern, but the culprits lie amongst the oil producing countries of the world; they do not lie on the front bench of the government.
The government is, as always, taking a very responsible approach to this important public issue. I suspect that when we listen to the views of Senator Mackay on behalf of the Labor Party we will find them as vacuous as the Labor Party can be on so many other issues of public importance. In the end—let me make a prediction—Senator Mackay will say nothing about cutting GST, nothing about cutting excise, nothing about dealing with what she sees as the indexation issues. What Senator Mackay will be saying is `Gosh! What we need is the 41st review on petrol!'",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-08-29,"—What we heard from the ALP was, indeed, a diatribe. Senator Cook excelled himself. It is not often that I agree with Senator Kemp, but I do in this case: we have heard a load of humbug. In fact, Senator Kemp, I need to correct you: it would be the 49th inquiry into fuel prices per se. The ALP say they want a properly constituted Senate inquiry. Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you and to the ALP: Senator Cook has obviously not read the terms of reference. Of course this is a properly constituted Senate inquiry. The fact that it goes to more than the question of `How can we bash up the government and the Democrats over the GST?' obviously does not suit the ALP. They want an inquiry where they can run around the country, speaking the same message over and over again: this is terrible, and it is all to do with the GST—and we know that that is not the case. In fact, it is quite a nonsense.
I was absolutely amazed and floored to hear Senator Cook say, `We don't want all this extraneous material from the Democrats in the terms of reference—this business of alternative fuels.' He actually said that Australians do not want to wait for the next century, another century, for alternative fuels. I think that indicates where the ALP are coming from. This is where their real credentials are on the environment. This is how much they care for greenhouse gas emissions. This is how much they care for pollution. This is how much they really care about the cost and fuel efficiency of the vehicles we run in this country.
I would remind the ALP that they left office with emission standards in this country five years behind those of other industrialised countries around the world. If we are going to start talking about the tax arrangements and the great benefits that the Democrats have managed to achieve through that tax package, then I will remind the ALP about the mess they left behind and the sort of pollution we suffer as a result of allowing our fleet to become very old, polluting, dirty and disgraceful.
Senator Kemp says, `We want to look at what has happened to the cash and whether the petrol companies have, in fact, pocketed that money.' Let me just carefully read through the term of reference which would allow us to examine that. It is reference (c)—and it is a pity that Senator Cook is not here as he could be listening to this. Reference (c) states: 
... the extent to which petrol companies will be able to pass on the 1.5c a litre savings from tax reform and over what time frame ...
Senator Cook says that what he wants is to look at the options for relief. Let me go to the very first term of reference, reference (a), which states:
... alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of petrol price rise on households.
It is plain enough to me that this allows us to look at options. That is what Senator Kemp says he is interested in: looking at options for relief. He wants a dinky-di inquiry. That seems to be pretty dinky-di to me. It is going to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry. That committee is not dominated by the government. The problem is that the ALP do not chair that committee, it is chaired by the Democrats—and that is obviously a major problem for the ALP. So we cannot have a dinky-di inquiry obviously if it is not under the control of the ALP.
Let us look at something else that Senator Kemp said we desperately need to inquire into: the windfall. The terms of reference again deal with this question of the windfall, and I will read them out. Term of reference (b) states:
... the amount of windfall tax revenues over and above that forecast in the 2000-2001 budget that the Commonwealth and states are likely to receive as a result of the rise in world petrol prices.
What more could you be wanting? The word `windfall' is there; it is actually in the terms of reference already. Senator Cook would have us believe that this is some nonsensical inquiry that is being put up by the Democrats that does not address the issues that people are interested in. He passes it off as some silly notion—`The Democrats are again getting carried away with alternative fuels; we all know that's airy fairy stuff.' Certainly the ALP's record, in this place at least, has shown that they are not much interested in that whole question.
There are some other important parts of this inquiry that I will spell out again because, obviously, Senator Cook did not read this effectively. Term of reference (d) states:
... whether the subsidy scheme for regional motorists is adequate and working effectively ...
so that the city-country petrol price differential is not increased. And:
... what alternative strategies can be implemented to reduce the cost of rural and regional transport.
Term of reference (e) is whether:
... oil companies and retailers have used the opportunity presented by higher petrol prices to increase their retail and wholesale margins.
So these terms of reference go to the core of the problem. But, instead of that, the ALP just wants an opportunity to bash the GST in the normal fashion.
I really want to talk in this debate today about the opportunities for us to look at alternative fuels, because the Democrats happen to think that that is important and that it is the way forward. As I said earlier in taking note of an answer and as I said in my question today to Senator Ellison, there are enormous opportunities for us to cut the fuel consumption of individual vehicles by 50 per cent. The average motorist spends $2,500 or thereabouts a year on petrol for their vehicle. The opportunities just to shift to LPG using the Ford Falcon dedicated LPG vehicle are 50 per cent. Over the last few weeks, we have been talking about minor increases. Of course, it means a lot of money to those people who travel long distances, but let us get real about this. The real opportunities are for us to reduce those imposts and reduce the cost to motorists by 50 per cent. What we need to examine in this place is what sort of leadership governments can show in order to deliver on those cost reductions.
Let us look at something we can actually have some control over. We do not have control over the OPEC nations. We cannot determine what the cost of a barrel of oil will be when it comes into this country. These are not measures which we can do a great deal about. Certainly reducing the one point whatever it is cents per litre that might be attributable to the GST in petrol is not going to make much difference to the hip pockets of ordinary Australians. But if you take $2,500 and reduce that by half then we are talking big money. 
It is not just LPG that offers those advantages. CNG is a very important fuel, and it is important because it is not tied to petroleum prices. It is important because it is an indigenous fuel. It comes out of the ground in Australia. It is pumped around our country. It can be tapped for transport purposes. All we need is the infrastructure to put it in place. We need the refuelling depots. We need to make sure of that before we ask Australians to commit to switching over to this new fuel, which is cost effective and extremely good for reducing emissions, both pollution and greenhouse gases. It would be extremely good if we turned our minds in this country to how we can encourage those fuels.
—Why didn't you get the government to agree to this in the negotiations?
—Senator Conroy interrupts, as he usually does, and points out that there were opportunities during the tax debate, and the Democrats indeed took those opportunities. We will have buses and trucks converted to compressed natural gas. In fact, there is $75 million for that measure alone. But more needs to be done.
—Why didn't you get a better deal?
—It would have been very good, Senator Conroy, to have achieved everything, but we are now asking you, the ALP, to help us to achieve what needs to be done at this point. But you are not interested. For you, this is of no concern. You just want business as usual. Senator Cook says, `In the next century we will think about alternative fuels.' You say, `There's no need for us to bother with that now. Let's just take the populist line. Let's just tap into people's concerns about increased fuel prices, not worry about the future and not worry for the next century about the fact that we have alternative fuels in this country that we could tap into tomorrow.' It needs leadership; it needs government action. Let us look at how we can do that with this inquiry. But, no, the ALP is not interested.
Let us have a look at some of the recent statements put out by CSIRO. This is topical today—we had a rally outside today by the very good scientists from CSIRO. Let me just mention a couple of things that were said in a recent press release. It stated:
Australia may need to cut greenhouse emissions by 50 to 85 per cent of today's level, to meet its long-term obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, two senior CSIRO scientists said today.
That is certainly consistent with the messages that have been coming to the global warming inquiry: that the Kyoto protocol is only the very first step and that we have to take drastic and serious measures. That means not continuing business as usual for the next century. The CSIRO suggest a couple of strategies. They suggest four altogether that would work to help us curb our greenhouse emissions. The first is:
... to obtain more energy from less fuel across the whole fossil fuel energy cycle, from production through to power generation
The third is:
... to gradually switch to low-carbon or carbon-free sources of energy, like hydrogen and renewables
That is what we need to examine. In the transport sector, which uses so much of our energy in this country and is such a big contributor to greenhouse, how can we look at alternative fuels which will assist us to do that and reduce the cost?
—Why didn't you get the government to set up an inquiry when you could?
—You might learn something, Senator Conroy, if you listen. The Australian Greenhouse Office says:
The Australian transport sector accounts for 72 million tonnes of Australia's total net greenhouse gas emissions, representing just over 17 per cent of Australia's total emissions. About 87 per cent of these emissions come from road transport, including cars, trucks and buses. 
Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector are also the fastest growing emissions of any sector, rising by 18 per cent from 1990 to 1997. The Bureau of Transport Economics projects that, without reduction measures, emissions from the transport sector will rise by 38 per cent between 1990 and 2010. 
That is what we want to see dealt with. The Democrats are interested in solving the problem of greenhouse gas emissions in this country. We can do this by changing to alternative fuels and by weaning ourselves off the total dependence that we have on fossil fuels. Remember—and Senator Cook should note this—they are not going to last for another 100 years. We are running out of oil reserves in this world, and Australia just cannot keep consuming petrol, diesel and petroleum products at the same level that we currently are. It is absolutely critical that we start looking at alternative ways forward.
It is disappointing that the government has chosen not to support our terms of reference. I would have thought the government would be well informed by the sort of inquiry this might turn up. The ALP does not want any sort of inquiry at all—unless it can simply attack the GST; that is all it is interested in. There are fantastic opportunities for us to achieve great savings, both in greenhouse emissions and in cost. I will mention a couple of hybrid petrol and electric engines which are currently either in production or available elsewhere. We can look to the United States now, we can look to Europe and we can look to various parts of the world that have governments that are prepared to put in place regulatory arrangements which encourage the use of those vehicles.
The Honda Insight has an ultralight one-litre lean burn VTEC engine that works in tandem with a brushless DC electric motor. It achieved world low consumption figures of 3.85 litres per 100 kilometres and a highway rating of 3.36 litres per 100 kilometres. It conserves fuel with an automatic idle stop system. It has a highly rigid and ultrasafe body that is around 40 per cent lighter than an equivalent steel body. Is it available in Australia? No. Will it be available in Australia? Probably not. It is available in the US, it is available in Europe and it is available in Japan. No doubt it could be imported into Australia, but it would cost a great deal of money to do so. Ford's Think City was on display here at the Melbourne International Motor Show. It is a zero emission two-seater powered by a liquid cooled three-phase alternating current induction motor. It accelerates from zero to 50 kilometres per hour in seven seconds, and it has a top speed of 90 kilometres per hour. It plugs directly into any standard 220-volt 16-amp or 10-amp outlet for recharging. That will be available in the US in the next two years, but there are no plans to have it available in Australia.
The Toyota Prius is another hybrid vehicle. It uses half the petrol and emits only half the carbon dioxide on a typical city drive cycle. It is powered by an electric motor, power for which is supplied by a 288-volt battery pack and a fuel efficient twin cam multivalve petrol motor. It has a Corolla sized exterior dimension and a 1992 Camry sized interior. Toyota—and I congratulate them on doing this—have brought seven production models of the Prius to Australia for evaluation. I have driven in one. It is a very quiet vehicle and a very pleasant vehicle to travel in. But there are no plans to go into production in Australia. Again, we have to ask ourselves why. What is it in this country that has not been able to encourage any of our car manufacturers, apart from Ford with LPG, to get these vehicles into production, on the road and available to motorists in this country so that we can save on fuel costs, so that we do not need to worry about OPEC and so that we do not need to be concerned so much about greenhouse emissions and pollution?
I have just mentioned a few of the many innovations available to reduce fuel costs, to reduce emissions and to reduce greenhouse gases in this country. We need to look at why Australia has not been able to get these vehicles onto our roads, why we in Australia still have very large cars and why other countries—like Japan—have chosen to impose variable registrations, for instance, to encourage people to update their vehicles so that they run cleaner and more fuel efficient cars on the road. The UK has recently announced a grant scheme of £1,000 for people who purchase electric vehicles. There are schemes of this sort all around the world in places where we really do care about the burning of fossil fuels, places where the reality of energy security and the reality of air pollution are real. Australia can learn much from the examples of those overseas countries. This inquiry would have been a good opportunity to look to the future in this country instead of to the past, to look beyond the last few months and what has been agreed in tax arrangements and to go into the next century that Senator Cook talks about—not with one's head in the sand, not imagining that we can go on doing the same thing, but looking at a real future for transport in this country that is much more cost effective than the ALP has been able to deliver to us so far.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-08-29,"—I was interested in Senator Allison's contribution in relation to allegations that the Labor Party are running a populist line. I think that is true. If you go to regional Australia to talk about this issue and to see what is happening in regional Australia, there is major concern among the populace. There is major concern among the people who are being, and who will be, impacted by petrol prices. Isn't it peculiar that these Democrat terms of reference arose only very recently? After the Labor Party had mooted an inquiry for some time, all of a sudden the Democrats came up with this. The Democrats are entitled to accuse us of being cynical, but at least our suggestion of an inquiry was out there for a considerable time.
I also note with some interest that the person who would be chairing this inquiry if the government were prepared to support it, Senator Woodley, is not here. Senator Woodley knows, probably more than anybody in the Democrats, the difficulties faced in his home state of Queensland and in regional Australia. I would obviously be interested to hear his views, but not everybody can speak. But one thing I have always respected about the Democrats—and I mean this most sincerely—is their absolute, unwavering commitment to accountability and transparency. Even when it has been extremely uncomfortable for the Labor Party, the Democrats have been supportive of that. Even when it has been to our detriment and we have not wanted it, the Democrats have insisted on accountability and transparency. I congratulate people like Senator Murray for his work on commercial-in-confidence. But the problem is that, when you are actually part of the decision, you have got to be held accountable for that decision. This is the difficulty, and this is why the Democrats are not prepared to support this.
We had an unbelievably undignified and ungracious response from Senator Kemp, who clearly had not done any preparation at all on this absolutely critical issue. If I were a person out in country Australia listening to that contribution, I would just be astounded at the lack of compassion that he showed to people in regional Australia who are genuinely suffering. This is not a game; this is serious. If you go out to regional Australia—and a lot of us do—and talk to people about how they are currently suffering in relation to petrol, if you look at the conditions that people are living under and the way the GST has impacted on regional Australians, and if you go to my home state and Senator Brown's home state of Tasmania and have a look at what is a regional microcosm of how the GST has impacted, it is extremely illuminating. 
I noted, with some interest, that Mr Peter Costello—it was in the newspaper clips recently—has spent the grand total of 10 days in regional Australia from 1996 to the end of 1999. I wonder why that would be? I wonder why Peter Costello would not want to go to regional Australia? I can tell you; I am out there all the time. If I were Peter Costello, I would not want to go either because he would not get out of there alive, given the initiatives this government has taken in relation to regional Australia. There are people in this chamber who know it, and there are people on the back bench of this government who know it. You know it—why aren't you doing something about it? This government is in office, so you have got the capacity to actually do something. The GST is this government's tax; it is not the Labor Party's tax. You are sitting around complicit, blaming the oil sheikhs, as Senator Cook said, and doing absolutely nothing. I think it is a total disgrace. As somebody who actually lives in regional Australia, I think it is outrageous that Senator Kemp gave it that sort of perfunctory treatment and clearly put no preparation whatsoever into his speech. 
Senator Cook moved a motion which would have allowed us to explore all these options, the alternatives that Senator Kemp talked about in what I thought was his fairly tawdry response. Senator Greig has yet to have this delightful experience—she says with heavy sarcasm—but the Democrats should try to come to the regional services estimates and try and get some answers and some genuine transparency from the government about what is going on in regional Australia. Try and get some answers out of the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Ian Macdonald, about what is happening in regional Australia. You will get none. They are not doing anything. That is the point. The government are doing absolutely nothing. 
Senator Woodley knows this because he sat there and listened to the absolute obfuscation from this minister for hours and hours as he simply stonewalled the questions. The Labor Party does not care too much about Senator Macdonald stonewalling questions, but I think, as a government minister, he should have a bit of a go at defending his own government in regional Australia. We asked a number of times whether there had been any impact—or would be, prospectively, any study of the impact—on regional Australia from the GST. Not only has there not been a study; there was never planned to be one and nor will there be one. I find it extraordinary that, when you have a tax that is clearly going to impact on one section of the community disproportionately, the government are not even prepared to have a look at it prior to its implementation. I find that unbelievable. We asked about the implications of the national competition policy—nothing. We asked about the implications of various budget cuts—nothing. They denied they even existed. It is just a joke, it really is. One thing people in regional Australia are not is stupid. They are not stupid, and they are not going to buy this.
The bottom line is this: regional Australians pay a lot more for everything. They pay a lot more for clothes, they pay a lot more for transport, they pay a lot more for food, they pay a lot more for health and education services—such as they are these days, courtesy of this government—and now they pay a lot more for petrol. The Labor Party are not asserting that the GST is the reason for the massive increase in petrol prices. We are asserting that the GST is in part a contributor to it. That is what we are saying the government should look at. We want to look at the commitment John Howard gave that prices would be substantially lower, and we want to have a look at some remedial strategies. We cannot do that now. Way back in the dim, dark days when John Howard actually made it out to regional Australia, with his hat on, he made a statement which has become famous as the Nyngan declaration. He said that every time there was a cut in regional Australia a red light would be flashing. The red light has basically been on high beam, especially in relation to this one, because people in regional Australia are paying more.
Let us look at some genuine empirical examples of what is happening in relation to petrol in regional Australia—in places I have recently been to—comparing pre-GST prices with the amount of increase contributed by the GST. Many of these regional cities are also areas of high unemployment, in fact, some of the areas of highest unemployment in Australia—cities like Bundaberg, for example, where I was last week. In the March quarter small area labour market figures, unemployment in Bundaberg was 14.4 per cent—so much for the growth economy in Bundaberg. Petrol prices in Bundaberg pre GST were 81.5c a litre and have now risen to 89.9c a litre. The GST component of that by our calculations is 2.14c. So in a place with one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia petrol prices are increasing exponentially, and the GST is a contributor to that. It is not the only place. Very similar figures can be found in nearby towns, and I am going to go through them because I think it is important to have this information on the record.
Let us look at Gladstone: pre GST, 87.5; August—now—91.6; GST, 2.29c. That is our calculation. If we are wrong, I invite the government or the Democrats to correct us. That is our calculation based on the formula that everybody else seems to be using—except the government, which is in major denial. What is the unemployment rate in Gladstone? It is 10.4 per cent—double-digit. So big petrol hikes and a major impact as a result of the GST. Why doesn't the government just come out and say that what it wants to do is basically kick regional Australia while it is down? Let us look next at Rockhampton: pre GST, 82.5; August, 96.9; GST impact, 2.78c—or close to 3c, which everyone seems to be accepting; unemployment rate, 11.8 per cent. Turning to Townsville, I noticed that the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government did a pretty good job today of defending the higher diesel prices in his home state or home base of Townsville. This is the regional services minister defending the higher prices of that product where he is based. Looking then at Townsville: pre GST, 80; today, 92.9; GST on our calculations, 2.4c; unemployment rate, 14 per cent. 
Let us look at Queanbeyan, which is not very far from where we are: pre GST, 84.9; now, 97.7; GST, 2.85c—close to 3c; unemployment, 8.4 per cent. That is better, but still above the national average. They are the figures for Queanbeyan—a stone's throw from here. Turning next to Grafton in regional New South Wales: pre GST, 88.9; now up to 96; GST in our estimation is about 2.7c—so that is 3c. This is now—of course, because of the nature of the GST, this will go up. Unemployment in Grafton is running at 10 per cent. Looking now at Lismore: 87.9 pre GST; now, 95.9; GST component on our calculations, 2.67c; unemployment rate, 11.5 per cent. How on earth are these people going to be able to afford to drive to actually get to jobs? Turning finally to Ballarat: 79.9 pre GST; now, 93.3; GST component on our calculations, 2.45c; unemployment rate, 10.4 per cent.
These towns that have been impacted by the GST are the very same towns that are paying more for everything else in relation to the GST. The GST is a flat percentage rate of tax—the higher the original price, as Senator Cook explained to everybody, the more tax you pay. That is axiomatic and that is a fact. Not only that, but the higher prices go, the more GST you will pay. Some of these regional centres are coping with record unemployment levels in a so-called boom economy and now they are being hit with record price increases. I do not want to be alarmist, and I will say it again: we are not asserting that the GST is wholly and solely the cause in relation to petrol prices; we are saying that it is a part of it. We are saying this is additional revenue the government did not expect and we are saying that it is going to increase because of the nature of the GST. Anybody would agree with that, except for the government, which simply denies that it is happening.
This is the inevitable outcome, in terms of petrol and regional Australia, of what is an intrinsically inequitable tax. This is what happens when you apply a flat percentage tax indiscriminately. Today the Victorian Road Transport Association commented on the impact of similar increases in the price of diesel fuel. In many regional areas diesel is now more than a dollar a litre. This represents an increase of 34c since the government set the level of its diesel fuel rebate at 24c a litre. This means, as we said in question time today, that regional Australians are at least 10c a litre worse off, so bang goes your diesel fuel rebate. The Victorian Road Transport Association said:
... nothing moves without a truck, and that cost will flow to the community.
That is absolutely correct, and that is what is happening out there. According to them, about 5c a kilometre has been added to transport costs, which will translate into supermarket price rises of about 2.5c. This is on top of the GST—on top of prices in the supermarket that have already risen as a result of the GST. Fuel prices, as we know, are going to go up because of what is happening in the global situation, and nobody disagrees with that. The government are continuing to deny reality, but they are also ignoring their own backbenchers. I suppose why wouldn't you really, when you look at how successful they have been in lobbying the government in relation to regional Australia.
Earlier this year on ABC radio the Prime Minister said—and I was amazed when we found this quote when we were undertaking research for this contribution: 
... one of the distinguishing features of the tax package is that it is going to result in sharply lower fuel prices than would otherwise be the case in rural and regional Australia.
So on the ABC he was not even asserting that it would be a zero-sum gain; he was saying that prices were going to be sharply lower. Extraordinarily, Senator Kemp came into the chamber during question time yesterday and said that, after the GST was applied, petrol prices had fallen. Senator Conroy is from Melbourne, and even in the middle of Melbourne, surely, petrol prices have gone up. I think one of the backbenchers today from the coalition made it extremely clear that the differential is increasing, but of course now urban Australians are being pinged too. This is an extraordinary statement from the Prime Minister coming on top of his comment that `the GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist'. I am not quite sure who he defines as `the ordinary motorist'—maybe it is the politicians who drive Comcars, I do not know. But certainly the ordinary motorist is doing really badly and not doing really well.
Let us have a look at some of the backbenchers who have complained. Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert—whose main city is Townsville—has written to Peter Costello about the harsh conditions being imposed on the people in his electorate under the government's policies. Good, you write a letter—that is going to get some action, I do not think. He has also expressed his concern about the impact of future inflationary increases on the price of petrol. We have not even seen that yet—that is, the inflationary aspects of the GST. But we have already seen petrol prices increase by approximately—maybe more, maybe less—3c a litre because of the GST; additional revenue this government had not counted on that is going to increase exponentially. Peter Lindsay has called on the government to freeze the inflation-linked increase in excise because of the rising prices. That has been ruled out by John Howard, the Prime Minister.
Paul Neville, the member for Hinkler—who I have to say was ardently pursued by the media in relation to this last week and was completely missing in action; Hinkler covers the cities of Bundaberg and Glad-stone—has, with other coalition back-benchers, called for a look at the reallocation to roads of the revenue raised by the GST from petrol. Just think about this for a minute: what he is saying is, `Let's put some more money from the petrol excise into roads.' What is the point of having roads if you cannot afford to drive on them? What is the point of having new roads if you cannot afford the petrol to put in your car? One of the things that is happening in my home state of Tasmania today is that people cannot afford to buy their fuel and are stealing petrol. There is a major problem in Tasmania of people actually stealing petrol. That is the nature of the Tasmanian economy when you have an increase in this sort of thing.
Some of the people in this chamber ought to wake up and go out into regional Australia and have a look at what is actually happening. It is an absolute disgrace. The National Party, particularly, should be ashamed, in that they purport to represent the regional Australians. That is what they are supposed to be here for. It is absolutely outrageous. We are proposing to have a look at a proper scheme that looks at the issue of the increased revenue from the GST. What is absolutely astounding is that the government is still saying the GST has no impact on petrol prices. That is not right. I reassert what I said in the chamber the other day, that those who assert that the GST has had no impact on petrol prices are lying. Those who make that assertion are lying.
I sat down with a service station operator in Bundaberg, and he went through it with me and explained how it all operated. It is there—in Bundaberg it is about 3c. He went through his books with me. This guy's business is now in jeopardy. He is likely to have to close up as a result of that. He joins the end of a very long queue of regional Australian businesspeople who are having to close up as a result, one way or another, of the application of the goods and services tax. There is no way to really overstate this. I really would invite senators who have not been out to the places that I have talked about to go and talk to these people. Many of us on this side of the chamber travel around regional Australia. Last week I went to Eden-Monaro. I was in McEwen. I was in Hinkler. Obviously, I talked to a lot of people outside those electorates as well. I do not just visit marginal seats, by the way. Those three happen to be marginal. 
—Richmond and Page.
—And Senator George Campbell was in Richmond and Page. People are absolutely furious about what has happened with the GST and petrol. They are not furious because of the hip-pocket nerve, as Senator Greig talked about; they are furious because it is going to impact on their day-to-day lives—in terms of what they can afford, in terms of what they can buy their families and in terms of what they can do in relation to their quality of life.
We have lost the opportunity. We have had this inquiry out there for a long time. It is not being supported. I honestly think—I do not know how Senator Greig would have voted, had he had his time over again—the GST is a disaster for regional Australia. The people of rural and regional Australia do not regard it as funny. They do not regard it as something that should be used as a political football. They just want a quality of life. They just want things fixed so they can have a decent education system, a decent health system and enough money to put some petrol in their cars.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-08-29,"—I was enticed by the contribution of the Democrats to make a contribution on the Democrats' motion. It was very interesting listening to the comments that they made in support of the motion that they have moved here today. I have to remind the Democrats that we find ourselves debating this motion, as we debated the motion that we proposed—for a proper inquiry, I might say—because of the situation that they placed this country in. It was they who took the step to join the government and impose a GST upon the Australian public. There is no doubt about that. They now seek to make all sorts of excuses for the consequences that they have foisted upon the Australian public.
We have pursued this issue on the basis that the government made a promise to the Australian public. They made a very clear promise, both prior to and after the election, that the GST would not increase the price of petrol. In fact, some ministers—one being the Minister for Finance and Administration—said that the price of petrol would go down as a result of the GST. We all acknowledge that world crude oil prices go up and down, and they do impact upon the price of fuel at the retail end. There is no doubt about that. That is not in question. What is in question here is: what has the government done with respect to the tax changes it made and the Democrats supported? That is what is in question. We have consistently had a government saying from the outset, as I said, prior to the election and subsequently, that petrol prices will not increase—in fact some, as I said, said it would decrease—as a result of the GST. We know that is simply not true.
I took steps to ring the Australian Taxation Office yesterday and asked them for some information. I asked them: if we still just had excise on petrol, what would be the current rate of excise today, excluding the GST, in terms of a tax on fuel? It is clear, abundantly clear, that there is a difference in the tax take on fuel today of almost 3c per litre. That is what the government and the Democrats have foisted upon the Australian public. That is a fact. The Treasurer was one of those who said, both prior to and after the election, that the GST would not add anything to the price of fuel, and he has continued to say it. As late as 23 August the Treasurer in an interview with Steve Liebmann on the Today show said:
The GST didn't add anything to the pump price.
I do not know what sort of calculator he has got, but he wants to get it checked because it has got a 3c per litre mistake in it somewhere. That is exactly what the difference is. As a result of the GST, we have got an additional three per cent tax take on petrol at the retail pump end, the end that affects the ordinary motorist and the Australian public. The Democrats' proposition in their motion reads:
(a)		alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of the petrol price rise on households and Australia's reliance on fossil fuels and to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ... 
As was pointed out by Senator Cook, the Democrats entered into an agreement on the GST, and part of that agreement related to an alternative approach. I have not heard the Democrats, in all the time since the introduction of the GST, stand up in here and make any comment about alternative policies or about what sorts of policies they locked the government into to bring about a population less reliant on fossil fuels. There has not been one speech—that is the truth of the matter. I have not heard Senator Greig or anyone else at that end of the chamber get up in here and make a speech in this respect. I heard Senator Allison talk about the ECOmmodore. Of course it is going to happen. But why didn't you lock the government into a stronger commitment to the development of a car like the ECOmmodore? No, we will not find that in any document or agreement between the Democrats and the government on the introduction of the GST—not one iota.
I go to the question of leaded petrol. Back in 1993 there supposedly was a 2c differential between leaded and unleaded fuels. I made a few inquiries recently to check out how things are progressing, because, as I understand it, there is a timetable for the expiration of the use of leaded fuels. My inquiries proved to be very interesting. I come back to the Democrats' position. I know for a fact that in Western Australia you can no longer buy leaded fuel; you can buy non-lead replacement fuel. If it is the case in Western Australia, why isn't it the case in the rest of the country? Where have the Democrats been on that? Why didn't they lock the government into that? If they are so concerned—as they say we are not—about emissions, why didn't they get that sorted out? They did not come in here and make a song and dance about that, because they failed in every effort.
While I am talking about leaded fuel versus non-leaded replacement fuel, who gets to keep the difference in the case of the non-lead replacement fuel now used in cars that would normally run on leaded petrol? The difference, which was only ever intended to be 2c a litre, now is approximately 2½c a litre. I wondered why the government should keep that excise, but the government does not get the excise anymore. The companies keep that money. I suppose they would argue that they keep it because of additional production costs. Where in his motion does Senator Greig deal with any of these issues? Unlike the motion that we put up, which goes to the very heart of the issue confronting the Australian public today, there is nothing in Senator Greig's motion that would give any comfort to the Australian public that the Democrats are genuine about getting to the nub of this issue. They have referred this matter to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, which they chair. Point (b) of the motion reads:
(b)		the amount of windfall tax revenues over and above that forecast in the 2000-01 Budget that the Commonwealth and the states are likely to receive as a result of the rise in world petrol prices;
There are two things about that. One is that excise on fuel is a fixed amount and comes about as a result of CPI increases. The CPI increase has to be greater than one per cent for there to be an increase in the excise on fuel. The only real effect on the Australian motorist as a result of the increase in world oil prices is at the retail end, and that is as a result of the GST.
I listened with some interest to the Prime Minister in the other chamber yesterday when he said, `Well, you've got to establish firstly whether or not there is a windfall.' He said that we—that is, the opposition—`seemed to think that there is a windfall, but in fact there is not a windfall.' He said this was because `our costs are greater'—I think it was by a factor of two to one—`in terms of the pension increases, et cetera.' I have a little bit of difficulty with that because excise on fuel does not increase unless the increase is greater than one per cent. It has increased, since the introduction in 1994, in excess of 24 times. There have been a number of occasions when it has not increased at all. Pensions increased. They increase, as I understand it, with any movement in the CPI—that is a fact. This again is a bit of a fudge on the part of the Prime Minister, supported by the Democrats. It amazes me. Senator Allison is saying that we want a beat-up on the GST. Of course we want a beat-up on the GST. Why wouldn't we? The coalition of Democrats, National Party and Liberals have put in place something which was a con on the Australian public. It has been proven to be a con because they now feel they are caught in a trap. The Democrats are caught in a trap and they are looking for a way out. I have to say that not even this motion will get them out of the trap that they are in. 
The public are not that gullible. They were gullible enough to accept your credentials before but they are not going to be gullible on this occasion. Senator Greig has proceeded to put up a proposition that for all intents and purposes is only aimed at looking at alternative policies. Senator Greig: in terms of your credibility on environmental matters, I would have thought that you would have had all of the alternative policies in your back pocket, that you would have been able to produce them and that you would have been able to argue very reasonably why they should be in place. But we have not heard that at all. If I go to paragraph (c) of this proposition, it states:
	(c)	the extent to which petrol companies will be able to pass on the 1.5 cents a litre savings from tax reform and over what time-frame;
As I understand it, the ACCC is looking at that, and I think they are having some difficulty. I do not want to be disrespectful to any of my colleagues on the rural and regional committee but, as a senator who sits on other committees, we sometimes face great difficulty in actually getting our hands on the facts. We sometimes need the advice of experts with regard to getting some of these matters properly fleshed out. 
Paragraph (d), which is another little gem, states: 
	(d)	whether the subsidy scheme for regional motorists is adequate and is working effectively so that the city/country petrol price differential is not increased ...
But it has already increased. That is another fact. I would say to the Democrats: make a few phone calls and check a few fuel prices. You will soon establish the fact that the gap has widened between the city and country prices. I would suggest that $500 million—if that was the amount of money to go into this scheme—is not sufficient. Why? Because the GST has added almost another 3c a litre to the cost of fuel. 
All of these claims that have been made by the government and the Democrats with regard to the benefits of the GST in respect of fuel—whether it is at the retail end, being sold for general motorists, for the transport industry or for any other aspect of industry—have not come true. The Democrats have to wear it. They have to accept that they locked themselves into a situation with this government who pulled a con on the Australian public. That is what they have to accept. 
First the Democrats came in here and voted down an opposition motion that went to the very heart of what is at question here because they knew that it would confront them and highlight their inadequacies to the Australian public over this issue. They then come in here with this mickey mouse proposal that will achieve absolutely nothing. And that is what they want: another smokescreen. I thought for a minute, when I listened to Senator Kemp, that the government were going to support it. I am still not sure that they are not, because some smokescreen is better than no smokescreen. I know that the government are looking for somewhere to hide and they may well try to hide in this Democrat proposition. That is a reality. 
As we have heard from Senator Lees, and again from Senator Kemp today, there have been numerous inquiries—Senator Kemp said 40; Senator Allison corrected him—and this would be the 49th. Well, the Democrats' one would not be the 49th because that would not be an inquiry at all. But, if you had proposed what we proposed, we would have had the 49th inquiry, which would have been a worthwhile inquiry. So what if we have had 48 others! They were probably very worthwhile inquiries about different aspects of the fuel industry. I have to admit that I have not taken the time to go and check what each of those inquiries actually was about.  
—If you are so interested in petrol prices, you should.
—I take the interjection from Senator Bartlett. I assume he has and I hope that, if he gets up to speak, he will be able to tell us what each and every one of them is about.
In closing, we have a responsibility to ensure that the government delivers on the commitment that it gave to the Australian public. We have to do that because that is what the Prime Minister said he would do on many occasions. He said, `We will deliver on our commitment.' The facts of the matter are that the government and the Democrats are not delivering on commitments on petrol that they made to the Australian public. That is a fact. This proposal, smokescreen that it is, should not be supported. We should get a proper inquiry going to establish some real facts as to the problems associated with the price of fuel. Nobody would disagree that world oil prices are a factor. We have to establish the facts—but we do not have to establish them, because we know the GST has increased the tax take on fuel by at least 3c. We have to look at the revenue take and what capacity there is to give some relief to the Australian public. This motion for a Democrats inquiry will do them no good and should be opposed.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-08-29,"—Just as Senator Murphy was inspired to speak by the Democrats, likewise he has generated some extra enthusiasm for me to clarify this situation for him, because I think it is important to ensure that it is clear. Despite all the protestations from the ALP that this whole exercise is not just another opportunity for them to get onto their bandwagon of bashing the GST, it is quite clear from their contributions—including Senator Murphy's—that that is precisely what it is about. Despite all of the ALP speakers acknowledging that world oil prices are a significant contributor to the increase in petrol prices around Australia, what do we have in their terms of reference? Paragraph (a), GST; paragraph (b), GST; paragraph (c), GST; paragraph (d), GST. That is all they want to focus on for another whole inquiry.
—You voted for it.
—I know everyone wants to relive their youth, relive the golden days and pretend that we are back when we were younger, but the GST is here and we have got to live with it. Sorry, but it is here. Speaking, as I am sure you would know, as one of those Democrats who did not vote for the GST, I came to terms with the fact that it was going to be a fact more than 12 months ago. I would rather live in the present and look to the future. Much as I would like to relive my youth, I am stuck with now and we have to look forward. My reliving my youth is not going to help the Australian public in terms of their concerns about petrol prices.
If we are serious about addressing the legitimate concerns of the Australian public about petrol prices, we need to look at the reality now and what we can do about it. As speakers have acknowledged in amongst all their various comments, the vast majority of the current petrol price rise is due to world oil prices. We know the Prime Minister did not meet his commitment to reduce the level of excise. That was a commitment and a power totally and only within the government; it was nothing to do with the Senate or the Democrats.
—Was that a core promise?
—I do not know whether it was core or not, but it was obviously broken and everybody knows that. Senator Cook himself said that, as did all the other Labor speakers. The Democrats have said that. It is quite clear that the Prime Minister did not meet his commitment to lower the rate of excise adequately. The whole country knows that. Why do we need a Senate inquiry to confirm that the Prime Minister did not keep his promise, something everybody already knows? Senate inquiries are about trying to establish facts, not confirming things that everybody already knows. They are about trying to find answers and solutions to address a problem, not just reinforcing complaints about something that everybody already knows. They do actually cost a fair bit of time and money. If an inquiry were set up in the context of suggesting that it would address a public concern or problem, then it would be misleading. Indeed, we would provide false hope to the public if we set up an inquiry that was not framed in a way that would provide a solution or at least some answers or suggestions. It is quite clear that the ALP are not serious about that, otherwise they would be supporting this Democrat motion. 
There is plenty in the terms of reference here for Labor to run all their stuff about the Prime Minister not keeping his promise. There is plenty of stuff in there where you can run all the GST stuff you like, but it also provides an opportunity to acknowledge that we are likely to be stuck with high fuel prices even if we were not stuck with a GST because of world oil price factors. That is something we should try to look at to see what we are going to do about it. Do we increase subsidies to reduce the price? Do we provide extra assistance for people in the bush? Do we put extra resources into reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and international exports of oil so we have less of an impact when the world oil price goes up? Forecasts are that the world oil price will go up significantly higher again, and you will still be there complaining about the GST. That is not going to help anybody very much; in fact, it is not going to help anybody at all, and it is certainly not going to help any of us in terms of dealing with our dependence on world oil prices. The whole point of trying to address the concerns of the Australian public is to try to ensure that we actually find solutions for this problem of overall price rises.
—You're doing a Basil Fawlty: don't mention the GST.
—I've mentioned the GST a number of times. I am quite happy to talk about the GST, but I do not talk about the GST as being a—
—Move on.
—I am quite happy to move on. The whole point is that we recognise the GST as part of the tax system now. You want to move on, as you repeatedly say, but you will not get rid of the GST and you are not even going to put forward any commitment to reduce the level of excise, stop indexation or anything like that. It is completely pointless to simply focus on the GST as though somehow or other it is to blame for everything. What we need to do is to examine proposals that will address the clear problem of the likely long-term, ongoing increase in the price of petrol—and that would be a fact whether the GST was there or not.
This is something, despite Senator Murphy's protestation, that the Democrats have spoken long and loud on for many years. He obviously, for whatever reason, does not immediately listen in every time the Democrats make a speech. I cannot imagine why that is, but obviously it is not the case. We will have to notify him every time we make speeches now so he can make sure he hears all of our contributions on transport policy, petrol prices and the need for alternative fuels.
—He will be hanging on with bated breath.
—I know Senator Conroy listens in every time, and that is why he never misrepresents our position on anything. Clearly some others do not listen, but these are policy positions the Democrats have pushed for many years. We have policy platforms. They are on our web site now and they were put forward at the last election. We have policies on transport, petrol pricing and all sorts of issues to do with reducing our reliance on petrol imports and moving to alternative fuels. Much as it may shock others, we do not suggest that we know all the answers to everything, and we think it would be appropriate to tap the expertise in the broader Australian community about other ideas for reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and, indeed, reducing the impact on our Australian economy every time world oil prices go up. It clearly reduces our independence and our control over our own future if we are subject to and vulnerable to things that we have no control over as a nation, such as international oil prices. That is what this whole issue is about and that is what this inquiry is focused on.
Even so, our terms of reference would still provide plenty of scope for the ALP to continue to get evidence, get witnesses and make speeches to their hearts content about the great evils of the GST, if that is all they wish to contribute to the whole debate. The fact that they are not interested in broadening it out to long-term solutions gives a clear indication that they are not serious about the issue and that they see it simply as a short-term political opportunity. I think that is a great shame because this is a serious problem—one that quite legitimately concerns the Australian public and has significant economic concerns and one that we should be trying to find solutions to rather than using it for political point scoring. It is a bit unfortunate that we as a Senate have not been able to move forward in a positive way on this issue of concern. Obviously we will have to look at other mechanisms to try to constructively address the concerns of the Australian public and the impact that this issue will have on the Australian economy and our environment.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-08-29,"—I did not have any intention of speaking in this debate until I had an opportunity to look at Senator Greig's motion that is before us. I have an opportunity to make a contribution in light of what I see as—and I take on board the word already used—the `smokescreens' in Senator Greig's motion. In particular, the Democrats are trying desperately to hide behind the fact that they are in this up to their necks—the predicament that the Australian motorists and the Australian transport industry are in at the moment because of the rising fuel prices that will affect Australian households, not only directly by filling up their cars but also indirectly by those increased transport costs that Senator Mackay outlined today, and the inability and resistance by the government to do anything about this.
I want to go to the parts of the motion that I find intriguing. Are the Democrats saying that there is no need for an inquiry into the government's broken promises in relation to fuel? If so, I do not know how they can justify the inquiry in the terms that they have outlined here today. In relation to the issue of saying that Australia has a reliance on fossil fuels and that we should be attempting to reduce this reliance, in our lifetime that reliance will not reduce at all. Probably in our own children's lifetime that dependence will not reduce at all. This is a furphy, and it has been run by a lot of well-meaning people but people who just do not wish to confront the issue—that is, that our technology and our transport systems, whether public or private, are dominated and will continue to be dominated by diesel fuels. 
One of the angles that the Democrat's motion is trying to run is that if we increase the price of diesel fuel then at some point or another that might discourage people from using their own private motor vehicle transport or, if you listen to Senator Allison, get heavy vehicles off the road—that people will switch to public transport, whether buses, trams or trains, and that goods will be delivered by trains. That will not happen in either my lifetime or my children's lifetime. That thinking is in cloud-cuckoo-land. To Senator Allison's credit, she has been to a number of industry functions at which she has not only advocated that heavy vehicles should be fuelled by ethanol, CNG or LPG but also suggested fuelling vehicles with canola oil. As I understand it, when she put that idea to one of the major road transport bodies, they really did think she may have overstepped the mark and, indeed, may have been out of her league. As I said, I think the people who are advocating this position are well meaning but not very well informed. 
If you look at the issue of public transport in terms of price rises in petrol or diesel, you will find that, no matter how much you increase the price of diesel or petrol, there is insignificant movement in the patronage of public transport vehicles, whether trains or buses. It just does not move. That is not the answer to what the Democrats see as urban congestion and emissions. The answer, as town planners will tell you, has to do significantly with urban density. Even that does not work. From reading some studies, even if we substitute cars for trains that are accessible and close by, there is only a five per cent decrease in the amount of private car usage. So in this country, and in most Western countries, we have a dependence on cars that we have had for some generations and that we will have for some generations to come.  
It is disingenuous of the Democrats to come in here today and argue that we should use a magic wand to come up with the answers to public transport. In their view—and they think this is correct—if we continue to increase the price of petrol and diesel, that will discourage people from using their own private transport to transport either themselves or their goods. They are living in cloud-cuckoo-land. Every objective survey I could point to—and if I had an opportunity I could get the names of the surveys—will indicate differently. People are not discouraged from using private transport no matter how much the price of diesel or petrol goes up. 
As Senator Mackay eloquently put it today, the Victorian Road Transport Association said today in their press release that the price of goods supplied to people in shops and other commodities throughout the state of Victoria will increase substantially over the next period. And why is that? Because of the government's policies. What will affect that? Inflation. This is something over which the government have control. Our original motion by Senator Cook urged the government to take action, to nip this in the bud, to protect themselves from inflationary effects that may occur as a result of these decisions. However, by the government voting down our motion today, they will not be able to have these issues fleshed out and they will not have the opportunity to act under the guise of a Senate committee report, if it went that way.
I also point to part (a)(ii) of the Democrats motion, `developing alternative fuel options'. If the Democrats are accusing Labor of having a 48th or 49th inquiry into petrol or diesel, I could accuse them of not being forthright and honest in relation to the number of inquiries there have been into alternative fuel options. There is major pressure in Europe and North America about fuel standards. There is a huge debate under way in California about low sulfur fuel. I want to point this out: on fuel quality, early indications are that low sulfur diesel needed to meet the emission standards that are being sought—that is Euro 4 or Euro 5 emission standards—will probably add 10c extra a litre. So even if we embark on a situation where we are going to reduce the amount of sulfur in diesel, we are going to increase the price by at least 10c a litre for that diesel. And there are no alternative or economically viable schemes coming along to replace the dependence—whether or not we like it—we have on diesel and petrol.
Under this inquiry that is being sought by the Democrats, we are being asked to investigate a situation where we will be advocating increased diesel prices over the next few years, and this will occur because of our commitment to meet the standards over the next few years. Let us not live in fairyland, cloud-cuckoo-land or anywhere like that. The Democrats know exactly what they are doing, and they are doing it for the wrong reasons. There are no viable reasons for what they are advocating. Behind this is their dislike of private transport, whether it is by car or by truck. That is what is really behind this. Their misguided logic is this: increasing the price of fuel—whether petrol or diesel—will discourage private passenger use and will discourage companies from using trucks to transport their goods. That will not occur, as I said, in my lifetime or in the lifetime of my children, because we are dependent on it.
The next part of the Democrats motion—(a)(iii), `restructuring motor vehicle registration charges'—goes to show how much research, I imagine, the drafters of this motion did. Earlier this year, the National Road Transport Commission made recommendations to the Australian council of transport ministers in relation to charges for heavy vehicles. Mr Acting Deputy President, you may be aware that in 1995 in this country there were 10.2 million passenger and light commercial vehicles, 340,000 rigid vehicles and 600,000 articulated vehicles. The NRTC reported to the Australian council of transport ministers and made some recommendations. As I have pointed out, this is in relation to the Democrats motion at section (a)(iii), `restructuring motor vehicle registration charges'. This year the NRTC has recommended: for two- and three-axle vehicles, a proposed increase of two to four per cent; for B doubles, a proposed increase of 15 per cent; and for three- and four-axle articulated vehicles, a proposed increase of 30 per cent. And, as I understand it, the states are in the process of implementing this recommendation. So we have already dealt with (a)(iii). 
Once again, I come back to what might be an obsession of the Democrats, and that is mistakenly thinking that, by their actions, they are going to discourage people from using private vehicle transport or from using heavy vehicles or light vehicles to transport goods. That will not occur. This is, as I have stated, a misguided—but probably well-meaning—attempt by people who really have not concentrated on the issue and looked at how they might address this dependence that we have on private motor vehicles.
If you look at it, it is a city-country divide. In the motion there is also a reference to looking at a subsidy scheme or some sort of differential between city and rural motorists. I remind the mover of the motion that, earlier this year, or it could have been last year, a High Court case was taken by Mr Ha against, I think, the South Australian government. The South Australian government deliberately did some cross-subsidisation—I think that is what it was—of South Australian rural motorists. The High Court struck down that differential. I think you may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that at some stage Peter Costello was looking at some sort of means by which to apply some differential between country and city operators. He has not been able to do it. Constitutionally, he will not be able to do it. It is bunkum for the Democrats to come in here and put forward this motion that we should be investigating it. Investigate it all you like, it will not change. Mr Costello and the coalition have done their best to see if they can do something like this. It cannot be done. If we are going to talk about people being fair dinkum, maybe the Democrats themselves should look at how they are going to operate on this. If this is a means by which they can slither out of supporting our motion and go back to their cafe latte set in Sydney or Melbourne and say, as they jump into their Jags, `We have done our best,' then good luck to them. If we are serious about trying to redress the difficulties that Australian families and companies are facing with these hikes in petrol and diesel prices, then the only way forward would have been for the Democrats to support our motion today.
I want to finish on one other thing that concerns diesel prices and the issue that the Democrats are trying to raise about social issues and increasing public transport. In the diesel grants rebates scheme that the government put forward, even though they were made quite aware of it, almost all urban buses operated by private bus companies are excluded from being able to make application to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. On 1 July their bus fares would have gone up because they are not in the zone that would attract the rebate. They are not in that zone. So much for their concern about trying to encourage people to move from private car usage to public transport. This is not a genuine motion; this is what I said earlier it is: an opportunity for them to slide out of their responsibilities.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-08-29,"—I will not take much of the Senate's time. I think what has needed to be said has, in fact, been said and I would only be going over what the Senate has already heard. The reason that matters are referred to committees—normally speaking—in this chamber is in order for the committee members and, through the report of the committee to the chamber, the whole of the chamber to understand the facts of a situation. The purpose of referring matters of major public policy to committees is also to allow persons affected to come before the committee and give the committee their experience as to how they are affected.
In this particular instance, those who are affected really are those least able to bear the burden. I am referring particularly to working families, those who are almost on the breadline. These are the ones that will mostly be affected. There will be others, of course, affected directly. Regional Australia, as has been said during the debate quite frequently, will be particularly affected—not least of all, my own state of Tasmania. Spare a thought for the truckies, for those people in the transport industry. They are working extraordinary hours at the present moment. I use the word `extraordinary' because we have all seen and studied the figures relating to deaths of persons who are in the transport industry. The pressure is on them at the present moment, and they do not need this further burden. 
This afternoon we have had the proposition by the opposition and the proposition by the Australian Democrats. An attractive part of the proposition by the opposition was that it had a reporting date in early December. One of the purposes of referring a matter to a committee is to come up with a report, based on facts, which will provide a self-evident path which the government and others would follow in order to achieve the objective outlined by the committee's report. In the opposition's proposal, the opposition did have a number of matters to be investigated and into which the committee would inquire—and to most of which, frankly, the answers are already known. But it would have been a useful exercise, I think, to focus the attention of government and others on what is actually occurring. I notice that the proposition did not mention the word `excise' by name—although subparagraph 1(e) would have been able to be utilised, I suppose, to get from the Labor Party what its view is about the whole issue of the excise. Nonetheless, I did vote for the opposition's proposal, and the reason I did so was that I thought it did at least focus on the issues as they are now.
The Australian Democrats motion, which we are discussing, does not have the sort of immediacy that I think is required. Nevertheless, it does raise issues, including the alternative policies that can be developed to reduce the impost of petrol price rises on households, and it goes into the question which is on a lot of people's minds: Australia's reliance on fossil fuels and the effect on greenhouse gas emissions. I must say, though—to be quite frank—that, for the people that I move amongst, that is not high on their thinking at the present moment. Their thinking is, `How are we going to make ends meet this week, as a result of a hike in fuel prices?'
I was hoping that the Democrats and the opposition might have come to some sort of agreement on the matters in question, because some of the things raised by the reference we are currently considering would be very worth while inquiring into. I must express my regret that there was no agreement. But having some sort of an inquiry is better than having none, because the matters will be canvassed and, no doubt, whether the proposers like it or not, certain people will come before the committee and give evidence on some of the matters that are pressing more on the minds of the public than are some that are specifically mentioned for inquiry.
After all of that—not that it will make a great deal of difference—I also will be voting for the proposal. But I really believe that that should not be used to sidetrack a government or used to lessen pressure on the authorities to do something about this matter immediately. A lot of the people I am thinking of just cannot cope with further rises. Some suggestion was made—I think it was by the minister—that there are likely to be further price rises caused by international factors within the next few months. We all realise, of course, that this is a matter largely about which the government has little control. But there are other areas—and I am not going into them as they have all been canvassed—where the government does have the opportunity to ameliorate the problem, the very real and big problem, that is faced by the community, particularly those who are most vulnerable.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-08-29,"—I take this opportunity to sum up briefly, mercifully. In closing this debate, I must say that I share some of Senator Harradine's disappointment that some kind of accommodation could not have been met. I do not believe that the proposal we put forward was unreasonable. Throughout much of the debate—such as it was—I heard time and time again from Labor senators their particular preference for going down the path of some kind of inquiry in terms of investigating petrol price rises, their cause, how the money is being accumulated and where it is going. Yet I remain convinced that those things are covered in items (b), (c) and (d) of our motion, and I cannot see why Labor could not bring itself to support that. 
Senator Cook spoke first and accused me of having a reasonable and carefully moderated voice. I do not know quite how to respond to that, other than to say that I have yet to be convinced that apoplexy is the way to go. He argued also, as I have said, that what we Democrats ought to be doing and what the Senate ought to be doing is going down the path of Labor's repeated call for yet another review. There have been so many reviews that I do not know why Labor does not just go the whole hog and have a musical! But 49 is, I think, enough. It is not enough simply to have a review or, for that matter, simply to have a Senate inquiry: we must act on the recommendations thereof. I wonder how many of these 49 reviews remain in dust jackets on shelves, waiting for their 50th counterpart.
Senator Kemp spoke and gave us 26 minutes of roll-back and two minutes of why the government would not be supporting the Democrats motion. Mr Acting Deputy President, I share your concern: to this point in time, I still do not understand why the government, nor do I understand clearly whether or not it was, was in fact cementing its position of opposition to this motion.
My colleague Senator Allison picked up on the points which I had noted in listening to Senators Cook, Mackay and others about the question of what was happening to the windfall tax revenue. Senator Cook seemed particularly agitated by that point, and again I come back to items (b), (c) and (d) in the Democrats motion, which I believe would have adequately covered that.
Senator Mackay made reference to Senator Woodley and made a point of noting that he was not here. For the record, Senator Mackay, I should point out Senator Woodley's keen interest in this issue, particularly for his rural and regional constituency in Queensland. But he did, in fact, have another engagement and, to the extent that I can, I extend his apologies.
Senator Mackay spoke also of rural and regional disenchantment. I have no doubt that that is very real in Tasmania, as it is in other parts of Australia. But one of the key reasons that we Democrats have proposed this motion and phrased the terms of reference in the way we have is that maybe—maybe—we can address some of that. One of the points that I have tried to make strongly here today is that, once we acknowledge—and we really should acknowledge—the reality that petrol prices have increased and that there is an unexpected windfall of revenue for the government, why cannot we use some of that revenue more sensibly in rural and regional areas?
Senator Cook made the point, for example, that where his electorate office is in Kalgoorlie there is very poor public transport. I think that is what he said from memory; it was a while ago. Perhaps if we could reasonably and realistically use some of this unexpected revenue quite specifically to upgrade and improve the public transport that exists in rural and regional Australia, that would be one of the things that this committee could and should address.
Senator Murphy, who is now in the chair, then spoke, goading us Democrats as to why we did not lock this in in the GST deal. We could not get everything. We got an awful lot, but we could not get everything. My rhetorical question to you is: what did you do in 13 years of government? Where were the alternative fuel policies then? Where was the public transport infrastructure then? As Senator Lees said quite rightly at the time—and it is worth echoing—the Democrats were able to achieve more in 13 days of negotiation with the government than was achieved in 13 years of negotiation with previous ALP governments.
Senator Bartlett then spoke. He also seems to have a reasonable and carefully moderated voice—monotone, some would argue. He reiterated his passion for environment issues, and there is no doubt that he is sincere about that. More importantly, I think he spoke quite honestly about the fact that we must simply recognise that this is the scenario we have, that this is the GST ANTS package we have, that this is the global political climate we have and that we need to respond to that reasonably. Shrill calls from the Labor Party—for purely political reasons—for an immediate reduction in petrol prices as we enter what is effectively an election year are simply unacceptable when the issues are more serious and deeper than that, as Senator Harradine indicated. 
Senator Hutchins spoke, sounding a little like a cracked record, as he was following three or four of his colleagues. He made a point which I must take issue with, and that is that the Democrats have a particular dislike or disapproval of private transport and that our passion for this issue was driven by that. I must refute that and say that it is not the case. We acknowledge the reality that many Australians enjoy the use of personal and private transport, but that is no reason to become complacent. The point I made in my opening remarks to this motion is that we should not simply take it for granted that a car must be available for everyone and that fossil fuels are here to stay. We must—I repeat, must—look at sensible public transport options and alternative fuel provisions. Senator Hutchins suggested that better public transport with alternative fuels simply will not occur because that is not part of the Australian mindset, but that is not enough. We Democrats argue that greater leadership is required here.
Finally, Senator Harradine spoke, particularly with regard to the committee process, and I share some of his concerns about that. Senator Harradine seemed to feel that a greater sense of immediacy was required in addressing this issue. In response to Senator Harradine's concerns—unless I misunderstood him—that those people who may want to present themselves to the committee process or to provide submissions to it will in part be disenfranchised working people, I suggest to Senator Harradine that, that being the case, if we keep the reporting date as the first sitting day in February then we keep that relatively slow social period over Christmas and the school holidays and the slow working period of January-February and the new year. That will perhaps provide some opportunity for those people to participate in the committee process. They might not be able to do so if we were to hasten this to a November reporting date.
In closing, I reiterate my party's position and its clear preference for these terms of reference on fuel policy to proceed in the way that we have outlined and I have spoken to. I believe the issues, particularly the issues of public transport and alternative fuels, are worthy of serious debate, not just here and now but in the committee process. The end result should be that we do something serious about it. We do not want this to become yet another dusty report on a shelf somewhere. I commend this motion to the Senate and believe it is worthy of support.

	(c)	notes the total failure of the National Party of Austraila to ensure that the country-city fuel price differential did not get worse as a result of the GST”.
Last night, at close of play, I was part way through my address on the second reading of the Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000. Anyone could be forgiven, on seeing the plain title of this bill, for thinking that `measures to address evasion' may well have referred to the government's duplicity with Australian motorists over how they have pumped up the price of petrol at the bowser in Australia through various tax measures, particularly the GST, which they applied as a tax on a tax—a tax on the excise—making Australian motorists pay more than they need to. This afternoon we saw the Labor Party's proposition for a proper inquiry—which set out the options for change and the handing back of some of this windfall gain to Australian motorists—defeated by a combination of the government and the Australian Democrats, the two authors of the GST, who were protecting the impact of the GST from parliamentary scrutiny and closer examination.
The terms of my amendment quite clearly nail part of the responsibility for the higher prices Australian motorists are paying onto the government and, if carried, would express the view of this chamber that the government should act to lower the costs to Australian motorists. The amendment now notes that the National Party has failed to do anything, as the significant regional political force in the coalition government, to reduce the yawning gap between country and city fuel prices. The differential has only got worse as a consequence of the GST; it has not got better. 
This substantive bill is about fuel substitution and about the government at long last succumbing to the blandishments and encouragement of the opposition—propositions that we raised in 1997 to legislate to prevent fuel being watered down, toluene being added to the field or fuel being tampered with so that people buying petrol were getting something less than what they paid for. Companies engaging in this practice were escaping their full obligations to the tax system, culminating in a drain on government revenue—according to one of the witnesses that appeared before the Senate committee that conducted an inquiry into this bill—of $300 million a year. In a press release in January 1998, Minister Warren Truss proudly announced the government's action to stamp out fuel substitution. It stated:
The Federal Government is implementing strict new laws ... to combat the loss of revenue and stamp out dangerous and illegal practices resulting from fuel substitution.
The government was very clear about what it was doing then with its legislation. The government said it was going to stamp out fuel substitution. But at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, my colleague Senator George Campbell asked both the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Customs Service about who had responsibility for carrying out the government's wishes and ensuring consumers were not harmed by substitution. It is instructive to now go back and look at the answers then given to what was a straightforward and plain question. Mr Jackson, from the tax office, said:
Our legislation does not empower us to deal with the quality of fuel. If people want to mix half a litre of water with half a litre of petrol and say that is petrol and, if they pay the excise on it, they have paid the excise.
At that point, as far as the tax office was concerned, as long as you paid the tax due it did not matter whether you mixed water with petrol and sold it as petrol. But then Mr Burns from the Australian Customs Service said in response to the same question from Senator Campbell:
I think the point is that it was not Customs' responsibility, but it was the responsibility of either other government agencies or state governments.
Customs wiped its hands of it. At the time, Senator Kemp said it was one big duckshove. Both agencies said that there was nothing they could do about carrying out Minister Truss's wishes to stamp out the dangerous practice because they did not have the power. Whatever the government said back in 1997 and 1998, the Taxation Office and the Customs Service—bear in mind that these were the appropriate agencies—were not able to deliver what the government said it intended to do because they lacked the capacity or the legislation to implement the government's wishes.
The bill before us seems, in a sense, to confirm what the tax office and Customs were saying: that, despite the brave predictions and promises of the government, they did not have the agency per legislative authority to do what the government said and, as a consequence, we now have this legislation. As I have already said, it has been a long time coming and, because we have waited a long time for it to come, the problem has got worse. Since July last year, when the tax office took over control of fuel substitution from Customs, a total of only 42 sites around Australia have been tested to see whether fuel substitution is occurring. Of those 42 testings, a total of eight instances of fuel substitution were discovered—so it is still going on. To get a strike rate of eight out of 42 is a fairly high percentage—a 20 per cent incidence of fuel substitution. Compare that meagre number of 42 sites tested with the actions of Customs when they had responsibility for this in the previous year. Their annual report for 1998-99 reported that they had visited 551 sites and had found 52 positive instances of fuel substitution.
So once again Customs detected a very serious level of fuel substitution. But instead of the government acting on that, once it found out there was this kind of problem, it reduced the number of tests. As I said, there were 42 tests last year and 551 tests in the previous year, and from those 42 tests we see a 20 per cent incidence of fuel substitution. This is a serious problem in the community and it is a wonder that it has taken the government so long to act. The opposition were concerned to participate in the Senate inquiry into this legislation. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into this legislation in August this year—earlier this month—but the Labor senators involved in the inquiry were not satisfied that the majority conclusions of the inquiry properly raised public interest issues about whether or not the government had acted quickly enough to staunch this haemorrhage to revenue and overcome the duplicity exercised towards motorists on fuel substitution. As a consequence, the Labor senators appended a minority report to the majority report. 
This is a fairly detailed document and I do not intend to go through all of it, but one of the questions it poses stands out. It is a question that I now refer to. The ministerial council is the body through which Commonwealth and state ministers responsible meet to see if there is a possibility of coordinating action between the states and the Commonwealth. On a matter like this it was not surprising that, when they convened the CBAV, they—along with the New South Wales and Queensland governments—advocated a 10-point plan to deal with fuel issues. I now refer to the minority report. In particular—and I refer to this New South Wales, Queensland and CBAV report—point 3 of that plan dealt with fuel substitution. It called on the Commonwealth to:
(a) report to the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs, the MCCA, on whether the proposed Commonwealth fuel standards would be adequate to take action under trade practices legislation in order to protect consumers from contaminated fuels; and
(b) ensure an adequate level of testing by the Australian tax office, formerly Customs, is conducted to minimise excise abuse.
What I now foreshadow is that in the committee stage of this legislation I will ask the minister directly what the government have done about that proposal. Why did they not accept that proposal at the ministerial council? It would have attended more rapidly to this problem I have referred to and been a more comprehensive way of dealing with it. And what do they intend to do about this in the future? It seems to me they are fairly fundamental questions. While we support this legislation, we believe it has been slow in coming. Part of fairness and justice in the tax system goes to acting promptly once a problem is identified and remedying it expeditiously. Here the government have clearly dragged the chain—they have made brave promises to the electorate and not honoured them until they brought forward this legislation after some considerable time.
Let me now draw my remarks on this bill to a conclusion by referring to the additional amendment that I have moved. We know that in Australia today the significant public debate reflected in newspaper coverage and the electronic media is the question of the white-hot anger of Australian motorists over the high price they are paying at the bowser for petrol. This is an issue that is not unrelated to the legislation before the chamber. But let me just draw this comparison. Of course part of the driving force for the higher prices being paid by Australian motorists is the import price—where OPEC, on behalf of oil producing countries, have squeezed the world market to force the price to rise. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-08-29,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Last year in the Senate I raised the question of a group of companies operating on the international education market that were operating in Australia as providers of educational services to overseas students and that had received grants under the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. In that discussion I raised the question of some 20 educational institutions that had received grants and subsequently lost their registration within Australia as a result of various levels of irregularity or from going out of business. But I was particularly concerned about how the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was providing export development grants to companies which were clearly operating outside of the law and, in some cases, providing grants to companies where the inappropriate actions of those companies clearly brought into question Australia's international reputation within the educational export industry. 
Since then I have been assured by various officers of the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs on several occasions in Senate estimates hearings that this problem would not arise again, because there were now much better liaisons between the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Austrade and a range of other Commonwealth departments and that there was a new interdepartmental committee. Naturally enough, I always accept the assurances of the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs on such questions, because I know that over the years they have always been able to be on the ball on these sorts of issues!
—Are you using irony?
—This is an ironic comment, Senator Cook. The problem has been that, while I have noticed that this year's export development grants report indicated the situation has improved dramatically—and to this extent one has to take some assurances, as I say, from the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs—I nonetheless remain very concerned that a number of problems seem to have slipped through the net. I know, for instance, that Alpha Beta College, which is an educational service provider operating mainly in New South Wales, has received a grant for some $23,000 this year. I understand that this is a college that is subject to ongoing investigation by the various levels of government, both Commonwealth and state, between DETYA and DIMA. It is my understanding this is a college that received a grant of $6,000 last year, so it has actually seen an increase in its level of grant, despite being under investigation.
Excelsior College, according to the reports in the Sydney Morning Herald on 22 July, was on the brink of closure by the New South Wales government, and according to the answers I have received from the department it has been subject to ongoing investigation of a quite serious nature, yet it has managed to receive $25,000 to sell itself overseas. This is a college which I suggest is posing a serious risk to our international reputation. I was able to table company records in a Senate estimates committee which showed that a very large number of students involved in that college were not actually attending the college, that in fact 14 of the 33 students enrolled were not actually paying their overseas student health charge, which is an important criterion in terms of the operation of the ESOS act. And we noticed a number of agents who have very dubious practices were employed by this college. And we noticed that there were a number of interlocking directorates between these agencies and various other unscrupulous operators operating in Sydney. So I am shocked to find that Excelsior College managed to score itself a grant this year. I am troubled that this is a pattern that is emerging. I notice, however, that there are others in a similar situation.
I am also disturbed that there are operating in Sydney agencies that you would think would know better. The Uniting Church, I understand, has leased its CRICOS registration and its registered training organisation registration to a company known as the Wesley Institute for Language and Commerce, also known as the Vision College, at the Sussex Centre at 401-403 Sussex Street. It is run by Rachel Ong, who also runs a college known as the Sydney Institute of Business. This college collapsed just last week, leaving I understand 600 students in the lurch, 200 of which have been reported for non-attendance. Many of the 600 ought to be reported for non-attendance, but the records do not seem to exist. You have to ask yourself why it is that the Uniting Church can lease out its name and not understand the full implications of the law.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-08-29,"—I too wish to speak on the Australian Trade Commission's review of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. I make note of the very appropriate points that my colleague Senator Carr has just made about some education exporters. However, the focus of my remarks goes to the very nature of the scheme itself. It should be said that the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is the foremost mechanism that is used by government to encourage small to medium sized Australian companies to access the export market. It is a scheme that has a long history. Its genesis was in the Whitlam government. That gives you some idea of how long the scheme has been around. 
Since the advent of the Howard coalition government the scheme has undergone remarkable surgery which has made it less effective and, therefore, less able to help lever small to medium sized Australian companies into the export market. Because the scheme has imposed blockages and hurdles for access for small business the potential gains to the nation through new exports has been lessened. This is hard to calibrate, and particularly difficult given the Asian currency crisis from 1997, when the decline in countries in our near region as export markets meant that opportunity was lessened. It has been hard to actually get a clear fix on what damage the government's changes to the scheme have done in not taking the maximum potential that was there for Australian exporters.
But now that the Asian economies are back in strong growth (with the possible exception in these circumstances of Indonesia, but one hopes that will change) and the complexion of our markets in ASEAN has improved—there are still strong markets elsewhere in the world; notably, the United States has been the major locomotive for world economic growth, and supported interestingly over the last few years as well by stronger growth in Europe and by China's continual strength, at between six or eight per cent, depending on whether you believe official or unofficial estimates of growth; and now at last we see Japan coming from negative growth back to a more promising position of growth—the question arises as to whether this scheme serves the purpose the nation supported it for, or whether this scheme requires now to be reviewed and made more effective. With stronger international markets, quite clearly greater opportunity exists. What this scheme does do is overcome one of the essential requirements for small to medium sized companies: it provides a measure of accessing market intelligence about what opportunity for a company might be somewhere else in the world and it provides a rebate on expenses incurred to make contacts with possible clients. It is a coalface scheme aimed at linking up sellers with buyers, to our national advantage.
There has been a review of this scheme. Interestingly, while the review has proposed an extension of the scheme for five years, I think it could have been longer, because the stop-start nature of these things is in itself a deterrent. The hurdles that have been introduced are hurdles where bureaucrats make judgments about entrepreneurial opportunity. We think that is wrong. Bureaucrats are not the people that should make those judgments; entrepreneurs should. The government would be better advised to seek private sector advice about some of the judgments it makes about whether or not it should make a grant. The government has maintained a $150 million cap on the scheme. With a growth market in the world, to limit the opportunities of Australian companies to that cap, given that when the world economy was stronger seven or eight years ago the scheme was valued at over $200 million, means that the government by being penny-wise is pound-foolish and, if you like, cramping the effectiveness of the scheme.
One of the other recommendations of this report is that producers of X-rated videos cannot access the scheme. This is an odd bit of moralistic judgment. If their businesses are legal in Australia—and they are—they ought to be able to access the scheme, because there is a ready market for their product in the world. If their businesses are illegal, they should not.
Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Trade Commission: Review of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme</title>,Documents,18,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2000-08-29,"—I rise tonight to express my belief in the future of small country settlements in Australia. I have found that communities, particularly out in the west of New South Wales, where I visited recently, in terms of their lifestyle and what they are trying to achieve, are truly inspirational as they grapple with very difficult economic circumstances, climate circumstances and market circumstances to maintain what historically for them has been a country lifestyle. 
I want to illustrate this message of hope by telling the Senate about the region of the Macquarie Valley in north-west New South Wales and how it has been able to change and adapt to shifting economic forces and how particularly the Narromine and Warren shires are trying to stay one step ahead. They have formulated a plan which they call the Macquarie 2100 plan. Communities like Narromine need strategies like this if they are to have a future because, over the last 100 years, the countryside has been slowly drained of people, of economic activity and of services. The main beneficiaries of this process over the last 100 years have been not only big cities like Sydney but also some of the smaller regional centres such as Bathurst, Wagga and Dubbo, who have over time drawn people and resources from the surrounding countryside.
A basic question we should ask ourselves in terms of the future development of Australia is: do centres of around 3,000 to 4,000 people have a future or should they perhaps pack up and move to larger centres? That was certainly the thinking of one academic in recent times. Dr Forth from Deakin University told a conference on the future of regional Australia—and he also repeated this on Radio National's AM program—that towns with a population of under 4,000 had to face up to the harsh economic reality that they are not viable and people should move to areas with better services and facilities. Dr Forth told the AM program that, in towns of falling population, there will be a high proportion of elderly people who are increasingly disadvantaged. They will not be able to access basic services such as health and banking, and these places could become poverty traps.
I do not know whether Dr Forth has actually gone out into rural and regional Australia. Some towns and some centres are certainly doing it tough, but there are vast areas of Australia where small centres of this size that he would like us to shut down are absolutely thriving. Just after he went on the radio to talk about this across Australia, I was out in western New South Wales and I visited Dubbo, which is a very large, thriving centre of over 50,000 people, but I also visited Narromine just up the road which has a population of under 4,000—3,500, to be exact—and this is the exact sort of centre that Dr Forth suggested should shut down in Australia.
When I was talking to the local council, they were not very impressed with his comments. There they were in the thriving Macquarie Valley, which is a great centre of the booming cotton industry in Australia. The town performs a servicing role for that industry and a number of other agricultural industries in nearby smaller towns, and they are doing just fine. They want Dr Forth to know that their town is certainly far from dead. They want to make sure it stays that way. That is why they have formulated this plan—Macquarie 2100—which is a 100-year plan for their future survival in that area, which includes the townships of Nyngan, Warren, Collie, Trangie, Dandaloo, Narromine and the appropriately named Nevertire. All of those towns I have mentioned have populations of under 4,000—they are the type of town that Dr Forth would like to shut down. 
The townships are part of the floodplain of the lower Macquarie Valley. The population of that valley, when you put all those towns and the individual settlements together, comes to a little over 10,000 people. There are 1,100 businesses in the area that employ over 4,000 people. The idea behind the Macquarie 2100 plan is for the locals to create a future for themselves and for their children. The underlying principle of the plan is that these communities recognise that they have a primary responsibility for their own wellbeing and that with careful planning they can create sustainable development in that region for at least the next 100 years. They do not want their town to die, they do not want services to leave, they do not want shops to close, and they certainly do not want crime to increase. These people want a safe and secure future for themselves and for their children, and in Australia they certainly have that right. 
They have developed the Macquarie 2100 plan over a number of years, and it is based on the ability of that region to adapt to changing economic circumstances. They see further changes coming and they are putting plans in place to adapt to these changes. Over time the economic focus in the Macquarie Valley has moved from beef and wheat to, more recently, the more intensive and more profitable cotton growing industry. This industry is also starting to slow so, like many agriculturally based communities, the other businesses in the area have to develop alternative strategies to grow and thrive. But when your main agricultural industry starts to move downwards, it does not take long for some of the basic services to start disappearing, and we should plan against this. Services in major towns such as Warren and Narromine certainly have not gone completely, but an agricultural profile by the Centre for Agricultural and Regional Economics found that the Macquarie Valley has been losing employment over the last two decades and that it is not really sharing in the growth of the New South Wales economy. Hence the need for a plan to get some of growth in the Macquarie Valley.
The community have highlighted a range of concerns that they need to address which they have divided into seven basic categories: economic viability, education and employment, health and lifestyle, chemical impacts, riverine and floodplain environment and water quality, salinity, and vegetation and biodiversity. The problems include concerns that they are particularly vulnerable to seasonal market variation for their products, that the number of people employed in all sectors is still dropping at a rate of one per cent a year, that youth unemployment is well above the average for New South Wales, and that the salt load in the Macquarie River is rising at about two per cent a year.
The people in the area have decided that, despite these problems, they have a future and it can be a bright one with good planning, but they have realised that they must act now. After countless hours of studying, researching and interviewing local people, the organisation has developed 32 aims to tackle these problems in the Macquarie Valley. The strategy involves: working towards a sustainable economy through business development; actively improving the availability of and access to quality information, education and training; sustaining and improving the riverine environment, water quality and ground water resource; and minimising the extent of salinity and its impact on the region. The Macquarie 2100 plan is a long-term vision that includes a number of short-term and medium-term aims, and certainly a number of short-term and medium-term projects. I am confident that, with the combination of community groups, councils, government agencies and private companies working together, their goals can be achieved.
The Howard government is very supportive of such partnerships. We were the first government in Australian history to hold an Australian regional summit, which discussed how to empower our rural and regional communities to leverage their own future development. That summit was held in October last year where the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, gave a key address. He emphasised the notion of encouraging coalitions or partnerships between government, business and communities to find the realistic solutions to challenges faced by each region in Australia. The people in the Macquarie Valley are well on their way to achieving this, and I congratulate them for taking such initiative in the Macquarie 2100 plan. There is a need for these programs to be backed by appropriate local, state and federal policies. I believe, with the right assistance, people living in the region of the Macquarie 2100 plan will have a bright future.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Development</title>,Adjournment,19,1,speech

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-08-29,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1) The Commonwealth, in recognition of the special circumstances of Tasmania, decided to spend ten percent of the expenditure under the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Reserve in Tasmania.  At the time, this represented a commitment to provide $125 million to Tasmania.  Details of approved Natural Heritage Trust projects in Tasmania have been provided to the honourable senator.  Further copies are available from the Senate Table Office.
(2) A summary table detailing approved Commonwealth Natural Heritage Trust funding by program, and planned allocation to meet the $125 million commitment, has been provided to the honourable senator.  Further copies are available from the Senate Table Office.  A total of $85 million has been approved to date.  Further approvals in Tasmania will continue to be subject to transparent, rigorous and merit -based assessment of Natural Heritage Trust proposals.
(3) The Commonwealth has provided $4.705 million from the NHT for management of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area between 1997-98 to 1999-00.
1997-1998		$2 million
1998-1999		$2.005 million
1999-2000		$0.7 million
(4) It is not correct to say that NHT funding for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area program in the 1999-2000 financial year has been cut.
Commonwealth funding from the Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) for the management of the Tasmanian Wilderness is additional to the government's commitment of more than $5 million per year under an intergovernmental agreement with Tasmania.  NHT funding is available for priority management projects in each of the World Heritage properties located in the states.  I consider project proposals received from the states on an annual basis, and I approve projects that meet the project selection criteria to a high degree.  Tasmanian proposals for funding under the NHT compete on merit with proposals for other World Heritage properties.  In 1999-2000 I have approved NHT management projects totalling $700,000 for the Tasmanian Wilderness - significantly more project funding than for any other eligible World Heritage property.  Funding has been provided for the Walking Track Strategy ($500,000) and upgrading of the Overland Track ($200,000).
(5) The Walking Track Strategy is a 15-year program which has been recognised by the Commonwealth as a very high priority for management of the Tasmanian Wilderness.  The government has contributed $2.4 million to the Strategy from the NHT over the past 3 years.  The Strategy is complex and addresses planning, capital works and maintenance, and user quotas and permits.
The Tasmanian Government sought $1 million from the NHT to progress the Strategy in 1999-2000.  I was not satisfied that the Strategy had made sufficient progress, particularly in the area of user quotas and permits, to justify Commonwealth funding in excess of $0.5 million this year.  I look forward to future progress reports that would justify a higher allocation in future years.
