"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-02-05,"—by leave—On 16 October, the Senate ordered the government to table documents relating to an ethanol excise and production subsidy. The government made an interim response to the order on 21 October 2002 and indicated that, due to the number of agencies involved in the coordination of the request, it was not possible to comply by the due date. At that time, I indicated that the government expected to be in a position to respond shortly. I gave a further response on the very last sitting day of 2002—in fact, I think it was in the early hours of the morning—and I re-scrutinised that Hansard last night. I anticipated at that time that if we failed to comply that Hansard may well be quoted back to me in the new year—and I still have that sense of anticipation.
At that time, I did advise the Senate that the response to the order had involved an extensive search of documents held in the six portfolios, that this was a lengthy and time-consuming task, that consideration of the documents was close to conclusion and that the government was not able to provide its final response prior to the rising of the Senate. I further added that I had spoken to the coordinating minister, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Mr Macfarlane, and also to Senator Kerry O'Brien who has been pursuing this matter. I do not think Senator Kerry O'Brien would mind me saying that we have had a number of discussions in the days leading up to Christmas and I reiterated my own commitment to the government providing a response. Unfortunately, the response has not been able to be made.
Over the summer recess, the documents have been thoroughly gone through in regard to the normal protocols that apply to tabled documents responding to a Senate return to order. The government has been unable to stand by the commitment that I made on behalf of it back in mid-December. The government is seeking to conclude its consideration of these documents and its compliance—albeit very late—to the order of the Senate. My latest advice is that the government will respond as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>FUEL: ETHANOL</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-02-05,"—by leave—I must say that I am not envious of Senator Ian Campbell's position in relation to this matter. He is, as he advised the Senate, making statements in effect on behalf of the responsible minister, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Mr Macfarlane, in the other place. He was right: I am going to quote back to him his words from the last day of sitting last year— not so much to embarrass him but to point out that he was passing on a commitment to the Senate. His words were—and he was referring to Mr Macfarlane:
The minister is happy for me to commit to tabling those documents out of session by next Tuesday.
That Tuesday was 17 December 2002. He goes on to say:
I am confident, dare I say—the Hansard might be quoted back to me next year!—that we will achieve that, and I have said that to Senator O'Brien privately and now on the record.
Shortly after the 17th, of course, when the documents were not provided, I spoke to Senator Ian Campbell and he assured me that all was being done to comply. Today, we are told not that the government commits to a response by a certain time—perhaps it is a case of being once bitten twice shy on behalf of Senator Campbell in that regard—but that, on the words given to the Senate today, we are further away from the government complying with this return to order. 
It is totally unsatisfactory that the government, through Senator Ian Campbell, has given a commitment to the Senate that it will do certain things. I am not seeking to cast doubt on the integrity of Senator Campbell in this regard; he was clearly giving a commitment on behalf of Mr Macfarlane. The concern I have is that, apparently, the commitment was given quite cavalierly—not only was the response not provided by the time it was undertaken to have been provided, but we are still unable to learn when it will be provided.  
I think that this is a disgraceful performance by Minister Macfarlane. I remain unaware of the reason why this could not be complied with. There have been many more onerous returns to order than this one that have been complied with in a much shorter space of time. I am concerned that there is a reluctance to comply with this return to order. We saw in the newspapers yesterday that the Manildra Group's donations to the Liberal Party exceeded $200,000 last year. In the absence of the production of these documents, we are entitled to conclude that where there is smoke there will be fire. I look forward to seeing the documents about this matter.",SENATE,<title>FUEL: ETHANOL</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-02-05,"—by leave—I also take note of Senator Ian Campbell's reference to the ethanol matter. I want to raise concerns about the time factor in relation to providing these documents to the Senate. The documents are very important to the function of the Senate, but they are equally important to the sugar industry. I ask Senator Ian Campbell to attempt, through the minister, to assure the industry that the benefits from the ethanol actually flow through to the producers in the cane industry.
I realise that it is state legislation that affects that control. By way of explanation, when a farmer delivers his cane crop to the mill, at the point of the mill accepting it, ownership of that cane transfers to the mill. All the products from it—the sugar and the gas—are then value added to the benefit of the mill. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Ian Campbell—
—On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: I think that these comments are outside the standing orders. The statement I made was in relation to the timing of the tabling of documents. It did relate to ethanol and Senator Harris is raising very important issues, but I think that this issue can be discussed at other times. We are going into the detail of policy and even state government policy. They are important issues but I think that if Senator Harris wishes to comply with the standing orders he might raise these issues at another time.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Harris, could you raise these issues at another time and be more relevant to the matter being debated?
—Further to the point of order—
—I have ruled on the point of order.
—Senator Ian Campbell raised a point of order and I am speaking to it. In my opening comments I clearly indicated to Senator Campbell that my reason for giving the explanation related to the importance of the documents being provided to the Senate. I think I have sufficiently conveyed to Senator Campbell the reasons for that importance. If he does not want the remainder of that on the public record, I am quite happy to speak to him privately.",SENATE,<title>FUEL: ETHANOL</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-02-05,"—by leave—I am very happy for things to be put on the public record. My point of order was to ensure that they are put on the public record at the right time. It is an important debate. I am not trying to gag Senator Harris. I do not want to hear from him privately. I am happy for him to have it on the public record. However, I think the standing orders demand that the Senate deals with things in an appropriate and timely manner and that subject can be dealt with later.",SENATE,<title>FUEL: ETHANOL</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-02-05,"—Before the adjournment yesterday I was saying that the world should not be taken in by Saddam's militaristic rhetoric. He knows that he can really only count on the Republican Guard if it comes to a real fight. He knows too that, in the time-honoured tradition of his country, if he miscalculates and brings disaster down on the people, they will finally deal with him.
These are not things with which Australia or any other country should concern itself. Regime change is not a legitimate policy option for anyone other than the Iraqi people themselves. Bringing democracy to Iraq is not an option either. There is only one genuine parliamentary democracy in the Middle East and it is not an Arab one—it is Israel.
The legitimate objective of current diplomacy—and we must accept that this may have to become a war aim—is to render Iraq no longer a threat to its neighbours and to the wider world. The Prime Minister will also visit Jakarta on his trip next week. It is important to include Indonesia in the consultative process that Australia is going through over Iraq. It will also, as the Prime Minister has said, be an opportunity to thank President Megawati for the way in which the Indonesian authorities have handled the aftermath of the Bali bombings.
The Iraq issue and terrorism, as others have stated, are not directly linked. Getting Saddam to stop being a threat to his neighbours is one issue and terrorism, in which Iraq is implicated, is another. But godless terrorism is a threat to every nation in the world. Countries in this region have an opportunity to fight it now before it becomes a more widespread and deadly problem. Of course it is dangerous and of course it puts Australia in harm's way, but it is a job that has to be done. I am keener than anyone else to avoid Australian casualties in the defence forces or anywhere else. It is also appropriate at this point to state that I have had many submissions from people who, for the best of motives, oppose the deployment of Australian troops in the Middle East. I appreciate what they are saying and where they are coming from, but what they are saying basically amounts to indecision. However, I submit that indecision cannot be the answer. If we are trying to avoid war, indecision now may in fact generate war and loss of Australian lives. Decisiveness and unity now may well avoid it.
In the post September 11 environment, a rogue state through its terrorist surrogates can only bring about global calamity. In this context, Saddam Hussein must disarm or must be disarmed. Our country's current diplomatic efforts and deployment of Australian forces are, in my view, appropriate responses to a growing and murderous threat to peace-loving nations. Together with our friends and allies, we need to send Saddam the message that we are strong and that we will prevail.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2003-02-05,"—The Bush administration's efforts to build a case for war against Iraq using intelligence to link Iraq to al-Qaeda and the development of prohibited weapons has created friction within the US intelligence agencies. That is according to officials of the US government on Monday of this week. Some CIA analysts have complained that senior administration officials have exaggerated the significance of some intelligence reports about Iraq, particularly about its possible links to terrorism, and they have done this to strengthen their questionable political argument for a war against Iraq. 
On the other hand, at the FBI, some investigators said that they are baffled by the Bush administration's insistence on a solid link between Iraq and Osama bin Laden's network. President Bush claimed in his State of the Union address last week that Iraq was protecting and aiding al-Qaeda operatives. But US intelligence and law enforcement officials said the evidence was fragmentary and inconclusive. `It is more than just scepticism,' one official said, describing the feelings of some analysts in the intelligence agencies. The official said:
I think there is also a sense of disappointment with the community's leadership that they are not standing up for them at a time when the intelligence is obviously being politicised.
The Gallup poll published on Monday showed a majority of the public polled in France, Germany, Spain, Britain and Russia were against war against Iraq in any situation. The poll, which sampled 1,000 people in each of the five countries and the US, showed that Spain—whose government has backed America on the crisis against Iraq— led the poll with 74 per cent of the people saying that they were against any strike on Iraq. One French weekly paper said the poll asked whether people would either be totally against military intervention in Iraq, be in favour of a strike only if authorised by the UN, or support a unilateral strike. The overwhelming evidence of course was that they were against any strike at all. In Russia, 59 per cent were against war.
This is not isolated to the countries I have mentioned. Yet yesterday we heard the Prime Minister deliver his statement on Iraq to parliament, aimed at influencing domestic opinion behind his government's stance before taking his arguments on a whistlestop trip to America, Britain and Indonesia. He has acknowledged that his government does not enjoy popular support for its position, and he has also stated, `It is evident that the community wants as much debate as possible.' It is highly unlikely that the debate we are having here will be sufficient to satisfy the wants of the community.
The Prime Minister also stated that his trip will be an opportunity for him to convey directly to the President the views of the Australian government on matters relating to Iraq. And yet, at the end of the day, the Australian government is essentially governing on the mandate of the Australian people. The Prime Minister then must convey the views of those who gave him that mandate. Of course, those views do not support action against Iraq. Those who support the Labor Party's position that there should be no military action taken to disarm Iraq without the authority of the United Nations are in the majority. Labor will support a decision of the UN Security Council to enforce resolution 1441 in the event of Iraq's noncompliance, and Labor will not support a US military attack made on a unilateral basis.
However, although Mr Howard has tried to win public support for strong military action against Saddam Hussein, he said on Monday that he would be prepared to take action even if it remained unpopular action in the view of the people. He said:
I will try very hard to put my case, effectively, to the Australian people, but this is one of those issues where while one listens very carefully to what people say ... in the end we have to do what we believe is right and I believe that what we are doing is right and I intend to continue with what we are doing.
They are the words of the Prime Minister. Mr Howard is making commitments to the Bush administration, an administration whose intelligence agencies are saying the evidence about Iraq being connected with al-Qaeda is fragmentary and inconclusive and who have been quoted as saying that intelligence is being overpoliticised.
In making these commitments to the US, the Prime Minister is not conveying the views of the people he was elected to govern. He is no more than a puppet, with the Bush administration pulling the strings. The Prime Minister is saying that his trip, and his access to President Bush, showed the importance of Australia in the UN and in the solution in Iraq. Firstly—and we need to be very clear on this—the Bush administration has already stated that America would continue with a pre-emptive strike without the backing of the United Nations. Secondly, an area where John Howard has avoided questions is that of the cost of the Australian deployment to date and the likely further cost to the Australian people. That is the financial cost, let alone what human cost may be involved. The deployment of the SAS, frigates, FA18s and air refuellers was budgeted to cost $200 million in 2002-03. Given the higher intensity of any likely operation in Iraq, the cost could be as high as $300 million to $500 million. The government has not been clear on costs in anything it has said publicly. 
But to bring all this into perspective, we have the Bush administration so preoccupied with the war on Iraq that it has evidently lost sight of the war on terror. Wasn't it both the Bush administration's and the Howard government's punchline that all this was war against terrorism? It is incredibly simplistic to say that a war with Iraq is a war on terrorism. As mentioned earlier, even US intelligence have questioned the Bush administration by saying that their evidence is fragmentary and inconclusive. Why now the focus on a pre-emptive strike on Iraq when there are plenty of other contenders? The Federation of American Scientists has identified 33 countries that are believed to have weapons of mass destruction, including nations with very poor records on human rights and known past links to terrorists. Are we now saying all is forgiven in their cases? After 11 September 2001 a terrorist network linked to Afghanistan was uncovered. Recently those links with al-Qaeda have been traced to many countries, such as Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Iran, Syria, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, along with some of the former Soviet republics near Afghanistan. Iraq has been perceived as at most a minor player on this list. How serious then are we all about a war on terrorism? General Brent Scowcroft, a former national security adviser to Republican presidents Ford and Bush Sr, has commented:
The central point is that any campaign against Iraq, whatever the strategy, cost and risks, is certain to divert us for some indefinite period from our war on terrorism.
Even Australia's former Chief of the Defence Forces during the Gulf War, General Gration, could not have made it clearer when he said:
It is not in our national interest to get involved in a US (non-UN) operation ... I don't believe in pre-emptive strikes.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-02-05,"—We are now into the second day of the debate on the ministerial statement on the government's decision to `pre-position'—as I think is the description being put forward by the government—Australian troops in the Middle East in light of the situation of potential war with Iraq. Last year the Prime Minister said that he would consult the Australian people prior to making any decision in respect of the deployment of Australian troops to the Middle East. That commitment has clearly not been kept. One would have thought the easiest option for the Prime Minister would have been to have raised the issue in this parliament prior to any decision being made. Of course, having made the decision, which seemingly came out of the blue, the justification given for it was that we would increase the pressure on Saddam Hussein in respect of the position that he had taken over the disclosure of alleged weapons of mass destruction.
I am not sure how one can conclude that, with all the might of the US and British military heading towards the Middle East, much of it already having arrived, sending an almost token Australian presence would somehow cause Saddam Hussein to cave in and fess up where he is hiding all of the weapons of mass destruction. Frankly, that justification just does not wash. We have now had a statement in this parliament that is supposed to be further justification, an explanation as to why the decision to have a forward deployment of troops has been taken, and the Prime Minister has been reported in various papers as having said that he believes what he has done is right. I have read the ministerial statement a few times and it is certainly my view that you really cannot find real justification for the decision that has been made.
You know a Prime Minister is in trouble when a ministerial statement contains the statements of other persons, particularly those in opposition who have been in a representative position—in this case, Mr Beazley, the former Leader of the Opposition. You know a Prime Minister is in trouble when they put into ministerial statements statements by others to try to justify a decision that they have taken that they know actually reneged on a commitment to the Australian public. The Prime Minister has not justified his decision. If the Prime Minister were completely honest with us, he would say what he did. He would say, `Look, George Bush, the President of the United States, rang me and, because he was in some difficulty because so many countries were starting to question what the United States was doing, he needed some support from somewhere and he asked me, the Prime Minister of Australia, to give him that support. I took a decision to do that, because that is the reality here.' That is what the Prime Minister has done; that is what the government have done—and that is what they should say they have done, because at least that would be being honest. The government come in here with a ministerial statement that talks about anything and everything without giving any real justification for the forward deployment. If there is one thing in the statement that might be considered to be a half-reasonable position for sending troops into the Middle East if there were to be a UN sanctioned attack on Iraq, it would be the fact that you might say, `At least they are there and they are becoming acclimatised to the conditions within that region.' That would be a half-reasonable justification for taking a step of this nature, but there is nothing else of justification—not one thing—in the statement. 
We all know the allegations with regard to the weapons of mass destruction; we all know that primarily they do exist. Whether Iraq has destroyed any of them or none of them we do not know. We can make all the statements we like, but we simply do not know. We have to come down to the decision that was taken for the forward deployment of troops. As I said, it is my view that the Prime Minister is not being honest here. The reality is as I said. The President of the United States has rung the Prime Minister. I quote the Prime Minister from an article written by Karen Middleton in the West Australian:
I listen to people, but in the end I'm charged with the responsibility of doing what I believe in my heart is in the best interests of this country ...
I ask the Prime Minister and the government: what is in the best interests of this country with regard to the decision that he and the government have taken with regard to the pre-positioning of Australian troops in the Middle East? What aspect of that decision is in the best interests of this country? If it were the case that the UN and the Security Council were certainly going to take a decision to say to Iraq: `Look, you've had the time, you haven't complied. Given that you've had 12 years, one year'—however much time you state—`you just haven't complied with the decision of the world community, the requirements of the world community, in respect of weapons of mass destruction; you have been dishonest and we are going to authorise military action that will lead to the removal of those weapons, the destruction of them, and the removal of your capabilities as a country to produce them,' then you could say, `We are fully justified in any approach.' But what is in the best interests of this country?
Generally, there is little that the US has done for us, except when you go back in the history of this country when there is no question about the importance of the alliance with the United States from a military point of view. But we are looking at an action that, on the one hand, seems to be little needed. The justification given by the Prime Minister originally was: `We're going to send the troops over there to pre-position them, and that is going to bring great pressure to bear on Saddam Hussein.' So Saddam is sitting there staring at the might of the US and British military and all of a sudden, when the Australian forces come trundling across, he says, `Oh no, the Australians are coming, so I must fess up.' That just does not wash—not now and not at the time that the Prime Minister said it. There is no justification that the decision that has been taken is in the best interests of this country. The US has never considered any action in terms of our agricultural interests, nor did it back in 1991. Frankly, that is why I will support the opposition's amendment and I will support the Democrats' amendment to that amendment. I will not support the Greens' amendment. Should the UN Security Council take a decision—which it probably should, given some of the evidence—if Iraq does not come clean, then action is justified and it should proceed.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-02-05,"—As I have been sitting here listening to Labor Party speakers contributing to this debate in the last day and a half, I have had a sense that this is not the late summer of 2003 but the spring of 1938. Indeed, there is something of a flavour of the 1930s about this debate. For it was in the spring of 1938, on 27 September 1938, that the Labor caucus unanimously resolved that the Labor Party would not support Australian involvement in a European war to stand up to Hitler. Mr Curtin told the House of Representatives on 27 September 1938:
Our view, based on an acute realization of all that has happened to Australia in the last twenty-five years, is that the wise policy for this Dominion is that it should not be embroiled in the disputes of Europe. I have said before and I say now that we have not the power to solve or appease them; and we should not risk the lives of our own people in an endeavour to achieve what appears to be doubtfully possible. The wars of Europe are a quagmire in which we should not allow our resources, our strength, our vitality to be sunk ...
As the months ticked by and the threat posed by Hitler in Europe became more and more apparent, Curtin realised that he had made a terrible error. As his very sympathetic biographer Lloyd Ross writes:
The desire to avoid involvement in war carried ... Labor ... to the edge of disaster. Labor traditions of internationalism were long forgotten. There was no knowledge of Hitler's ideology and ambitions, no recognition of the threats to Australian security.
Now, two-thirds of a century later, the Labor Party is repeating the same error—once again, it is behind the game—but there is this difference: this time nobody can say that we are not aware of Saddam Hussein's ideology or agenda. The United Nations Security Council has insisted that he disarm and he has refused to do so. We know that from the findings of the United Nations' own agency, and in particular the findings of Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei.
Let us not forget what this debate is about. It is about disarmament. It poses three questions: when does the international community use force? By what process does it decide to use force? What is the role of the United Nations in that process? 
One of the statesmen who founded the United Nations was the American Secretary of State Cordell Hull. In September 1943, Cordell Hull said this:
It is abundantly clear that a system of organised international co-operation for the maintenance of peace must be based upon the willingness of the co-operating nations to use force, if necessary, to keep the peace.
The whole basis of collective security is based, first of all, on the concept of pre-emption—the very concept that is invoked against Saddam Hussein. It is the attitude that says, `We will remove a threat to peace before it develops into a war and, if necessary, we will use force to do so.' And that is the second point: the whole international system is based on the notion that force may be used to remove threats if necessary.
A process developed over the decades through the United Nations has established certain protocols and criteria by which force will be used. In this case, what the United Nations Security Council has done over the last 12 years has been to pass no fewer than nine resolutions concluding that Iraq poses a threat to world peace and that it must disarm both in the interests of the stability of its own region and for the sake of the peace of the world. It has insisted that Iraq disarm and it has established a body, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, UNMOVIC, to supervise and police Iraq's compliance with that sequence of UN resolutions, in particular, resolution 1441. Nobody doubts the neutrality of UNMOVIC, of Dr Blix or of Dr ElBaradei. We know that last week they reported to the Security Council, and this is what Dr Blix said:
... Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance—not even today—of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace. 
So the United Nations processes have resolved and declared that Iraq is in material breach of the series of resolutions culminating in resolution 1441. Now it is up to the United Nations to enforce its decree.
The United Nations predecessor organisation, the League of Nations, was destroyed and the world was thrown into a terrible war largely because it failed to enforce its sanctions against Italy when Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935. That weakness of will, that failure of policy destroyed the League of Nations and hurried the world into the yawning chasm of the Second World War. The United Nations cannot allow the same thing to happen again. It cannot allow a weakness of will among any of its member states, including any of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, to weaken its determination to stand up to the new Hitler. If it does, then the liberal democracies of the world must take action of their own. That is what Prime Minister Blair, a social democratic Labour Prime Minister of Britain, and President Bush, a conservative Republican President of the United States, have jointly declared, as has our own Australian government.
There was something sad and pathetic in Mr Crean's speech to the House of Representatives yesterday. Mr Crean spent most of his speech attacking our ally, the United States, and barely did he mention the threat that everyone knows is posed to international and regional security and stability by Saddam Hussein—as if our ally were the enemy. The Labor Party have not learnt the lessons of the 1930s, and the way they are travelling at the moment they seem bound to repeat them.
Let me deal with the suggestion, because it is about in this country, that the United Nations Security Council is the sole arbiter of international legality. It is not. The United Nations Security Council is a political body; it is not a court of law. It is simply wrong—it is a legal error—and it is political blindness to say that anything the United Nations Security Council resolves is sanctified and anything that the United Nations Security Council does not sanction is forbidden. Let me give three examples. The intervention in Kosovo, which saved so many lives, was not sanctioned by the United Nations, yet how many lives were saved because the Clinton administration resolved to intervene in that territory? Twenty years ago, the Falklands War was not sanctioned; it did not proceed under the auspices of the United Nations. And in 1962, when the Kennedy administration intercepted the missiles on the way to Cuba and so forestalled a threat to the territorial security of the United States, that was not sanctioned by the United Nations either.
The United Nations has decreed and declared that Saddam Hussein must disarm. It must now enforce its decree lest it run the risk of going the way of the League of Nations. But, if it does not, the Western democracies, led by Britain, Australia and the United States, are entitled and, I believe, politically, strategically and morally obliged to intervene to protect the liberal democracies of the world.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-02-05,"—I rise in this debate—
—It's a hard act to follow, Hoggie!
—It is not hard at all, I can assure you, Senator Kemp. The current debate generally degenerates in the broader community into an anti or pro war, anti or pro peace, or anti or pro United States position. That is the unfortunate way in which the debate tends to degenerate because people do not seek to find out the full range of facts that must apply in such a debate. To me, the debate should really be about how we as a nation play our part as a responsible international citizen. This may well mean being, in some instances, anti war or pro war, anti peace or pro peace, but it means taking a responsible position to ensure that the general wellbeing, the general good and the common good of people are preserved such that they can live in reasonable freedom and liberty and enjoy no fear of persecution and repression in the society in which we live.
Having said that, I must say that I have a longstanding respect for the alliance that Australia has had with the United States. That alliance has served this nation well. It has served us and the best interests of the defence of this nation over a long period of time. However, I stand critical of the inept handling of the Iraq issue by the Howard government, including in particular our relations with the United States and our Asian neighbours. That factor has been forgotten in this debate. While the Prime Minister has been toadying to the United States and going cap in hand, he has forgotten the repercussions of any of our decisions on our near neighbours in the South-East Asia region. They have been put completely out of the question. Of course our neighbours do not understand our motives. The government are not about to explain to the Australian people or to our near neighbours how we think, why we think it, what we do, how we do it and the reasons for the way in which we go about our business. So there is this air of cynicism by the Australian people about the approach of the government—and rightly so—and there is this air of cynicism by our neighbours about the way in which a major player in the region, Australia, behaves. 
This issue comes about because of terrorism. Everyone deplores terrorism. No-one wants it and no-one wants its consequences. Everyone wants to live in peace. That is the easy path to go down; that is the easy position to adopt. There are conflicts around the world and they are a fact of life, and they bring horrendous consequences to the people in the countries where they are occurring and to neighbours and other nations as well.
In the Iraq debate, Labor has consistently and repeatedly called for all appropriate and peaceful means to be used to resolve the noncompliance by Iraq with UN resolutions to disarm. At the centre of this debate is the noncompliance by Iraq. As alluded to by Senator Brandis in his speech on this issue, there are a number of resolutions in the United Nations Security Council on this issue of noncompliance, and the noncompliance has been going on for a substantial period of time. The issue is this: when do you say, `Enough is enough; we have had enough; the noncompliance has to stop; we now are looking for the appropriate compliance to take place by Baghdad'? On every occasion that Hussein has been given the opportunity, he has effectively thumbed his nose at the processes of the United Nations. Nonetheless, in spite of that, Labor has gone down the path of repeatedly and consistently saying that the processes of the United Nations have to be used. Labor's response has not been the erratic knee-jerk response of the Howard government. Labor has advocated going down the path of the UN, who people must remember first authorised action against Iraq for its irresponsible action of invading Kuwait, as the proper and legitimate vehicle for the resolution of the continuing impasse with Iraq.
As I and others have mentioned, UN Security Council resolution 1441 of 8 November last year went through a number of issues, including identifying the number of resolutions that have been taken on this issue in the UN Security Council. It went into the noncompliance with council resolutions and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles and the threat that they pose to international peace and security. Part of resolution 1441 deplored the fact that Iraq has not provided an accurate, full, final and complete disclosure as required by resolution 687 of 1991. That 1991 resolution was taken more than 11 years before resolution 1441 was taken. People cannot claim that in that period of time Hussein, who runs an abhorrent regime, did not have time to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations. That is a key factor that must weigh on the minds of people in this nation when we determine our final position after we hear the outcome of the reports to the United Nations.
That is what Labor has been doing. Labor has been consistently going down the path of the United Nations. Hans Blix's report cast real doubts about the issue of chemical weapons, biological weapons and missiles. It was a strong report. A subsequent report is still to be brought down by Blix, this week or next week. But there was and still is a need to see that the UN process draws to its logical conclusion. Labor has not sought to pre-empt the outcome of the United Nations process at this stage. Labor has consistently said that the process needs to be seen through to its logical conclusion. Having said that, Labor has said it would support the outcomes of the process. That has been consistent in the resolutions of the party since April last year. This is in marked contrast to the actions of the Howard government. The behaviour of the government shows a blind, slavish following of the US-led initiative on Iraq. The mean and tricky Howard government did not come clean with the Australian people about their commitments or undertakings that must have been in place some time ago in respect of Iraq, and they still have not come clean today. 
Labor's consistent position has been to support the outcomes of the UN. Clearly, it is difficult to predict the outcomes of the UN, but, in the end, Australia must play its role as a responsible member of the UN. This may entail some difficult decisions. We will need to be cognisant, in the wake of any UN decision, of our relationships with the US and our Asian neighbours. That has been completely ignored by the government in this particular issue. Saddam Hussein runs a reprehensible regime that thumbs its nose at the UN. Subject to UN support, Australia should play its role in the support of UN-backed intervention in Iraq if that comes about. Australia had no difficulty in participating in other UN sanctioned actions, such as in INTERFET in East Timor. This saw the commitment of ground troops in a combat role. Australia also played a role, as people know, in UNTAET. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-02-05,"—I want to put on the record my strongest opposition to any attack on Iraq. This is a very important debate. It is in marked contrast to the very shallow rhetoric that we have so far had to endure from the Bush, Blair and Howard team about the US being forced to take action against Iraq. The fact is that Iraq has not threatened anyone and is not a threat to the US, to Australia or to anybody else at this time. We need a rational, truthful debate that does not rewrite history, does not ignore international law and that does take a cold, hard look at what kind of war this is going to be and what the long-term implications will be for Australia and its troops, for Iraq, for the United Nations and for world peace. It can be hard for people to sort out the truth from the lies, but, fortunately, over the last few weeks no shortage of eminent, well-informed and experienced people have come forward to correct the record and to point out how stupid and irresponsible the Bush, Blair and Howard team is being.
The Prime Minister said yesterday that Australia did not need to wait for any UN authorisation, arguing that `the terms of UN Security Council resolution 1441, together with previous resolutions, already provide sufficient legal basis for military action without further resolution'. Scott Burchill, who is a lecturer in international relations at Deakin University, says this view is highly contested by most credible and independent international lawyers. Even it if were true— and there are grave doubts—this would only be an authority to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. There is no mention of regime change in any of these resolutions, and it would be for the Security Council to determine this, not individual members. 
Richard Woolcott, a former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and our last representative on the Security Council in 1985-86, has reminded us that the fundamental role of the UN Security Council is to preserve peace, not to authorise war. He says the case has not been made that Iraq and Saddam Hussein are a threat to anyone, much less to Australia. He says Iraq has been well contained and is much weaker than it was in 1991, and that any regional ambitions Saddam Hussein had were thwarted at that time. The fact is that Iraq was much more dangerous and much more heavily armed when it was a great friend of America— when it was fighting the Islamic state of Iran, for instance. In fact just one month after 5,000 Kurdish men, women and children in the Iraqi city of Halabja were killed from a cyanide based chemical weapon in March 1988, America resumed the shipping of components and materials for weapons of mass destruction.
History tell us that you can never take at face value the arguments mounted by people determined to go to war. We cannot assume that they are driven by justice, moral virtue or global peace. Right now in America, one in every two people believes that Saddam was responsible for the attack on the World Trade Centre. John le Carre says: 
... the American public is not merely being misled. It is being browbeaten and kept in a state of ignorance and fear.
Like the majority of Australians, I ask: where is the evidence for the claim, repeated ad nauseam by the Prime Minister, that Iraq still has weapons of mass destruction? Hans Blix says that he has not found them and that his weapons inspection team is not being obstructed in looking for them. President Bush declared yesterday that an empty cylinder had been found that would have or could contain chemical weapons. Is an empty cylinder the most serious threat facing world peace? Our Prime Minister says he believes that Iraq's `aspiration to develop a nuclear capacity' might be sufficient reason for Australia to join in pre-emptive action. It is about as difficult to prove that you do not have an aspiration as it is to prove that you do not have weapons of mass destruction. Is an aspiration okay as a reason to attack another country, and how does that sit with international laws? These are questions that have not been answered in this place.
We are not heading off to a war against Pakistan, which not only has aspirations but also has nuclear weapons and has threatened to use them. As justification for attacking Iraq, the Prime Minister says that only two countries stand accused of breaching the nuclear non-proliferation treaty: Iraq and North Korea. At least these two countries have signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The only reason Israel has not breached the treaty is that it refuses to sign it. Pakistan and India are not even authorised by international agreement to possess nuclear weapons, but the Bush-Blair-Howard team is not rushing off to declare war on these countries. 
Yesterday, the Prime Minister was defensive about Israel, talking about the courageous efforts of Ehud Barak, whose generous offer to give the Palestinians the `bulk of their demands' was `repudiated' by Yasser Arafat. Like so much of what the Prime Minister is saying, this is untrue. Barak offered to negotiate only a small percentage of the Palestinian territory that Israel occupies, in spite of United Nations resolutions. The Prime Minister talks of the murderous pattern of suicide bombing that continues to be inflicted on the Israelis, but not of the 35 years of brutal, illegal and humiliating occupation inflicted on Palestinians. Mr Howard claims there is already a mountain of evidence in the public domain about Iraq's nuclear capacity. Perhaps he thought that by saying this that there would be no need to actually produce the evidence. Australians are not that stupid, and that is why so many of them are saying this war against Iraq is wrong.
Scott Ritter, a former UN weapons inspector, says in his book War on Iraq that in 1998 nuclear infrastructure and facilities had been 100 per cent eliminated. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Mr Ritter, who describes himself as a card-carrying Republican, has called the President a liar over his claims that Saddam Hussein is a threat to America and said the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction would have been detected by satellite by now. He says Iraqi scientists would still have the knowledge to reconstruct these weapons but this would be a very gradual process and would not be possible while weapons inspectors are there. Ritter says that suggestions Iraq may have nuclear weapon capacity or be on the verge of attaining nuclear weapons are nonsense. Gamma particle atomic radiation from the radioactive materials in the warheads would have been detected by Western surveillance, as would the centrifuges needed to enrich uranium. The former UN Under-Secretary General, Count Hans von Sponeck, told the Sunday Herald that he too believes the West is lying about Iraq's weapons program. He visited the Al-Dora and Faluja factories near Baghdad in 1999 after they were comprehensively destroyed on the orders of UN inspectors. He returned last July and said both plants were still wrecked. 
Of course, the nuclear infrastructure that Iraq once had did not come out of thin air, although President Bush might want us to think so. The recent United States Senate report said:  
The US provided the government of Iraq with dual use licensed materials which assisted in the development of Iraqi chemical, biological and missile-system programs.
The 12,000 page inventory produced by Iraq includes a list of its weapons of mass destruction suppliers. This inventory was, by all accounts, edited by the United States before being handed on to the 10 non-permanent members by taking out the chapters on procurements in Iraq's nuclear program and Iraq's relations with companies, representatives and individuals for its weapons of mass destruction programs.
Former UN weapons inspector David Albright said in the Guardian that there would be widespread embarrassment if the extent to which Western companies had supplied Iraq's weapons was known. Yesterday the Sydney Morning Herald listed details of the suppliers. Iraq's weapons came from the United States, China, France, Great Britain, Russia, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Sweden. Of course, the United States sold Iraq the most, with 24 American companies as well as the United States departments of defence, energy, trade and agriculture trading weapons of mass destruction. Both Hewlett Packard and Tektronix provided nuclear weapons components. Nelson Mandela said a few days ago, `It is a tragedy what is happening, what Bush is doing to Iraq.' He condemned President Bush as `a president who has no foresight and cannot think properly'. He said that Bush `is now wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust'. He said, `Because they'—the Americans—`decided to kill innocent people in Japan, who are still suffering from that, who are they now to pretend that they are the policemen of the world? If there is a country which has committed unspeakable atrocities, it is the United States of America. They don't care for human beings.'
I expect that the holocaust that Mr Mandela was referring to was a nuclear war. In the 50 years since America dropped its devastating bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, treaties and agreements to not use nuclear weapons pre-emptively have successfully stopped nations using the many thousands of much more powerful nuclear bombs that have been developed and stockpiled since. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech. I have circulated it in the chamber.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The serious question not addressed by the Prime Minister yesterday is will a pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons trigger an escalation of nuclear weapons in so-called rogue states and would this result in a catastrophic nuclear war?
We cannot assume this is a remote possibility—the rhetoric from the Whitehouse is not cautious. Last week STRATCOM said the US would shatter Iraq “physically, emotionally and psychologically” using 800 cruise missiles in two days— twice the number launched during the 40 days of the Gulf War. These will presumably be loaded with depleted uranium as they were in the Gulf War.
America has now effectively removed the distinction between conventional weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons. President Bush says the US Administration will use nuclear weapons if necessary. What will make their use necessary? We don't know.
A few days ago, American Nuclear weapons analyst, William Arkin, Senior Fellow at the John Hopkins University said the US Strategic Command is compiling potential target lists with planning focussed on roles for nuclear weapons on underground facilities. Apparently STRATCOM knows where they are. Perhaps they should tell the weapons inspectors!
These bombs are euphemistically called bunker busters. When asked about this report, Whitehouse spokesperson Ari Fleischer said that all military options were available.
Last Sunday, the UK Defence Minister Geoff Hoon went further “Saddam can be absolutely confident that in the right conditions we would be willing to use nuclear weapons.”
What are those right conditions? We don't know and Mr Howard probably doesn't know either, despite committing our troops to this war
Just yesterday the Prime Minister said the use of nuclear weapons had been ruled out by the United States. Why is it that he is the only one on the team saying so?
Oxfam wrote to all parliamentarians a few weeks ago with advice on the current condition of Iraq and its people: 
Iraq's economy is already devastated. Child mortality rates have rocketed since the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990. Up to 16 million people—more than two thirds of the population—already rely on a fragile system of food rationing for their survival. Even with the food rationing system set up by the international community, malnutrition is widespread, especially among women and children.
The water and sanitation system is on the verge of collapse. Most urban homes get piped water but two thirds of it is untreated. In rural parts of central and southern Iraq, only 46 per cent of homes have piped water. In the towns, the trucks that empty cesspits and septic tanks aren't working properly because there are no spares, tyres or batteries. Sewage flows back into people's houses.
The Prime Minister admitted that sanctions and containment have had little influence over a dictator who cares nothing for the wellbeing of his people. That suggests to me that every effort should be made to find an alternative. It also suggests that attacking the country with nuclear weapons and cruise missiles will not bring wellbeing to ordinary Iraqis.
Even if Saddam Hussein is overthrown what will be left of the country, what is the long term plan and who will take over control of Iraq?
There has been a lot of speculation about this being a war about Iraq's considerable reserves of oil. The Prime Minister rejects this, saying if the US had wanted low priced oil it would have done a deal with Iraq to lift the sanctions years ago.
But commentators say this is about control, not access to cheap oil. The US has no interest in the cheapest possible oil. It needs the price to be maintained at a level high enough for profits but low enough to encourage consumption and avoid inflation.
Tony Walker, for the Fin Review, says Australian officials in Canberra are understood to have had preliminary talks with their American counterparts in Washington about the possibility of BHP Petroleum and Woodside sharing in some of the post-war action in Iraq.
The Democrats say we have a right to know if this is a war for oil as so many suspect.
There has to be something more to this dangerous and costly war than disarming a country that, on all available evidence, is not armed.
Richard Woolcott said “War is not, in fact being “forced” on the US, as Bush said in his State of the Union address. The truth is that an unnecessary war is being forced on Iraq.”",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2003-02-05,"—This debate on the situation in Iraq and whether or not Australia should be involved in any possible military action to produce a change in the governing regime in Iraq is of vital interest to the Australian community. One might ask: what is the case against Saddam Hussein and where do most Australians stand on the question of military action? In my view, most Australians believe that Saddam is an evil man who has committed hideous atrocities and suppressed human rights in his country.
According the United States Department of State, the atrocities Saddam has committed include the use of poison gas and other war crimes against Iran and the Iranian people during the 1990-98 Iran-Iraq war. Iraq also summarily executed thousands of Iranian prisoners during that war as a matter of policy. Another atrocity committed was the Al-Anfal campaign in the late 1980s against the Iraqi Kurds, including the use of poison gas on cities. In one of the worst single mass killings in recent history, Iraq dropped chemical weapons on Halabja in 1988, in which as many as 5,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed.
Crimes against humanity and possible genocide against Iraqi Kurds in northern Iraq have also been committed. This included the destruction of over 3,000 villages. The Iraqi government's campaign of forced deportation of Kurdish and Turkomen families to southern Iraq has created approximately 900,000 internally displaced citizens throughout the country.
Another atrocity is the crimes against humanity, and possibly genocide, committed against the Marsh Arabs and Shiah Arabs in southern Iraq. Entire populations of villages have been forcibly expelled. Government forces have burned their houses and fields, demolished houses with bulldozers and undertaken a deliberate campaign to drain and poison the marshes. Thousands of civilians have been summarily executed.
Saddam's record on human rights is especially heinous. The executive summary of the report of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, entitled Iraq: a population silenced, states: 
In 1979, immediately upon coming to power, Saddam Hussein silenced all political opposition in Iraq and converted his one-party state into a cult of personality. Over the more than 20 years since then, his regime has systematically executed, tortured, imprisoned, raped, terrorized and repressed Iraqi people. Iraq is a nation rich in culture with a long history of intellectual and scientific achievement. Yet Saddam Hussein has silenced its scholars and doctors, as well as its women and children.
	...	...	...
The Iraqi people are not allowed to vote to remove the government. Freedom of expression, association and movement do not exist in Iraq. The media is tightly controlled—Saddam Hussein's son owns the daily Iraqi newspaper. Iraqi citizens cannot assemble except in support of the government. Iraqi citizens cannot freely leave Iraq.
The executive summary concludes:
Saddam Hussein has given the Iraqi people a terrible choice—to remain silent or face the consequences. But despite his regime's attempts to silence the Iraqi people, their voices are still being heard.
One of the most pertinent questions in this debate is that of whether or not Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction. The International Institute of Strategic Studies assessment states that Iraq has made substantial efforts to avoid revealing the location of its weapons of mass destruction and has not participated in their subsequent destruction. Just prior to the Gulf War, Iraq was on the verge of being able to produce sufficient amounts of highly enriched uranium that `would have allowed it within two to three years to produce its first nuclear weapon' according to the IISS statement. The IISS believes Iraq still harbours nuclear potential—the scientific and technical expertise remains and Iraq's core nuclear teams are `in place working on various civilian projects'.
In addition, the institute believes that most of Iraq's key biological weapons facilities emerged unscathed from the Gulf War. It says:
By the time UNSCOM's work ended in 1998, it was only able to account for a portion of Iraq's BW munitions, bulk agents, and growth media. Again, Iraq retains the expertise and industrial capability to produce agents quickly and in volume if desired. 
Over the years, since the end of the military action to evict Iraq from Kuwait, Saddam— as Senator Brandis pointed out in his speech—has failed to comply with many United Nations resolutions that he disarm. Disarmament was, in fact, a requirement of the ceasefire agreement at the end of the Gulf War. Saddam has also frustrated the work of the United Nations inspectors, leading to the withdrawal of UNSCOM in 1998. In these circumstances, it is impossible, in my view, not to come to the conclusion that Saddam Hussein probably has maintained his arsenal and that, but for the imposition of no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq, which have effectively contained Saddam Hussein, Iraq would have been a source of further threats in the Arab world in the years since the Gulf War.
In conclusion, I believe that most Australians do regard Saddam Hussein as an evil man and understand that he has committed hideous atrocities against, and has suppressed the human rights of, his people. I think Australians also believe that Iraq probably does have weapons of mass destruction and therefore believe that it would be preferable for him to be removed from office. Quite clearly, Australians would prefer this end to be achieved by peaceful means and, if military force proves necessary, would prefer it to be under the auspices of the United Nations. The Australian government is seeking a diplomatic solution and a second UN resolution, but it needs to be said that, in the final analysis, evil only prevails when good men do nothing. The people of Iraq surely have suffered enough under the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. Iraq is a potentially wealthy country of 25 million people who deserve to enjoy a better way of life and a well-established civil society which respects human rights. These objectives will, I believe, only be achieved by the removal of Saddam Hussein.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-02-05,"—It is indeed a very healthy sign of a vibrant democracy that we have this opportunity today to debate a major strategic issue for the world and Australia's part in it. It is an issue on which we must provide leadership but, in doing so, we must explain and inform, providing the detail, proper perspective and necessary context. However, I believe that before governments make such momentous decisions they must ensure that the community is well informed of the facts and all of the options without misinformation, propaganda or lies. Unfortunately, where government is so easily swayed by opinion polls which are based on poor information, slogans and emotional reaction, we have the worst of both worlds: a populace which does not understand all the issues and is without any context within which to frame its attitudes, and a government unwilling to lead by providing education and information as to the realities and choices, a government which is hooked on its own sloganeering. 
Today I would like to add some perspective and context to this debate, particularly from the Labor Party's point of view, which is based on the desire to maintain our national independence and our desire to be a responsible member of the world community. It goes without saying that Australia is a small but wealthy country far from the power blocs of the world. We have to make our own way. The policy of the Labor Party in this context is simple. Three legs of policy have emerged or evolved over the last 60 years which are worth restating. Firstly, we recognise the reality that since the early days of World War II we have moved from a relationship of dependence on the United Kingdom to a relationship with the United States which has brought not just defence benefits but a wide range of economic ties based on the same common values. This relationship was formalised in the 1950s as the ANZUS alliance. This alliance has stood the test of time and served Australia well, and it continues to be as relevant in 2003 as it was when it was drafted almost 50 years ago.
Secondly, we have become strong members of the United Nations in every facet of its activity, including the preservation of world peace—the first instance of which was in Korea and the most recent in East Timor. It was the then leader of the ALP, Dr Evatt, who contributed so much and who bound Australia so tightly to the UN charter. Thirdly, we have shifted the focus of Australia to our relationship with Asia, entailing, as it does, matters of security, trade and economic development. This is commonly referred to as Australia's engagement with Asia. In common with the international values of the UN, we also have a number of principal values which underpin our entire approach to national government and our attitude towards the rest of the world. They comprise a commitment to democratic processes, human rights and the rule of law. These legs of foreign policy reflect our geographic reality and the values of our community. Together they are an integral part of our national interest. We are also a multicultural society, hopefully without prejudice, whose aspirations are for greater international cooperation on trade and economic growth based on more open markets in a way that enables the world community to better share the benefits that this interaction brings. That is the context in which we approach the problem with Iraq.
There is no doubt on our side that Saddam Hussein is aberrant in all those values, hence his disdain and contempt for the United Nations and hence our agreement that he is a person whose regime needs to be dealt with simply because he threatens what we and all other members of the United Nations value. Dealing with bully boys who threaten the world order is not a new problem. It is sad for peace-loving people who believe in the shared values of the world community and who work hard to protect it in the common good, and for self-interest of course, that sometimes we have no alternative but to resort to force. That is why we fought so hard and at such huge cost against the likes of Hitler and the Japanese in a global sense in World War II, and that is why we support the United Nations both globally and regionally. 
For those who have reacted on this issue with some anti US sentiment may I also provide some context. When you look at the history of the Western world, commencing with the ancient Greeks and Romans and the development of international spheres of influence, hegemonies, empires and global systems of all different kinds, the primary driving motive has been, in later years, the desire for influence. The nature of this influence has been one of promoting strong common values, including religious tolerance and democratic values, human rights, economic exchange, dispute resolution and the interdependence we have become accustomed to and accept as a given. In our own short history as a nation we have seen two such powers: first, the British, of which we were a direct part, and we continue to cling to the remnants of that legacy; and now, following World War II, the United States. We therefore, as a result of that history, share many of the values of those powers and continue to benefit from their influence. 
In modern times these powers have made major economic, social and cultural contributions to world development. There is no doubt that their driving force was self-interest, but the result has been global gain simply because of the economic value that this interest brought and the inevitable interdependence which grew from it. While it might seem a contradiction to some, the broad self-interest of such national powers as outlined above and the total health of the international community are one and the same. It would be nice if the ideal of an international government once promoted by Woodrow Wilson and others could be achieved, but the realities are different. The continuing differences of view in the UN between the major powers is evidence of that and, indeed, the history of the UN is such that, without the support of the principal power, the US, it would have been pretty ineffective.
Put simply, we do need to be realistic about the power structure of the world and how it works. Maintaining peace is indeed paramount. Further developing economic growth internationally will continue to promote interdependence. It would seem that, in the absence of any better model, the growth in democratic processes and having more liberal and open markets is a formula which works well, albeit imperfectly. For those who are critical of the US and of the history of its foreign policy some understanding is needed, because it has not always had a policy of isolation and withdrawal, as some might argue. Nor are the American people a warlike people who fight without good cause.
From its earliest colonial days the US has been a major international trader, fostering its own interests and the interests of the world economy in which its own and everyone else's interests prosper. It has rarely, if ever, been an imperial nation with territorial possessions. We may sometimes be critical of the missionary zeal with which it has promoted the values on which US society is built, but it must be remembered that those values are often our values too and we equally benefit. 
So, in dealing with Saddam Hussein, we need to consider the larger picture. We need to understand what is at stake here, and it is much more than the behaviour of a minor dictator. There are many minor dictators in the world, but they do not attract the same attention. It is about the lawful regulation of the world order and of the way in which the stability of the international economy is dependent on it. And, yes, there is some self-interest, and I suggest that as Australians we have a vital interest for the same reasons the US and UK do. Firstly, we are committed members of the UN and we need to know that there are members of the Security Council who have the will to make the UN live up to its charter. When the US brings its weight to bear to have the UN enforce its own resolutions to properly deal with crises of security worldwide, we should support that approach. We need access to markets and resources and, as a member of the global community, our interests should not be at the risk of being held to ransom by a madman.
We need stability in the Middle East, as a major market, and in a world which is threatened not so much by major conflagration but by the insidious behaviour of minor groups with narrow ideological bents who draw their support from regimes like those in Iraq and other countries. Equally, we need to support the principles of the UN, which we on this side were key proponents of through H.V. Evatt. While ever Saddam Hussein thumbs his nose at those values and principles set in the UN Charter, we are obliged to have him mend his ways. Saddam's reputation does not bear repeating in detail, but he is a killer. The abuse of human rights in Iraq is indeed a major issue. 
In summary, apart from the particularities of Saddam's sins there is a much broader view of the importance of this issue, and it is one which goes much further than the particular self-interest of the US or the UK, as some allege. It is one where we should not be distracted by the rhetoric and the spin doctors. It is about protecting global interests. At heart we all prefer peace, but we have a choice: we can leave Saddam to continue to threaten the stability of the world order as we know it, or we can do something about it. There seems to be no disagreement from anyone— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-02-05,"—Like so many other Australians I find it extremely difficult when talking about this issue not to get intensely angry at the government's dismissal not only of the views of this parliament but also, most importantly, of the views of the Australian people. In making a decision to send Australian troops over to be involved in a war in Iraq, Prime Minister Howard is putting US economic interests ahead of the lives of Australian men and women in our defence forces and ahead of the lives of Iraqi civilians. In doing so, I believe that he will be condemned by history and by the Australian people for making this decision. So far the role of parliament in this decision has been reduced to a farcical sideshow. Despite the Prime Minister's assurances that there would be full parliamentary debate, even today there remains no resolution before this chamber whereby the elected representatives of the people of Australia are able to make a decision voting for or against Australian involvement in a war on Iraq. Instead, the Prime Minister has made that decision and his denials are convincing absolutely nobody.
I said six months ago in my first speech in this chamber that a war on Iraq cannot be justified. Nothing we have heard from Mr Howard, Mr Blair or Mr Bush since that time has changed this situation. The government purports to have provided the public with a case to justify Australian involvement in an invasion of Iraq. Instead of accurate information about the situation, we have been given distortions, partial reports and, on occasions, outright lies. The misinformation that this government has associated itself with cannot be overstated. We have seen it in the form of continuously fruitless attempts to link Saddam Hussein to Osama bin Laden. We have seen the US administration editing Iraq's weapons declaration to the United Nations to remove embarrassing information about the involvement of Western corporations and governments in arming Saddam Hussein. And these are not isolated incidents. Without accurate information about the situation, people are in no position to be able to assess the government's claim. Instead, they are expected to blindly follow our government's leaders into a course of action which will have tragic consequences.
It is preposterous for anyone to argue that all peaceful options to resolve this conflict have been exhausted. The United States continue to bulldoze all attempts at diplomacy, refusing to let the United Nations continue to do their work and undermining alternative suggestions that have been put forward by other countries, and instead pushing ahead with their own agenda and their own timetable. We have seen no serious debate about the alternatives to war. We have not seen the necessary discussion about the need for an international effort to support the people of Iraq to establish their own democracy. We have seen no discussion about a redirection of even a fraction of the military spending to address the problems of poverty and structural injustice that sit at the base of issues in the Middle East. Instead, we are being presented with a fait accompli that military action is the only way to resolve the situation. The Australian people will not accept, as the government is trying to make us accept, the expectation that they believe the only way to liberate the people of Iraq is by bombing them. Such a proposal is preposterous.
Throughout this debate we have seen from political leaders and parliamentarians a complete lack of moral responsibility. I find it astonishing to see the extent of buck passing from some MPs and some political parties who seem unprepared to take responsibility for the courses of action they are advocating. Instead, they would rather offload this crucial decision to the United Nations. If the United Nations is bullied by the US into letting them go ahead with their war, that does not remove the responsibility of Australian parliamentarians to decide what our course of action should be. For politicians to take a position on Australian involvement in a war on Iraq which boils down to saying, `The war is just if the United Nations says so,' is to fail a crucial moral test. Any debate must deal with all consequences of such a decision. I was appalled yesterday to hear the Prime Minister give a 34-page statement to the House of Representatives supposedly outlining the case for war and not once deal with the horrendous human consequences of the decisions that he is making. It is crucial that any country that is making a commitment to war has a real and absolute understanding of the inevitable human consequences of such a decision. 
In this war, soldiers from the United States, Australia and Britain will be protected by the massive military technology imbalance between our countries and Iraq. There is a chance that Australians and others will be killed, but it is a certainty that thousands or tens of thousands of innocent people who are not Australian, British or American will be killed.
They will be blown to pieces, they will be maimed and they will die in pain and in fear. Their homes and their businesses will be destroyed, and their families and communities ripped apart. Many of them will starve and a whole generation will be traumatised. These things are a certainty and they are our responsibility. These deaths will weigh on the conscience of our nation throughout the course of history. Once a decision to wage war has been made, the consequences are unavoidable. We must bring back the troops before it is too late and we must say no to a war on Iraq. I know that I speak on behalf of millions of Australians and many more people all over the world when I say that I am angry about this war. I am angry about the decisions being taken by the Prime Minister.
—Should we have fought against Hitler?
 (Senator Bolkus)—Senator Brandis, you are out of order; you are not in your correct seat.
—I am angry that this government's decision will affect the lives of ordinary men, women and children who happen to live under a vicious dictator in Iraq, and that this means so very little to Mr Howard, Mr Blair and Mr Bush. A war on Iraq cannot be justified. If the opposition ultimately supports a war under a UN sanction, the Greens will continue to state that any involvement by Australia in a war on Iraq is immoral. We will join with Australians who, like many millions around the world, will take to the streets to call for peace on the weekend after next. We are proud to be a part of this movement; we are proud to stand up and speak for peace. It would be fantastic to see some moral courage from parliamentarians in this chamber so that they come on board and show a genuine commitment in calling for peace.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-02-05,"—I will restrict my contribution to the debate this morning to the intellectual argument underpinning much of the opposition to Australian involvement in the military action in Iraq. The United Nations, particularly the Security Council, is at the heart of international efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein. Australia and her allies are devoted to the UN process. The UN of course has a tough job—I think all of us recognise that. Despite its failures it remains our best hope for international peace.
When the UN, in particular the Security Council, gives its authority to act, nations tend to do so with greater diplomatic and political authority for their actions. It makes it much easier for governments to justify to their people and internationally that military or other action is warranted. That is why the vast majority of Australians support military action in Iraq only if it is authorised by the UN Security Council: so that the Security Council might supply political and diplomatic authority for military action.
This might all seem rather mundane and obvious, but it follows from this that the failure to obtain UN Security Council approval means that the political and diplomatic hurdles are much greater. Perhaps they are insurmountable. But the argument developed over the last day or two by the vast majority of the Labor Party and many of the Democrats—and this is their key argument—is that a UN Security Council failure to sanction military intervention in Iraq not only makes political and diplomatic battles far more difficult, but also any Australian military action would lack moral legitimacy. That is the key argument. 
To restate, the vast majority of those opposite are now arguing that UN Security Council authorisation makes military action morally legitimate. If you do not have Security Council endorsement, your military intervention lacks moral—not political and diplomatic but moral—legitimacy as well. This very curious argument underpins the entire opposition case: that the UN Security Council, and in particular the five permanent members, are somehow moral arbiters; that somehow the collective national self-interests of the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and China constitute some sort of ethics board to duchess military action with moral legitimacy.
There is some evidence, of course, that Russia and France have interests in Iraq that they may wish to protect. Does their veto mean that military intervention lacks moral authority? That is the Labor argument, and it is not a very good one. Labor's argument is that the political and economic interests of the five permanent members of the Security Council equate with moral legitimacy. This is, of course, ridiculous. The moral legitimacy of military intervention in Iraq has nothing to do with the Security Council, though, as I say, it may have a lot to do with the political and diplomatic strength with which a country might operate.
Labor is now sanctifying the Security Council with Saint Augustine's capacity to determine a just war. Let us briefly test this thesis. For example, during the Cold War, according to the vast majority of speakers on the Labor side, the exercise of the Soviet Union's veto would have deprived any military action by the West of moral legitimacy. The Soviet Union during the Cold War as moral arbiter!
The case of Korea springs to mind. If the Soviet Union had turned up to the Security Council meeting and exercised its veto, what the United States and allies such as Australia and New Zealand did in the Korean War would have lacked, according to the Labor argument, moral legitimacy. It is not a strong argument. Take the Falkland Islands war. Britain did the right thing; there is no doubt about that. I remember the Labour Party in Britain, and poor old Michael Foot, waiting for the UN to do something. What did they do? The Security Council did not act. Britain acted unilaterally with some Australian support and did the right thing. Once again, veto or inaction by the Security Council cannot constitute moral authority. Again, the UN under threat of a Russian veto did not intervene in Kosovo to stop the slaughter of ethnic Albanians, giving rise to the horror of ethnic cleansing. No-one here would argue that the unilateral action by the United States and some NATO allies was not justified. Again, moral legitimacy does not flow from the Security Council. Despite your best efforts, it does not work. 
If anyone thinks that the General Assembly is any better, and that somehow it is a greater moral arbiter, I remember that when I was in high school the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution by a majority of 70 to 29 which stated, `Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination.' You cannot say that the Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly are bastions of moral legitimacy. It is a failure to understand history that leads the Labor Party to equate multilateralism and internationalism with moral legitimacy. Multilateralism is so often the talk of the lowest common denominator, not necessarily the voice of justice or a just war.
Sure, we need the UN. It is our best hope for peace and for collective security. Of course the UN processes should be adhered to. It is highly desirable that the Security Council endorses any action in Iraq. All of us would concede that. But to claim that moral legitimacy is spawned from a Security Council decision is rubbish. The Security Council is not the arbiter of morality and that is where the Labor Party gets it fundamentally wrong. Military action in Iraq may or may not be moral—I think it is—but you do not ask the Security Council for its moral code book. 
Let me leave a question, particularly for the Left of the Labor Party, but actually for most of it: if the UN Security Council does endorse military action in Iraq, does that therefore mean that the war is morally legitimate? Does that give the war some sort of ethical sanction? I will leave my friends on the left and their moral vanity to ponder that.
However, there is some agreement around the chamber. In fact, there is a lot of agreement. Indeed, I concur with some of what Senator Nettle said earlier. Saddam Hussein is a murderous dictator. He is a greater threat to his people than anyone else. He murdered the Kurds and the marsh Arabs. His total lack of concern for young men and women, and indeed boys and girls during the Iran-Iraq war in the early eighties, shows that. No-one here is defending Saddam Hussein and I understand that. But do not therefore hide behind the Security Council to make your moral decisions. Do not let the Security Council be the moral arbiter for your conscience: make that decision yourselves.
Let me remind you of what that respected and venerable commentator Alistair Cooke said the other day on Letter from America when he was talking about the beginning of World War II. He said:
... a majority of Britons would do anything, absolutely anything, to get rid of Hitler except fight him.
At that time the word pre-emptive had not been invented, though today it's a catchword.
After all the Rhineland was what it said it was— part of Germany. So to march in and throw Hitler out would have been pre-emptive—wouldn't it?
He went on to say:
And so many of the arguments mounted against each other today, in the last fortnight, are exactly what we heard in the House of Commons debates and read in the French press—
over the last few days. And, very sadly, we continue to hear them from the opposition benches.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2003-02-05,"—Let me make it clear at the outset that I condemn Saddam Hussein and his murderous regime. I always have and I always will. However, I have not heard anyone on the other side make the point that a lot of the weapons—the so-called weapons of mass destruction—that the Americans now want to go into Iraq and take from Saddam were actually supplied to him in the early nineties by the Americans when he was an ally fighting a war for them against Iran. The reality is that two wrongs do not make a right. For us to invade Iraq without the sanction of the UN would be a second wrong. 
The deployment of Australian forces to the Gulf was a mistake. It jumped the gun and undermined the actions of the UN inspections team and the legitimacy of the UN process. No-one can seriously suggest that these forces will not be involved in an attack on Iraq regardless of whether the UN sanctions the action or not. The Prime Minister has already committed young Australians to a war without legitimacy at the moment. That has been confirmed in the past 24 hours by what has occurred and the disclosure of the discussions between the foreign minister and the New Zealand government.
The Sydney Morning Herald reported some interesting statistics on Iraq recently. For example, clean bottled water costs 10 times as much as petrol. Seventy per cent of the 1.7 million children who have died since 1990 did so from preventable sanitation related diseases, according to UNICEF. Half a million tonnes of raw sewage are dumped in fresh waterways each day. The mortality rate of children under five is 10 times as high as that in Rwanda and South Africa. Yet we are expected to believe that this is the nation that poses the greatest threat to world security. You have to ask yourself a question: who will suffer the most if an invasion takes place in Iraq?
For the United States to invade Iraq with help from the UK and Australia, without the sanction of the UN Security Council, would be a tragedy. It would result in the further destabilisation of the region and it would erode multilateralism. These are not just my feelings; they are the feelings of the Australian people. A Newspoll published in the Australian revealed that 76 per cent of Australians do not support military action against Iraq without UN backing. The Prime Minister can respond to this with his usual mantra of `I'm doing what is right, not what is popular.' The reality, in this instance, is that what he is doing is neither popular nor right. 
The uneasiness of the Australian people is shared by most of the world. In a recent Time Europe poll, people were asked which country poses the greatest threat to international security: Iraq, North Korea or the United States. Eighty-three per cent of the 250,000 people who voted said it was the United States. I do not agree with that sentiment, but it does illustrate that being the only superpower left comes with both rights and responsibilities. To outsiders, the Americans— or at least their government—seem to have stopped caring about the international system as such. And how much should we make concessions to the US position on international issues such as global warming, the Kyoto protocol and the International Criminal Court when the US refuses to join in anyway? It seems as if the US wants its own way or else it simply threatens to undermine the international structure that disagrees with it.
As to the legitimacy of American action, Bush's return to the UN has helped. Even US public opinion is considerably more supportive of action with UN backing than without it, and in Europe the difference is even greater. Constitutional lawyer Professor George Williams has been reported as stating that Australian involvement in a war on Iraq without United Nations sanction would be a clear breach of international law. 
The United States argues that two reasons justify invading Iraq: Iraq's support for al-Qaeda and its possession of weapons of mass destruction. The original justification for US action in Iraq was the continuation of the war on terror. While the US has backed off a bit on this, Secretary of State Powell will discuss the al-Qaeda links with Iraq in the UN this week. Unless Secretary Powell presents substantively new evidence, no-one can confidently talk about clear links being established between Iraq and al-Qaeda. General Brent Scowcroft, former national security advisor to Republican Presidents Ford and Bush Sr, commented last year:
... the central point is that any campaign against Iraq, whatever the strategy, cost and risks, is certain to divert us for some indefinite period from our war on terrorism.
If the US is serious about prosecuting the war on terror, there are more obvious nations for it to target. At the moment there is no incontrovertible evidence that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction. While Iraq has failed to provide active assistance to the UN inspections team, they have reported that Iraq has generally complied with its disarmament obligations. The inspections team should be given more time to establish whether Iraq has breached resolution 1441.
The reality is that Iraq is more contained and less dangerous now than it was in 1991. There is time for the inspections to continue. The claims of Saddam Hussein's bodyguard, for example, should be checked out. There was a report in the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney about this person, who is now in the hands of Mossad and who has been in the hands of Mossad for some considerable time. He has identified where these weapons are supposed to be stored. It strikes me as strange that this information has not been passed on to the inspection team. If it has been passed on, why hasn't it been checked and why hasn't it been verified? This is a person who was supposedly closer to Saddam Hussein than even some of his wives were. The claims include the existence of an underground chemical weapons facility and bunkers containing biological weapons.
Unilateral US action would forestall this and destroy any chance of a truly multilateral approach backed up by indisputable evidence of weapons of mass destruction. If Iraq does possess weapons of mass destruction, they are most likely to be used if they are invaded with their backs to the wall. At the moment, however, neither the existence of weapons of mass destruction nor substantial links with al-Qaeda have been established. Without these, there is no justification for action against Iraq. 
Without this evidence, there is the suspicion that unilateral US military action against Iraq would be motivated by the desire to control Iraq's vast oil resources. This suspicion is reinforced by the extraordinarily close links between oil companies and the Bush administration. I do not know if everyone in this chamber saw the 60 Minutes report a couple of months before Christmas in which it was clearly demonstrated that there were convoys of oil trucks 100 miles long heading out of the north of Iraq through Kurdistan, which was charging them a toll fee to pass through the country, into Turkey and out into the Western world. No-one can tell me the US administration was not aware of that occurring. But what were they doing? They had a couple of ships stationed at the other end of Iraq to prevent the oil coming out by sea into the Persian Gulf. What a joke! They did not take action to enforce the sanctions. They knew the oil was coming out, but that was more important than the issue of preventing the loss of lives and preventing further destruction of people within that country.
The importance of the UN as a principle and as a tactic in this particular instance should not be underestimated. Even Tony Blair, Bush's greatest European supporter on this issue, has faced real dissent from within his own party.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2003-02-05,"—I also rise to respond to the Prime Minister's statement on Iraq and I join my colleagues in the Democrats in stating my full opposition to military action against Iraq. Like my colleagues, I also support the amendment to the motion that was tabled yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, and I welcome the ALP's support for the Democrats' amendment to that motion as I believe the members of the United Nations Security Council should be made aware of the position of the Australian Senate. There is one element of the Prime Minister's statement that I do agree with, but for reasons very different to those that he outlined. The burden of resolving the current crisis with Iraq is not a responsibility that should be left to the USA, the UK and Australia alone. It is, in my view, a responsibility for the entire international community to resolve through diplomacy and peaceful means. The clear message of the ministerial statement though is that the forward deployment of Australian troops is designed to put enough pressure on Saddam Hussein so that he will be forced to fully comply with UN resolution 1441 and disarm Iraq of all weapons of mass destruction. In other words, the government would have Australians believe that sending some 2,000 Australian troops to the Gulf to join US and British forces is the only way that anyone will be able to achieve the active cooperation of the Iraqi government, including the elimination of its stockpile of weapons of mass destruction and the cessation of its programs that produce these weapons.
The disarmament of Iraq is an outcome that I believe everyone in this chamber would dearly like to see. However, the question on the minds of many Australians is why our defence forces are being sent to the Gulf to apply pressure when the international community—and indeed the Australian community—is not supportive of this unilateral act by any nation. The accusation that Saddam Hussein has treated the UN resolutions with contempt does not justify another nation treating the United Nations and the agreed procedures of the international community with equal contempt. Yet that is precisely what the Australian government has done, and it is also trying to convince us all that two wrongs do make a right. Rather than adhering to the principles of international diplomacy, the government is prepared to compromise the standing and authority of the very body that the international community established, in the wake of the last world war, to maintain international peace and security. The Howard government is prepared, of course, to turn this international crisis into a crude test of the power of the United Nations. Yet the UN Security Council is the one international institution capable of resolving the Iraqi situation without the need for more bloodshed and additional suffering for the Iraqi people.
I think the Australian government should do everything possible to utilise the extraordinary capabilities of this institution, particularly to build a stronger human rights culture at the international level. The international community has made it quite clear that it is far from having exhausted all diplomatic avenues for resolution of the situation with Iraq. Indeed, some of the permanent members of the UN Security Council remain resolutely opposed to any unilateral action against Iraq and have made it clear that they are prepared to exercise their veto power to prevent such actions. At the present time I believe that the Prime Minister should heed the wise words of Nelson Mandela, who observed: 
If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.
Instead our Prime Minister and the President of the United States are playing on our fears in an attempt to garner public support for their pre-emptive and provocative actions. We have nothing to fear from the Iraqi people themselves. It is their leader who is purportedly playing brinkmanship with the international community, and arguably Australia and the United States are playing right into his hands. US presidential historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr has pointed out that basing a declaration of war on fear, instead of on overt acts of belligerency, is not only illegal under international law and convention but also immoral. It cannot be right to kill a country's civilians because you are afraid of what their ruler might do, yet this is precisely what the Prime Minister is asking Australians to sanction. Why else would the government spend $15 million on its antiterrorism mail-out? It is about blatant scaremongering at its worst.
I also believe there are a number of reasons why so many members of the Australian community do not want to see their defence forces engage in another war against Iraq. In addition to the reasons that I have outlined, many Australians are also deeply concerned about the danger that Australian Defence Force personnel will be exposed to and ask whether this danger can be avoided by exhausting all other diplomatic avenues. As other senators have mentioned here today and yesterday, the Prime Minister is prepared to send some 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel to the Gulf for involvement in a possible armed conflict, the biggest contingent since our involvement in the Vietnam War. Australians are also concerned about the financial cost of engaging in foreign conflict on the other side of the world—not in our region and certainly not on our shores— when countries in our region are also in crisis and in urgent need of support and assistance from Australia. East Timor, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have had serious breakdowns in their ability to maintain law and order. What are we going to do to assist in those cases? It is not surprising then that the message being put out in the media, particularly in yesterday's and today's Australian Financial Review, is that the government is saying that, whether it be in health, education or indeed tourism, we will inevitably have to compromise on our expenditure in these areas in order to take up war.
I think many Australians are rightly questioning whether our involvement in the Gulf at this time really is in the national interest because there are clearly a lot of other courses of action that are more immediately related to our national interest. Similarly, many Australians are questioning the morality of Australians participating in a war that will dramatically add to the suffering of the Iraqi people. Lost amidst the cries for war is the recognition of the shared responsibility of states and citizens alike to guarantee the human rights of all people, including the 24 million people of Iraq. These people have already suffered throughout the Gulf War and the following 13 years of crippling sanctions that the international community applied.
Whilst the Prime Minister referred in his statement to the fact that Saddam Hussein has `rorted' the food for oil deal by `violating its provisions and evading its constraints', there is incontrovertible evidence of the devastating effects that this deal and the associated sanctions have had and continue to have on the lives of ordinary Iraqis. In 1999 a UN humanitarian panel reported that under sanctions Iraq has `experienced a shift from relative affluence to massive poverty'. In that same year, a UNICEF survey estimated that over 500,000 Iraqi children had died as a consequence of the sanctions between 1991 and 1998 alone. Yet the international community has looked on with indifference and inaction to the appalling humanitarian cost of its own sanctions in Iraq, in the misguided belief that applying pressure to a civilian population would somehow ultimately affect and remove the leadership. 
A confidential UN assessment warns of `disease in epidemic if not pandemic proportions'. Once Iraq's electrical grid system is destroyed, the consequent disruption to the sanitation and public health systems will cause a spike in water-borne disease and child mortality. It goes on to say that there would be 500,000 direct or indirect casualties—assuming that only a conventional war and not a nuclear war is launched—and up to two million internally displaced persons and refugees. UNICEF has warned that in the event of a war against Iraq and the collapse of the monthly food distribution program that already operates across the country the international community can expect a `nightmare scenario'.
All the concerns that I have referred to have been raised in recent weeks by members of the Australian community, former prime ministers, leaders of the RSL, representatives of the churches, and other ordinary Australians. Yet the Prime Minister in his statement has failed to address the humanitarian concerns or to even acknowledge the moral and ethical questions that an attack on Iraq would inevitably entail.
I close by referring to comments by Martin Luther King in the hope that the Prime Minister will heed them. The wise words of Martin Luther King are:
If we do not act, we shall surely be dragged down the long, dark and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion, might without morality, and strength without sight.
An action in this situation does not have to mean war. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
One matter that I do want to correct in the Ministerial Statement relates to the comparison the Prime Minister has made between the current crisis with Iraq and the situation leading up to Operation Desert Fox in 1998.
On page 25 of the statement, the Prime Minister says that these two international incidents are “so similar as to be nearly identical”.
This is simply not the case.
It is not appropriate to compare the current situation with Iraq with the situation that existed in the lead up to Operation Desert Fox in 1998— when Australia pre-positioned an SAS squadron and two refuelling aircraft in the Gulf, and joined with British and American forces in the Gulf.
At that time, the Government also held a debate regarding Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction, after Prime Minister Howard had already given the US President an in principle commitment to send Australian defence personnel to the Gulf as part of the US-led international military coalition.
But in contrast to the present situation, the Opposition supported the involvement of ADF personnel in the US-led coalition.
In further contrast, back in 1998, Australia was only proposing dispatching 190 ADF personnel: one SAS squadron and 2 air-to-air refuelling aircraft—NOT 2,000 ADF personnel.
And perhaps in greatest contrast to the present situation, the majority of Australians improved of Australia sending SAS troops to the Gulf if the US were to launch an attack against Iraq (according to a Morgan Poll taken in February 1998).
There simply was not the same level of anxiety and concern in the Australian community that the ADF personnel would be involved in an actual war. Nor did the US Government at the time flag the possibility of a conflict that could involve the deployment of nuclear weapons against the Iraqi people.
Today, the Government does not have the support of the Australian Democrats, or the ALP, or the Greens to send Australian forces to the Gulf without such action being sanctioned by the international community through the United Nations.
Nor do we believe that the Australian people support this forward deployment of ADF personnel, without the international community calling for it.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-02-05,"—On 11 September 2001, with the terrorist attack on New York and Washington and its horrific effect, the war on terror began. It is worth noting that Australian lives were lost on 11 September, along with lives from 80-plus other nations. As the United States President said then, and our Prime Minister reiterated, this is a war that will be fought like no other because there is no front line. It would be a war long and protracted; above all it would be difficult and demanding on society. The truth is that the free world's security would never be assured again and liberties would be curtailed. 
The Australian government, with the full support of the people of Australia, joined this war in defence of our hard-fought freedoms. We could never have imagined that the Bali terrorist attack would entwine us even more in this war. Our determination, along with our powerful allies, has resulted in success that has assured us a measure of security— for example, the comprehensive arrest of the Bali bomb plotters. The Taliban regime fell very quickly in Afghanistan and al-Qaeda was put on the run. Many al-Qaeda operatives have been arrested or eliminated. Across Europe and Asia other terrorist connected organisations have been flushed out and dismantled or scattered. Behind this successful drive has been the policy of pre-emptive strikes—that is, to go out and meet your enemy before they have a chance to destroy you; to neuter their plans and their networks.
There can be no other sensible and more effective policy than pre-emptive strikes when fighting a shadowy enemy—an enemy who is not seeking firstly to take your land, towns or cities but an enemy who clandestinely attacks because they hate and seek to destroy your lifestyle, philosophy and religion. If we are to secure for the future our Western values and beliefs, all possibilities of links to terror must be pursued. Iraq has a clear link to terrorism, a link that threatens regional and global security. The Iraqi regime has been a sponsor of terrorist organisations, a harbourer of terrorists, a keeper of weapons of mass destruction, a user of weapons of mass destruction and a pursuer of a nuclear arsenal.
In the best interests of Australia and world security, action must be taken to disarm the Iraqi regime. Who is willing to gamble on the silk-thin line that now separates Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorist groups? How could we take such a gamble post September 11 and post Bali? The consequences are grave and the risks cannot be taken. In fact, not to intervene would almost ensure that the terrorist groups link with Iraq.
The United Nations over the past 12 years has been pursuing that very point—that Iraq must disarm for the sake of international security. For 12 years Iraq has evaded the resolutions of the United Nations for it to disarm. It is beyond doubt that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction. In 1998, when Iraq forced the first United Nations inspection commission to leave the country, the commission confirmed the presence of chemical and biological weapons, nerve agents and other weapons of mass destruction.
Today the Iraqi regime is still ignoring and avoiding the United Nations. The chairman of the United Nations weapons inspection team, Hans Blix, after 60 days in Iraq, unambiguously reported that Iraq was violating the United Nations Security Council resolution 1441 to disarm. As Blix said, `There is no genuine acceptance by Iraq to disarm.' It is therefore essential for the credibility of the United Nations and for world security that it enforces its resolution 1441. This means that, if all diplomatic channels fail and the next inspection report is the same as the last, military force becomes the only resort to force this dictator to meet his international obligations.
Because the military option has been looming as likely for some time, it has been necessary for the United States, Britain and Australia to be prepared. That is why forward deployment has been undertaken. It has had the dual effect of providing the necessary time for our forces to be prepared and, moreover, to display the will to enforce resolution 1441. It is because of the build-up of military force on Iraq's border by America and its allies that Saddam Hussein has cooperated to at least allow United Nations inspectors back into the country. 
In this debate there is a clear dishonesty from the Left, which is epitomised by the comment from the Greens senator, Bob Brown, when he said, `More people are afraid of George Bush than they are of Saddam Hussein.' The intellectual and moral dishonesty of that statement is nothing new. It was the rationale during the Cold War to equate communist Russia as a moral equivalent to the United States—that is, a dictatorship is morally equivalent to a democracy. That belief permeated the Left during the 70 years of communist rule. That belief even stretched to defending the Stalin regime and all its brutality. While governments of the Western world defended freedom and democracy, many of those enjoying that freedom and democracy intellectualised that moral equivalence. The wall was up and oppression and massacres took place, but the anti-Americanism, which represented Western democracy, was always attacked. History proved just how bankrupt the Left's views were. History will also show that their support for Saddam Hussein's regime through their anti-Americanism will also be found to be morally bankrupt.
The Australian government does not recoil from its full support of our alliance with the United States. We stand by it. What emotional frauds many in this chamber were after September 11. How quickly they forgot what happened to the world that fateful day. How quickly their hate for America and our alliance rose to the top at the expense of all else, not least the Iraqi people themselves. In reality, the so-called `peace team' are joining Saddam's privileged elite, because no-one else in Iraq is his friend, especially not the people of Iraq. Outside his elite, the people hate Saddam and they will not fight if an attack eventuates. The Geneva based International Crisis Group conducted an extensive survey of Iraqi opinion in October last year. The report was notable for the surprising honesty and bravery of the people it surveyed. They overwhelmingly supported the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, even if it meant an American led attack, which would be seen as liberating them. 
Before any Australians jump on the Left's bus to Baghdad, they ought to be aware of Saddam Hussein's record towards his own people. Amnesty International has catalogued the human rights atrocities of this dictator in a report published in August 2001 entitled Iraq: Systematic torture of political prisoners. The brigade from the Left should also speak to the women of Iraq who are brutalised physically, psychologically and culturally. A report published in December 2002 by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the UK on the human cost of Saddam Hussein's policies graphically describes the atrocities towards women. I quote from a part of that report:
The heads of many women have been publicly cut off in the streets under the pretext of being liars, while in fact they mostly belonged to families opposing the Iraqi regime. Members of Saddam Hussein's gang have raped women, especially dissident women. The wives of dissidents have been either killed or tortured in front of their husbands in order to obtain confessions from their husbands. Women have been kidnapped as they walk in the streets by members of gangs of ... (Saddam's sons) and then raped.
Even the children of Iraq have suffered under the corruption of this regime, which diverts revenue from the oil for food program developed by the United Nations towards Saddam Hussein's opulent lifestyle, his personal guard and his power elite. The truth is stark in regard to this regime but the Left cannot handle the truth.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-02-05,"—I do not think there is anyone in the Australian parliament who would try and prosecute the case that Saddam Hussein is a humanitarian. However, in considering this issue about this proposed war, the one question that constantly comes to my mind that still has not been answered is: why now? Why, in 2003, do we need to go to war? What are the conditions that make war appropriate in 2003 and not appropriate at any other time in the last 12 years? At the end of the Gulf War, the Iraqi military were defeated. There were no forces capable of resisting the allied attack and yet the attack was stopped after only four days. Why did the allies stop? It would seem now, 12 years later, we are going to get a rerun.  
President Bush was on television the other night making claims about not wanting to watch a rerun—he even said it was a bad rerun—of Iraqi noncompliance. So, just to differentiate the US from Iraq, we are going to get a rerun of the Gulf War. However, this rerun does not have the legitimacy of the Gulf War provided by the United Nations. As is often the case, sequels normally do not live up to the original. No sovereign nation has been invaded, as was the case 12 years ago. So what do we get? We get a trumped-up series of claims about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, that they have biological, nerve and nuclear weapons, and if we do not do something right now they will use them— after all, they used them on their own people. They are the publicly stated grounds for war. That is why it is now, and not at any other time during the last 12 years when they supposedly had these weapons. Well, that just does not cut it.
What about North Korea? Don't they have weapons of mass destruction? Of course they do, but for some reason they are exempt from the current debate and the focus of this government. They are to be allowed to keep these weapons of mass destruction, apparently, but Iraq, who it is alleged also has them, cannot. There may be a different view amongst ordinary Australians, I fear, about this war if we apply the same rules to other nations as we will apply to Iraq. The reality is that we have adopted one rule for Iraq and another for North Korea or, for that matter, the rest of the world. North Korea is on the public record as stating that it is reactivating its nuclear weapons program. Let me see if I have this right: there is no clear evidence so far that Iraq has nuclear weapons, North Korea is actively developing them, so we have to invade Iraq. The logic is inescapable; there is no logic. We are prepared to kowtow to the North Koreans but we must get Iraq. So the weapons of mass destruction argument just does not hold up. Therefore there has to be another reason.
As some of my colleagues have pointed out to me in recent days, a diversionary attack is a standard military tactic. You divert the attention of the enemy by attacking somewhere else to mask your real intentions. So perhaps this attack on Iraq is a diversion. What could it be a diversion from? Following the dreadful events in the US on September 11, the President of the United States stated that he would use the full resources of the US to hunt down and destroy al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden—the war on terror, as it became known. The US and its allies, including Australia, attacked the Taliban in Afghanistan. After a month, the Taliban and al-Qaeda were pushed from power and it appeared that the war on terror was won. However, a disturbing picture has emerged: no Osama bin Laden, and al-Qaeda, although damaged, was still operating. Had President Bush and his allies not won the war on terror? As time went on and al-Qaeda operatives committed additional atrocities, it appeared that the war on terror was ongoing: no Osama bin Laden dead or captured, and al-Qaeda still operating.
I recollect that it was early last year, at about the time that people started to realise that the war on terror was not over, that the talk about Iraq started. In fact, President Bush used his State of the Union address last year to start building the case. Some would say that America whistled and Australia responded like a good little lap-dog. For months last year, our country—our country, based in our region—was leading the charge against Iraq. After all this time we are about to participate in the largest diversionary attack in history. It is designed not to fool the Iraqis or the North Koreans—it would seem that they are not easily fooled at all—but so that the American and Australian public do not ask a lot of awkward questions about the failure of the war on terror.
Let us be clear that the war on terror has failed in its primary aims. Al-Qaeda continues to operate, with all the atrocities that that involves, and there is no proof that Osama bin Laden has been killed. The full resources of the United States have failed to deliver for the international community. We now see that the American involvement in Afghanistan is ongoing and that there are few signs that the warlords are now prepared to operate within a functioning democracy. The failure of the war on terror also opens the case for the aim of the war with Iraq. This is not simply an issue of disarming Iraq, although that is the objective that is most talked about. President Bush, it would seem, is not averse to the idea of regime change. But what does regime change really mean? Could it mean a compliant Iraqi regime run by an Iraqi currently in exile? Could it mean a regime that will need to be propped up for an indeterminate period of time? Or are we seeing a future Iraq where a new strongman is held in power by a US military garrison? We need answers to all these questions before we embark on this folly.  
For many people the real worry about a war with Iraq is what will happen once it is over. There is little support for a war with ambiguous aims that is conducted outside the auspices of the United Nations and without any real justification as to why now. The Americans have had ample opportunity in the last 12 years to seek a military solution to the issue of Iraq. Until now they have failed to act because there was no clear case for such action. They have failed to convince world opinion that there are such grounds now, and that is why this war should not be supported without a UN resolution to justify it. 
There is no compelling case for Australians to be preparing to invade Iraq. There is no reason our service men and women should be anywhere other than in Australia or East Timor. Australia needs to look to its own interests first. Only if there are compelling reasons in our national interest and if the action is supported by the United Nations should we ever become involved. The current debate and the current actions of this government are a sham and Australia should not be participating at this time.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-02-05,"—A major threat to world peace and security is Iraq's continual refusal to adhere to international obligations on weapons of mass destruction. For over a decade Saddam Hussein has thumbed his nose at the world in relation to international law and United Nations resolutions which require Iraq to disarm these weapons. It is imperative that Australia and our allies apply pressure on Iraq, as it is only by demonstrating the consequences of noncompliance that the peaceful, diplomatic resolution the world desires can occur. It is necessary to show Iraq that it is at the request of not only the United States but also the larger world community that it disarm these weapons of mass destruction. The international community needs to increase pressure to turn Iraq's cooperation from passive to active, as it is only via military threat that Saddam has accepted the resumption of United Nations weapons inspections.
This is especially necessary when we consider Saddam's track record in ignoring the rest of the world on all issues, including human rights matters. I think it is important to draw attention to a few of these human rights matters. Since the beginning of the 1980s, hundreds and thousands of Kurds and Shia Muslims have disappeared. Their cases remain unresolved. In a campaign of mass arrests and killing of Shia activists, the Ayatollah Baqir al-Sadr and his sister were executed in 1980. In 1983, 18 members of another Shia family were arrested, of which six—all of whom were religious leaders— were executed. In 1987-88 the campaign of attacks on Kurdish villages had Amnesty International estimating that more than 100,000 Kurds were killed or had disappeared during that period. In the last 18 months, a number of prominent Shia Muslim clerics have been killed in southern Iraq in circumstances that suggest that they may have been extrajudicially executed, possibly by government forces or forces acting on government orders. 
Since 1991, according to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, 94,000 Kurdish individuals have been forcibly expelled by security forces from their homes in the north to areas controlled by the two Kurdish political parties in Iraqi Kurdistan, on the basis of their ethnic origin. A 20-year-old Kurdish businessman from Baghdad, who was married with two children, was arrested in December 1996 outside his home by plain-clothes security men. Initially, his family did not know of his whereabouts, and started going from one police station to another, inquiring about him. Through friends, they found out that he was being held in the headquarters of the General Security Directorate in Baghdad. The family were not allowed to visit him. Eleven months later, the family was told by the authorities that he had been executed and that they should collect his body. His body reported evidence of torture: his eyes were gouged out and filled with paper, and his right wrist and left leg were broken. The family were not given any reason for his arrest and subsequent execution. However, they suspected that he was executed because of his friendship with a retired army general who had links with the Iraqi opposition outside the country and who was arrested just before the young man's arrest and also subsequently executed. 
Every day in Iraq, Kurdish people and people of many other ethnic minorities are suffering at the hands of Saddam Hussein and his supporters. Based on this evidence and Iraq's shocking human rights record, we cannot any longer go on expecting that one day Saddam will do the peaceful thing and disarm his weapons of mass destruction. It is quite the opposite; it has already been 12 years. With the spreading threat of terrorism, it is time that the world stood up and put a stop to this stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons. If it had not been for the actions of the United States and Great Britain, the weapons inspectors would not be in Iraq now. 
Previously, Iraq has shown no hesitation in using chemical weapons—for example, during the Iran-Iraq war. Many of the victims of that conflict are still in Iranian hospitals, suffering from the long-term effects of the numerous types of cancer and lung disease associated with these types of weapons. In 1988, Saddam also utilised mustard gas and nerve gas agents against the Iraqi Kurds in northern Iraq. According to Human Rights Watch, up to 5,000 people were killed and 10,000 or more were injured. The use of chemical warfare and Saddam Hussein's method of controlling his civilian population are not very diplomatic behaviour, and yet this was against his own people in his own country. Saddam ensures that there is no-one else in power in Iraq. Members of the opposition abroad have been the targets of assassination attempts conducted by Iraqi security services. Army officers are vital informants for Saddam's regime. Any officers suspected of having ambitions outside serving the Iraqi president are immediately executed, even to the degree of taking pre-emptive action against those who Saddam feels may pose a threat to him.
I certainly would prefer to see a peaceful resolution to this crisis, and I know that the rest of Australia would as well. Although the government believes that the UN processes should be allowed to continue unhindered, it is only through the support of Australian troops that a dangerous man such as Saddam Hussein will be pressured—and that is the emphasis—into taking some positive action to ensure that the weapons of mass destruction are disarmed. The deployment of Australian forces in the Persian Gulf is the same as the action that we took in 1998, which was supported then by the opposition. The ultimate aim of sending troops is for Australia, as a supportive non-Security Council member of the United Nations, to assist in maintaining pressure on Iraq to enable a peaceful end to this international crisis.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-02-05,"— The opposition's amendment to the government's motion to take note of the ministerial statement highlights our deep concern about the gross inconsistency that the government has shown in this pursuit of a war with Iraq. We make it very clear from the start that we support our troops. We support the military forces of this country on the simple basis that they are obliged to follow orders and they do follow orders. We do not support the issuing of those orders. Surely there could be no more important question for parliament to discuss than the question of war. We are asking our troops to go into a war where they will kill and potentially be killed. In those circumstances, it is appropriate that we give very serious consideration to the issues that are involved.
There is great uncertainty about the present circumstances. We have been in a period for the last 10 years in which we have been promised a brave new world which simply has not come to pass. We have been faced with a whole series of quite difficult decisions. The claims that are being made with regard to the regime in Iraq are not really at the core of the debate, because there is no-one here who seriously argues that there is any legitimacy to the actions of Saddam Hussein. However, our position would be stronger if there were greater consistency in the approach taken throughout the world. For instance, if we heard that support for the Kurds was to be part of the debate at the moment, we would be in a much stronger position if we supported the Kurds not just in Iraq but also in Turkey.  
We would be stronger in our determination if we opposed the use of chemical weapons in all cases. We saw with regard to the war against Iran that it was Western companies that supplied the equipment and supplied the materials that allowed those weapons programs to be established by Iraq. We would have a much stronger case if we were to argue that we were opposed to the gross abuses of human rights in all military dictatorships, not just the one in Iraq. Throughout the Cold War, how many military dictatorships were supported by the Western alliance as a bulwark against communism? We would be in a much stronger position to argue that we are in the business of disarmament of nuclear weapons if all countries were required to disarm. But that, of course, weakens the position from which people on the other side have been arguing.
It is an appalling a-historical view that is being presented to us here today, as though we are all mugs, as though the Australian people are mugs who do not understand the complexities of these arguments. We live in an era in which the concept of the great power has fundamentally changed. Since the early 1990s, the United States has been the only recognisable classic great power. Other countries, like Japan, Germany and even those in the European Union, do not meet that criterion because they simply do not have all the ways and means that the United States has at its disposal.
We have seen significant changes in the way the government of the world functions. We have seen the disappearance of a whole range of assumptions that we have come to expect as being the status quo. We live in a period characterised by insecurity and permanent crisis. However, we have also seen the disappearance of the essential acquiescence that people of the world have shown towards the occupation of their countries by colonial powers. Before the First World War, Bosnia was able to be governed by a very small administrative group of people from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Today, it requires 30,000 troops to keep order. We saw in the 19th century in the Sudan General Gordon had a bit of an exhibition of military power. It was not a unique circumstance of our time; there were considerable periods of time throughout the 19th and 20th centuries when small administrative groups could, in fact, run countries. That is no longer the case.
So when we are debating a war in Iraq, we have to seriously think about the consequences of that war. Anyone who understands the events in Mogadishu in 1996, when the United States sent 20,000 troops to that city, would also understand just how difficult the circumstances are likely to be. And the armchair warriors on the other side, who are only too happy to send our troops into a warfare situation without thinking through the implications, ought to bear in mind their responsibilities. They ought to consider the consequences of a prolonged period of occupation of a conquered Iraq. They ought to consider what the implications are in terms of the regional insecurities that are likely to flow from such a war. They ought to consider, particularly from Australia's point of view, the domestic consequences of increasing the risk that Australians will face internationally as a result of participation in this undeclared premeditated move towards war by the Australian government, working in league with the British government and, of course, the United States government. They ought to consider the full implications of those matters.
The United States has been only too happy to launch a whole series of wars in recent times. We have had the war on drugs, we have had the war on poverty, we have had the war on terrorism and now, of course, we have the war on Iraq. It strikes me that the enormous resources, capacities and talents of a country like the United States could well be served and put to better use than they are at the moment, when there seems to be an underlying contempt for any capacity to resolve these issues through the United Nations. Those resources could be used, as I say, to defeat the causes of terrorism: the instability, the insecurity and the poverty in this world. They could be put to greater use in terms of the war on drugs. 
All we have seen today, and what we have seen from a number of serious military analysts, is that the circumstances we are seen to be pursuing in the war that is being proposed are, in fact, detracting from those very important and worthwhile objectives. If there were such a serious question about the war on terrorism, we ought to be having a look at Saudi Arabia. Remember this: 15 of the 19 people who took part on the attack on the United States were from Saudi Arabia. If we were seriously concerned about changing the level of commitment to democratic values throughout the world, we might want to have a look at the long list of countries that have governments which are in power not as a result of due democratic process but as a result of other means.
I ask: what is the implication of embarking upon a campaign of regime change in one particular country? Will that flow through to Egypt? Will that flow through to Syria? Are we now saying that we are going to have a campaign in Iran? There are enormous implications from what is being proposed by this government in unilaterally seeking to invade another country without going through the proper processes of the UN.
Finally, let me deal with the issue of the material breach argument. People say we have circumstances here in which resolutions have been passed and Iraq has not met its obligations. It appears that that is a substantive view held around the world. The arguments for that are very strong, but whether or not that justifies a military invasion is another question entirely. There is a whole series of measures that could be undertaken by the United Nations to prosecute its decisions to enforce disarmament. There is the issue of biological weapons, or germ warfare, which dates back to one of the oldest treaties that exists—back to 1925 if I recall rightly. 
It is appropriate that the full resources of the international community be placed to make sure the world is safe. But does that automatically mean that we should commit to the murder of many innocent civilians as a result of unlawful military action? That is the sort of question that comes up. It strikes me that the issue of the United Nations decision process is paramount. It does not automatically follow, however, that an invasion using military force is appropriate under the present circumstances. This is not just a question for people who have an interest as members of parliament. Significant military figures, such as Major General Alan Stretton, British General Sir Michael Rose and others, have indicated that it is much more difficult than anyone could possibly contemplate.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2003-02-05,"—I rise to speak on this extremely important debate. For many people it is a difficult issue, and I accept that people of good conscience may well differ on this issue. Despite the difficulty of the issue, it is something that we cannot run away from. Of course there are risks if military action is taken, but there are enormous risks if no action is taken and Saddam Hussein refuses to disarm. We all share a common opposition to the horror of war— and that was a point that you made well in your speech, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson—but these horrors already exist under the regime currently in power in Iraq. There are some corners of the world that have bred the most terrible evil, and this evil must be fought.
There are two issues I want to particularly draw to the attention of the Senate today. One is the appalling leadership that Simon Crean has shown on this issue. We have just heard a speech by Senator Kim Carr, who is a leader of the Left in the Labor Party. To think that Mr Simon Crean feels he has to pander to the likes of Senator Carr rather than stand up for the national interest of this nation is absolutely appalling. If you look at Senator Carr's speech you will see the same rabid, anti-American approach taken by a number of Labor speakers who have, unfortunately, chosen to follow Mr Simon Crean in his remarks.  
Not all Labor speakers have followed that road. In the Senate I have noticed that Senator Mark Bishop and Senator Hogg—and there may be a couple of others yet to stand up—have spent quite a bit of time supporting the American alliance and underlying the importance of that alliance to Australia. Senator Ludwig nods in agreement. But that was not apparent in the often insulting remarks by their leader, Mr Simon Crean. Nor was it apparent in the remarks that followed, such as those by Mrs Julia Irwin in the lower house. Of course, we also witnessed a speech by Senator Webber in this chamber in which some of the old furphies of anti-Americanism were pulled out. This does not mean that America is right on every issue, and no-one would say this; but with an issue as grave as this we are entitled to expect that we do not degenerate—as Mr Simon Crean and some of his followers have degenerated—into mindless attacks on the American alliance and mindless attacks on the American President. 
There are Labour leaders who have shown great leadership on this issue. Mr Tony Blair is a Labour leader who has been able to grasp the nettle of how serious this issue is that the world is facing. He is prepared to go out and argue the case and to attempt to bring a divided party with him. Mr Simon Crean does not have that capacity, so yesterday we saw that tragic speech from the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. Certainly, when you think of the Curtins and the Chifleys of this world and, indeed, of the leadership that was shown by Mr Hawke and others in relation to the Gulf War, it is a tragedy just how far the Labor Party has sunk. There is a monstrous evil in this world at the moment. It exists in Iraq and it deserves every action to be taken by the international community to deal with this problem, one way or another. It is important that the Labor Party recognises that there are national interests above and beyond the narrow party interests of a bitter and divided party.
It is interesting, when you listen to members of the so-called Labor Right, how their remarks differ remarkably in tone and content, typically, from the remarks of the Labor Left, to which Mr Simon Crean wishes to pander. Senator Chris Evans—I will say this, and I am happy to say this—is one of the more intelligent people on the frontbench of the Labor Party. He is not someone I agree with always and, in fact, I may not agree with him often, but Senator Chris Evans is one who understands an argument. When you carefully read his speech, you see that there are none of the mindless personal attacks or the anti-Americanism that so marked Mr Simon Crean's speech. But there is a contradiction at the heart of Senator Evans's speech. He makes a point that rather intrigued me as I read his remarks. He said:
There is no doubt that Iraq must be disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein is an evil, dangerous dictator who poses a serious risk to regional and international security.
He is quite right on that. But what does he then go on to say? You read down his speech and he says that no convincing case has been made for the deployment of combat troops. We understand from Senator Evans that this is a dangerous dictator who poses a serious risk to regional and international security. But no action apparently should be taken by Australia. Australia should in fact sit back and let others do the work. Someone has to take a lead in this world. We would have preferred the UN took the lead but, as we know, it is countries like America, the UK and Australia which have put some pressure on the UN to make sure the resolutions that they have passed on Iraq are enforced. Failure of the UN Security Council to enforce the resolutions would be catastrophic for the credibility of the UN and the international system.
But you do not get that feeling from the Labor Party Left. You do not get that feeling from Mr Simon Crean's speech. In the wider community we hear the argument that this is about oil. The Labor Party caucus were clearly told they were not to use that argument because it was a nonsense. It is true I think that when you look through most of the speeches—the ones that I have had time to read—that the Labor Party did not go down that track with that furphy as we see the Greens and the Democrats doing. If the issue were just cheap oil there would be far easier ways to get cheap oil out of the area than to take the action that is being taken. Of course it is not about oil. The Labor Party caucus were told not to argue with us about oil. That did not stop the member for Fowler, but very few Labor Party speakers in this chamber have gone down that route, which occupies the attention of so many letter writers to newspapers these days and the attention of the Democrats and the Greens. 
This is a difficult issue. This is an important debate. I believe the government has shown very important and strong leadership on this issue. Above all, this government is a government which thinks of the national interest. The Labor Party has got it wrong on a few big issues in the last decade. It got it wrong on East Timor. It got it wrong on border protection and, if you listen to Mr Simon Crean, I think we are right to suspect the Labor Party will get it wrong again.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-02-05,"—Yesterday in the Prime Minister's statement he stated:
We must take a decisive action on Iraq.
Further on he said:
We must be clear, unambiguous and decisive.
These are all words to which we relate, but it is actually seeing the meaning behind the words that this debate is about. In this same place in 1991, during a similar debate about war and who was right and who was wrong, my predecessor the senator for Queensland Margaret Reynolds made a series of statements. One of the things she said that still rings true in many of the arguments that we are hearing across the whole parliament now was:
Everyone in this parliament wants peace, but we disagree on the means to ensure it. 
I think that in this debate we must face exactly where we are coming from and what we hope to achieve. There is absolutely— and I do not use the word lightly—violent agreement that we want peace. However, there is a significant difference of opinion as to exactly how we can acquire it. The Prime Minister will be going to America next week—and we have heard a lot of argument about the reason for the visit. But the public statement is that he will be talking with the American leadership about how the Australian community feels about the environment in which we are living at the moment. When the Prime Minister goes it is essential that he speaks from the heart of the Australian community, not from any particular group of interests but from where we as an Australian community want to be. All over the country members of the Australian community have been contacting their elected representatives, of all flavours, and saying that they are worried about this proposed war. It does not really matter what words are used—whether `predeployment' or `deployment' or `preparation for war' or `war'—people are scared. They are writing to and emailing people and saying, `Tell the Prime Minister that we do not want this war. Tell the Prime Minister that we as a community are afraid. Tell the Prime Minister that we are not supporting Saddam Hussein.'
Already in this House we have been hearing the violence of words alleging that various people are somehow supporting the atrocities that are going on in Iraq. It seems pretty easy to talk about the horrors of the abuse within Iraq and about the unquestioned violence that is occurring there. We have heard that discussed in quite clear detail in various speeches in this place. But we have not heard about the horror of war. It is not as if there is a competition about whether war is more horrible than what is going on in Iraq at the moment, but that is somehow where the debate has degenerated. It seems to be worthy to support warfare, with all the horrors that that implies, because there is injustice and violence happening in the community in Iraq. We abhor what is going on in Iraq. We abhor what is going on in a whole range of communities across this planet. There is injustice and there is violence. However, the way to support that is not to encourage further violence. You do not argue with weapons of mass destruction by bringing in more weapons of mass destruction. It does not make it okay to kill people because they are killing others. We share the abhorrence but we do not share the argument.
People are writing in and they are actually identifying themselves by saying, `We are not fringe radical loonies.' We have already heard in some speeches in this place that anyone who would oppose this war would be a `fringe radical loony'. People who are opposing war are not. I have had letters which say, `We who are opposed to this conflict are ordinary'—and I often wonder what an ordinary Australian is, but they identify themselves as being ordinary—`fairly conservative Australians. We cannot bear to contemplate the inevitable mass destruction of life without making a protest. We want our voices heard. When the Prime Minister goes to talk about how Australia is feeling about any proposed conflict, make sure the message picks up that people do not support war.' 
There has been some discussion about the way the war could be fought. It worries me that we are talking about the war being fought, not about the potential that it may be fought but the fact that it will occur. And the media is talking as though it is a laid down solution that there will be war. There should not be any acceptance that it must happen. We must, as we said earlier, share the desire for peace. When we talk about how it is going to happen, people seem to be able to run away from the realities of the loss, the death and the destruction. They seem to be able to run away and talk in sanitised debates, such as we are having here in this place, about how you would deploy troops and how it would operate and what would occur. War is not a sanitised debate; war is the reality of loss and destruction.
We talk about the potential of using nuclear weapons. We hear it is possible that, if there are nuclear weapons being predeployed or deployed in this potential conflict, or if it becomes clear that there will be weapons of mass destruction used in this conflict, we would be able to withdraw. I am at a loss— as Senator Webber has said in terms of the questions that need to be asked—as to how you withdraw when you suddenly become aware that a weapon could be, may be or is a weapon of mass destruction. How do you define that? How do you withdraw? Once you actually start that conflict there is no withdrawal. There is no noble way of withdrawing from that kind of conflict. We need to get that message now. It is too late after the predeployment becomes the deployment.
This debate reflects what is going on across communities in our country. All of us who identify ourselves being as representatives of the people are being contacted by people who say that they need to know what is going on. People have opinions about this issue but they feel as though they are not having their opinions put forward. It is not enough just to use the words. The words seem to flow quite freely and for extended periods of time. It is not enough just to use the words; it is about listening to the meaning behind the words. Hopefully, this is what this debate will achieve. People will have the opportunity not only to have their say about how they feel personally—whilst that is important—but also to convey what the people in the local communities, at the local rallies and in the shopping centres are coming up and saying about how they feel about this process. We get letters that start by saying, `We wish to express the strongest opposition to any possibility of war with Iraq. We are concerned about the build-up of weapons of mass destruction wherever they exist.'
In 1991, when similar debates were going on, a group of women sent some emails around the place on their concerns about war. They made a statement which I echo now and which my predecessor Margaret Reynolds quoted in one of her speeches:
We believe that only through recognising our common needs and seeking to explore ways of settling our differences can we live in peace. We know that conflict will always exist between individuals and between nations but believe that we can work to minimise this and to find creative solutions which do not involve death and violence. War is neither natural nor necessary but an archaic and dangerous way of solving disputes.
That message in 1991 has been real ever since. It is real now. When we discuss in this place—as we must; there is no way that such decisions should not be discussed in this place—that we must take decisive, clear and unambiguous action, we must make sure that the background to that decisive, clear and unambiguous action reflects the need of our community for a peaceful solution and a commitment to saving lives, not killing.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-02-05,"—I seek leave to incorporate three speeches from the Australian Labor Party. The reason these speeches are being incorporated is the time constraints we have this morning. We wish to ensure that the chamber has dealt with this debate prior to our session at 12.45 p.m. The speeches are from Senators Denman, Lundy and Ludwig. 
Leave granted.
The speeches read as follows—
Senator Denman
I am proud of Labor's consistent position on this issue. We have firmly argued for the role of the United Nations Security Council, an organisation with a charter that assigns its responsibility to the maintenance of international peace and security. In these difficult times, when we are experiencing definite threats to world peace and security, I believe—we are—and have been—correct in placing our trust in the United Nations Security Council. To date, the United Nations Security Council has been able to carry out an independent investigation into whether or not Iraq does hold weapons of mass destruction. In my opinion, it would have been wrong for Australia to rush blindly into any military involvement for a war against Iraq, back in September of last year, when this issue first starting heating up—without having the benefit of a comprehensive and independent investigation. It's true on 28 January, this year, Hans Blix, the Chief Weapons Inspector, delivered an inconclusive report that suggested Iraq had committed violations but that there was no firm evidence to support this. The results of further investigations are likely to be reported on 14 February. The coming days are going to be difficult and stressful for so many. The American Secretary of State will address the United Nations on 5 February—he may or may not reveal further evidence concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
However, today, without evidence—without anything concrete—we cannot conclude guilt. We have given our support to the United Nations process, and we must show our patience, commitment, and trust, in following that process through. We must heed the advice of the United Nations Security Council. Labor considers that to speak of war, or even more unwarranted; for the Australian Government to deploy troops is premature, presumptuous and unfair. Especially to those employed in the Australian Defence forces, their families, and, let us not forget all the innocent Iraqi people. The deployment of Australian troops to the Middle East has angered and frustrated many Australians, for our Government led us to believe that they would wait for the United Nations Resolution in relation to Iraq, before acting. Given that the investigations are ongoing; and the United Nations Security Council Resolution has not yet been handed down—Australia should not be deciding on it's course of action, regardless of instructions from the United States of America. However, what is becoming increasingly unclear in recent days, is whether our Government will in fact wait for the Resolution, or whether they will act in support of any unilateral action that may be taken by the United States. Certainly at this point, a persuasive case has not been for the actions that our Government is currently taking and has already taken in preparing for war.
The Labor Party has consistently argued for the role of the United Nations Security Council, regarding any decision on Iraq. Recent opinion polls have shown that the majority of Australians share this view. An AC Age Nielsen Poll conducted on 14 January of this year reflected that 62% of Australians consider that Australia should be involved in a war against Iraq only as part of an United Nations approved force. This poll also revealed that another 30% of Australians opposed Australia's involvement in a war against Iraq. Against this backdrop, it really is puzzling why the Australian Government has decided to act against the wishes of so many Australians.
In speaking today, I make an appeal, on behalf of all of those Australians, to the Executive of the Australian Government—because it is their call on whether or not we are involved in a war against Iraq. This is an important debate—for Opposition Parties it is our only opportunity to make a contribution to this crucial decision, on behalf of the Australian people. I cannot think of a decision more serious or likely to have more dire consequences than becoming involved in a war. I will admit I fall into the 30% of Australians who oppose war. My hope is that we can avoid war. We had avoided a war up until this point by pursuing diplomatic processes, a course of action consistently called for by the Labor Party.
The Labor Party, like all Australians would like to see our Government show leadership on actions that are best for Australia's interests, rather than the interests of the United States. As a nation, Australia has much to be proud of, and protect. We have economic and security interests much closer to home. Weapons of mass destruction can be found much nearer in our neighbourhood and our attention should also be on establishing a diplomatic solution with North Korea. 
I am unconvinced that the `costs of war' can ever justify `going to war'. It would be naive for this vital debate to shy away from the ugly and brutal facts. In supporting a war, we also place at risk Australians—our sons and daughters—with families of their own. For some, involved in the recent deployments of troops, their destiny is already unknown. In a recent article, by my colleague, Carmen Lawrence, Member for Fremantle, she noted that Medact, the British equivalent of Australia's Medical Association for the Prevention of War, estimates that if the threatened attack on Iraq eventuates, between 48 000 and 260 000 people on all sides could be killed. And yes, while these estimates could prove untrue, they do show that war will cost one life too many. Not to mention, the incidence of injury, diseases, or the disruption to communities and infrastructure.

Senator Lundy
We should not be here today debating WHEN we should decide to join the attack on Iraq. We should be debating IF we should go to war at all.
It is important to remember the UN has long worn criticism for being the political plaything of the US. So in the first instance, a UN sanctioned conflict should not and does not necessarily mean that the conflict is principled or morally justifiable. So it is not surprising that the US and Australia for years advocating the importance of the UN.
But the world is headed towards war and it would appear that despite the existence of the United Nations, which is the body established to collectively decide the appropriate action, in this case against Iraq, our Prime Minister is intent on joining a US lead unilateral attack.
This has been proved by the leaked memo released yesterday, confirming what we have been saying all along. John Howard is committed to a war against Iraq.
Continuing the rhetoric of the `War on Terrorism', Bush has mobilised the same terms to argue for an invasion of Iraq. Iraq and Terror are now synonymous thanks to the manipulative political campaign by the Bush administration. The rhetoric of the US president has been repeated by the Australian Prime Minister.
Both campaigns have mobilised divisive and racist sentiment by playing with the notion of the West and the Rest, where Islam is painted as the `Other', something different and dangerous to the Australian `way of life'.
Labor principles and my personal convictions determine that I argue for a more inclusive Australia. In doing so in the context of this debate I reject this appalling rhetoric and have sought to examine the truths of the arguments behind an invasion of Iraq.
Any debate on this issue must include an explicit rejection of racism, and an explicit recognition of the fact that Australia's society embodies a diversity of cultures and beliefs. This cannot be subsumed into John Howard's dichotomised perspective on the world.
The Prime Minister tells us that he doesn't want a war, but his actions speak far louder than these words. Australians certainly do not want war and are smart enough to challenge the propaganda and I commend the community leaders who are speaking out against the Prime Ministers shameless acquiescence to the Bush agenda.
So when Mr Howard tells us he wants to put to President Bush directly the views of the Australian people, we know his real intention is to build his international profile, and to assure the US President that in spite of the widespread opposition to US unilateralism, Australia will remain by Bush's side.
In the United States, support for a unilateral invasion of Iraq remains at 30%, a fraction of the support for the previous invasion of Afghanistan.
There is increasing reluctance in both the United States and Australia to be drawn by spurious arguments of the links between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.
This link remains unproven—American intelligence agencies have acknowledged as such—and so Bush has sought to justify his determination for invasion on other grounds.
Historical resistance on the part of the Iraqi regime to UN weapons inspections and repeated violations of human rights by the regime have been presented as alternative motivations for war.
These are the issues that need to be debated; the divisive and empty rhetoric of Bush and Howard cannot be our justification for war.
Iraq has acquiesced to the obligatory weapons inspections under Resolution 1284 of the Security Council.
American and British pressure on other members of the Council to pass a new resolution, that includes a right to strike as an automatic consequence of non-compliance with the new resolution, has met a cool response from the other permanent members.
France, China and Russia have all emphasised alternative, non-military, resolutions prior to consideration of multilateral military action. 
The Bush administration, however, is determined to follow the latter course by `push[ing] Baghdad into a corner and creat[ing] a pretext for a war they've already decided to wage'.
In rejecting Saddam's acquiescence to the existing UN resolution and persisting in pressuring other members of the Security Council to support this new resolution, Bush is backing Saddam, and the Iraqi people with him, into a conflict they cannot escape.
Howard's support for Bush-style militarism strongly suggests the commitment of Australian troops to this probable unilateral action; this both goes against Australian commitment to the primacy of the UN in international relations, and commits Australian troops to an unjust war without pursuit of diplomatic solutions.
The level of international debate around the issue of Iraq, with concern about the access to weapons munitions by UN inspectors and the divisive rhetoric of world leaders such as Bush and Blair, has shown little concern for the Iraqi people.
The impact of the oppressive regime under which they live is compounded by the devastation on the population of poor infrastructure and malnutrition.
In the twelve years since the imposition of UN sanctions on Iraq, the economy has failed to recover from the 50% contraction caused by the 1991 Gulf War.
Despite the 1996 introduction of the oil-for-food programme, poverty and starvation are rife; one in eight Iraqi children will not live beyond their fifth birthday.
The Gulf War Allied use of depleted uranium has resulted in a massive cancer rate, the majority of which cannot be cured because of the ban on importation of necessary medical supplies under the UN sanctions.
The oil-for-food programme contains no cash component and so necessary infrastructure such as hospitals and schools remain in drastic need of rehabilitation—one in four Iraqi children drop out of school, and it is estimated that 8000 schools are in dire need of rebuilding.
The economy is unable to support such a massive rebuilding effort—its oil fields, among the richest in the world, remain largely unexploited because of outdated machinery.
The machinery cannot be updated because of the UN sanctions, which prohibit the importation of necessary spare parts.
Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, has already indicated their primary interest in Iraq lies in the exploitation of its oilfields.
Powerful business interests in the United States and elsewhere in the West have expressed similar intentions. Yet invasion of Iraq would cement the misfortune of its population.
Aid organisations around the world have lobbied governments to oppose an invasion of Iraq, arguing that “years of war and sanctions have already created an extremely vulnerable population whose ability to cope with any hardship is very limited”.
The sanctions imposed on Iraq by the UN have had little effect on Saddam or his military—“the economic sanctions have not hurt him ... just the ordinary people who are his victims”.
Invasion would serve only to compound that suffering. Military intervention of any kind would create a further humanitarian disaster, rather than address any that currently exists.
In engaging in this debate it is imperative to consider the lives of those who have been forgotten, and to consider the impact of such an intervention on those lives.
I remain entirely unconvinced by the rhetoric; this war is about oil and domination more than disarmament”.
There is no humanitarian motivation in military intervention into Iraq, only a concern for the bank balances of the West.
Labor has a strong tradition of supporting a multilateral approach to international relations, which would be profoundly contradicted by us following Bush blindly to war.
John Howard is fear-mongering, in the same way he did in the Children Overboard Affair and with the Tampa.
Labor must set the boundaries of debate by arguing, with passion and conviction, against taking up this barbaric task we have been set.
—————
Senator Ludwig
Labor's policy since March last year has been to support a full parliamentary debate on the question of Australian policy on Iraq, in particular, the conditions which would need to be met for Australian military support for US action in Iraq.
This sort of debate is absolutely necessary for the nation, because we need to canvas the facts which are not so far being canvassed in all the by the foreign minister, the Prime Minister and others on the question of Iraq.
We needed, for example, to explore what specifically is Iraq's current weapons of mass destruction status, how has that changed over times most recently, how does it relate to other states possessing weapons of mass destruction in the region. 
We needed to have this debate before our troops were sent to the Gulf.
In the eyes of the world, the deployment of Australian Defence forces to Iraq without a resolution by the United Nations shows John Howard has little regard for the UN process of resolution by committing Australian troops to a potential conflict that has not been sanctioned. You cannot withdraw such troops that you have committed.
The United Nations has resolved to get Saddam Hussein to disarm, and that task is being performed as we speak. Dr Hans Blix most recent report to the United Nations shows us that they are doing their job albeit with a basic lack
of cooperation, however there may still be a peaceful outcome. The United Nations needs Australia's full support, and should not be pre-empted by the sort of decisions Mr Howard has taken in deploying forces.
On the first of November 1945 Australia was admitted to the United Nations as a member. We recognised that one of the primary purposes of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security. Since its creation, the United Nations has often been called upon to prevent disputes from escalating into war, to persuade opposing parties to use the conference table rather than force of arms, or to help restore peace when conflict does break out.
When Prime Minister Chiefly made the application to become a United Nations member on the first of November 1945 he agreed to accept all obligations of the UN Charter including:
·	ensuring by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, and
·	to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and
·	to cooperate in solving international problems.
The Governments action in pre-empting deployment of our forces has in reality questioned the United Nations ability to complete its objectives as witnessed by the Ministers statements here yesterday when he questioned the credibility of the United Nations. We should let the UN finish the task—we as a member expect them to do.
Although the threat that Saddam Hussein will use biological and chemical weapons is very real, the United Nations has not completed its process whereby Australia or any other country could initiate military action against Iraq under UN authority.
There is a real possibility that this may come to pass, however it is the Labor Party's belief that troops should have remained at home until that resolution came through.
·	The Australian people and defence force families are entitled to the facts—
·	They are entitled to know why their troops are being forward deployed ahead of a United Nations mandate.
·	They are entitled to expect debate on the Government's intentions if a UN resolution is not forthcoming.
·	They are entitled to know why our Defence forces are operating on a shoestring in relation to Defence spending.
·	They are entitled to know whether all of our units are fully supported and combat capable.
Instead of flaunting our intentions to the UN by following in the footsteps of the US and the UK by amassing forces along Iraq's border without proper resolutions being passed we should endeavour to assist by supporting the UN Security Council in its efforts.
Whilst there were references to the information compiled by the United States and the United Kingdom, information which will be presented to the UN Security Council in the near future, the fact remains the UN has not sanctioned its members to take military action against Iraq.
Australia whilst not occupying membership on the Security Council should endeavour to support the UN in its efforts to arbitrate a peaceful solution.
The Minister made mention of Saddam Hussein using weapons against his neighbouring countries, however, the Financial Review has informed us of a Pan Arab stand formed by 18 countries surrounding Iraq to cease any action that would further destabilise the already volatile region. Unlike Australia it seems these countries are willing to await results of Dr Han Blix's return to Iraq and subsequent rulings by the UN before taking action. They are further prepared to listen to the information the US Secretary of State Colin Powell is giving in his address to the UN Security Council and they further advocate a peaceful solution to this issue.
Our Defence forces whilst being amongst the most dedicated in the world are sadly lacking in support by this Government. 
Our defence force capabilities are not the priority of a Government who would send them to war. At a time when the Government has committed troops to assist with our allies they have cut future spending in Defence by 4 billion dollars— something which will leave troops believing they do not warrant the best equipment to assist them in their duties. All who care to look can see the absolute ineptness by this government in handling the best interests of the soldiers they have ministerial responsibility for.
This Government, which would deploy our troops, have become irresponsible in their commitment to
·	The Defence Force by leaving it struggling to maintain combat readiness,
·	They have faltered in their commitment to keeping the oath sworn as a member of the United Nations, and
·	They have faltered in their commitment to uphold the basic principles other members of the United Nations expect and demand.
The Minister speaks of the damage to the United Nations if the compelling terms of this latest resolution are not enforced—but what damage is this Government doing to the UN's reputation as a mediator when it clearly cannot wait to deploy its troops without a resolution being passed?

"Senator SANTORO,",LP,2003-02-05,"—One of the most difficult issues facing Australia at present is the falling rate of boys' achievements in the education system. It is a topic that deserves the closest scrutiny and national action. The issue is broader than that, and I want to speak a little about those broader aspects later. But first I would like to commend the actions of the Minister for Education, Science and Training in signing—with his colleagues the ministers for training, employment, youth affairs and community services, and state and territory ministers—a ministerial declaration called Stepping forward—improving pathways for all young people.
I recall with pride launching the `Pathways to your future' guide to vocational education and training options in Queensland in 1997, the Year of Training, when I was the Minister for Training and Industrial Relations in that state. I said then, and I believe now, that it is very hard to decide what to do when you leave school. But the one thing young people can be sure of is that every workplace needs confident, competent young people with initiative, real skills and, in particular, a good attitude and that, for many, vocational or on-the-job training is the way to go.
The federal minister believes schooling needs to be responsive to the needs of young people in order to enable them to develop their talents and capabilities. I do not think there is anyone who would argue with the commonsense behind that proposition. It is for that reason that all Australian governments have adopted the National Goals for Schooling in the 21st Century. A key element of these goals is to encourage all young people to stay at school until the completion of year 12 or its vocational equivalent.
In relation to the `stepping forward' declaration, it is important to note that this cements a joint national commitment to provide leadership and establish a common direction in developing opportunities for young people, particularly those most at risk of becoming disconnected from society. In turn, this picks up on the recommendations from Footprints to the future, the report of the Prime Minister's Youth Pathways Action Plan Task Force. In short, it contains a raft of proposals to assist young people to grow into productive, community-minded adults.
This process is of particularly great importance to young men. Though this may be a generalisation, it does seem that young women have a greater capacity or willingness to get to grips with communal imperatives and demonstrate a more obvious readiness to make agreements among those with whom they must interact as opposed to those in their own circle—an important distinction. This is the very basis of civic responsibility. It is the antithesis of the `me' focus that has blighted and endangered Western society over the past 30 or 40 years. The federal minister has asked the Department of Education, Science and Training to develop new career and transition arrangements for young people, which will commence from January next year. That will be a significant advance towards the commonsense approach of a unified, or at least interlinked and essentially similar, whole-of-education program throughout Australia.
There is a more particular problem, to which I referred earlier—that of educating boys. More broadly, I believe it is an issue of raising boys. This has begun to attract significant attention nationally, and I know it deeply concerns a great many people. There is compelling evidence that boys are underperforming at school in the essential area of reading. Victorian studies show this distinction becomes greater as schooling progresses. In fact, females outperformed males in the final year of schooling in all states in 1995. These results are consistent with the declining academic performance of boys documented in North America, Europe and South-East Asia. Obviously, it is not just an Australian problem and it is not just an education problem.
In his 1997 book, Raising Boys, family therapist and parenting author Steve Biddulph provided a very useful primer for parents—and policy makers—on what boys need in their family and community circles. What boys benefit from most of all is a father—a resident, involved, disciplined father who has, and daily demonstrates, a very strong commitment to family and the upbringing of his children. In saying this, I acknowledge that school is not a substitute for a father. There are a number of ways in which a boy without a father directly and constantly in his life can be mentored. As a society, we need to look seriously and urgently at ways we can facilitate and encourage this.
As Biddulph notes, boys and girls are very different creatures. In recent decades we have sought to mask those differences, to pretend that there is really very little difference between the genders. Unfortunately, we have often foolishly misread the absolute, fundamental requirement in our society for complete equality between the genders as meaning that we should obliterate differences. In fact, we need to encourage differentiation between the genders—not on the arbitrary bases of the past, but on the basis that one's gender does indeed determine how one lives one's life.
At the practical level—and it is at the practical level that successful and effective policymaking must reside—the preparation of young people for productive and fulfilling adult lives is given greater force and effect through the education system. It is a fact that boys' scholastic performance in several key areas of learning has fallen away in recent years. It is vital for their future and for Australia's future that we reverse this dangerous trend. Boys often have fewer connections from the language half to the sensory half of the brain than girls. Because of this, parents need to read to young boys, tell them stories, talk to them a lot and explain things, especially up to the age of eight. Boys often need to have a clear set of rules and a clear knowledge of who is in charge. Because of that they need good, calm and orderly environments at home and at school and to be in a school where bullying is simply not part of the picture. Because boys have more muscular bodies than girls, we have to specifically teach them not to hit or hurt others and also to teach them to use words to communicate. Because boys have a predisposition to act first without thinking things through, we need to talk with them often in a friendly way about options, choices, ways to solve problems and what they can do in situations in their lives.
Outside the home, it is clear that we need a revolution in schooling. This brings me to a very worrying trend within Australian schools: the plummeting number of male teachers. According to the House of Representatives committee report on boys' education, the percentage of male teachers in all Australian primary schools, state and private, fell by five per cent between 1991 and 2001. In 2001 only 21.3 per cent of Australian primary school teachers were male. Nationally, the proportion of male secondary teachers also fell to only 45.1 per cent in 2001. Since men are proportionately more likely than women to hold promotional positions, the proportion of male classroom teachers in both the primary and secondary sectors is lower than indicated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics data from which these figures are drawn. The minister for education warned last year, in the context of the national shortage of teachers, that the trend forecasts for male recruitment indicated even fewer males would become teachers in the future. This is not an issue of teacher quality—I want to make that crystal clear—but one of our need to address the gender imbalance in teaching so that boys have the benefit of male teachers and a male role model in their schooling.
It is a fact that more and more female teachers have to face physically intimidating and disrespectful boys. Boys in these circumstances create stress but they themselves are suffering. In fact, girls outperform boys in almost every subject area. In our analysis of where education policy should be moving, two elements stand out as essential debating points. The first is a later starting age for boys, whose fine motor skills and cognitive skills generally are slower to develop than those of girls. The second is more men in schools—men of the right kind, men with a mixture of warmth and sternness, men who are obviously in charge but not in a way that necessarily challenges boys negatively. In this regard a now widely known experiment at a British school in shifting to single gender English classes is worth examining. At the Cotswold School, a coeducational secondary school in England, boys and girls in the fourth year of secondary school were placed in gender-segregated English classes for two years. As the new single gender classes got under way, teachers adjusted the curriculum—the choices of books and poems—to make it more interesting for the boys or girls in their class. They were no longer restricted by a need to strike a middle path between the interests of boys or girls. The classes began to take on a distinctly boys' or girls' flavour. The Cotswold results were impressive. Where the UK national statistics record only nine per cent of 14-year-old boys achieving grades in the A to C range in English, Cotswold recorded 34 per cent of boys, after two years in the single gender classes, having winning grades in the A to C range in their final exams, an increase of almost 400 per cent in the number of boys scoring high grades. The girls' performance improved too. At the end of the two-year experiment 75 per cent of girls got scores in the A to C range, compared with 46 per cent a year before. 
This is food for thought. I note that there are lessons—no pun intended of course—for Australian educational authorities to consider. Essentially one thing is obvious: we need to reverse the trend of declining male teacher numbers and we need to encourage males to think of the teaching vocation as one which is most worthy of pursuit, as indeed males have thought of it over the past century. I intend to canvass the broader community in relation to this most important issue. I believe that the community will be most interested in participating in this debate and in contributing ideas as to incentives that can be provided or made available to males within our society who are thinking of becoming teachers but then decide not to. The reasons for this are many, and I intend to discuss them in this place at some other time.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Education: Boys</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-02-05,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill in his capacity as Leader of the Government in the Senate and as Minister for Defence. Minister, has the government decided that no elements of the Australian forces currently deployed in the Gulf region will be withdrawn in the event of a US-led war against Iraq proceeding without Security Council authorisation? If so, why has the government insisted that no decision has been made about whether to withdraw the ADF from the Gulf if a war starts without UN backing?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-02-05,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. My question went to whether a decision has in fact been made to withdraw the ADF from the Gulf if a war starts without UN backing. I wonder if the leaked comments by the foreign affairs minister demonstrate clearly that the government had made clear decisions as far back as October last year on the continuing nature of Australian deployments during a unilateral US attack on Iraq. I ask the minister: when does the government intend to come clean with the Australian people on all the decisions it has made regarding Australian deployments in the Gulf region?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-02-05,"—Australia has a number of forces in the region. It has two ships as part of the multinational interception force at the head of the Gulf; it has two P3 aircraft that have been deployed to the Gulf also as part of the war against terrorism; in recent times it is deploying certain other forces to the region, as has been stated publicly— forces that are designed to send the message clearly and unambiguously to Saddam Hussein that he must comply with UN Security Council resolutions; and it also has a presence to enable such forces to be properly acclimatised in case they are called upon to take part in an action against Iraq in the future. So the issue of withdrawing the forces is not relevant at this time. They have been sent there for specific purposes, as I have just outlined, and the government has not therefore, logically, focused on the issue of the circumstances in which they would be withdrawn. That is something that the government can do at any time it so determines. I remind Senator Faulkner that the government decided to withdraw and withdrew our special forces from Afghanistan even though other coalition partners continue to have forces on the ground in Afghanistan. Similarly, the ships in the MIF have been rotated from time to time. Similarly, in relation to other forces the government is able to withdraw them at any time it so determines if it believes that the purpose for which they have been sent has been completed or for any other reason.

I said to him that the government can withdraw such forces at any time, as it has demonstrated in the past, but obviously it has not made any decision to withdraw them.

With reference to the deployment of Australian armed forces to the Gulf, as the minister announced on 22 January, has the minister made any declaration on the status of that service with respect to the Veterans' Entitlement Act and the military compensation scheme—that is, is the service routine non-warlike or warlike? What have ADF personnel been told of the benefits attached to this deployment, including allowances and compensation cover, and if so what are they? If Australian troops are in fact deployed on warlike service, how does this possibly sit with the Prime Minister's claim that no decision to go to war has been taken?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question

When will the government get round to finally implementing the recommendations of the 1999 Tanzer review into the military compensation scheme, which specifically covers entitlements to ADF personnel serving in the Gulf? Isn't it the case that any ADF personnel injured during deployment in the Gulf will only be covered under the old scheme of military compensation, which the Tanzer review found, four years ago, needed a significant overhaul and updating?

There are different conditions of service in relation to those engaged in the multinational interception force.

It is at the stage that a bill is currently being drafted. I spoke to the parliamentary draftsmen about it earlier this week because I had been told that it was going to be ready for public exposure last year. It was not because of the complexity and the extent of input from all of the various veterans' organisations and other stakeholders. We do expect, however, that that exposure draft will be available in the not too distant future, so the process will continue. But I can say to the honourable senator that last year, when I compared our compensation scheme with those of others, our scheme seemed to be better than most.

I did not want to do it earlier and interrupt question time; I did not want to be churlish or embarrass your guests. I assume that the Italian delegation are in the chamber as your guests, and I wonder if there is any rule about senators approaching them to present them with material.

Senator Macdonald did not take a point of order, and he has rightly pointed out to us that he did not want to interrupt question time. I accept that at face value. I acknowledge that. But if he is to ask a question of you, there are other mechanisms to do so, and I do not believe that you should have given him the call like that in the manner that you did. I ask you to rule in favour of that point of order. I accept that the issue may well be an important one and ought to be dealt with, but it ought to be done in accordance with the forms that have been established in this chamber over a long period of time.

I could have taken a point of order because it was a matter that happened in this chamber. If it suits Senator Faulkner, I will withdraw the question and now take a point of order, Mr President. My point of order is this: is it appropriate—
—Under what standing order?
—I am seeking a ruling from the President on whether it is appropriate that senators should approach your guests with material. I do not know what was in the material, but from looking at the guests they were embarrassed and they did not know what to do. Of course, if every senator presents guests with material in the chamber, it does disrupt the chamber. My point of order goes to whether such approaches in the chamber are appropriate. Is there provision in the standing orders for this and, if there is not, could you make a ruling on it so we do not embarrass your guests in this chamber?

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2003-02-05,"—There are several points of order but, generally speaking, at the conclusion of question time ministers may give additional answers to questions and then we move to taking note of answers. The conclusion of question time is not a time to be raising other issues. I thought you were going to comment on a question you had been asked or reply to a question for some other reason. I heard what you said, and I think you should raise that matter with me after we have gone through taking note of answers. I did observe what happened. I will look at the standing orders. I realise that once people walk outside the seating area in the chamber they are seen as being outside the chamber. Nevertheless, it did disturb the proper running of the Senate, and I will report back to the Senate in due course to clarify the situation.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-02-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today relating to military action against Iraq.
We know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, in his talks with the New Zealand High Commissioner, told the high commissioner, Mrs Lackey, that he did not want the issue he was discussing—whether ships and other presence would stay in the Gulf if United Nations processes broke down—canvassed publicly. On the 7.30 Report last night, Kerry O'Brien quoted the Downer document in this form:
... and this was not a point that could be made publicly—Australia was not in a process if the UN process broke down to withdraw our ships and other presence in the Gulf.
So Kerry O'Brien asked Mr Downer, `What other presence?' Mr Downer said:
It doesn't talk about that.
But of course Mr Downer was wrong again. Unfortunately for Mr Downer, the memo says, `and other presence.' And of course this is typical of Mr Downer and it is typical of ministers in the Howard government. Either Mr Downer is trying to deliberately mislead Australians or he is a buffoon—or both.
On preparations for the war last year, Mr Downer again last night told the 7.30 Report:
The military do contingency planning ... They do contingency planning for all sorts of contingencies ... It's nothing to do with Iraq, that's their job.
He went on:
The point is that the Government hadn't sat down and considered this issue of predeployments. 
That was a decision that was made on 10 January.
We know that that is complete nonsense from Mr Downer. Of course we know that Mr Downer sees himself as some sort of home-grown aristocrat. He obviously regards the rest of us as pretty dumb. He thinks that we will accept that high-level work on military engagement with Iraq was not going on throughout this period. We know that Mr Howard met President Bush in June last year. Four days after Mr Downer talked to the New Zealand High Commissioner on 28 October last year, Mr Howard and Mr Bush met in Mexico. The day after that, Senator Hill and Mr Downer were at the AUSMIN talks in Washington. This was all happening and I am sure, if it was possible, it would be at the forefront of Mr Downer's mind.
Mr Downer should have been absolutely briefed to the eyeballs on this issue. There is no doubt that the government was gearing up to go to Iraq when this conversation with the New Zealand High Commissioner happened. Senator Hill said it all when, less than a month later on 21 November, he was asked in estimates hearings by Senator Evans about ADF contingency planning, and he said:
It has not been linked to any particular UN mandate. It is very much the sort of contingency planning that militaries constantly do ... It has been designed to keep us as well informed as possible on the thinking of the US military. We believe we have been given valuable access and that it has helped keep the Australian government as informed as possible.
So planning for the deployment was well under way using US thinking, not UN thinking. Mr Downer has been so badly exposed on this. The real point here of course is that Mr Downer did not want this to become public. It is okay to talk to the New Zealand High Commissioner about these matters, but never take the Australian people into your confidence. Why not? Because that is standard operating procedure for the Howard government—cover up; never take the public into your confidence; operate in a sneaky and Nixonian way. That is Mr Downer's method. That is the Howard government's method. If you have a choice between a conspiracy and telling the truth, they will pick the conspiracy every time. ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2003-02-05,"—I rise also to take note of the answers given to questions in question time today. One of the most disappointing things in the debate in recent days and in some of the questions asked by those opposite in question time today is that noise, waving arms and volume really do not cover a complete lack of substance. We have seen that again and again in the comments made both in this chamber and in the other place. In fact, an objective observer could be forgiven for wondering whether some on the other side really believe that there should be a limit to the production of weapons of mass destruction at all. However, it is the contention of the government and of members of the government that the leader of Iraq must know that not just Australia but other like-minded countries are absolutely intent and serious in our intention to do just that—to limit the production of weapons of mass destruction. If 12 years of hampering the efforts of the United Nations to verify whether Iraq's WMD capability and production programs have been dismantled or not, as the case may be, if that time and the failures therein are not enough, it is necessary to demonstrate to the leader of Iraq that he cannot ignore, or thumb his nose at, the international community.
As I understand it nobody—and certainly nobody in this place and certainly not me—is in a position of advocating going to war, not now, not before and not in the future. However, that does not mean that we must not be vigilant and it does not mean that we must not take appropriate steps to deliver that message in the most appropriate manner as Australia is doing.
In recent months we have had some less than edifying demonstrations of the political process. I am very disappointed to record that, in my view, one of the most disappointing was what the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, said at the departure of HMAS Kanimbla. There are places and opportunities to say the things that we, as parliamentarians, feel about this and that is in this place. However, I want to read into the record this afternoon a letter that appeared in the Australian on 27 January signed and authored by Major David Bermingham from the peace monitoring group in Bougainville, PNG. The letter is on the public record and I feel comfortable reading it into Hansard here:
HMAS Kanimbla has seemingly departed without the full support of the nation. My greater concern is the puerile actions of Simon Crean. 
Combatants who depart on their nation's business must do so with the full confidence of that nation. Simon Crean has perpetrated an act of sheer bastardry by bringing into question the efficacy of the deployment. While he may harbour these thoughts as a private citizen, as leader of the loyal—
emphasis included in the letter—
Opposition, he is meant to provide nothing less than full support to the nation's defenders. 
Worse—
—Order! Senator Payne, I remind you that you should not utter unparliamentary language from a document. You can continue to read; I am just drawing it to your attention.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I take note of your request. The letter continued:
Worse, he enunciated his thoughts in front of the families of the departing sailors. How much lower can he go?
I am convinced the majority of the nation is behind the deployment. As a serving officer in Bougainville, I can only express my full support for the men and women of Kanimbla and wish them a safe and speedy return.
I think that puts fairly and squarely on the record the views of the Australian Defence Force and the serving representatives of that Defence Force in— 
—What rubbish! You think they are all of one opinion?
—I will take that interjection, Senator Evans, and I will say that I think that people like the author of that letter who are prepared to stand up for their colleagues and stand up for those people who are doing as they are requested on behalf of this nation are the sorts of people I am prepared to look at with some pride and strength and am happy to have serving this nation.
—You took a cheap shot because the letter suited you.
—The conflict that we are discussing in this chamber today is a very, very serious issue before the parliament. I have often been disappointed by— and Senator Evans would try to persuade you I may have added to this myself—some of the debate that has occurred on this matter. If you think that a cabinet or a government takes these decisions lightly then I think those who hold that thought are very much mistaken. They are decisions that are taken with great concern and great consideration. Even the Secretary-General of the United Nations has said that, without the United States' recent deployment of troops, Iraq would not even have accepted weapons inspectors back into the country. Even the Secretary-General of the UN said that. Obviously a UN resolution is preferable and that is certainly the case in the government's view.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2003-02-05,"—I usually resist the temptation to be provoked, but I do want to reply to Senator Payne's contribution because I think it was a very unfortunate and really unhelpful contribution. I want to make clear that I usually have a lot of respect for Senator Payne and it was not her usual sort of contribution, but it was a cheap shot and it was one that was totally inappropriate. The letter sent by that particular serving officer was the subject of a formal apology to Mr Crean by General Leahy, as Chief of Army, and indicated that it should never have occurred. No complaint was made by the opposition or by Mr Crean's office but General Leahy, as I understood it, took the trouble of approaching Mr Crean's office and apologising for the publication of that letter. It reflects one view.
I want to put on the record very clearly that I would have been very disappointed if Mr Crean had not gone to the Kanimbla farewell and been totally honest with our troops. What they wanted was honesty. There is a debate in Australia about whether or not we should be making this deployment. There is a real debate. There are divergent views in this community; we show them around this chamber and they exist in the broader Australian community as well. But it would have been cowardly of Mr Crean to do anything other than make it very clear what his and the Labor Party's view was. He did put that very clearly and very frankly to the troops, and the feedback that I have had from families and from service personnel is that they appreciated it. Some do not agree with the message—that is quite clear. Some support the deployment, as others in the community do. Others are very concerned about the deployment and do not support it. But what Mr Crean did was to honestly explain to those troops the political difference and make it clear that our support remained for those troops, that they were acting under proper authority from the government. We concede the government had the power to take the decision to deploy. They have been deployed legally, with the authority of the Australian government. But Mr Crean made it clear we did not support that decision. He made it clear to them, so they understood where they stood, that we supported them, wished them well and hoped for their safe return, but that we did not support the deployment.
I think Senator Payne does herself a disservice to try to pretend that the military— ADF personnel—are of one view on this deployment. There are widely divergent views inside the military about whether or not this is a good thing, whether or not it should be occurring without UN sanction. I refer to former ADF chief Peter Gration's contributions to the debate. A large number of military officers have very serious reservations about this government's commitment to a US-led attack without UN approval. Some ADF personnel who have been responsible for Australia's proud record in enforcing UN sanctions and UN peacekeeping missions over many years have grave reservations about being involved in an action that does not have that authority. But there are divergent views. There is a mix of views from service personnel and their families about that. They are part of the Australian debate, but they have always in the past been encouraged to keep their views to themselves as serving officers. That is something that General Leahy took up with Mr Crean. 
I think the key issue we want to raise today, though, is that Mr Downer spilled the beans yesterday. He let the cat out of the bag about the government's strategy here. The strategy is to commit to war, to provide George Bush with the assurance that we will be there when he calls, but they want to conceal it from the Australian public. There has been some talk about this question in the briefing note about other presences in the Gulf. What I was keen to elicit from Senator Hill today was the fact that there were other presences in the Gulf. Sure, there were the two ships there under the MIF deployment, but we had a national command headquarters also positioned in the Gulf at that time, responsible for coordination with the United States of America on the war on terror but also responsible for actions relating to any involvement in Iraq, responsible for coordinating with US command under General Tommy Franks and responsible for liaison on any issues to do with planning a possible invasion of Iraq.
The minister also made it clear we had ADF personnel in Kuwait, so we did have other presences inside the Gulf. The briefing note was right to refer to those. They were quite clearly troops that could not be withdrawn, because the government had put them in there as part of the planning for an invasion of Iraq. They were not put there on the proviso that it would only occur if there were UN backing. They are there as part of a government commitment to the USA, to be part of the command structure, to liaise on military planning for an invasion of Iraq.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2003-02-05,"—Let me rebut some of the comments that the previous speaker, Senator Evans, has made. The Australian government is conforming to United Nations resolution 1441 to the letter. The Australian government has not ordered any troops to invade Iraq. The Australian government is doing everything it can in a responsible fashion to ensure that the despot of Iraq does not strike first, not like the despot did in 1963 when he was a member of the Baath party and attempted to assassinate Kassem, who was the then leader—and dictator nonetheless—of Iraq. Saddam Hussein fired into the dictator, but did not kill him. He recovered, only to be assassinated and his body dragged through the streets at a later date. Saddam Hussein then adopted the unflattering sobriquet of the Butcher of Baghdad.
This is no ordinary person that we are talking about. This is a man who has craved all his life to kill. This is a man who has survived upon the old ethos of kill or be killed. This is not a man that anyone in Australia should be supporting. The Australian government has said time and time again it has no argument with the Iraqi people, but it does have an argument with a man like Saddam Hussein, a man who started his life in a field of blood as a man who started the war with Iran, his hated enemy. The Persians, the Aryans, the non-Semitics, the non-Arabs— how he hates those people. This is a man who was responsible during 1980-89 for the slaughter of 375,000 young Iraqis and Iranians. This is a man who, not long after that, released chemical weapons upon his own people, the Kurds, in the northern part of Iraq. This is a man who, because he did not see eye to eye with his own Muslim people in the south—the Marsh Arabs—attempted to slaughter them. He killed them in their thousands. This is a man with a million-strong army who invaded the tiny sheikhdom of Kuwait, which barely had a million people.
This is a man who we know to be in possession of all sorts of weapons of mass destruction. They include 6,500 chemical bombs, including 550 shells filled with mustard gas; 360 tonnes of bulk chemicals, including 1.5 tonnes of nerve agent—shades of Nazi Germany; 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals—that is, chemicals used to make weapons of mass destruction or specific killing agents—300 tonnes of which could only be used for VX nerve gas and over 30,000 tonnes of special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological agents. They are all unaccounted for. Those are what we want to know about. That is what we want from resolution 1441, which imposes upon Saddam Hussein, the Butcher of Baghdad, the obligation to come clean and say where these weapons of mass destruction are. We want him to conform to the United Nations resolution, but we are not going to be in a position where we have to be the second ones to strike. That is not what a responsible government can do. Many people tell me: `Thank god for the strong leadership of John Howard at this stage of the evolutionary and political life of our Australia. Without him we would be insecure, we would be seen as impotent and we would be seen as a soft target.' The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, said, `You've got a choice between conspiracy and telling the truth, and you pick conspiracy every time.' I have one comment for Senator Faulkner: he has a choice—get behind Australia or get behind Saddam Hussein. That is the simple choice.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-02-05,"—The commitment by the Howard government to deploy armed forces to the Gulf does raise a number of vital questions of interest to serving personnel, who are tomorrow's veterans, and today's veterans, none of which have been answered to date. Those personnel go to the Gulf with no knowledge or certainty of anything as to their conditions of service or their compensation coverage, nor do we have in this country a policy or legislative framework of care and support for veterans which has as much credibility these days as it had in years gone by. In short, the veterans portfolio is becoming a shambles. Let me iterate the reasons. Since 1972 we have had two military compensation schemes for serving personnel, with dual eligibility resulting in confusion, inconsistency and gross unfairness in many cases. A new scheme was recommended in 1999 but, as Senator Hill acknowledged today, there is still no sign of it. We have a Repatriation Commission, established following World War I, which actually repatriates no-one and which has surrendered its independence from government to become a political entity. Its oversight of its act, its exercise of power and its administration of compensation claims and health care have now become a matter of notoriety, not respect. In fact in recent times I have been inundated with complaints, mostly from Queensland, over service to veterans entailing a meanness of spirit on transport costs and the supply of aids and appliances for disabled veterans which once were never in dispute.
We have seen, under this government, a complete watering down of the concept of qualifying service to the extent that the benefits of the Veterans Entitlements Act, which for over 75 years were reserved for those whose lives were at real risk in World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam, are now generally available for anybody who serves overseas. Past policy is now apparently defunct. Promises made about the gold card have been dishonoured, with almost 20 per cent of GPs in the scheme not extending their agreement and hundreds of specialists still in the process of withdrawing. The grapevine tells me that several hundred million dollars have been earmarked to provide `incentive' to GPs to accept the gold card. That is an increase in the scheduled fee by another name. The home care scheme has been cut back in almost every area, despite denials, and the budgetary provisions for it in the estimates are both deceitful and dishonest. Veterans and war widows in need are being ignored, with hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on lesser priorities. The health study of personnel deployed to the last Gulf War, for which there are unresolved issues surrounding Gulf War syndrome, is now more than 12 months late.
Millions of dollars are being wasted in the construction of war memorials and in the cutting of ribbons to glorify the current minister and the Prime Minister. Medical research into the health effects of past deployments seems to have been stalled, with no more answers available on the effects of Agent Orange or radiation exposure. The Clarke report on veterans' entitlements has still not been released two months after its completion. I am told it is the focus of the Howard spin doctors now in control—with budgetary implications of a $700 million deficit, in contradiction of the instruction that it must be budget neutral. 
Rumours abound within the veterans community that Justice Clarke has recommended an increase in the T and PI special rate of $60 per week with indexation to MTAWE and a benchmark, that BCOF and atomic test servicemen will be given coverage of the VEA under hazardous service, and that rehabilitation will be made compulsory prior to all compensation claims being assessed. We shall see next Tuesday, when the report is to be released—if the rumours are correct that it will be released next Tuesday evening in the House. Of the 109 recommendations it will be interesting to see how many the Prime Minister will reject and how much he will spend to again buy himself out of trouble before the next election, regardless of good policy. As our young men and women are shipped off ready for a war that has not happened yet, they can have no comfort or security about the framework or detail of what their compensation or entitlements are or might be. More to the point, what can the minister tell us of the precautions taken so far in protecting—(Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-02-05,"—I propose to move an amendment to Senator Ferris's motion that the report be adopted. I agree with everything Senator Ferris has done except for this, so I move the following amendment: 
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on 20 March 2003”.
The Selection of Bills Committee, which does a fantastic job—and I am privileged to be a member of that committee—seeks to find agreement on which bills are referred to committees and on the dates that the committees report back. Very rarely do we have a disagreement. On this occasion there is a disagreement in relation to timing. The government would like to deal with the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002 before Easter. I think it is fair to generalise: the Australian Labor Party have a preference for reporting back in the middle of May, which I think is the exact proposal. We think it is in the interests of the industry and the government are firmly committed to dealing with it in a timely manner so that the industry and those involved in wheat marketing, ranging from the growers to those throughout the industry, have some certainty. So we would propose to the Senate that the committee report by no later than 20 March. It is a simple disagreement which ultimately has to be resolved here.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,10,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-02-05,"—The opposition is firmly of the view that, whilst reporting as expeditiously as possible is desirable, the history—at least in my experience—of this committee dealing with legislation relating to the wheat industry, and particularly wheat export matters, has required the committee to visit Western Australia. The Western Australian constituents of Senator Ian Campbell are always insistent that, as they appear to be, they are the source of the majority of Australia's export wheat—
—It is certainly the best quality.
—It may even be the best quality, Senator Ian Campbell, but certainly quantity seems to stack up in terms of officially available statistics. They are the source of the majority of wheat exported from this country. The committee has normally given the industry in Western Australia the opportunity to present its views to the committee. That is not to say, of course, that the committee gives disproportionate weight to that evidence but, given the cost of industry representatives travelling to Canberra for a hearing, for example, at least to my recollection we have conducted some hearings on matters relating to wheat and wheat exports in Western Australia.
The timetable proposed by Senator Ian Campbell on behalf of the government would put extreme pressure on the committee in terms of its ability to convene a hearing in Western Australia, given the program of the Senate. The other constituent committee, the references committee, having established programs for non-sitting weeks and senators having already established other commitments—I have been talking to the chair of the committee about availability— could certainly include in the program some of the hearings within the time suggested by Senator Ian Campbell. But it is certainly not clear that we could avail the Western Australian industry of the opportunity to address us at hearings in Western Australia.
To that end, I propose to move a further amendment that the date of 20 March 2003 in Senator Ian Campbell's amendment be replaced with the date of 15 May 2003. I move:
Omit “20 March 2003”, substitute “15 May 2002”.
If it is at all possible for the committee to conclude and report at an earlier time, certainly the opposition would have no difficulty with that proposal. I am reminded of a circumstance in a previous parliament when the responsible minister, through Senator Ian Campbell, told the Senate that it was urgent that we conduct a hearing and report on the regional forest agreement legislation to enable the matter to be dealt with very expeditiously. So the committee cancelled other appointments and expeditiously convened hearings to complete its hearings program on the regional forest agreement legislation. Having done that and presented its report to the Senate, the bill was dealt with in this chamber some seven months later. With the best will in the world and given the program— 
—I would like to know the reasons for that. It is not a good example.
—I think it is a good example. The government chose not to put that bill on the agenda at that time, for reasons which were entirely unclear. Whilst the government may desire to have the opportunity to present the legislation, I suggest that, if the legislation remains controversial, as it is now, it is certainly not clear to me that the government would give it priority over other pieces of legislation that are to come before the Senate.

—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator O'Brien be agreed to.
Question negatived. 
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Ian Campbell be agreed to.
Question agreed to. 
—Mr Deputy President, rather than seek a division, I ask that it be recorded that the opposition has been the only voice supporting my amendment and opposing the government's amendment.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-02-05,"—I propose to move an amendment to Senator Ferris's motion that the report be adopted. I agree with everything Senator Ferris has done except for this, so I move the following amendment: 
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on 20 March 2003”.
The Selection of Bills Committee, which does a fantastic job—and I am privileged to be a member of that committee—seeks to find agreement on which bills are referred to committees and on the dates that the committees report back. Very rarely do we have a disagreement. On this occasion there is a disagreement in relation to timing. The government would like to deal with the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2002 before Easter. I think it is fair to generalise: the Australian Labor Party have a preference for reporting back in the middle of May, which I think is the exact proposal. We think it is in the interests of the industry and the government are firmly committed to dealing with it in a timely manner so that the industry and those involved in wheat marketing, ranging from the growers to those throughout the industry, have some certainty. So we would propose to the Senate that the committee report by no later than 20 March. It is a simple disagreement which ultimately has to be resolved here.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,10,2,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-02-05,"—The opposition is firmly of the view that, whilst reporting as expeditiously as possible is desirable, the history—at least in my experience—of this committee dealing with legislation relating to the wheat industry, and particularly wheat export matters, has required the committee to visit Western Australia. The Western Australian constituents of Senator Ian Campbell are always insistent that, as they appear to be, they are the source of the majority of Australia's export wheat—
—It is certainly the best quality.
—It may even be the best quality, Senator Ian Campbell, but certainly quantity seems to stack up in terms of officially available statistics. They are the source of the majority of wheat exported from this country. The committee has normally given the industry in Western Australia the opportunity to present its views to the committee. That is not to say, of course, that the committee gives disproportionate weight to that evidence but, given the cost of industry representatives travelling to Canberra for a hearing, for example, at least to my recollection we have conducted some hearings on matters relating to wheat and wheat exports in Western Australia.
The timetable proposed by Senator Ian Campbell on behalf of the government would put extreme pressure on the committee in terms of its ability to convene a hearing in Western Australia, given the program of the Senate. The other constituent committee, the references committee, having established programs for non-sitting weeks and senators having already established other commitments—I have been talking to the chair of the committee about availability— could certainly include in the program some of the hearings within the time suggested by Senator Ian Campbell. But it is certainly not clear that we could avail the Western Australian industry of the opportunity to address us at hearings in Western Australia.
To that end, I propose to move a further amendment that the date of 20 March 2003 in Senator Ian Campbell's amendment be replaced with the date of 15 May 2003. I move:
Omit “20 March 2003”, substitute “15 May 2002”.
If it is at all possible for the committee to conclude and report at an earlier time, certainly the opposition would have no difficulty with that proposal. I am reminded of a circumstance in a previous parliament when the responsible minister, through Senator Ian Campbell, told the Senate that it was urgent that we conduct a hearing and report on the regional forest agreement legislation to enable the matter to be dealt with very expeditiously. So the committee cancelled other appointments and expeditiously convened hearings to complete its hearings program on the regional forest agreement legislation. Having done that and presented its report to the Senate, the bill was dealt with in this chamber some seven months later. With the best will in the world and given the program— 
—I would like to know the reasons for that. It is not a good example.
—I think it is a good example. The government chose not to put that bill on the agenda at that time, for reasons which were entirely unclear. Whilst the government may desire to have the opportunity to present the legislation, I suggest that, if the legislation remains controversial, as it is now, it is certainly not clear to me that the government would give it priority over other pieces of legislation that are to come before the Senate. (Time expired)
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator O'Brien be agreed to.
Question negatived. 
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Ian Campbell be agreed to.
Question agreed to. 
—Mr Deputy President, rather than seek a division, I ask that it be recorded that the opposition has been the only voice supporting my amendment and opposing the government's amendment.
—Yes, that will be recorded.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2003-02-05,"—I have a statement to make on behalf of the Committee of Privileges. Senators may recall that in June 2002 the Committee of Privileges reported to the Senate on a matter referred on a motion by Senator Harris. In brief, the reference involved establishing whether there was any contempt of the Senate in relation to search warrants executed by the Queensland Police Service in the office of Senator Harris. In its 105th report, the committee concluded that no breaches of the immunities of the Senate, or contempts, were involved in the search and seizure or in the continued possession by the Queensland police of material from the office of Senator Harris. It also concluded that the only step which should be taken at that stage to ensure that any such material protected from seizure by parliamentary privilege was returned to Senator Harris, without further access to the material by the police, was that Senator Harris and his solicitors should take the opportunity offered by the Queensland Police Service to claim privilege in respect of identified material. The committee also commended the Queensland Police Service for the impeccable way it had fulfilled its obligations in respect of parliamentary privilege.
An impasse was subsequently reached between the Queensland Police Service and Senator Harris. On 4 December 2002, Senator Harris gave a notice of motion based on a resolution in the Senate in relation to a similar seizure of materials from the office of former Senator Crane. This notice was postponed to 5 February and, subsequently, 4 March, at my request, to enable the Committee of Privileges to consider whether it should become involved. It decided at its meeting on 12 December 2002, acting under the terms of its original inquiry into the seizure, to put in place procedures based on Senator Harris's notice of motion to resolve the matter. It therefore appointed, with the approval of the President, Mr Stephen Skehill to determine whether any of the material held by the Queensland Police Service is subject to a claim of parliamentary privilege or is not covered by the warrant executed on 27 November 2001. It further agreed that the matter should proceed only if the Queensland Police Service and Senator Harris abide by Mr Skehill's determinations. Both the Commissioner of the Queensland Police Service and Senator Harris gave the requisite assurances. Mr Skehill has commenced his evaluation of the material, and I shall report to the Senate in due course. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-02-05,"—I understand that among those documents that have just been tabled are the responses to resolutions of the Senate. If I am correct in that understanding, I would like to seek leave to respond to the response by the Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister.
Leave granted.
—I note that the Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Hon. Peter Slipper, has written to honourable senators, through the agency of Senator Hogg—I assume as Deputy President of the Senate—advising them that the Prime Minister has asked his department to coordinate, within his department and other cabinet officers, a response to the resolution of the Senate carried last year following Senator Faulkner's motion concerning the findings of A Certain Maritime Incident Select Committee. 
By way of introductory comment, the resolution that the Senate carried last year went specifically to the findings of the Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident and called on the Commonwealth government to implement immediately the recommendations contained in that report. Without reading the resolution, it made a number of quite important—I do not diminish their significance—observations, as well, but then turned to the serious concern of apparent inconsistencies. I will be quoting from the resolution of the Senate provided to the committee and to the estimates committee by Commonwealth agencies in relation to the people-smuggling disruption program and in relation to suspected illegal entry vessels— SIEVs—including the boat known as SIEVX.
I thank the parliamentary secretary for saying that there is now in process, under the Prime Minister's guidance, a response to this resolution of the Senate. That is quite important. I remind the Senate that the Select Committee into A Certain Maritime Incident reported in October last year. In tabling that report, I, as the chairman, drew the Senate's attention to the fact that we were not able to complete the remit that the Senate had handed us, because the Prime Minister had made himself and other ministers unavailable to give evidence to the committee, and the federal cabinet had decided to instruct all public servants on ministerial staff, and ministerial staffers, not to be available to give evidence either. As a consequence, our ability to probe this issue to its logical conclusion was inhibited significantly and the findings we returned were findings on the evidence available to us and not on all of the evidence that could have been available had that embargo not been applied.
I say that by way of introduction. The fact that the Prime Minister is now proceeding to coordinate a response to the Senate resolution is significant. One hopes that, in doing so, some of the evidence that the committee might have sought directly from him, his ministers, ministerial staff, public servants working in ministerial offices, and others, will now be included and the Senate will be able to be informed in full detail, albeit without being able to probe and examine the evidence, of the full views of those persons.
There is another issue that needs to be mentioned here, which is profoundly important and probably overshadows my previous remarks. There have become available to me, in my capacity—although it no longer exists; it is my former capacity—as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident, answers to questions that were sought by honourable senators in those proceedings. This information has just become available. I received in the mail just recently a document dated 4 February, which came to me by virtue of the Senate Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The covering letter says it was an answer to a question posed by Senator Faulkner in supplementary estimates on 20 November:
... to follow up an earlier QON from the Inquiry into a Certain Maritime Incident ...
In other words, this question was asked in the certain maritime incident inquiry and no answer was received. It was asked again by Senator Faulkner in the estimates. On 4 February, some four months after the certain maritime incident inquiry reported, the document sought by Senator Faulkner, as a member of that inquiry, has now been made available. That raises questions about why it has taken so long, but I simply note the time gap at this juncture. The answer was in relation to this question by Senator Faulkner. This document says that he asked:
... 1 outstanding issue from the Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident relates to a DFAT cable on SIEVX. Can a copy of the cable be provided to the committee?
The answer is:
... the declassified DFAT cable is attached.
The declassified DFAT cable has now been provided to us. The date on this DFAT cable, which is quite significant, is 23 October 2001. I refer to that date because the certain maritime incident inquiry occurred over the major part of last year. In other words, this DFAT cable had been circulated in October of the year before, and some six or so months before the certain maritime incident inquiry convened to probe the issues that this cable has as its subject matter. 
The next significant thing about this cable that I wish to draw the Senate's attention to is the distribution list of this cable. This is a DFAT cable, but the distribution list is quite extensive. For action, it went to Dr Calvert at DFAT, to Dr Hawke, the secretary of Defence, to Admiral Barrie, the commander of the defence forces, to Mr Farmer at DIMIA, and to Mr Max Moore-Wilton in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It also went to the Prime Minister and all the relevant ministers, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the minister for immigration. It also went to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty. There is quite an extensive distribution list for this cable.
What I think is more important than all of that is what this cable says, because we may now be in a situation in which this cable, which was before all of those officers who appeared before our inquiry before they fronted to give evidence—and they gave evidence to our inquiry after swearing an oath before the inquiry to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth— reveals information which is not entirely consistent with the evidence that was given by some public servants and with the evidence that was adduced by the inquiry. Specifically, the point of concern was: where was SIEVX when it sank? The Prime Minister said that SIEVX was in Indonesian territorial waters. The evidence by some, and I suspect by all—but until I can exhaustively pursue it I cannot make that statement categorically—is that SIEVX is believed to have been sunk in Indonesian territorial waters.
This declassified cable, dated October the year before that evidence was adduced by us, says, in the start of the summary:
THE SIEV—
referring to SIEVX—
IS BELIEVED TO HAVE FOUNDERED IN ROUGH SEAS TO THE SOUTH OF SUNDA ST WITHIN THE INDONESIAN MARITIME SEARCH AND RESCUE AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.
That is not Indonesian territorial waters. Indonesian territorial waters are close to the borders of Indonesia. The Indonesian maritime search and rescue area of responsibility extends deep into the Timor Sea and abuts Australia. It covers what would, in layman's terms, be called international waters. A key issue in our inquiry was to try and establish what Australia knew about where SIEVX went down. The consistent refrain to that question was, `In Indonesian territorial waters'. We now know that it went down in international waters. This is a significant piece information because it goes to whether Australian search and rescue capability could have intruded into the area concerned to rescue people who were on that ill-fated ship. I remind the Senate that some 353 men, women and children drowned as result of this vessel sinking. Obviously, we are not competent to intrude into Indonesian territorial waters, but, obviously, given the deployment of vessels for border protection purposes, we are competent to rescue people from the ocean and are bound to rescue people from the ocean in international waters under the protocols of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-02-05,"—by leave—I wish to make a short statement in response to a Senate order to produce documents, moved by Senator Brown, about the Chief Scientist. I am advised that, in relation to items (a)(i) and (ii), neither the Chief Scientist nor his office has provided any direct advice to the government regarding funding or allocation of money or benefits to the Rio Tinto Foundation for a Sustainable Minerals Industry, nor with respect to any other Commonwealth funding to Rio Tinto. Attached are letters from the Chief Scientist to me and to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the Hon. Ian Macfarlane, containing advice in relation to HIsmelt, which noted the strategic importance of the project to Australia. The letters explicitly identify the Chief Scientist's dual interests.  
In relation to items (a)(iii) to (vi), I am advised that, other than as a member of the CRC committee of which he is one of 11 current members, neither the Chief Scientist nor his office has provided any advice on the CRCs to the government regarding funding or allocation of money or benefits. 
In relation to item (b), neither the CRC for Coal in Sustainable Development, nor the CRC for Clean Power from Lignite applied for funding in the 2002 CRC selection round. The CRC committee recommended total funding over seven years of $21.8 million for the CRC for Greenhouse Gas Technologies and did not recommend funding of the CRC for Renewable Energy. Attached is a copy of the document provided by the CRC committee concerning the applications recommended for funding. Information concerning applications not referred to in the Senate order has been excised as this information is outside the scope of the Senate order.
In relation to item (c), neither the Chief Scientist nor his office has provided any advice to the federal government on carbon sequestration, clean coal or related energy matters in determining Australia's national research priorities. The Chief Scientist participated in the national research priorities process as chair of the National Research Priorities Consultative Panel and as a member of the National Research Priorities Expert Advisory Committee.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-02-05,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
The request for documents which I put before the Senate in December, and which was then put to the minister, is to investigate the dual roles of the Chief Scientist, Dr Batterham, who advises the Prime Minister and the government on matters relating to science. This eminent scientist is also on the Rio Tinto Foundation for a Sustainable Minerals Industry and has a long association with that corporation and with other scientific and business establishments. I am concerned that there is a conflict of interest in the positions held by the Chief Scientist.
It is interesting at the outset that the government is tabling no advice in the first part of the request. All material or advice given to the government, including the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, by the Chief Scientist or his office—regarding funding or allocation of money or benefits to, firstly, the Rio Tinto Foundation for a Sustainable Minerals Industry and, secondly, any other Commonwealth funding to Rio Tinto—has not been forthcoming. The minister says that no advice has been given by the Chief Scientist. I will be looking at the statement the minister has made, with a view to coming back to the Senate to seek reasons as to why that advice has not been forthcoming.
The minister has given a list of documents that have been forthcoming and then indicated that some were not passed on to the Senate because they are outside the terms of reference of the request. And, clearly, some other matters have not been responded to in the way I might have expected. It will take some time for me to analyse the minister's response and the documents that have been tabled. Until I do that, it is not possible in immediate response to know to what degree this order of the Senate has been complied with and to what degree the order of the Senate has not been complied with. Let me say to the minister and the government, however, that I will be seeking the fullest compliance with that order and the information that was requested. If there has been a default—and, on the face of it, it appears to me that there has been—in the documents that were tabled today, I will come back to the Senate with a further request for the minister to provide that information. After all, it is a very important function of this chamber that information that is in the public interest be brought into the public domain.
I submit again that there is a conflict of interest in the positions held by the Chief Scientist. I do not believe you can be advising the Prime Minister and the government on science and the allocation of funding, of moneys, to science and at the same time be part of the business and industry suite that is seeking that funding. I did notice that the minister has told the Senate that part of the advice from the Chief Scientist—if I am not wrong—was for $21 million for greenhouse gas amelioration, and I think that is through sequestration. For those senators who may not know what that means, it is a coal industry request to be able to spend money to try to find some way of putting the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that come out of the mining and burning of coal back into the ground. I have very strong legal advice that this is not feasible technology. Even if it is, it is not going to give near the same result that spending that money on research into renewable energies will, because renewable energies do not produce the gasses in the first place and do not require the chancy techno-fix that is expected from coal, that in some way or other you can get rid of the greenhouse gases being produced. Let me remind the Senate that fossil fuel burning is at the heart of this matter, and there are massive penalties—economic, social and environmental—for us if we do not turn around the greenhouse gas phenomenon. 
There is competition here between the fossil fuel industries, which have a huge hold over the Prime Minister's policy direction, and the renewable energies industries, which have cutting edge technology and experimentation in this country and do provide an answer, with potentially enormous economic and employment windfalls to the country, if that is where we put our investment. There is competition between the coal industry, on the one hand, wanting to get its hands on what money is available from government to try to help reduce its massive impact on the environment and, on the other hand, the renewable energies industry, which actually displaces coal altogether and does not produce a global warming impact on the environment—and that is clearly the way we should be going.
I am aware that there are cutting edge technology centres for renewable energy— for solar power, for the development of hydrogen power—in Australia which are being defunded by the government at a time when massive amounts of money are going across the coal industry. It is wrong. It is not in the national interest, it is not in our economic interests, it is not in our employment interests and it is certainly not in our environmental interests. This is one of the big questions of the age. When you have a Chief Scientist who is caught in the middle—on the one hand advising the government and on the other hand employed by the fossil fuel industries—you have a direct conflict of interest. As I said, I will be studying these documents very carefully over the coming break, and I will come back to the Senate with the best advice I can get as to how we further investigate this matter and clear the air on it.",SENATE,<title>SCIENCE: FUNDING</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-02-05,"—I would like to speak on the same matter, Senator Brown's return to order, the thrust of which is essentially directed at establishing that there is a conflict of interest between Dr Batterham's roles as Chief Scientist and as Chief Technologist for Rio Tinto. My prima facie response to what the government says is that such a conflict of interest has yet to be demonstrated. There is no demonstrable conflict of interest in the documents that have been presented today. That is not to say that the substantive point that Senator Brown raises about the appearance of a conflict of interest is not a serious or important one.
There are matters that we ought to pay more attention to. However, I think that, in terms of the responsibilities of the Chief Scientist, Senator Brown may well be a bit ahead of himself. The evidence that we have seen has not shown that there is an actual conflict of interest in what Dr Batterham has done. There are very few opportunities where Dr Batterham actually gets to distribute moneys on behalf of the government. The fundamental question of political responsibility for the allocations of moneys remains with the government. The research priorities that the government has established are ultimately the responsibility of the government itself—in particular, Dr Nelson, although Mr Peter McGauran appears to have some responsibilities in this regard as well.
The evidence that I have seen suggests to me that the priorities that were presented by the Chief Scientist and the Priorities Consultative Panel were in fact very different from the priorities announced by government. When I read them I had the distinct impression that the priorities announced had been put through a focus group. They had that ring of the PR consultant about them, not necessarily the Chief Scientist's consultant. But that is by the by; the substantive question remains as to whether or not we should have a full-time chief scientist. The Labor Party has argued that there ought to be a full-time chief scientist. A research paper that we published last year made that very point. We cannot afford the appearance of a conflict of interest. While I have every confidence that Dr Robin Batterham has behaved properly, and all the advice coming to me from the scientific community in the university sector is that Dr Robin Batterham is a man of the highest integrity, it may well be that in the Greens movement there is a different view. I have yet to see the evidence to sustain that view and I look forward to Senator Brown's comments on that matter. But, on the basis of what I have seen, I think the claim that Dr Robin Batterham has behaved inappropriately or improperly in his function as Chief Scientist is not correct. 
I think we have a situation where we need further advice before that claim can be sustained. As I say, in my dealings with Dr Batterham he has behaved impeccably in all matters. However, I believe that the government ought to look at the question of making his position a full-time position, and I believe that is a matter that ought to be attended to quickly.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-02-05,"—The bill we are discussing is the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. On Minister Abbott's own count, this is the seventh time a bill claiming to exempt small business from unfair dismissal laws has been introduced into the Senate. The arguments against the bill have been well ventilated in the parliament and more broadly over the last few years, and Labor believes those arguments still stand. There continue to be sound policy reasons to vote against this bill. If anything, on a closer look at what the bill proposes, the case for opposing this bill becomes stronger. To recapitulate, the essence of the case against the bill has drawn on the following points. Firstly, the bill is inequitable. It would leave a substantial number of employees without the right to a fair go all round if sacked unfairly. Basically, employees of small businesses have no rights if they are sacked unfairly—regardless of the circumstances.
If this bill is about fairness, it fails miserably. Imagine a firm of solicitors or lawyers—and that is not hard for the Liberal Party to imagine because so many of them are lawyers—with 19 employees, most of them skilled lawyers, capriciously sacking a 17-year-old receptionist because she came to work late one morning due to her car having a flat tyre. The power imbalance, in terms of money and knowledge, between the employer and the employee in such a situation is, I think, obvious to all—all except, of course, this government. To deny such an employee a remedy is something that Labor will not agree to. The Liberal Party is arguing that, in these circumstances, an employee who is sacked unreasonably has no right of redress, no fundamental right to argue that they should be reinstated. Labor will not agree to that. 
We have had this bill before us seven times. The government can bring it up an eighth or a ninth time but we will not agree to that fundamentally unfair approach that the Liberal Party is proposing. But there are other more pressing and complex issues for small business. When all the other pressures facing small business are weighed up, the prospect of a federal unfair dismissal action would have to be some way down the list as an impediment to growth. Compare this to problems like sourcing capital, competitive pressures, a plethora of regulation in other fields like taxation—particularly with the GST—labelling requirements and workers compensation issues. In my own policy area there are the Liberal government's proposals to implement so-called choice in terms of superannuation funds—which is the deregulation of superannuation funds. These issues are much more on the minds of small business operators.
When this is done, the notion of affording fair treatment to a business's staff is relatively simple. Related to the above, a simple removal of the right to take an unfair dismissal action is not a panacea for small business and certainly is not the panacea that the Liberal government holds it out to be. Even if the right to an unfair dismissal case was removed under federal law, an employer would still be liable to unlawful termination actions, actions under antidiscrimination laws and complex and expensive actions that may exist under common law or under state law such as an unfair contracts provision. All that this bill would achieve is greater uncertainty, greater complexity and a greater prospect for more complex litigation.
The Liberal Party loves litigation. It loves lawyers. The Liberal Party is dominated by lawyers. We can see a front bench full of lawyers. These are lawyers who are generating work for lawyers. A consequence of removing an important facet of employment security from a segment of the labour market could be a move of skilled labour away from smaller business towards larger business. This could deprive small businesses of the talents and skills they need. The scope for this bill to free up job creation is still unproven. It is speculative and open to claim and counterclaim. We have not seen hard evidence. We have seen lots of assertion— assertion after assertion. Lawyers are very fond of assertion. They can turn black into white and white into black and the Liberal government is very good at doing that. But it is assertion—it is not hard, proven, tested fact about these continual claims that are made about job creation.
In entertaining this issue, it should not be construed that Labor sees merit in the bill. But, to the extent that the Liberal government claims that unfair dismissal laws inhibit job creation, the case is just not convincing. Indeed, when the Liberal government briefed senior counsel and called on Professor Mark Wooden from the Melbourne Institute to give evidence that unfair dismissal laws killed jobs, he failed to persuade the full court of the Federal Court. I am, of course, referring to the Hamzy case, where the judges—these are impartial, independent persons who were asked to determine the strength of this case about job creation—were unanimous in concluding that:
It seems unfortunate that nobody has investigated whether there is any relationship between unfair dismissal legislation and employment growth. There has been much assertion on this topic during recent years, but apparently no effort to ascertain the factual situation.
Then, later:
... it seems to us the suggestion of a relationship between unfair dismissal laws and employment inhibition is unproven. 
After Professor Wooden's unconvincing appearance in the Federal Court, the government called on one of his colleagues from the Melbourne Institute—no less a person than the Institute's Assistant Director, Mr Don Harding—to take a second look at the issue. Mr Harding's report was based on a telephone survey of small and medium sized business. He prefaces his report with a mention of earlier surveys of business and employers which touch on unfair dismissal laws. Unfortunately for Mr Harding, in earlier surveys unfair dismissal laws barely rated a mention as a deterrent for hiring decisions. However, to Mr Harding's credit, he does cite the results of earlier studies. For reasons I will give later, Labor finds the results of these studies more reliable than Mr Harding's survey.
I will inform the Senate of what was found in, firstly, the July 2002 Yellow Pages small/medium business questionnaireand, secondly, the 1995 Australian workplace industrial relations survey. In the Yellow Pages survey, 5.6 per cent of firms mentioned any of the following as a barrier to hiring new staff: employment conditions, unfair dismissal, industrial relations, and safety and health. Remember that unfair dismissal was lumped in with a bundle of other factors, so one could assume that this figure of 5.6 per cent for businesses mentioning these issues as an impediment to job creation is on the high side. This assumption is borne out when one reconciles the Yellow Pages results with the Australian workplace survey. According to the Australian workplace survey, only 1.4 per cent of respondents mentioned unfair dismissal laws as a discrete impediment to taking on new employees. Of course, these are not the sorts of figures that would impress a panel of judges or any other reasonably impartial and free-thinking person—1.4 per cent hardly stands out as a crushing figure.
So Mr Harding takes another tack. Instead of asking employers to freely volunteer what they thought were influences on their hiring decisions, he resorted to push polling—that is where you plant ideas in the minds of the people that you are polling. The Liberal Party is infamous for this. Mr Harding argues that a more reliable result can be obtained by prompt and suggestion, and that is what he does. For example, in the conduct of his telephone survey, when interviewers called businesses seeking a dollar figure from business on the cost in time and money of complying with the law and reducing their potential for exposure to unfair dismissal action, the interviewers were given the following instruction:
Instruction to interviewer: If response is that it is hard to quantify costs, prompt by asking for best estimate. If response is that costs vary from year to year, ask for cost in best year and cost in worst year and take a midpoint. If a range is given, code the midpoint of the range.
After this prompting, it should be pointed out that only about a third of businesses surveyed said that there was an increase in costs associated with an unfair dismissal law. However, buried in the report was the fact that a greater proportion of employers surveyed said that unfair dismissal laws had no effect on the bottom line, despite the prompting.
When one looks at the amounts proffered by the employers after all of this prompting, there appears to be no rhyme or reason in the results. While Mr Harding said that care should be taken in relying on these figures, some of them bounce around so wildly that you have to be sceptical. Take figures given for the cost of unfair dismissal laws on businesses in the finance industry as an average cost per full-time employee, broken up by the size of business—the sizes given are one to five, six to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 50, 51 to 100 and 100-plus employees. One would expect some fluctuation in the reported costs associated with unfair dismissal on different sized businesses in the finance industry, but one would also expect some discernible pattern—and I certainly cannot find it. The figures are as follows: the average claim cost for one to five employees is $45 per employee. For six to 10 employees, the average cost is $755 per employee. For 11 to 20 employees, the average cost is zero. For 21 to 50 employees, the average cost is $348 per employee. For 51 to 100 employees, the average cost is $17 per employee. For more than 100 employees, the average cost is $8 per employee. 
Going across industries for businesses with one to five employees the figures jump about from $44 per employee in the wholesale trade to $1,087 in accommodation—that is the hospitality industry. So overall the figure given per employee per year ranges from $30,000 to zero. Despite no apparent science or reason in these reported amounts, Mr Harding still averaged them out to be $296 per employee per year. He then multiplied this figure with the number of small and medium sized businesses in Australia. This then gives an astounding figure of $1.3 billion. This is cited as the alleged direct cost of unfair dismissal laws to small business in Australia. It is just nonsense—absolute wacky nonsense! This was picked up and put as the banner on the minister's press release about the report. While the minister buys this figure, we on the Labor side of the Senate certainly do not.
On the issue of job creation the Liberal government's case can be exposed as spurious on other grounds. The reach of the government's proposed exemption is limited by the spread of federal law. Constitutional constraints on the Commonwealth mean that of the nation's one million-plus small businesses only one-fifth come under federal law. This means that four-fifths of small business employees have a remedy under state law. It is unconscionable to let this government create an unfortunate minority of workers who would be deprived of recourse or justice if unfairly sacked. This amounts to industrial apartheid. A worker in a small business in a state award firm would have her or his day in court if unfairly sacked, as would an employee in a federal award firm with 21 employees, but the estimated 2,000 applicants for relief from small businesses each year in the federal jurisdiction would be told—if this Liberal government has its way—to go away: `You don't have any opportunity to present a case in front of a tribunal in any way, shape or form. Go away.' It is an utterly absurd situation.
Moving on, there is another aspect of the debate that is yet to be fully considered. I refer to an issue touched on by Marilyn Pittard from Monash University, who is also a consultant to Clayton Utz. In a paper authorised by Ms Pittard she noted that employers could structure their businesses to take advantage of the exemption proposed in this bill. I am sure she would have to be a lawyer, coming up with these sorts of contrived arrangements. I do not want to give unscrupulous employers ideas, but perhaps this could happen under the Liberal government's laws if the bill were passed.
Let us take the hypothetical example of company X with 2,000 employees and a turnover of $1 billion. If the bill were made law, from its commencement date company X could start a practice of no longer employing its staff directly but instead employing them in subsidiary companies such as company X1, company X2 and so on. If each of these subsidiary companies has fewer than 20 employees, the large parent company will avoid having to account for unfair dismissals. Obviously this is most unfair, yet it may well be lawful under this bill if it is passed. I want to bring to the Senate's attention the fact that safeguards against such a scam are available. For example, there is a grouping mechanism incorporated in the New South Wales Employment Protection Act 1982. This mechanism prevents large businesses from exploiting the small business exemption under the New South Wales act, but this Liberal government saw fit to leave them out of its bill. This government, dominated by lawyers, is coming up with all sorts of contrived schemes and arrangements to encourage employers to avoid their legal obligations.
These arguments expose this bill for what it really is: bad policy, bad law, missing the mark and fundamentally unfair. We have a Liberal government proposing to take away from a minority of employees their right to argue a case of unfair dismissal in an industrial commission or court—their fundamental right. I would have thought that it was generally accepted in this country that it is a fundamental right for all citizens and residents to be able to have an opportunity in any sense to argue a position in front of an industrial tribunal or court. There might be all sorts of other impediments—for example, the cost of a lawyer to represent you if you need one—but it is fundamental in Australian law that every citizen and every resident has that right of access, at least in theory. And here we have the Liberal Party—not much of a liberal party any more, more of a conservative party—intending to take away that fundamental right from a number of citizens of this country. 
I want to return to the illustration of how this bill could lead to unfairness by way of the example of the hypothetical 17-year-old receptionist sacked for being late for work one morning. If this 17-year-old's parents were small business proprietors, one wonders whether they would agree with the Liberal government's line that she deserves no employment protection. How many senators in this place would like it if their children— for whatever reason—were sacked and had no ability to argue their case in an industrial tribunal? You take away that fundamental right.
—You didn't say hypothetical before. It's certainly hypothetical now.
—This is anti-family, Senator McGauran.
—It's hypothetical.
—It's not hypothetical. Taking away young people's rights to appear in an industrial jurisdiction to argue a case is what the Liberal Party is at—taking away the rights, slowly but surely, of Australian workers. But one would expect that the parents of such a worker would want her treated decently, fairly and with dignity. To excuse her boss from affording her such respect simply because of the 20-employee criterion in this bill would be seen as an affront to justice. Labor realises that most small businesses will treat their employees fairly. For the vast majority of small business employees there will be no need for an unfair dismissal action.
Labor will oppose this bill and, in the committee stage, move amendments that will afford justice to all employees and at the same time speed up the simplified manner in which an unfair dismissal claim is processed. The Labor approach is balanced, fair and just. It preserves a right for employees who are harshly dealt with but it gives businesses a straightforward, cost-effective and simple manner in which to defend their actions. If the Liberal government, dominated by lawyers, got the lawyers out of it, things would be a lot less costly in this jurisdiction. If the law means that employers must confer on the fairness of their employees' conditions, is this inherently bad? Such an obligation would have an educative function and would enhance employment relations practices across the board. This is to be commended. Here lies another reason to oppose this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-02-05,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. Yet again, this chamber is faced with the absurdly titled fair dismissal legislation. It was originally designed as a double dissolution trigger and that is still its purpose. It would be unfair to disappoint the coalition and so, yet again, the Australian Democrats will remain steadfast in opposing the main tenet underpinning this bill—that it is fair to be unfair and all right to break your promises and agreements.
After gutting this bill and substituting amendments, the Senate passed it on 27 June of last year. These amendments were considered by the House of Representatives on 28 June and the bill was set aside. An attempt was made to reintroduce the bill late last year, but the Senate refused the cut-off exemption. The main provision of this bill is to exempt employers who hire fewer than 20 employees from the unfair dismissal provisions in the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which is one of six unfair dismissal regimes. However, unlike previous attempts, only new employees dismissed from federally regulated small businesses will be prevented from seeking an unfair dismissal remedy. In previous parliaments, the Democrats have opposed this legislation and given the government a consequent double dissolution trigger. A second failure by the Senate to pass this bill has the potential to trigger a double dissolution. The Democrats will not be deterred by a DD possibility from standing by the principles we have stood by each time that unfair dismissal laws of this kind have been presented to the parliament. 
Shamefully, this is the seventh time that the coalition government will attempt to go back on its 1996 federal election campaign promise that all workers would be covered for unfair dismissals. During the 1996 campaign, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia asked the coalition, the Democrats and the Labor Party to support an exemption for small business from the federal unfair dismissal laws. All parties—the National Party, the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and the Democrats—refused in 1996 on the basis that it would breach the `fair go all around' approach.
Shamefully, this is also the seventh time the coalition have breached their agreement with the Democrats that all workers would be covered for unfair dismissals in all businesses. That agreement allowed the 1996 Workplace Relations Act to pass through the Senate with Democrat support. Unfair dismissal amendments which were agreed to included, at that time, that hearings be held in the Industrial Relations Commission instead of the Federal Court, making proceedings less formal, expensive and time consuming; that there be disincentives to speculative or unmeritorious unfair dismissal claims; that costs be awarded against an employee found to have made a frivolous or vexatious claim; that employees pay a $50 application fee; that the viability of the employer be taken into account in deciding whether to award damages in lieu of reinstatement and that greater restrictions be placed on probationary, casual and specified term contract employees applying for unfair dismissal relief.
Following these reforms, the number of unfair dismissal cases fell by at least 40 per cent, and this occurred very shortly after the reforms. This large fall was despite Victoria sensibly referring its powers to come almost completely under federal workplace relations law, with a consequent transferral of Victorian state unfair dismissal cases to sole federal jurisdiction. Just five years later, in September 2001, the unfair dismissal laws were again reformed to address remaining abuses of the system. Greater accountability measures on all parties, including lawyers and advisers, were introduced to deter large settlement payments being extracted from employers in false applications. The Senate passed numerous Australian Democrat amendments to improve processes and to reduce both litigation and delays. The reforms included a default three-month qualifying period of employment before unfair dismissal claims could be brought by new employees, and greater rigour in the processing of unfair dismissal claims by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
The small business lobby considered the 2001 changes a big win, claiming that they provided the much needed certainty and confidence for employers when deciding to hire new employees. Even Minister Tony Abbott claimed it was a very good day for small business around Australia. He said, `It really will take the unfair dismissal monkey off the back of small businesses to a great extent.' What is more, since the 2001 changes, figures provided by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations as at September 2002 show a further decline in the annual number of federal unfair dismissal claims, which are down by over 1,000 claims a year or by a further 12 per cent. In my own state of Western Australia, federal unfair dismissal claims made under federal jurisdiction for small business number less than 100. In Queensland it is less than 100, and in a number of states and territories it is well less than 50. What a lot of fuss there is about those numbers. This very significant decrease—at least a halving since 1996— makes it unlikely that there continues to be a swag of unmeritorious and vexatious unfair dismissal claims. Importantly, it has been achieved through addressing small business concerns without impairing the substantive rights of employees.
The same cannot be said of the other five jurisdictions, where the bulk of unfair dismissal applications lie. The great problem with coalition rhetoric on this topic is that, were they ever to get this legislation through, they would experience the fury of small business when those businesses discovered that they mostly fall under the looser and less onerous state jurisdictions. While there are a number of common features of the six systems, a table comparing the features of federal and state termination laws shows that the Commonwealth has the tightest regime. The great difficulty with the dismissal laws in Australia is not only their variance across the six regimes and not only that small businesses have no idea that they mostly fall under state not federal laws, but the confusion that results from a proportion of businesses that are apparently respondent to both federal and state awards and therefore to more than one unfair dismissal regime. 
Surveys illustrate that businesses either do not know what unfair dismissal laws they are covered by or have no idea what the provisions of those laws are. Those same surveys usually pretend that they have got informed responses—from businesses who, understandably, are confused about the systems, know little of the law and have no direct experience of their application. Because of my role as spokesperson for workplace relations over the last 6½ years for the Democrats, my office sometimes gets calls on the unfair dismissal issue—often when it is before the Senate, occasionally otherwise. Invariably, during those calls I will first ask: `Which law do you fall under?' `I don't know.' `What are the provisions of the law?' `I don't know.' `How do you think you are affected? Have you taken advice on this?' `Perhaps,' `No,' or `Maybe.' It is not a good state of affairs.
A 1999 OECD job study reported that Australia was in the `easy to dismiss' bottom quintile along with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland. Unfair dismissal provisions can actually enhance sound and efficient human resource management as well as the professionalism of a business. Any business, regardless of size, has an interest in knowing these laws and embracing them, since the practice of good workplace relations with your employees produces good outcomes. It makes good business sense to foster a healthy workplace relations system. A system underpinned by autocratic methods does nothing for productivity or a business's ongoing competitiveness. It is for that reason that right from the start the Democrats supported Labor's initiation of enterprise bargaining and the coalition's improvement of it. At enterprise bargaining levels, you get improvements in relationships and better productivity outcomes.
For the record, I will restate the Democrats' position in consistently opposing this bill. First, we do not agree with the coalition's repeated and highly exaggerated claim that the unfair dismissal laws remain a serious impediment to the creation of additional jobs. In an address to the Tasmanian Liberals in November of last year, the Prime Minister said:
... we would create tens of thousands of more jobs if the Labor Party and the Democrats and others would allow our changes to the unfair dismissal laws presently hampering small business to pass through the Senate.
Without being rude to the Prime Minister, what bunkum! The proposition being put is that withdrawing the unfair dismissal rights of about 2,500 employees who make claims among the 1.6 million small businesses would create `tens of thousands' of jobs. Where is the credible research and empirical data to justify such an extrapolation? There is none. Instead, spurred on by anecdotal stories and an inappropriate reliance on selected business surveys—many of which are biased—an attempt has been made to prove the radical and tenuous assumption that businesses will not hire because they believe they cannot fire. That is not shown by the growth in employment that the coalition boasts of or by the different rates of employment growth in small business compared with large business. It is much faster in small business. In the case of Queensland, when the then coalition government introduced an exemption for small business it had no effect whatsoever on job creation. We have Senate evidence to that effect from the Queensland government.
The coalition government's inference that much of the health of the employment relationship revolves around unfair dismissal laws is nothing more than a beat-up. The fact is that when the coalition government beats this issue up, it makes its way into small business surveys of issues that matter. When the coalition switch off the publicity, it falls away. The coalition has never produced material which is readily accessible for small business that they can easily refer to when looking at this area. It did not rate a mention in the Australia-wide CPA survey of 705 small businesses in February 2002. It was not even included in the top five reasons for not hiring more staff. 
To counter the employment argument even further, a recent Federal Court judgment found:
In the absence of any evidence about the matter, it seems to us the suggestion of a relationship between unfair dismissal laws and employment inhibition is unproven.
Not that that will deter the political and ideological propagandists. Secondly, the coalition government's claim that Australian workers are excessively protected is again untrue. As recently as 2001, using 1999 data the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development stated that Australia— along with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland—was in the bottom quintile of comparative OECD employment protection legislation. In other words, dismissal is easier in those countries.
Thirdly, the Democrats only partially accept the claim that unfair dismissal exemptions will reduce small business costs. It is probably true that there is a cost consequence arising from the perception of unfair dismissal practices, and for those directly affected there will be costs. It is more the case that small business is still baffled about unfair dismissals—an aspect that did rate a mention in the CPA survey. It found that, because of complex and ill-defined procedural requirements, there is still a need to simplify the compliance processes and for educational initiatives to better inform small business about their real capacity to dismiss employees.
As I have pointed out before, the Democrats are more than happy to continue to look at process issues. We supported some of the Labor amendments last time round in exactly that area. We have always preferred to address specific concerns of business about the procedures, rather than adopt the government's approach of `fixing' the problem by denying 2.8 million small business employees the right to challenge an unfair dismissal, of which about 2,600 take advantage under the federal laws.
Above all, the confusion experienced by small business emanates from the fact that Australia is burdened with six different industrial relations systems and thus six different unfair dismissal jurisdictions. The Democrats consider it more important that the Commonwealth attempt to procure some commonality across these jurisdictions. It was with some pleasure that the Democrats noted that the government is going to attempt to widen the coverage of their unfair dismissal provisions. We think it is helpful to have commonality in this area.
Unfair dismissal applications are most often pursued under state laws, not federal law, with variation between states and industries. Likewise, not all employing small businesses fall under the federal jurisdiction, with not more than 30 per cent of employing small businesses falling under federal laws— although, as the department will readily attest, the figures are always difficult to get. It is frequently the case that those who complain about unfair dismissal laws are subject to their state jurisdiction.
On the basis of both statistics and individual reporting, it is absolutely clear that federal unfair dismissal laws are not the major issue facing small business that the coalition beat it up to be. For instance, in the five years after the 1996 changes, a paltry 2,715 unfair dismissal applications have been arbitrated under the federal system. The vast majority of these employees were found to be blameless, and less than five per cent—or 132 people in five years—of arbitrated cases resulted in reinstatement. What system is fair when a worker can be sacked without due cause and lose his or her job and prospects for future employment? If the government were serious about improving employment and decluttering the system, it would consider giving the Industrial Relations Commission greater power to use reinstatement as a remedy—or as an improved or increased remedy—for blameless workers.
Once an employee has been unfairly dismissed, an effective defamation has occurred. This actually reduces the worker's future employability and unduly increases the person's reliance on government benefits. The damage to society is clearly manifold. Furthermore, under the federal unfair dismissal laws, most applications are in fact made against large companies rather than small businesses, with 65 per cent or two-thirds of claims being made against big business, not small business. It is ironic that some small business groups and individuals argue for the right to sack workers unjustly while at the same time campaigning against being discriminated against through big business practices, particularly as tenants. I wish the coalition would spend as much time on tenancy law and tenants' rights as they have on this issue. It is a disgrace. The analogy between the employer-employee and landlord-tenant relationships should not escape those advocates in this area. 
To continue to waste parliament's time on unfair dismissals reveals a government that is determined to get a double dissolution trigger. It also reveals a government that attempts to demonise both the issue and the workers involved. Many, if not most, Australians support the idea that both employers and employees have a right to fairness in relation to dismissal. But a fair go all round is a long way from the two-tiered system that Minister Abbott and his predecessor, Minister Reith, have brought to the Senate. To label the federal unfair dismissal laws that they themselves introduced as `ridiculous' is ridiculous in itself. This government will also deny those small business employees affected legal recourse against an employer who has sacked them harshly, unjustly or unfairly if it gets this bill through. This is a long way from keeping the promise of fair treatment all round.
The Democrats are keen for this government—and the opposition, for that matter— to join us in attending to a broader range of industrial issues, such as protecting employee entitlements, extending maternity leave provisions, work-family relationships, problems of unemployment, underemployment and welfare dependency, unpaid and excessive overtime and lengthy working hours. These are just some of the issues. Between 1995 and 2001 the proportion of full-time employees who would prefer to work less—not more but less—almost doubled to 36.7 per cent. For the 16 per cent of workers putting in more than 49 hours a week, the percentage shot up from 38.1 per cent to 58.2 per cent. If the government is serious about unemployment and underemployment, this intensification of the working week clearly requires addressing. The excessive hours worked by a section of our working population need addressing because they have serious social and economic costs. They have costs that can be measured publicly through our health, social welfare and workers compensation systems, and privately through the erosion of family life, relationships and households.
I will close by referring to some figures. I find that many of the advocates on the coalition side who are sent out to barrack for their side—and that is their job—unfortunately do not refer to the statistics or the figures. Typically I will say to a member of the coalition, `You're from such a state; how many unfair dismissal applications are there in that state under federal law?' They do not know. If I ask, `What is the percentage under state law?', they do not know. I will help you out, Senator Boswell; I will give you the Queensland figures, as you are about to speak. For the year at September 2002, there were 359 unfair dismissal applications in Queensland under federal law, down from 623 in 1996, and of that 359 about 21 per cent were from small business. My quick maths would say that is less than 80—about 70. So there were 70 unfair dismissal applications in Queensland under federal law which I am going to hear about very passionately from you, I am sure. Australia-wide, the total number in 1996 was 14,499. It is now 7,283, despite the Commonwealth taking on all of Victoria's state unfair dismissal applications as well.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2003-02-05,"—If Senator Sherry were here, I would say to him that he is going to listen not to a lawyer—he accuses the coalition of being overrun by lawyers—but to a genuine small business person who spent 18 years in a previous life, before coming into the Senate, in small business. So the information I give the Senate is straight from the horse's mouth, as someone who employed people for 18 years. My wife and I started a small business which grew into something that was not terribly big, but in terms of what I was doing as a manufacturer's agent we employed nine people. 
Let me say this to the people from the Labor Party and to Senator Murray. I am disappointed in Senator Murray today, because I do consider him to be genuinely interested in small business. He has supported me and I have supported him on various occasions, but I think he has got it wrong on this occasion. Let me tell you, Senator Murray, that people do not go out to dismiss people. In fact, people go out to hold the people that they have. I will concede that there are bad bosses and there are bad employees and you will never get the balance right, but a bad boss will not hold a genuine employee—he will go to someone else—and a genuine employee will not work for a bad boss and vice versa. It sorts itself out.
There are other reasons why people dismiss employees. It is not a question of going in there, not liking someone and sacking them. There are occasions in small business when you just have to react to the market. You may have to put someone off when you may not want to. It has happened to me. As a manufacturer's agent, if I lost an agency I would have to downsize the staff. It was not anything to do with the worker. I would have to go to them and say, `Look, I don't need three storemen-packers. I'm sorry, you've done well, but I just can't afford to pay you.' Down at the lower end of small business, there is no margin. You are living from hand to mouth. For that reason, you may have to take an employee aside and say, `I'm sorry about this. I've lost this particular agency, I've lost this account. We don't need three or four storemen now. I'm sorry, but you'll have to leave.' Under the present conditions, that is not possible any more.
—That's a redundancy, not an unfair dismissal.
—Hear what I am saying, because I do know what I am talking about here, Senator. For various reasons, you can have to downsize your business. Now you cannot do that without taking court orders and things like that. I believe that employees have the right to work for someone and that the employer has the right to employ someone. If you have to rely on an act of parliament to achieve that, you are not going to get cohesion in small business. I had a small business and I was very close to the people I employed. I assisted them in many ways. On occasions, if their children got married I would help them out with paying for the wedding and so forth. We were a very close and a very good little firm and we produced well. If you took away the right for me to say to someone, `Look, I just can't afford to keep you,' so that he said, `Well, I'm going to take this to court and I'm going to fight it,' and my response was, `I will have to get a solicitor,' and then we went to court and went through the process, my reaction would be: `I am not going to employ anyone. I am going to employ the absolute minimum number of people that I can. I will not employ people. I will not put people on. I will put them on in casual positions and I will outsource everything I can, including making various things and photocopying and those sorts of things.' I would not take the risk of employing anyone who was not completely necessary.
I have not lost my contacts in small business. The National Party is virtually 90 per cent small business owners and farmers. Every meeting that I go to, I get harangued: `What are you going to do about the small business laws, the unfair dismissal laws?' I respond by saying that we have put them up seven times, as far as the under-20s are concerned, and about 22 times in total. They just cannot understand why they do not get passed. These are decent people and they employ people, but there is a war story in many, many people whom you talk to. I know that anecdotes given in the Senate do not have impact, but I want to tell you a story about a very good friend of mine whom I have known since I was selling boat fittings. I started that when I was about 26. We became friends. I was selling boat fittings, and he was behind a counter. A smart young fellow, he developed a business in partnership and that business worked. It ended up employing 28 people. The partners agreed to split, an amicable arrangement was made and my particular friend walked out with a fair amount of money. He decided to buy a small business, and when the small business adjoining came up for sale he bought that. That happened to be a fruit shop. The story goes that a young lady came in and got a job. About two weeks later she said, `I'm pregnant. I can't lift.' He said, `But this job is lifting. You've got to be able to do it. When you applied for this job you knew what the job was.' The long and the short of it is that he went to court and $15,000 later he said to his wife, `It's not worth it. We don't need the money. We don't have to persecute ourselves like this—we just don't have to do that.' He shut both businesses down and he walked away. 
That is a war story that I happen to know. The interesting thing about this is that we shared a yacht. He was a battler. He came from a family that was Labor Party—he was one of the very few people in the yacht club that did. His father was a fitter and turner, and he was a small business person. He used to stand up for the Labor Party and, as I say, there were not too many Labor Party supporters at the yacht club. But I can tell you that now you would not get a more devout, staunch supporter of the coalition than this particular friend of mine. He was bitten badly—a decent guy who went out to try to employ a few people and to run his own business and in the end he just said that it was not worth it. There are thousands of those stories, and we can document them.
Senator Murray says that we should not really worry about this. Because this is mostly state legislation he says, `Let us not worry about it because it is not going to affect that many people.' But, if the principle is wrong federally, then the principle is wrong state-wise. We as a parliament should address the principle, not the numbers. If the principle is wrong, we should vote against it. I cannot understand the Labor Party because they must know—it must be so clear to them—that, if they want to win an election, they have to get the small business community onside. They cannot win an election by thumbing their nose at the small business community; it employs the biggest number of people. It is the biggest community group. It just would not be possible to do that. If they continue to support this legislation— and I know that they will be getting pressure from the unions—they will consign themselves to the opposition benches for the next 20 years.
As I have said, not only is it the employees that you have to win over but an employee has influence on his workers—the storemen and packers, the reps, the typists and so forth. He can use that influence to get people to shift across from the Labor Party and to get them to vote for the coalition. If you antagonise someone, he will do it. And those opposite are antagonising the small business sector. They say that no supporting evidence is available to prove that this law prevents the employment of people. The fact is that a survey released in 2001 showed that 57 per cent of business believe that unfair dismissal laws are an important issue. I am surprised that it is 57 per cent. I move around from party meeting to party meeting—as all of us do here—and I continually hear from farmers and small business people, `What are you going to do about this issue?' When we tell them that we have put it up 22 times, they cannot quite understand it. As part of the survey, many small businesses indicated that they would be more likely to recruit new employees if they were exempted from the current unfair dismissal laws. It is so obvious that, if you are in the employment game, you do not want to go to a solicitor if you want to put people off, and you are going to do everything in your power not to put people on. One million private sector non-agricultural small businesses in Australia, which account for 98 per cent of all businesses, rely on assistance to ensure that the workplace relations system is on their side. People could make the decision that if they believe the boss is a so-and-so they will leave because there are other jobs out there.
Here are a few examples of how current laws work against small business. I will relate the personal experience of a particular friend whom I have known for 30 years, first as a counterjumper who sold boat fittings, second as a businessperson who employed 28 people and then as a co-yacht owner with me. That person was a staunch Labor supporter. He is now one of the most staunch defenders of the coalition because unfair dismissal cost him $15,000 and his walking out of two businesses. Another example is that of a small Melbourne engineering company which had to terminate two casuals and a permanent employee because of business downturn arising from a strike overseas. The applicant for the unfair dismissal requested a settlement of $5,500. The solicitor's advice was that defending the claim would cost up to $15,000, so the business handed over $5,500 because it was the least expensive option. 
Senator Murray says that the number of challenges to unfair dismissal is falling. One of the reasons the number is going down is that people are throwing their hands up in surrender and saying, `It's five grand or it's three grand or it's two grand; let's get out of it.' No-one wants to get involved in a court action, and many of them just pay the settlement and get out of it. I am sure most cases never get to court because people just say, `That was a bad decision; let's cut and run and get out of that decision.' I cannot guess the number, but people I talk to say, `We paid the damn thing and walked away. It wasn't worth fighting for; it was three grand.'
The response to that is that, when those people employ someone else, they are not going to employ young, inexperienced people who have no track record. They are going to make sure someone has just about got an ironclad reference before they put them on; they are not going to do anything in their workshop, factory or office that they can do outside. I say to the Labor Party, who probably believe they are doing the right thing, that this is straight from the horse's mouth. I was there for 18 years. When I started out, it was my wife and me; I ended up with a business that employed nine people. I was not in any way challenging BHP, but it was a good little business; it provided a good living. I know what people do and I know what actions they take. Things would be no different now as they were then.
As I said when I started this speech, you do not go out to sack people. If anyone is half-good, you encourage them. You try and get them better. It is only the most dismal failures that you have to take action against to protect yourself—people that fight, people that take drugs or something like that. Those are the only people that you have to react to. 
I will give another example. To survive a financial downturn, the owner of a leather-goods business employing up to 10 people believed that the only option to remain viable was to downsize by one employee. His lawyer told him that it would cost him around $20,000 to pay off his employee under the unfair dismissal laws. Instead, this business decided to close down. That is 10 people out of work. You can go on and on. A small motor industry in New South Wales faced an unfair dismissal claim from a former employee dismissed for poor work performance. Despite repeated warnings, the company agreed to settle the matter to avoid legal costs, and it cost $9,000.
We have been told there is no hard evidence and that all we ever get in the Senate is anecdotal responses. The Melbourne Institute released, in October 2002, some economic and social research done at the University of Melbourne, which shows that the state and federal unfair dismissal laws cost small and medium business $1.3 billion each year. The research also shows that the dismissal laws have had a significant impact on jobs. These laws have contributed to the loss of about 77,000 jobs from businesses—businesses which used to employ staff and now no longer employ anyone. About 60,000 of these jobs are from small businesses with less than 20,000 employees. That research is from the University of Melbourne. I suppose it would be as creditable as any other research. 
I always rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] because I feel passionately about it. There are many, many struggling small businesses out there. It is like a slalom course or an obstacle course in small business. It is hard; it is tough. Out of every 100 small businesses that start, in eight years time I think there are six left. The casualties are immense. You are just throwing more obstacles in the way of small business. Many of these small businesses are like small acorns and can grow up and become big businesses but, if you knock them off at the beginning, then they do not have the opportunity to turn into big businesses. It is a real obstacle. I have tried to tell the Senate in my own way what actually happens out there in the small business world. I spent 18 years in that world. I think that I know what I am talking about. I know this legislation will not pass. If you wanted to do something meaningful for small business, you could, but you are not going to vote for this legislation— you cannot; the unions will not allow you to do it.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2003-02-05,"—One thing that Senator Boswell said that is right—and it is not very often he says anything that I can agree is correct—is that there are many struggling small businesses out there. You are right. The problem is that you are wrong to suggest that they are struggling because of unfair dismissal rules or laws—
—I did not say that; I said it was just another obstacle.
—It is not an obstacle of any consequence. Think about their requirements under the GST provisions introduced by this government, and about other government reporting requirements put in place by this government. They are the things that are making small businesses struggle out there, not unfair dismissal laws. Once again, we see the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] before this chamber. Its purpose is the same now as it has been in the bill's other guises, and that is to exempt those small businesses with fewer than 20 employees, which are bound by federal awards, from the dismissal laws of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. In this bill, only new employees dismissed from federally regulated small business will be excluded from taking an unfair dismissal remedy. A new employee will retain the right to contest termination where it appears to have been made on discriminatory grounds, such as age, pregnancy, religious belief or something of that nature.
Like many of my colleagues, I could simply say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, `Refer to certain pages of Hansard and you will be able to see what we are saying yet again,' but I will not do that, because, when you have a double dissolution trigger before you, I think it is important to address the issue. Labor's approach to unfair dismissal is guided by three central principles. Firstly, we say that unfair dismissal laws—or, as the government likes to say in their prettied-up term, `fair dismissal laws'—are as much educative as regulatory. The development of unfair dismissal laws over two decades has been vital in promoting the concept of a fair go and a mutual obligation of good faith in the Australian workplace.
Secondly, unfair dismissal laws should be workable and accessible for employees and employers. They should be accessible to all employers and all employees equally, not just to some, as this government would prefer. Labor recognises there are still problems of cost and procedure. I can recall on many occasions prior to coming to this place lamenting about the procedural processes and costs of federal unfair dismissal laws. The parliament should be turning its attention to addressing those issues that are, in my view, quite simple to remedy. It should turn its attention to that rather than trying to create an employer-biased and discriminatory process.
The third point in the central principles that Labor hold is that unfair dismissal laws are designed to promote employment security for those who have been unfairly treated. Changes to unfair dismissal laws should not erode employment security by stripping employees of the right to a fair go—a right to challenge—simply because of where they work. But the government's exclusion of small business employees badly fails the test for a fair go.
What the bill essentially creates is two distinct classes of employees: those with an entitlement to a fair go, and those without. There is no question; it is simply a case of where you work and how many work at the same place. Those who work in factory A with 21 employees retain the right to challenge their employer if they are dismissed unfairly. But in factory B right next door, the workers have no such rights. These workers share the same bus to work, they go to the same shop to buy their lunch and more than likely they have a beer at the same pub on the way home. Everything, in that case, makes these workers equal. They may even share the same wage rates. But there is an exception: one company is a little bit bigger. It has 21 or 25 or 30 or 100 employees, but its colleagues next door have less than 20. So there is discrimination. This government likes to promote itself as a non-discriminatory government, and I think there may be other opportunities to address many areas to elaborate on that. But in this particular bill the government is exposing itself as one that has a discriminatory streak. 
Those who work in the first of the two factories I referred to—the one with more than 20 employees—will experience a greater level of job security. As a matter of public policy, how can the government justify a situation where employees working side by side have differing rights depending on where they are—factory A or factory B? How can they have different rights? They are in the same street, the same suburb; they travel on the same transport, they eat at the same shops and probably share their leisure time in many ways.
There are many flaws in the proposed bill as it is presented to us. Some of those flaws go to the fact that the bill denies the basic rights of all employees to the same protection of the law, irrespective of the size of their employer. It makes you wonder whether the government is thinking it ought to change the workers compensation laws so that if you get hurt in one factory you will not have the same cover as if you work in another factory. This is the sort of thing that this government is doing—dividing the community as much as it can on a principle that it does not need to tamper with, apart from tidying up things such as costs and procedures. But, no, this government goes further.
Another flaw is that we have yet to see any conclusive evidence—despite the ramblings of some in this chamber on the other side—to support the government's claims that federal unfair dismissal laws have acted as a significant brake on employment growth; no evidence. But then, we do not have very much evidence from the government on the question of Iraq, so why on something such as unfair dismissal laws would they care to produce it?
The existing statutory exclusions from the unfair dismissal regime are already quite significant, and the case for further exemptions specifically directed to small business fails to take these things into account. Another flaw is that the existing federal unfair dismissal laws confer rights on individual employees and less directly on registered industrial organisations. It has to be said that the Labor Party has always recognised the importance of small business to our economy, particularly when we go into the regions and the rural parts of the country.
I see Senator Boswell is not in the chamber, but it might pay him to actually go out into the country and see how small businesses are operating in regional and rural areas. He might find that what he has had to say does not really apply. These people are not struggling because of unfair dismissal laws; they are struggling because the government has regulated in such a way that there is no opportunity for growth. It has cut back in rural and regional areas and become citycentric, particularly—from my point of view—on the east coast. All of what those like Senator Boswell say about the effects on people in country areas or small towns does not really fall on fertile ground.
The reality is that it has been estimated that around 27 per cent of small businesses actually fit into the category which will be affected by this bill. This figure really makes you wonder where the minister thinks he is taking us all. The greater majority of industry—sole traders, partnerships, noncorporate bodies or simply corporate bodies—is covered by state awards, and therein we again have an argument about questions of fairness, or unfairness, and equality.
In the financial year ending in 2001, there were 2,534 claims filed under the federal legislation that this bill is advocating to amend. Under the state system, there were 8,485 claims filed. This bill does not supply an antidote for the majority of businesses. To elaborate on that 27 per cent of small businesses which would be affected by this bill, in the year 2001-02 there were 6,719 claims filed that were finalised at or prior to conciliation. It would be interesting to get a breakdown of how many of those were finalised and satisfied with the help of unions. I cannot be definite on this, but if we did a bit of an analysis of that I think we would find that the majority were satisfied with the intervention of the union movement. But 1,648 claims were finalised prior to the arbitrated orders, and out of the 8,485 claims filed only 291 went to substantive arbitrations. So I think the minister is selling the public a bit of a pup if he wishes to pursue this legislation. 
These figures really exemplify that only a very small percentage indeed ever get through to the stage of having their determination arbitrated or adjudicated by a judge or a commissioner. In the vast majority of cases where the employee has been terminated the issues are resolved in-house—that is, between the employer and the employee—with generally the intervention of their respective representatives. As a non-legal trained advocate, I have always found in settling disputes that dealing with employer associations and the advocates that they had was far easier than going into battle with a trained legal operative, because, like the union officials and the advocates from the union movement, the employer advocates had themselves generally been in the work force, they had an understanding of how industry works and they had the ability to be able to judge the merit of things based on their knowledge of industry. But this government, with its frontbench full of lawyers, has an obligation I guess to ensure that that fraternity has continuing employment, unlike the many in the blue-collar work force who would be under very unfair and unsavoury unfair dismissal laws if this act were to pass.
In the few minutes I have left, I think it is important to take note of a few of the things that have been found by the jobs study undertaken by the OECD. Going back as far as 1994, the OECD's jobs study reported that, of the 21 countries assessed, the easy to dismiss countries in order were the United States of America, New Zealand, Canada and Australia, while the most difficult to dismiss countries were Portugal, Spain and Italy. The updated information that I have available from 1999, reported in 2001, showed that Australia is still at the bottom of that category of those surveyed. The only countries with less strict employee protection legislation were the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. On this occasion, we jumped a little bit ahead of Ireland, so Ireland has been relegated to a level somewhat less than where we were.
The reality is that this bill has come back simply to give this very poor government an opportunity to trigger a double dissolution of the parliament. Given the extremely fragile condition that our nation is in today—being led by an inept Prime Minister joined by an inept group of ministers who are more interested in strutting their stuff on the world stage than worrying about the realities and hardships in our own country—we as a parliament have more important things to debate than something such as the unfair dismissal law, or the `fair dismissal law', as the minister likes to call it. We are facing war, and our people are confused by the strange reports they are getting from the government. We are already getting in calls asking, `What do we do with our fridge magnet? Where do we put it?'—I guess on the fridge—`What do we do with the information we're getting? Where are we actually going?' We should be directing our attention to these things and not to something as unimportant as what we have before us in this bill.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-02-05,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. The bill is designed to exempt businesses with fewer than 20 employees from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. Once this protection is removed, employers will be able to dismiss an employee and the employee will have no recourse. An estimated 47 per cent of the private work force in Australia—that is, 3.3 million people—will be affected by this legislation.
This is not the first proposal to remove small business from the federal unfair dismissal jurisdiction. In 1997 the government promised new regulations to exclude small businesses from unfair dismissal laws. This move was in response to findings of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, chaired by none other than Mr Charlie Bell, the managing director of McDonalds— hardly a small business by any stretch of the imagination, with more than 30,000 restaurants in 121 countries serving approximately 46 million customers each day. 
The government has now had several attempts at getting this legislation through, as well as a failed attempt to change the rules by regulation, which was disallowed. While this legislation may be the government's No. 1 priority, there are other matters that are of great concern to Australia's small businesses. The latest small business survey by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—that is, November 2002—indicates that the top constraints on investment by small business are business taxes and government charges. Interestingly, this concern is mirrored by medium sized businesses. An authoritative survey conducted in May last year by the Small Business Development Corporation of Western Australia assessed the impact of the GST on Western Australian small businesses and examined the steps they have taken to manage the new tax system. The key findings from the survey are as follows:
The estimated additional cost incurred by respondents to prepare their business for the GST was $5,587. A total of 68% of respondents reported that the performance of their business had been made `worse' by the GST (10% reported an improvement), 71% said that their industry's performance was `worse' (5% said it had improved), and 75% of respondents considered the economy to be `worse' as a result of the GST (6% considered it had improved). Almost two-thirds of those surveyed said the new tax system had a negative impact on their business cash flow. The profit margin of over one-half (58%) of respondents has reportedly been negatively affected by the GST. Compared to that under the system in place before 1 July 2000, the overall record keeping workload has increased for 82% of respondents, while the overall reporting workload has increased for 81% of respondents. The average annual estimated cost associated with ongoing requirements for BAS record keeping and reporting was $3,514. Over one-third of respondents (34%) indicated that they were satisfied with the time they now have to lodge their BAS. This compares to one-quarter (26%) who continue to be dissatisfied. On average, respondents spent 13 hours calculating their tax liability to complete the BAS for the period ending 31 March 2001. Just under one-half (41%) of those surveyed used an accountant or similar adviser to complete the BAS for the period ending 31 March 2001, at an average estimated cost of $300. GST induced price increases were found to have been absorbed by 38% of respondents, with the average estimated amount of the GST induced price increase absorbed by respondents being 19.5%. The cash economy has decreased as a result of the new tax system according to 37% of respondents, while one-quarter (25%) considered that it had increased.
The GST related problems for small business will be exacerbated when the GST increases, as it has done in other countries. In the United Kingdom the initial rate was 10 per cent in 1991, and now it is 17.5 per cent. In New Zealand a GST was introduced in 1986 at 10 per cent, and within five years it had climbed to 12.5 per cent.
The government is launching a two-pronged assault on the labour market and upon small business. The aim is to reduce the rights and entitlements of employees, particularly those who occupy the most vulnerable positions in the labour market, and to strengthen the bargaining position of employers in disputes with unions and their members. In addition, all levels of government are making life difficult for small businesses with taxes, charges and red tape. With GATS—that is, the General Agreement on Trade in Services—small businesses are going to find themselves competing with multinational predators which will receive national treatment, which is the same sort of favourable treatment offered to local businesses. In the building trades, in the financial sector, in health, education, hospitality and many other sectors, small business will be devastated by this great trade robbery. Who is this bill going to affect?
One of the government's claims is that unfair dismissal laws stop small business jobs growth. According to the minister, if only five per cent of small businesses employed one extra person, an extra 52,000 new jobs would be created. This is the claim, and it was considered by the Federal Court in the recent case of Hamzy v. Tricon International Restaurants trading as KFC. This case concerned the validity of the regulation exempting some casual employees from the unfair dismissal laws. In the course of the proceedings, the court concluded that no such link between unfair dismissal laws and job creation could be shown to exist. 
One Nation do not wish to unnecessarily expose employees to the likelihood of being sacked for no reason. By the same token, we recognise that the legal costs of an unfair dismissal claim could be the death knell for a small business struggling to keep its head above water. Statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that less than 0.3 per cent of small businesses actually experience federal unfair dismissal claims annually. The ABS defines a small business as being one with fewer than 20 employees in all industries except manufacturing where they have fewer than 100 employees and agriculture where they have an estimated value of agricultural operation of between $22,500 and $400,000 in income. One Nation believe that this broad and general definition of small business is problematic. A more realistic definition of small business would be of those employing fewer than five individuals across all facilities and operations owned by that entity. To this end, One Nation will be moving an amendment to this bill to alter the definition of a small business to one employing fewer than five individuals.
In many respects, this bill is a red herring to deflect criticism from the real concerns of small businesses, such as the GST. The government policy which causes the greatest concern is the GST. This, coupled with insufficient work and insufficient consumer demand, is the real reason for small businesses not hiring more staff. Fair dismissal laws are only part of a very heavy burden that small businesses face. The administrative nightmare of the GST, extended trading hours, predatory pricing, concentration of ownership, strong competition from imports— particularly in our manufacturing and farming sectors—and the pressure to cut costs and get competitive or get out are some of the real issues facing small businesses throughout Australia.
I would like to expand briefly on the issue of predatory pricing. We have seen, not only here in Canberra but also throughout my home state of Queensland, an extension and proliferation of liquor outlets that have been put in place by two of the major grocery retailers—that is, Woolworths and Coles. In a majority of cases, these outlets are associated with their grocery retail outlets and it is not uncommon for small businesses in those areas to find that the prices on their stock are undercut by Woolworths and Coles, sometimes to below the wholesale price at which they purchase. So to small business, predatory pricing by major competitors is by far a greater area of concern than the issue of unfair dismissal.
Another area of concern for small business is the pricing structure of leasing agreements. Again, this is particularly the case in Queensland, where the leasing agreements are tied to the actual turnover of small businesses which are generally in large shopping centres. That becomes a great disincentive to those small businesses and is an impediment on their ability to employ more people. As I said earlier, less than 0.3 per cent of small businesses in Australia are exposed to unfair dismissals. The ABS statistics clearly show that it is not high on the list of priorities for small businesses. One Nation will move an amendment to alter the definition of small business to bring it in line with what we believe is a more accurate measure of small business in Australia. If it is the choice of this chamber not to accept that amendment, that will clearly leave me with no other alternative than to neither support nor oppose this legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-02-05,"—In speaking briefly on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] I would like to make some general comments in support of legislation that delivers cost-benefit advantages and freedoms to small business. It is generally true that big business can look after itself. It has the money to make its voice heard. It contributes wealth to the economy that is not only highly visible but also impossible to ignore. Small business, in contrast, is where most Australians live and work. The government that ignores that central fact of life—and governments formed from time to time by those opposite often do—is a foolish government. It is a government that is not so much interested in national advance as in doing cosy deals with mates. That is one important reason why the Labor Party is in opposition federally and why it will remain there for a long time yet. 
The principal aim of sensible government policy in the area of workplace relations is to generate stable and growing employment. The coalition parties and this coalition government do not believe in regulating private enterprise—or, indeed, anything else—beyond what is absolutely necessary. That is something else that fundamentally separates us from the Labor Party opposite. Labor is the party of regulation. Labor is the party that says to private individuals and private businesses, `We know best.' Labor is the party that seeks to put in place in this country a system of guided democracy—guided, of course, by itself, because it alone has drunk from the well of knowledge. All of the facts, as opposed to the fictions—and we have heard some fictions in here this afternoon— show that overregulation does not work; that those who most loudly proclaim that they know best do not; and that the best guide for democracy is what the people choose freely and of their own volition. All of the battalions of pliant Fabian and proto-Marxist thinkers that the ALP can deploy to argue its case will not ever win that argument.
On our side of politics, we trust people. We know very well, for example, that small businesses do not hire people just to fire them. They cannot afford to and, more importantly, they do not want to. It is not in the interests of small business to recruit and train up employees and then dismiss them in a capricious way. They have invested in their employees. An employee's training and consequent value to the enterprise is in fact the best guarantee of continued employment. It is because of this that exempting small business, the real growth engine of the national economy—and, spectacularly, the engine at the point of economic growth—from onerous unfair dismissal laws is sensible government policy. That this exemption is a driver of jobs growth is widely recognised in the community and among those who study the economy, workplace regulation and small business. It is an issue of ideology apparent only to the Labor Party and the unreconstructed portion of the union movement—the inhabitants of the industrial Jurassic Park, in other words.
A Centre for Independent Studies report, Poor laws (1): unfair dismissal laws and long-term unemployment, makes the point very well. It says:
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 ... is intended to exclude small businesses from the unfair dismissal laws and thereby to encourage job creation. Such an exemption is sensible because the unfair dismissal laws have a particularly adverse effect on small businesses without enough resources to cope with unfair dismissal allegations. Survey results indicate that small business employment would have been higher had it not been for the unfair dismissal laws.
In my view, the more relaxed approach to employee management created by the government has paid dividends and should be expected to pay dividends at a rate that incorporates employment growth at the very heart of the process. In September last year, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations noted that full-time employment in August rose by 87,700 in seasonally adjusted terms to a near record of 6.722 million and that total employment reached a record of 9.378 million. Those figures represent an advance for employment and genuine benefits for Australia. There is just no other way of looking at it.
At the same time, it is legitimate to examine the arguments of those who regard the matter of whether the small business exemption does in fact lead to employment growth—those of the Labor Party, on the one hand, and, within this chamber, the views that Senator Murray put in his dissenting report to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee report on this bill and also an hour or so ago in this debate. In his dissenting report, Senator Murray said:
... the assertion of the employment-creation effects of removing unfair dismissal access in small businesses remains unproven. ... Until the evidence exists, the argument that employment will be created by removal of rights from a class of employees based on business size is moot, to put it mildly. 
In Senator Murray's view, the argument is moot. With respect to the senator and others in this chamber, I would suggest that the evidence is there for those who actually want to discover it. When I heard Senator Murray make his contribution—and I thought that it was a thoughtful contribution—I sought to address the concerns that he expressed mainly in his speech. Senator Harris also has expressed similar concerns very strongly. I asked for some advice in relation to what the surveys and the statistics in fact show.
I want to take up some of the time of the Senate just to go through some of the statistics that are available for all senators in this place and other members elsewhere. The statistics from the 1995 Australian workplace industrial relations survey have been used recently—or were used by the ACTU—to show that less than one per cent of small businesses gave unfair dismissal laws as a reason for not hiring staff. But this evidence was not in fact supported by the attitudinal data that was provided by the survey evidence that came into the hands of the ACTU. A 1998 survey of the members of the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers, jointly conducted by the ACM and Deakin University, surveyed 2,000 firms with less than 300 staff. It noted that unfair dismissal legislation and associated implications for small business were highlighted as employment deterrents. In 2001 Sweeney Research, on behalf of the Victorian Trades Hall Council amongst others, conducted a survey of 400 small businesses. It found that 39 per cent of respondents said that unfair dismissal laws affected their businesses. In November 2001, ACCI released the results of a survey of affiliates, to which some 2,500 firms responded. The survey found that unfair dismissal laws were ranked as the fifth most important problem facing them.
In March 2002, CPA Australia released its survey results for 600 small businesses and 105 certified practising accountants. When asked to nominate for themselves the main impediment to hiring staff, five per cent of small businesses and 16 per cent of CPAs nominated unfair dismissal laws as a primary issue. Also, 30 per cent of small business respondents and 44 per cent of CPAs cited a desire to avoid unfair dismissal laws as a reason for employing casuals. The research also found that perceptions about unfair dismissal laws were as much of a barrier to employment as the laws themselves.
In August 2002 the Centre for Independent Studies issued a short study entitled Poor laws (1): unfair dismissal laws and long-term unemployment. This report re-examines international and Australian research on job creation and employment protection and concludes that a possible explanation for Australia's relatively high unemployment problem is overregulation of the labour market. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has recently received the results of a survey designed by Mr Don Harding of the Melbourne Institute and undertaken by Yellow Pages. The survey examined employer attitudes towards unfair dismissal laws. This is the most recent statistical evidence available to help address the concerns expressed by senators who have spoken before me. The survey involved 1,802 telephone interviews with small and medium enterprises employing fewer than 200 employees. The results disclose that the cost estimate to small to medium enterprises of complying with unfair dismissal laws of $1.3 billion per year is more likely to result in lower employment and higher unemployment than in lower wages.
In this context I ask senators to note the comments that were just made by Senator Harris. He referred to the GST as a reason for low employment creation in the Australian economy and as an impediment to job growth. I suggest to Senator Harris that we have figures that show, to the contrary of what he stated in this place a few minutes ago, that during the implementation of the GST Australia experienced record employment growth despite what I, and most people who are reasonable, acknowledge was a disruptive environment created by the introduction of a new broadly based tax. I dare add, given the elimination of many other taxes and the simplification of the tax system, it is a fair tax and a fair tax system. I suggest to Senator Harris that he have a close look at the statistical evidence available in terms of job creation under the introductory phase of the GST regime, because those statistics tell a different story to the one he just put forward to us. 
Under that same survey, which was designed by the Melbourne Institute and undertaken by the Yellow Pages, other interesting results became obvious. Of small to medium sized employers that do not have employees but previously did, 11.1 per cent were influenced by the unfair dismissal laws in deciding to reduce the number of workers they employed. This translates to the loss of 77,482 jobs, in 35,000 of which unfair dismissal laws played a major role—I stress `played a major role'. The survey also found that many employers were confused by or unaware of jurisdictional issues associated with the operation of unfair dismissal laws. That was a concern that was raised by Senator Murray, and I dare say that that concern is legitimate. A range of unfair dismissal law regimes exist across the Commonwealth. State regimes do interface with federal laws. As Senator Murray quite rightly pointed out, there is a lot of confusion in the marketplace. The arguments building up towards the establishment of a national industrial relations system are becoming louder because of those differences. It is a debate that we should have in a moderate but nevertheless definite way. It is a debate in which I look forward to participating in the future. That particular survey also found that two-thirds of employers were unaware of changes to federal unfair dismissal laws made in August 2001. That represents a continuing challenge for this government and for this parliament to communicate those changes that were good and that obviously had—as suggested by the statistics that I quoted—a very positive impact on job creation, as outlined by the minister last year.
I had not intended to bombard the Senate with that barrage of statistics, but I was prompted to do so, and to seek some information, particularly by the contribution of Senator Murray and the subsequent contribution of Senator Harris. We all agree that we can make statistics say whatever we really want them to say, but in this particular case I have quoted dispassionate research. If senators opposite have a different point of view about the validity of what I consider to be very well-conducted empirical research and worthwhile findings, we would like to hear them, because it is a debate that is worth having. I suggest that it should be an informed debate and hopefully I have contributed to the level of information.
I draw on my experience as Minister for Training and Industrial Relations in Queensland from 1996 to 1998, when I introduced laws to free small businesses under state jurisdiction from the more onerous aspects of unfair dismissal laws. Critics of the bill before the Senate today should consider this. Even where the unfair dismissal laws had been relaxed for small businesses in Queensland as part of a legislative program that had far wider application, there were no recorded instances put forward to me. As I have said previously in this chamber, I constantly challenged the union movement and my colleagues who sat opposite me at that time to provide me with one instance of inequitable dismissals that had taken place as a result of the laws which I introduced on behalf of the then coalition government, not to mention the record job creation that took place in the private sector—
—They probably didn't bother.
—I think you are right that they did not bother, but not for the reason that you are implying.
—Because there was no justice for them, was there?
—There was justice. The unfair dismissal laws that were in existence in Queensland basically stood the test of time while they were in existence. There was record employment growth and, again, not one incident that people were able to point out that was an inequitable outcome of the laws that I had overseen. Your colleagues in that state were critical of me at every possible opportunity.
—They did have good cause. 
—Again, I accept that you are making a contribution to this debate from the same warped point of view that they had.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Are you saying that I have a warped point of view, Senator Santoro?
—Not at all. I was directing my comments through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to members opposite who were seeking to provoke me. I was simply trying to say that there was no lack—
—He's a sensitive petal, isn't he?
—No, not at all. I am simply trying to inform you as to my state of mind here. I did not take anything from them and I do not intend to take anything from you good people opposite either.
In particular, I suggest that the assertion by Mark Latham in his 1998 book Civilising Global Capital that, with the abolition of unfair dismissal laws, business managers in Australia are no longer required to take responsibility for the mistakes they might make in the selection of staff is a very partial interpretation of the facts. It might help the member for Werriwa in another place and the Labor Party, in whose future not only as an author he is apparently vitally interested, to consider the benefits of sensible policy formulation. In fact, as anyone who has ever had anything to do with actually running a business will know, it is absolute nonsense to suggest that a cavalier approach to recruiting staff is any sort of business plan. Business managers are responsible for the costs of running a business. Those costs include training recruits, which is a far from insubstantial debit to the books, and for that matter, even without all the rigmarole of an unfair dismissal claim, dispensing with the services of an employee is also an expensive proposition. Except in a very few instances, I think that a manager who consistently chose the wrong staff would pretty soon get a `please explain' from the boss. I made the point before and I will restate it now: no business—small business or big business— recruits staff so it can sack them.
We are fortunate to live in a country where, unless you believe in the old Labor myths, there is a remarkable level of equality and, on a global comparison, astonishing equity. It is in everyone's interest to keep it that way, and I respectfully suggest to honourable members opposite that that might be the most useful lesson to come out of a debate on the bill before us today.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-02-05,"—When listening to Senator Santoro, you might think that if we were to allow passage of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] then a number of great events might occur—the drought might stop or the Murray might overcome its problem with salination! You would think that if we do not pass this legislation the Sisters of Mercy are going to be in a lot of trouble.
—Hang on, you weren't listening to my speech.
—I know you have been here for only a short time, but you have got to understand that this legislation has been revisited on a number of occasions. Senator Sherry said this afternoon that this is the seventh occasion the legislation has been here, and it can come here an eighth and a ninth time. We, as a matter of principle, oppose exempting people because of the size of the company that they work for. It would be immoral and un-Christian to do such a thing.
I want to speak this evening on the contrast between our position as the Labor Party and what I see as the coalition's position in terms of the people that they represent. Throughout the Australian community there is certainly an observation that people in the workplace are being screwed. That is certainly a position that people think they are in. Yet they see in the friends of the coalition that corporate greed is allowed to go unchecked. Only at the end, sometimes, is corporate greed brought to book because of public pressure and pressure from within the Senate and the House of Representatives. This evening, I want to give some examples of where employees have been unfairly dismissed and have been reinstated or have had a settlement put before them. I would also like to contrast a number of these employees, whom I will name shortly, with the dishonest and incompetent conduct of some of the corporate players in the Australian community—namely, big backers of the Liberal Party of Australia, the HIH directors. 
When this bill came before the Senate last time, I highlighted to the Senate a number of individual stories in relation to men and women who had been unfairly dismissed. I spoke last time about Mrs Jeanette Wynbergen. She is a lady who works for Babyco in the Bankstown area of Sydney. Mrs Wynbergen is a member of the shop assistants union. She had an arrangement with her employer that she would be able to have time off and be able to work rosters that would allow her to go and see her daughters Stacey and Tiffany play netball on Saturdays. Her employer tried to change that arrangement. When Mrs Wynbergen refused to give up the time she spent with her daughters on the weekend, she was sacked. She was fortunate enough, however, to be able to have recourse to the New South Wales unfair dismissal laws and was eventually given her job back. As has been highlighted by Senator Sherry, one of the difficulties with the legislation that is being brought before us as well is that there are a number of unfair dismissal regimes throughout the country.
I refer now to Ms Sunita Kore. It was widely reported last week that a woman who was sacked just days after being admitted to hospital for severe morning sickness won an unfair dismissal case against her employer. The woman, Sunita Kore, was a purchasing officer with Ipex ITG. She took about two weeks off work when she was suffering from a rare form of morning sickness which causes severe vomiting and nausea and often results in body weight loss of more than five per cent. Her time off included four days in hospital. Despite informing her supervisor of her illness, the company wrote to Ms Kore while she was in hospital, saying `We have no choice but to conclude that you have abandoned your employment,' and giving her only five days, which included a long weekend, to substantiate her absence. The company did not return calls made by her husband before the deadline. A week later, Ms Kore wrote to her supervisor to explain her absence and express her desire to return to work but was informed that her employment had been terminated. Ms Kore pursued a claim against the company for unfair dismissal in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and Commissioner John Tolley found that the dismissal had been harsh and unfair and ordered Ipex to reinstate Ms Kore.
Similarly, in a case before the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission in 2000 Mr Sakchai Limsiripothong successfully claimed that he was unfairly dismissed by his employer, Four Sons Pty Ltd, who operate the Doyles restaurants in Sydney. You may be able to tell me otherwise, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, but I understand they are supporters of the coalition. In 1999, Mr Limsiripothong was dismissed by his employer. Although the employer claimed in the commission that the termination was due to a seasonal downturn in business, the commission found that no such seasonal downturn had occurred. Instead, it found that Mr Limsiripothong had been subjected to serious victimisation at the hands of his employer.
Shortly before the termination, he had raised complaints with the restaurant's management about the alleged sexual harassment of a female waitress by a male chef. The allegations included unsolicited and unwanted embracing and kissing in the workplace, and harassing telephone calls at the home of the female employee. When Mr Limsiripothong complained to the restaurant manager, Mr Doyle, he was told: `If you want someone to be your girlfriend, you have to do this sort of thing. This happens all the time.' He laughed at Mr Limsiripothong's protestations at this response and informed him that nothing could be done. Less than a week later, when the applicant worked his next rostered shift, his employment was terminated with no proper reasons given.
I refer to the case of Mr Christopher James. Mr James worked as a customer service representative at an Internet cafe operated by Global Gossip Australia Pty Ltd in Darlinghurst, Sydney. There were no complaints at all by his employer about his workplace performance. However, in May 1999 an incident occurred where a regular customer accessed child pornography at the store. Mr James did the right thing and immediately called the police, bypassing senior management. The customer was arrested and escorted from the store. Soon after the incident, the company produced a policy to deal with any such future incidents. The policy required employees to contact management in the first instance should such an incident occur and contained the warning, `Under no circumstances should you take matters into your own hands and contact authorities.' Mr James made it clear to his employers that he would not abide by the policy as he felt he had a moral and legal duty to contact the police. The commission found that, although Mr James had no such legal duty to report matters directly to police, he nonetheless opposed the policy due to his strong beliefs and concerns about the reprehensibility of paedophilia.  
Following Mr James's complaints, his shifts at Global Gossip were reduced substantially. He was rostered onto shifts which he had informed his employer he could not work due to his other work commitments. Like many casual employees, Mr James juggled his time between two casual jobs. As such, Mr James resigned from his position at Global Gossip. The commission found that his resignation amounted to constructive dismissal due to his employer cutting his hours. It was found that the dismissal was unfair and harsh as it related directly to his reasonable concerns surrounding the child pornography policy.
There are four instances where decent men and women in this country have had some redress to situations they have found themselves in as a result of being unfairly or unjustly dealt with by their small business employer. What morality allows us to give an exemption in those four instances? You would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it was only last year that the coalition was so embarrassed and humiliated that it had to order a royal commission into the operations of HIH Insurance. These people made a significant contribution to the Liberal Party of Australia. The Australian community is very angry about how the government is pursuing these nitpicking little policies that are going to take away rights and privileges that belong to the `little' people. The only time the government acts against the corporate greed and excess that is oozing out there is when there is public and political pressure on it to do so.
Plenty has been said about the HIH collapse and there has been a royal commission into it. There have been any number of actions highlighted by the royal commission and a lot of people have been hurt. It seems to me that not many of them will be rescued, whatever the royal commission's findings. I want to let you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, why the people in the community are opposed to the coalition's intentions towards this unfair dismissal legislation. When you look at the contributions to the Liberal Party of Australia from HIH over the last five or six years—I will just read them out— you see a total of $696,000: $100,000 in 1999, $100,000 in 1998, $78,500 to the New South Wales branch in 1996, and $275,000 to the federal Liberal Party in 1996 through one of the Liberal Party fronts, the Free Enterprise Foundation. I stand to be corrected on that. That is not a bad little amount to get as a result of your corporate greed and access. As I said, you had to have a royal commission into this operation because you were forced to by the public and by the political operations at the time. While you try to deny Mrs Wynbergen justice, I want to tell you what your mates have been getting up to—and this has come out of the royal commission.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Are you referring to my mates?
—No, I meant collectively. I am not sure that they are your mates, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I withdraw that. I want to explain to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, what the Liberal Party mates have been getting up to. This has come out of the royal commission. Mr Ray Williams spent $32 million of the company money in the HIH executive office in the 12 months prior to the company's collapse in March 2001. He had his executive bathroom fitted with gold taps, marble and a spa. In the final year of the company's life, Mr Williams spent $2.4 million on lavish corporate entertainment, $86,000 on gold Swiss watches and $4.6 million on executive bonuses—this is in a company that is going to the wall. In one three-week period, he spent $9,000, including $2,000 in restaurant tips. I wonder if he went to Doyle's. He paid massive bonuses to his favourite, a bloke called Mr Stuart Korchinski, a young accountant who often went jogging with the boss. Korchinski received a bonus of $158,000 and a $17,000 trip to Canada when his father died. He was paid $20,000 to have an airconditioning system installed at his house. When Mr Korchinski left HIH at the end of 2000, he received a payout of $910,000, was sold his Saab company car for $1,000 and had a $250,000 housing loan written off. 
Then we get to Mr Williams's secretary. Now can you understand why Mrs Wynbergen and people like her are angry with the Liberal Party because of this excess—the money that they dribbled into your coffers? Mr Williams's personal secretary, Mrs or Ms Young, received a base salary of $105,000. The company paid $63,000 to fly her from her Gold Coast home to Sydney each week and put her up at the Intercontinental, which is not a bad hotel. Her corporate Amex card bill for 2000 totalled $123,000, including invoices totalling $19,000 from Bangkok's superluxury hotel, The Peninsula—and Senator Ferguson might be able to tell us about how good it is later—and $4,000 worth of Thai silk.
These are their mates, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is why the Australian community is angry with them, because there is one rule that they want to apply to small business people in the community but not to their mates. And why not? Because it has $696,000 attached to it. But let me tell you about one of the most reprehensible things Mr Williams did. In March 1998, he gave himself a 17.3 per cent pay rise to $1 million a year, but not one staff member received a wage increase. These people, it appears from the royal commission evidence coming through, knew the company was going to the wall, and yet they were all putting their snouts into the collective corporate trough.
As I said when I started, the people of Australia are very angry with the coalition's pursuit of this bill, trying to deny rights to the men and women who work in small businesses. It seems that, when there is corporate excess or corporate greed, the coalition is dragged to the bank to make some sort of restitution. I do not believe that this legislation should be changed. I think that men and women who work for a small business have as much right as somebody who works for a large business to be fairly and justly dealt with if their employment has been put on the line. As a former union official—I am proud that I am a former union official—I have represented many people in unfair dismissal cases before the commission. I have also told many people that they had no case that I could take to the commission, as my colleagues would have also done, because they had broken the commandments and done the wrong thing. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2003-02-05,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I ask that the Senate take note of the document because there has been some media speculation about the benefits that may be available to surviving partners and children of serving ADF personnel. No amount of money can compensate for the loss of a husband and father, but the government completely rejects the Labor scare campaign that provisions for war widows are inadequate at this time. I think it is most out of character for Senator Bishop to play politics with this issue—it is not his usual modus operandi— and I am disappointed by the media speculation about it. I think it is particularly opportunistic to score political points at a time when the men and women of the Australian Defence Force are predeploying on operations in defence of our national interest.
The 1996 Black Hawk disaster revealed the gross inadequacies in the former Labor government's compensation arrangements for veterans and war widows. The coalition government quickly introduced interim legislation for a package that provides a war widow's pension for life that is non-means-tested, tax free and indexed twice a year regardless of a widow's marital status and income status; free health care for life through a gold card providing free, comprehensive health care for a war widow and for any dependent children; an orphan's pension; education assistance for dependent children plus a lump sum of $57,000 per child; and access to a capped lump sum payment for the widow. As well as repatriation benefits, the widow of any ADF member killed in the line of duty has access to military compensation and superannuation. This includes a lump sum, tax-free death benefit, superannuation entitlement and a pension. The total value of these lifelong comprehensive benefits surpasses, in most cases, the large one-off payments issued by courts to civilian claimants. The civilian government is committed to providing lifelong care for our defence families with health care for life and financial assistance for life.
The government is also looking, and is always looking, to improve arrangements for compensation and it will continue to progress legislation for a new military compensation scheme. However, it is irresponsible for Labor to raise false expectations by inferring that the new legislation will provide windfall additional benefits. The federal government strongly believes that any new scheme needs to support the defence and ex-service community and has been liaising with all the stakeholders to do that. Not surprisingly, such a complex piece of legislation requires a large amount of cooperation between all the stakeholders. Labor has already admitted that it has no alternative but to oppose the legislation if it does not agree with it, yet it expects the federal government to introduce legislation that does not yet have the agreement of everybody in the military and ex-service community. Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, our government— and you especially; I know we have your support—is committed to our military and veteran communities. I want them to be reassured of that, especially as we predeploy personnel to the Middle East and apply the necessary pressure on Saddam Hussein to rid himself of weapons of mass destruction.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority</title>,Documents,30,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-02-05,"—At this crucial time in our nation's history when our parliament is in the throes of debate concerning what we should do in relation to the looming war against Iraq, it is important for all of us to make decisions in a well-informed and rational manner. Regardless of what position one reaches on this important issue—and we are all too well aware of the current divisions of opinion in this parliament—it is my firm view that any position should and must be well considered, reliably informed and backed up by strong evidence.
Regardless of what your position on this issue is, one thing that should concern us all is the reappearance in public debate of the views of Australia's most embarrassing literary export: far Left journalist John Pilger. I am greatly concerned that, once again, just at the moment when Australia faces big decisions concerning its place in the world, Mr Pilger has suddenly decided to call Australia home. My concern is that, with this man weighing into the public debate in Australia—a country he has not called home for 30-odd years—it will, if anything, degenerate the so far well-informed debate into nothing more than an overly emotional, banner waving, slogan slogging and conspiracy theory charged shouting match. I am particularly concerned that Mr Pilger is one of the keynote speakers at an upcoming rally in Sydney against the war in Iraq. Not that long ago Mr Pilger said:
There is no war of terrorism; it is the great game speeded up. The difference is the rampant nature of the superpower, ensuring infinite dangers for us all.
Hence, he is attacking America. He also said:
The current American elite is the Third Reich of our times.
Did the Third Reich ever wage a campaign to topple a regime in Afghanistan that refused to accord women basic rights and oppressed an entire nation? And another quote from him:
Far from being the terrorists of the world, the Islamic peoples have been its victims—that is, the victims of American fundamentalism, whose power, in all its forms, military, strategic and economic, is the greatest source of terrorism on earth.
When it was put to Mr Pilger in an interview that Osama bin Laden had publicly said that the Bali bombings were a result of Australia's role in East Timor, Pilger simply replied, `We can't believe all these things we're being told.' In the 1991 Gulf War, he opposed the US led and UN endorsed attacks on Iraq following Saddam Hussein's hostile invasion and refusal to withdraw from independent Kuwait. He said of Saddam Hussein:
If he gets too cocky and intrudes elsewhere in the empire for whatever reason, he will be judged Unacceptable Aggressor and expelled forcibly.
In relation to his views on the First World War, he claims in his book A Secret Country that the AIF during World War I was a `vassal's army' and that the `scandalous truth' of the Gallipoli campaign was that `victims were exploited as shock troops in an engagement of no military or strategic worth'. Both these comments seriously demean that role played by Australian troops during that conflict and the immense role it plays within the Australian psyche. He also claims in A Secret Country that World War I was caused by `a family squabble between Kaiser Wilhelm II and his cousin George Saxe-Coburg'. Suffice to say, the causes of the First World War are sadly not that simplistic, with entire volumes of books written on what remains a hotly debated subject. But in Pilger's world view, tragic events that result in loss of human life can always be blamed on such simplistic causes.
On the Vietnam War, Pilger remains an advocate and apologist for the once Soviet backed North Vietnamese government, which did of course eventually become the government of the whole of Vietnam. Yet when Saigon fell in 1975 before the military might of the Soviet backed North Vietnamese army, and the so-called liberation took place, Pilger did not dwell in Saigon to witness the liberation. Rather, he was lifted out of Saigon by a US helicopter and departed Vietnam on a US command ship to the safety of US bases in the Philippines.
On the Whitlam dismissal, Pilger's much repeated views on the disgraceful dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 demonstrate perhaps the epitome of his conspiracy theory ramblings. Despite Whitlam's own denials, and the well-established facts that the reasons for the dismissal related more to factors like the constitutionally and ethically questionable actions of Sir John Kerr, Pilger maintains that the CIA was behind the dismissal. In 1984 when Mr Whitlam was asked by a journalist whether he thought the CIA had got to Kerr prior to the dismissal, Mr Whitlam responded, `No I don't; I never have.' In spite of this, Pilger continues to claim that the CIA was behind the Whitlam dismissal. Pilger has no evidence for his claims. He has said that the alleged sources for his CIA conspiracy theory `cannot be named'. 
In 1991, a Pilger documentary on Cambodia called `Cambodia: The Betrayal' was screened on UK television. In the documentary, Pilger accused two British men of being members of the SAS who trained Khmer Rouge guerillas to plant mines that maimed and killed Cambodian civilians. Pilger and UK Central Television were sued by the two men. The case was settled during the third day of the High Court action, as the claims made in the documentary were plainly false and could not be backed up by any evidence. The documentary failed at any point to discuss the role that the Vietnamese communists played in bringing the Khmer Rouge to power. Pilger also claimed, in relation to the successful Cambodian peace plan, that the United Nations `had built a Trojan Horse for the return of Asia's Hitler'.
He condemned NATO action in Kosovo, implying that the West should have negotiated a settlement with Milosevic. This is in spite of the fact that the UN had made several agreements with Milosevic, all of which had been broken and followed up with more shocking human rights abuses. The most famous example of the futility of the West's appeasement approach is the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995. The UN had declared Srebrenica a safe area, but hundreds of men, women and children were massacred, buried alive, mutilated and tortured.
Then we get to Mr Pilger's known anti-Semitism. He wrote an article for the New Statesman magazine called `A Kosher Conspiracy', in which he claimed that Israel had an unhealthy influence on media coverage of Middle Eastern affairs. The cover of the magazine depicted a Star of David stabbing a Union Jack. The New Statesman was forced to issue an apology to Britain's Jewish community.
In an interview relating to claims in his book A Secret Country that Australia was run by an `order of mates', including Bob Hawke, Rupert Murdoch and Alan Bond, Pilger answered that he was suggesting that Australia `out-cronyfied' the Philippines of the 1980s. The book says:
The World Bank, the IMF and other international institutions are invested with the privileges of conquest on behalf of the new papacy in Washington.
That sounds more like Pauline Hanson than John Pilger, but in fact it is John Pilger. So famous have Pilger's inaccuracies, common mistakes and self-plagiarising become that they have become known as `pilgerisations', and I want to share one or two with you tonight. In his book A Secret Country, Pilger wrongly claimed that the support for the Liberal Party in elections between 1949 and 1966 was never more than 34 per cent of the primary vote and that support for the coalition was never more than 42 per cent. In fact, during this period the Liberal Party only once polled less than 34 per cent of the primary vote, with the coalition never receiving a combined vote of less than 42 per cent— that was a shame. Also in his book A Secret Country, he wrongly claimed that Keating's floating of the dollar in 1983 resulted in an immediate devaluation of the Australian dollar. He also claimed that, at the same time, Keating immediately and suddenly lifted banking controls. That is wrong again, as the deregulation of the Australian banking system took place over three years. The people who are behind the rally on 16 February in Sydney are no doubt well intentioned and well meaning, but I do not think it brings any good or decency to them to have someone like John Pilger on the platform as the main speaker.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Iraq: John Pilger</title>,Adjournment,31,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-02-05," asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 June 2002:
(1)	(a) How many applications for assistance under section 229 of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993 (the SIS Act) have been received by the Assistant Treasurer or her predecessor in relation to Commercial Nominees of Australia Limited (CNAL); and (b) when were these applications made.
(2)	When did the Assistant Treasurer make a formal request (or requests) for advice from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), under section 230A of the SIS Act, in relation to these applications.
(3)	How many funds did this request (or these requests) apply to.
(4)	In this request (or these requests), did the Minister specify, under section 230A(1), any particular matters that APRA was (or is) to provide advice about or a particular time by which APRA was (or is) to provide the advice.
(5)	When did APRA provide advice to the Assistant Treasurer pursuant to this request (or these requests).
(6)	What was APRAs advice under section 231(2) pursuant to this request (or these requests).
(7)	In relation to the 181 funds for which the Assistant Treasurer has made a section 231 determination, as announced on 14 June 2002: (a) what is the total eligible loss; (b) what is the average eligible loss; and (c) does this eligible loss include rectification and/or administration costs charged by Oak Breeze as replacement trustee.
(8)	In relation to the 181 funds for which the Assistant Treasurer has made a section 231 determination, as announced on 14 June 2002, what is the total assistance that will be paid under section 231.
(9)	In the period from 14 June 2002 to the provision of answers to these questions, will the Assistant Treasurer make any further determinations under section 231; if so: (a) to how many funds do these determinations relate; (b) what is the total eligible loss; (c) what is the average eligible loss; (d) does this eligible loss include rectification and/or administration costs charged by the replacement trustee Oak Breeze; and (e) what is the total assistance that will be paid under section 231.
(10)	(a) How many applications for assistance in relation to CNAL has the Assistant Treasurer received without making determinations under section 231; (b) when does the Minister expect to made determinations under section 231 in relation to these funds; and (c) what is the estimated total eligible loss for these funds.
(11)	Has the Assistant Treasurer determined not to provide assistance under section 231 to any funds for which CNAL was trustee.
(12)	Of the funds for which CNAL was trustee but the replacement trustee is yet to make an application, how many additional applications does the Assistant Treasurer expect to receive, and, of these, what does she expect the total eligible loss will be.
(13)	What is the total amount of assistance under Part 23 that the Assistant Treasurer expects will be paid.
(14)	(a) On how many occasions does the Assistant Treasurer expect to impose a levy under the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Act 1993; (b) what will be the total amount of each of these levies; (c) what will be the applicable rate or rates for this levy or levies under section 8 of this Act; and (d) will this rate be different for different classes of fund.
(15)	When does the Assistant Treasurer intend to impose this levy or levies.
(16)	What steps did APRA take to ensure that rectification costs and administration fees charged by Oak Breeze, the replacement trustee of the 475 small funds for which CNAL was trustee, were kept to a minimum; in particular, what commitments in relation to costs did APRA seek from Oak Breeze before it was appointed as the replacement trustee.
(17)	Does APRA believe Oak Breeze is satisfying its disclosure obligations under the SIS Act and/or the Corporations Act to members of the small funds; in particular: (a) what are (or were) the start and finish dates for Oak Breezes most recent reporting period and has Oak Breeze provided (or does it intend to provide) statements and annual reports to fund members within 6 months of the conclusion of that period; (b) did Oak Breeze provide details of how fees would be charged to fund members upon its appointment as trustee; (c) has Oak Breeze established a complaints procedure; (d) has Oak Breeze provided relevant and timely information to fund members when they have requested it to do so; and (e) if APRA is not satisfied that Oak Breeze has met its obligations, what enforcement action has it taken in relation to any or all of these issues. 
(18)	With reference to the answer to a question placed on notice during additional estimates, in which APRA said that it chose PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) (the parent of Oak Breeze) as the replacement trustee of the three larger CNAL funds after seeking expressions of interest from PWC as well as KPMG, Ferrier Hodgson and Sims Lockwood: (a) were expressions of interest sought from these same parties before APRA appointed Oak Breeze as replacement trustee of the small funds; and (b) did any of these parties, other than PWC, express an interest in the appointment; if so, were their costs, or likely costs, any different to those of Oak Breeze.
(19)	What opportunity, if any, was there for other parties to express an interest in being appointed as replacement trustee of the small funds.
(20)	Given that, in the answer referred to above, APRA said that it adhered to its policy for the appointment of replacement trustees in appointing Oak Breeze: (a) in light of the significant fees charged by Oak Breeze and the difficulties it initially experienced in its administration functions, has APRA seen fit to revise its policy for the appointment of replacement trustees; and (b) has APRA, for example, considered the possibility of establishing a pool of appropriately resourced entities that would be ready to be appointed as replacement trustees, at minimal cost, in future cases.
(21)	In its report into CNAL the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, noted with concern that neither APRA nor the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) had regulatory control over the so-called Enhanced Cash Management Trust (ECMT), the vehicle responsible for the losses incurred by CNAL funds and neither APRA nor ASIC were able to quantify the number of investment vehicles, like ECMT, that fall outside the current regulatory framework. In response to a question on this matter that was placed on notice during additional estimates, APRA stated that it does regulate these trusts and has no records as to either their number or prevalence: (a) does APRA believe it is a cause for concern that investment vehicles, like ECMT, that receive superannuation monies, are not regulated by either itself or by ASIC; (b) does APRA agree that it is important for a prudential regulator to understand the extent of problems or loopholes in the regulator regime in order that it might recommend legislative changes to address any such deficiencies; and (c) should APRA therefore be concerned that APRA does not know how many investment vehicles like ECMT fall outside its regulatory jurisdiction.
(22)	(a) In light of the example of the TED Engineering superannuation fund raised during budget estimates, what regulatory sanctions are at APRA's disposal for dealing with non-arms length transactions and other breaches of trust that occurred before the commencement of the SIS Act; (b) if another case were to emerge in which a fund had suffered a loss as a result of a non-arms' length transaction or other breach of trust that occurred before the commencement of the SIS Act, how would APRA respond; and (c) how would this response differ if the trustee had breached the relevant provisions of the SIS Act following its commencement in 1994.
(23)	If APRA were presented with similar circumstances, and found it was unable to take effective remedial action under commonwealth legislation, would it take action against the trustee in the appropriate common law jurisdiction.
(24)	(a) What proportion of regulated superannuation funds does APRA believe are in breach of the equal representation rules contained in the SIS Act; and (b) what strategies does APRA have in place to ensure that the equal representation rules are adhered to.
(25)	With reference to the draft report of 4 March 2002 of the Superannuation Working Group, which noted concerns about the grandfathering provisions that allow the in-house investment cap of 5 per cent (in section 82 and 83 of the SIS Act) to be exceeded: (a) can APRA provide an average proportion for in-house assets in superannuation funds; (b) can APRA provide any details of recent enforcement actions in respect of breaches of the in-house assets rule; (c) what is the maximum proportion of in-house assets that funds have held while still complying with the SIS Act; (d) does APRA believe that the grandfathering provisions in sections 71A to 71E need reform; and (e) does APRA believe that the 5 per cent cap in sections 82 and 83 is too high. 
(26)	Given that the working group does not deal with investments in derivatives by superannuation funds in its draft report: (a) should this be interpreted as a sign that APRA is unconcerned about derivatives trading by super funds; (b) what proportion of superannuation funds are involved in derivatives trading; (c) what is the average derivative charge ratio, that funds are required to calculate and report to members if it exceeds 5 per cent, for superannuation funds; and (d) can APRA provide details of any recent problems it has encountered, and any enforcement action it has undertaken, in respect of derivatives.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,34,1,question

(1)	See Table 1.
(2)	See Table 1.
(3)	See Table 1.
(4)	Yes. Requests have been be tabled before Parliament for all determinations made to date.
(5)	See Table 1.
(6)	For those applications where determinations have been made, APRA's advice was that the losses suffered were the result of fraudulent conduct or theft and caused substantial diminution in the funds leading to difficulties in the payment of benefits.
(7)	(a) $11.6 million (b) approximately $64,000 (c) Yes.
(8)	$10,442,320.
(9)	(a) see table 1 (b) $27,780,149 (c) $73,883 per superannuation fund (d) yes (e) cannot be determined at this time.
(10)	(a) See Table 1 (b) a decision on these applications will be made once all administrative issues and a review of the available evidence is finalised (c) Cannot be determined until all investigations are completed. 
(11)	No.
(12)	Cannot be determined at this stage.
(13)	Cannot be determined at this stage.
(14)	These issues are still being considered.
(15)	See answer to question 14.
(16)	The fee charge out basis of all of the firms that lodged expressions of interest was on an “hourly charge out” rate. Due to the uncertainty of the amount of work required to be undertaken, this was the only basis that those firms would tender. Hourly charge out rates for rectification and reconstruction work are the commercial norm when the scope of the work is unknown.
(17)	APRA can only address prudential reporting requirements set out in those sections of the SIS Act for which it has responsibility. Oak Breeze has been provided with a number of extensions of time within which to lodge annual APRA Returns.
(a)	Reporting dates were from Oak Breeze's appointment, and as at 27 June 2002 Oak Breeze's most recent reporting period was the period to 30 June 2001. Member reporting requirements, are included in those parts of the SIS Act which are not APRA's responsibility.
(b)	Oak Breeze did not globally advise members of the basis of how fees would be charged on taking up their appointment. The newsletter dated 2 July 2001 from Oak Breeze to fund members addressed the issue of fees. In addition, Oak Breeze has advised APRA that individual fund members were advised the basis of fees being charged when they enquired.
(c)Yes.
(d)	Since May 2002, Oak Breeze has had in place a toll free telephone service for member enquiries. Queries to this service are responded to within 24-48 hours. The service was set up at the request of APRA after a number of complaints were received from fund members.
(e)	APRA is satisfied that Oak Breeze met those obligations it was able to meet given the state of the accounting and administration records of the superannuation funds inherited by Oak Breeze when they were appointed acting trustee. APRA has taken no formal action against Oak Breeze.
(18)	In respect of the three larger funds Oak Breeze was appointed as Acting Trustee to AWERF only. ACT Super Management (KPMG) was appointed Acting Trustee of Network and Midas.
(a)	APRA used the same expressions of interest in February 2001 when replacing CNAL as trustee of the small funds that it had used in December 2000 when it had replaced CNAL as trustee of the three larger funds.
(b)	All of the four parties expressed an interest in the appointment and all quoted costs for work done on an hourly basis and rates similar to those quoted by Oak Breeze.
(19)	 APRA requested expressions of interest only from the four firms identified in Question 18.
(20)	(a)	APRA has examined its appointment policy (ie calling for multiple expressions of interest from interested parties with appropriate qualifications to fit the proposed role) and found that it is still sound. For future replacement trustees APRA would require a complaints handling mechanism to be put into place.
(b)	APRA has considered the possibility of establishing a pool of entities that could be called upon to act as acting trustees. However, while this issue has been reviewed by APRA, it has to date not been practical as the skills required of an acting trustee need to reflect the particular circumstances.
(21)	(a)	While APRA is concerned about the use of these vehicles it was the fraudulent conduct of particular directors of CNA that caused the loss and not the structure or the legislation. The responsibility for investment of superannuation funds rests with the trustee. Excluding superannuation funds from accessing these vehicles would penalise those responsible trustees that use such vehicles prudently to enhance the return to those funds of which they are trustees. APRA is required to regulate by balancing the objectives of financial safety and efficiency, competition, contestability and competitive neutrality. APRA is concerned where investment vehicles are used for fraudulent purposes causing loss to superannuants. 
(b)	and (c) APRA has commented comprehensively to the various reviews of the prudential regime for superannuation conducted in the past year. APRA has tightened its on-site supervision of “downstream” investments especially in cases where the superannuation trustee has links to the downstream investment. See response to (21) (a) above.
(22)	(a)	and (b) The regulatory sanctions that are legally available to APRA to deal with non-arms length transactions and other breaches of trust that occurred before the commencement of the SIS Act are very limited and contingent upon the facts of the particular case. The power under section 298 to commence proceedings on behalf of a person who has suffered loss or damage is the only power that might be available, and it may only be legally available in certain circumstances. Factors which will help to determine whether that power can be used will include whether an investigation has been made into the fund under section 263; the legal grounds for carrying out that investigation; whether a particular trustee who might be sued has been trustee of the fund since it became a regulated superannuation fund; and the particular facts of the individual case. APRA would need to examine in some detail the circumstances of any individual case before determining whether it is legally possible to take action under section 298. A test case is likely to be required before it is legally clear whether APRA has the power to take action under section 298 in relation to acts that occurred before the commencement of the SIS legislation.
(c)	If the trustee has breached relevant provisions of the SIS Act following its commencement in 1994 and after the time at which the fund became a regulated superannuation fund, and APRA has conducted an investigation into the fund under section 263 of the SIS Act, then it is probable that in most cases APRA would have the capacity under section 298 to commence proceedings on behalf of members of the fund who have suffered loss. However, APRA's capacity to do so in any given case will depend upon the particular facts of the case, and APRA's assessment of the public interest in taking action under section 298.
(23)	The only power APRA has to take action to recover member's losses in circumstances similar to those in the TED Engineering superannuation fund case is that set out in section 298 of SIS to commence proceedings on behalf of a person who has suffered loss or damage. If section 298 does not enable APRA to take action in the circumstances of a particular case, it is almost certainly beyond APRA's power to do so on any other legal basis.
(24)	(a)	Arrangements for the appointment of employee representatives are reviewed as part of APRA's on-site reviews of superannuation funds and rectification is required/monitored where breaches arise. In addition APRA is working with industry bodies to address concerns and develop best practice guidelines. 
(b)	The operation of trustee boards is a standing item for review by APRA staff engaged in an on-site review.
(25)	(a)	For funds indicating in-house assets on the 2000/2001 annual return APRA estimates the average proportion was 3.4 per cent. 
(b)	In 2001-02, APRA obtained civil penalty orders against the trustees of the Wes Lofts Superannuation Fund for breaches of the in-house assets test and attempts at avoidance of that test. 
(c)	The maximum proportion of in-house assets that funds hold while still complying with the SIS Act is currently 5 per cent in respect of accumulation funds and, for defined benefit funds with a surplus, as per division 3A of Part 8 of SIS Act. Investments in a related party of a superannuation fund that were permitted under the legislation prior to the introduction of SLAA 4 of 1999 have been grandfathered, that is they are not treated as in-house investments. Certain additions to such investments made up to 30 June 2009 are also permitted without being treated as in-house assets.
(d)	This is a policy matter on which it is more appropriate for the Government to comment.
(e)	The purpose of the in-house asset test is to ensure that, if an employer fails, staff members do not lose their superannuation as well as their jobs. APRA has seen no evidence to date that a 5 per cent exposure to an employer sponsor has placed superannuation fund members in jeopardy. However, this must be subject to on-going review in the light of market volatility. 
(26)	(a)	No. APRA is currently reviewing its investment requirements, including the use of derivatives and the risk control framework, and this was noted in the SWG report.  
(b)	Approximately 50 per cent of funds that are not Small APRA Funds invest in derivatives. Funds investing in derivatives do so either directly, via a Pooled Superannuation Trust (PST) or unit trust, or via a mandate set out in an agreement with an investment manager who is subject to a RMS requirement.
(c)	Funds are required to calculate their derivative charge ratio and where this exceeds 5 per cent must report this to members and to APRA. APRA is unable to calculate the average derivative charge ratio as only ratios in excess of 5 per cent are required to be reported.
(d)	APRA found a trustee whose risk management system was not sufficiently robust to control adequately its dealing in derivatives. At APRA's direction this trustee undertook an orderly run down of positions and no longer is permitted to deal in derivatives.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,34,1,answer
