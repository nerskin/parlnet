Amount of self-funded retirees supplementary bonus component




Item
If the Family and Community Services customer's annual retirement income is:
. . . the amount of the self-funded retirees supplementary bonus component is equal to:



1
$20,000 or less
his or her annual savings and investment income, up to a maximum of $2,000
 2
more than $20,000 but less than $30,000
(a) his or her annual savings and investment income, up to a maximum of $2,000; less
(b) the phasing out fraction (see subsection (5)) of the amount worked out under paragraph (a) of this item
	 Example:	 Dawn, aged 59, has annual retirement income of $24,000, all of which is annual savings and investment income.
	 Dawn's self-funded retirees supplementary bonus component is worked out as follows.
	 Dawn's savings and investment income of $24,000 is only allowable up to a maximum of $2,000.
		 The phasing out fraction of the $2,000 then needs to be subtracted. The fraction is:
		 Therefore 4/10 of $2,000 (i.e. $800) needs to be subtracted. This leaves a self-funded retirees supplementary bonus component of $1,200.

Amount of self-funded retirees supplementary bonus component



 Item
If the ATO client's taxable income as shown in his or her assessment for the qualifying year is:
. . . the amount of the self-funded retirees supplementary bonus component is equal to:



1
$20,000 or less
his or her adjusted savings and investment income, up to a maximum of $2,000
2
more than $20,000 but less than $30,000
(a) his or her adjusted savings and investment income, up to a maximum of $2,000, less
(b) the phasing out fraction (see subsection (7)) of the amount worked out under paragraph (a) of this item
	 Example:	 For the 1999-2000 income year Susan, aged 59, has an assessed taxable income of $24,000, all of which is annual savings and investment income.
	 Susan's self-funded retirees supplementary bonus component is worked out as follows.
	 Susan's adjusted savings and investment income of $24,000 is only allowable up to a maximum of $2,000.
	 The phasing out fraction of the $2,000 then needs to be subtracted. The fraction is:
		 $24,000—$20,00		           4
		 _________________    =    __
			 $10,000					          10
Therefore 4/10 of $2,000 (i.e. $800) needs to be subtracted. This leaves a self-funded retirees supplementary bonus component of $1,200.

		 (c)	 he or she has not received certain pensions or benefits during the period 1 April 2000 to 1 July 2000; and
		 (d)	 if the individual is a woman under 611/2 or a man under 65: 

			 (i)	 he or she has also not received those pensions or benefits during the rest of 1999-2000; and

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I wonder whether the government would favour the Senate by doing the decent thing and explaining the purpose of their amendments and requests. Just to come in, stand up, move the amendments and requests and expect the things to be put through is a bit rich, given that these are amendments to the government's own legislation. This is, of course, a bill which deals with bonuses for older Australians under the GST.
Senator Ferguson interjecting—
—I may well qualify, but what has that got to do with the price of eggs? This is the government's big tax adventure for Australia. This is the GST, and this is the bonus for older Australians provision in 
 order to compensate older Australians—and, in particular, self-funded retirees—against the ravages of a GST. The government comes in here and moves an amendment and expects that, without any explanation, the thing will be passed. I do not think that is a reasonable expectation of this chamber. I have a number of questions and perhaps I should ask the first one now—which the minister might wish to take note of and which, since she seems to be now prepared to make an explanation to the chamber about her amendments, she might wish to address in the course of that explanation.
Prior to the deal between the Australian Democrats and the government to foist a GST on Australia, the Prime Minister is on record as having made an offer to Senator Harradine to induce him to, among other things, support the legislation. Would the minister be prepared now to inform the chamber what the terms of that offer were with respect to self-funded retirees and also how the terms of that offer meet what is now before us for consideration? Do they meet it wholly, or has there been a change during the course of the negotiations between the government and the Australian Democrats? If so, what is that change?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-06-28,"—Perhaps it might help the Senate if I give some explanation at this point. These amendments and requests are a direct result of the submissions to the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System and arise out of the evidence which was given. I might point out that the committee received around a dozen submissions from self-funded retirees and organisations, not just from individuals, and also from retrenched workers, who argued that it was unfair that they were forced to live on their savings but were denied access to the self-funded retirees bonus.
This bonus is an important part of the compensation package. Because the savings of self-funded retirees are finite—that is, they do not have any built-in increase due to CPI or inflation—the outcome for them does not rise with the GST. This effectively means that the GST discounts the value of their savings and their future income stream. This is why 
 it is necessary to have a one-off bonus payment to offset this negative result.
However, the bonus in the government's original package was made available only to people over the pension age, at 65 for men and 61 for women. Thus, many self-funded retirees were denied access to that bonus. What the Democrats have been able to achieve is to decrease the age from 65 and 61 respectively so that many retrenched workers over the age of 55 who have been denied access to social security payments will receive the lump sum.
In the case of people who have voluntarily retired, it may be justifiable for them to be denied access to the bonus, but we were worried more about those who involuntarily left the work force. Beyond age 55, once a worker is retrenched from a job, it is extremely unlikely that they will ever work again; they will have to rely on their retrenchment pay to live in the future. As a result of the 1996 budget changes many of these retrenched workers over the age of 55 were denied access to social security payments because they received such a lump sum payment. Under the new tax system they would not have received any compensation, either as a bonus or because of substantial tax cuts or through social security payments. This was what those dozen or more retrenched workers wrote to the Senate committee about—and we thought they had a good case. The amendment insisted on by the Democrats will move the eligible age for the self-funded bonus down to age 55 for genuine self-funded retirees—that is, those without earned income or social security support. The cost of this is substantial—it will cost an additional $180 million—but it does ensure that one group that was not properly compensated is properly compensated now. I am pleased to commend this to the Senate as further evidence of the Democrats' determination to protect low income earners and the aged, in the new tax system.
I point out that, as far as pensioners are concerned, this bonus is on top of the pension supplement which we have also managed to secure. I also point out that, if the GST were to come in today rather than in July 2000, 
 that pension supplement would be $14.50 per fortnight for single pensioners. With inflation and other effects that will probably be more. For couples the supplement would be $24 combined additional pension per fortnight. This supplement is to be paid on top of the basic rate of pension for those pensioners who will receive it. We believe that the Senate should vote very strongly for this measure.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I put a question to the government, and the government has sat with its arms folded. Does the government intend to answer this question or not?
—Senator Cook, I only call those people who stand. It is not for me to decide who is going to answer and who is not. You have put your question again, and I do not see anybody standing, so I will put the amendments.
—Then I will seek the call, Mr Temporary Chairman.
—Senator Cook.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-06-28,"—We have just had a self-serving explanation from the Australian Democrats as to what they have achieved in this package. The truth is that they have voted for a GST to be imposed on Australia. You do not need to compensate for a GST if there isn't one. This package deals with compensation for self-funded retirees. The only reason this legislation is necessary is that we have a GST. The things we know about a GST are that inevitably the amount of tax rises—the tax being proposed here is 10 per cent; no-one in Australia believes that it will remain constant at 10 per cent forever and a day—and the other thing we know about a GST is that, wherever it has been applied, the bonuses or the compensation to offset the regressive impact of this flat tax erode over time. The two things we know about a GST are that the amount goes up and the compensation goes down over time.
This is the question I asked the government. They put an offer to Senator Harradine: will they now outline to the chamber what that offer was, where it differs from the compromise agreement they have arrived at with the Australian Democrats, and will they say what that difference is? The government sits in this debate declining to answer those questions and declining to bring into this Senate chamber, for the information of all Australians, what their backroom dealing has been. On the basis of their absolute refusal to answer the question, it would be idle for me to conclude that they do not know the answer to it, since they are the authors of it, so the only conclusion open to me now is that the government do not wish to tell Australia what their proposal was and that, if they did, the proposal that they have now arrived at with the Australian Democrats would be seen for what it is: something less than what they were originally prepared to do. That is the only respectable conclusion able to be arrived at, because the conclusion of ignorance—`I didn't know'—is not one open to the government, who are the authors of this proposition.
So we go back the fundamentals of the GST. We know the amount rises and we know the compensation erodes. It seems to me that since the government are reluctant or refuse to tell us what their position is one ought to go on to the other part of the argument: is this adequate compensation for self-funded retirees or is it not? In this debate over the last week or two I have become sick and tired of the fact that every time I ask the government a question an Australian Democrat rises and gives the answer. When you turn to the government for an answer, they are locked up at the advisers box seeking more information, because they either do not know—and when they get that information they sign off on the Democrat explanation—or sit pat, like they are now, declining to report to the chamber an answer to a reasonable question and a question that Australians are entitled to know the answer to.
In these circumstances I think it is fair to conclude that this package is unfair for self-funded retirees, who are people on fixed incomes and who are most at risk if taxes, 
 charges, prices or costs increase in the community. They are on fixed incomes. They are not in a position to negotiate a bigger income for themselves. They are not beneficiaries on the social welfare system. They have provided for their own retirement out of prudent investment or arrangement of their business affairs in such a way as to save themselves being beneficiaries and therefore they do not draw down on taxpayers' money. As a group of Australians in the community, they are entitled to due and proper compensation for an imposition of a new tax. No-one disagrees that the GST will impose higher costs.
Last week when we had this debate, indeed on Friday, the Australian Democrats made much of the fact that in the Weekend Australian of the previous Saturday there was a published set of tables by Professor Harding and Professor Warren, who are regarded around Australia as being the experts on the distributional effects, that is to say, the equity effects—are things fair?—in the distribution of the tax cuts and in the distribution of the compensation with respect to the GST; in other words, do the compensation and the tax cuts fairly offset the costs and charges that Australians will have to meet when they pay a new tax like a GST?
In that debate, I was referred to the Warren-Harding analysis. I was referred in that debate confidently, if I might say so, by the Australian Democrats on the basis that there would be no Australian losers. The comment was, `Go and look at the Warren-Harding tables. No Australian loses.' I have the Warren-Harding tables before me at the moment. This is the document that I was referred to. It was published in the Weekend Australian of 19-20 June—that is, the weekend before last. Under the headings `Single self-funded retiree' and `Self-funded retiree couple' it was stated that there are losers, there are people who will be worse off. So these compensatory provisions that we are debating now do not mean that no-one will be worse off. People will suffer. I remind the chamber again that these are people on fixed incomes. They are not people able to gain a higher income for themselves by negotiating new wages. They are people 
 who live off their investments; they have fixed incomes.
According to these tables, a couple of categories of self-funded retirees will be worse off. Importantly, when one looks at the categories of which self-funded retirees will be worse off, one sees that it is those self-funded retirees on lower incomes. These are not the wealthy millionaires able to live off their savings. These are Australians who have eked out investments for themselves. They have a modest income from their investments of between $10,000 and $20,000 a year but they are too proud to take a pension; they want to live off their investments. These are the ones that are worse off, the ones that are hit. These are the ones who cannot find extra income in their household budgets to compensate for the higher costs that they will be meant to be paying under a GST. It is no wonder, therefore, that at the beginning of this debate when I said to the government, `You have moved your amendments, but you haven't explained them to the chamber,' their approach was to sit pat. They declined to explain them. If they do try to explain them they will have to refer to the fact that if these amendments go through some Australians, among them self-funded retirees, will suffer. It is no wonder they are quiet and do not want to say anything. They do not want to draw attention to that fact.
I listened carefully to Senator Woodley's explanation. I am used to the routine now. You ask the government a question, a Democrat provides the answer and the government nods its head and does not say anything. Senator Woodley's argument did not go to the fact of whether people will be worse off or not. It went to the argument that the Australian Democrats have made it a bit better and not so many people will be worse off. It is not that everyone has had their position met and that no-one will suffer; fewer people will suffer. This is an argument that the Australian Democrats used to justify their compromise on the GST. But, like a compromise, it does not fix the problem: it fixes part of the problem.
I do not know why the Democrats are so lily-livered when it comes to negotiating with 
 this government. Given that the government requires their vote to get the bill through, why did they not exercise their negotiating clout properly in order to make sure that no-one will be injured by this measure? The fact that they tolerate injury means that they are not fair dinkum when it comes to all their professed self-belief about protecting those people in this community that cannot stand up and protect themselves. It means that they are not prepared to have a decent red-hot go when it comes to people who are at the bottom end of the income scale trying to survive off their own investment and who need legislative backup to ensure that they are properly compensated for the new cost of a tax.
Why do the Australian Democrats not do that? It is a worthwhile question to put to them. They had John Howard at the negotiating table. He required their vote to allow this legislation through. Why did they not hold firm and make sure that no-one suffered? Why did they allow some Australians to suffer? It is because they wanted a headline about how good they are as a serious political party. It is not a serious political party that reaches a compromise for the sake of public appearances but, when you look at the fine print, sells Australians down the river and makes them worse off.
I again say to the Australian government, `When you rise to justify your position, will you give us the benefit of making an explanation about your offer to Senator Harradine?' I am not at all certain that it will have the courage of its position to explain it to the chamber, since I have already invited it to do so and it has refused. This is a very important issue because an offer was made to Senator Harradine, although it was rejected. I must say that it was rejected on the very moral basis that it did not solve the problem: it went part-way to solving the problem but it did not fix it up—exactly the basis the Democrats have committed their vote on. Senator Harradine, as a moral person, declined to commit his vote, and because he did that the Prime Minister said to the Australian community, `I will legislate what I promised Senator Harradine by way of my offer. I will 
 put that in black-letter law.' Has the Prime Minister revealed the terms so we can test whether he is keeping his word by that commitment? No; we just have to take the Prime Minister on trust. Remember, this is the Prime Minister who said, `Never ever will there be a GST.' We have to take that person on trust that, although he is not revealing the contents of his offer to Senator Harradine, he is legislating for it.
But we know this piece of evidence as well: we know, from the lips of the Australian Democrats themselves, that not all the things that the Prime Minister promised Senator Harradine are being legislated in this package, that some of them have changed significantly or importantly and that some of them are being delivered at a lesser level than had been undertaken. Unless the government can actually prove, by now tabling the documents concerning what they offered Senator Harradine, that they are not here dudding self-funded retirees, we must assume that their silence means that they are not prepared to tell the truth and back up the Prime Minister by saying, `Here are the documents on what we promised. You can see for yourself that we are now delivering it.' If you have nothing to fear, why not come clean and give us the evidence? The fact that you sit silent and do not want to engage in this debate suggests that you have quite a lot—
—Senator Cook, please address the chair.
—I do address those remarks, Mr Temporary Chairman, through you to the Australian Democrats. I believe that this amendment does not go far enough and sells out self-funded retirees. The bonus for retirees goes nowhere near to compensating them for other items that they will have to pay a GST on and there are a number of items that they will have to pay a GST on for the first time. Self-funded retirees are often older people in need of the purchase of services that they themselves find difficulty in delivering. Many of them engage someone to mow their lawns or prune their gardens and require assistance with household maintenance, plumbing, electrical work and painting, 
 et cetera. They are not significantly capable of doing that themselves, so they engage outside help. They may have covered that in their original budgets, but one must remember now that they will have to pay an extra 10 per cent GST for the first time on all those services.
That is one of the reasons why this package does not go far enough to cover the cost of those extra charges that they will face. We also know from the Senate inquiry mentioned a moment ago by Senator Woodley that the Australian Investors Association, which gave evidence in Brisbane, gave evidence about what they regarded as the disastrous effect of a GST on retirees. I refer the Senate to the committee report for a full summary of that evidence. They wanted proper and full compensation in those circumstances. There are a lot of questions that have to be answered here. I will conclude my remarks because the light is on and I will have to sit down soon. We may not get the answers. The Australian Democrats and the government have imposed a guillotine on this debate so that if they do not answer the questions now, we will never get the answers because they are going to cut off this debate, stop our line of inquiry, and shut it down with a vote. They call that democracy! They ought to go and hang their heads in shame. These are serious questions about the welfare of Australians who have to face a new tax for the first time, but you are not properly compensating for it.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-06-28,"—I am absolutely amazed to hear the Uriah Heep on the other side of the chamber wringing his hands over self-funded retirees. My memory is long enough, even if Senator Cook's is not, to just remember what the Australian Labor Party in government did to self-funded retirees. Let me start with probably the most heinous crime of all, that is, letting inflation rip in this country. That was a dreadful thing for people who are retired, an absolutely shocking thing, where the value of their assets and their savings simply disappeared—it left them high and dry 
 in very worrying circumstances. What did Labor ever do that was good for self-funded retirees?
Yet this government is introducing substantial tax cuts for all Australians who have an income. This government is abolishing provisional tax, which is a great worry to older people and retirees generally. We have kept inflation low and provided the Commonwealth seniors health card for up to 220,000 more Australians—self-funded retirees every one of them. The tax reforms introduced in the package of measures that are before the chamber mean that the 50 per cent taper rate for the old age pension being reduced to 40 per cent will lead to 50,000 more people being able to access a part pension, including a pensioner concession card. Those 50,000 people are currently all self-funded retirees. It is an incredible thing that we could observe that wringing of hands from Senator Cook on behalf of the Australian Labor Party when this government has done all those things that have helped self-funded retirees, with more to come under the legislation that is in front of us.
Do not forget the tax rebate treatment, which now means that self-funded retirees and pensioners are getting the same treatment there. I remember Labor being lobbied about that long and hard. The Association of Independent Retirees tried very hard for a number of years to get the Australian Labor Party to do something about that, but they sat on their hands. They did not sit on their hands entirely of course because they said that there were going to be l-a-w tax cuts. They introduced the legislation, they did not say that there would be any wholesale sales tax increases and they went to an election. The people of Australia voted them in again in 1993—but they did not get the tax cuts.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on the standing order in relation to relevance, we have the government's amendments to these bills in front of us. Perhaps you could ask the minister to speak to her own amendments?
—There is no point of order. Senator Cook ranged reasonably far and wide in presenting his 
 point of view. The minister is talking about matters of interest that relate to the amendments before us and she is not out of order.
—On the point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman: since you have ruled out relevance, although the minister is talking about the alleged sins—and quite improperly and misleadingly because most of what she is saying is not entirely right but that hasn't stopped her before—
—What is your point of order?
—My point of order is that I have put a couple of direct questions to the minister. Apart from smearing the Australian Labor Party, will she bother to answer either of them?
—That is not a point of order, Senator Cook.
—Senator Cook is only a new chum here, Mr Temporary Chairman, and he does not know that. I would also like to point out that Senator Cook has just misled the Senate in the speech that he made. He was referring to Professor Harding and the use made by the Democrats of her findings on Friday, I think he was saying, with regard to what is going to happen to people under the amended package agreed with the Democrats. Senator Cook talked about some self-funded retirees remaining losers under the compromise tax package: a single person with $10,000 in private income and a couple with $20,000. He quite dishonestly refused to read the second sentence of that paragraph.
—Order, Senator Newman. I would ask you to withdraw that imputation.
—I withdraw. It is mysterious that Senator Cook managed to miss the second sentence in that paragraph, which I will read into the record. It reads:
But Professor Harding said these examples were unrealistic because these people should qualify for the pension unless they had expensive assets over and above the family home.
I was talking about wholesale sales tax when Senator Margetts called the point of order. That is very relevant to what is before us today because, when the wholesale sales tax 
 went up substantially after the 1993 election, with no prior warning and with no compensation at all, that hit all Australians. It inevitably must hit people on fixed incomes who are not in the workplace and who have little or no chance of increasing their savings when they want to buy replacement items for their home, for example.
Many older people, when they retire, want to make sure they can replace their fridge, which may have seen better days—like they often feel they have themselves—or perhaps their TV is on the blink once too often and it costs them a lot in service charges. When a whole range of electrical goods need replacing after a lifetime, as they do, the increase in wholesale sales tax hits retirees very hard. By comparison, this tax package will mean the cost of the purchase of whitegoods and browngoods will be reduced substantially. That will help all Australians, but it will be particularly valuable for people who are in retirement and whose savings are finite.
These government amendments do relate to a supplementary bonus for self-funded retirees aged 55 and over on 1 July next year in the limited circumstances where the retiree has no more than a $1,000 business and/or salary income during the 1999-2000 tax year and has not received any income support payment during that year. That is an important factor in the whole consideration of tax reform. There will be extra costs on some items, for which the government and the Democrats agreement is providing additional compensation, but on a number of quite costly items there will be a reduction in price. Those reductions will be in an area that is very important to older Australians.
We continue to hear this same old chant from the ALP that the compensation will erode over time. I do not think it is necessary to go through that whole debate again. The ALP have run this line every chance they have had in this debate. It is not true. The compensation measures, as now completed in the drafting, will mean that the compensation remains indefinitely for people who need assistance through the pension or for people on low incomes. We are obviously just wiling away the time, as the ALP want to use up the 
 time between now and half past one. I daresay we are going to get simply more of the same. It is becoming very tedious, and I wonder whether they want to call it quits now.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I just want to make a couple of points about this. People who are in retirement are overwhelmingly dissavers. They no longer continue to save money; they are actually running down their savings, for fairly obvious reasons. They are generally no longer employed or earning an income, and they are spending the money they have accrued throughout their working life. That is why a switch to a consumption tax, in this case a goods and services tax, has a particularly detrimental impact on people who are close to retirement or who are already retired. Because elderly Australians are overwhelmingly dissavers, it is difficult to disaggregate this and, I would argue, impossible to make any claim that elderly Australians are all better off and that there are no losers, as Senator Cook highlighted in the couple of examples that he gave the Senate earlier.
What is interesting about the difference between the government's initial package and the requests that the Senate is considering is that the latter drops the age for the qualification of the self-funded retiree supplementary bonus down to 55. What is interesting about that is that it is, in part at least, attempting to compensate for another measure that this government introduced shortly after it came into office: the so-called deeming provisions, whereby persons who had reached the age of 55 had their superannuation deemed.
These particular requests that we have before us are in contrast to the deeming provision that this government introduced, which effectively forced people at the age of 55 to run down their savings and which, I might say, Labor fought hard and long against. It is a contradictory policy approach. To some extent you are attempting to give back moneys, having taken substantially more moneys off people who reached the age of 55.
My main concern with all this is how to guarantee that this inadequate compensation the Senate is considering for retired Austral 
 ians will be maintained forever. One of the great difficulties with a GST is that invariably the compensation payments made—not just to retirees but to other people in society who are disadvantaged—do not remain forever. We only have to look across the Tasman to New Zealand to see what occurred there. One of the requests we are considering in relation to A New Tax System (Bonuses for Older Australians) Bill 1998  is a self-funded retiree bonus at age 55. In the explanatory memorandum that is costed at $150 million. I guarantee the Senate—I do not guarantee much to the Senate; politics is that sort of game—that, at some future date, the Department of Finance and Administration and the Treasury will be viewing this $150 million of expenditure with some considerable concern.
Like the government's activities shortly after it was elected when it introduced the deeming of superannuation at age 55, I am sure that Treasury and Finance would be eyeing off these compensation measures for future reduction in future budgets. I am sure that, at some future date when economic growth declines, as it inevitably will at some point, and there is a need to adjust budget expenditure, it will not be the higher income earners who gain very significantly from the income tax cuts that we will be considering after 1.30 p.m., who will be targeted for future budget cuts; it will be people who are retired, pensioners, self-funded retirees and lower income Australians. I am sure that these are the sorts of areas that will be targeted by this government in future budgets.
So I have two basic reasons: firstly, the inadequate compensation for people who have saved all their lives, and generally saved after they have paid tax. There is an interesting overall comment on a GST on people who are retired or close to retirement: they have been taxed on the way in and they are taxed on the way out. They are taxed on the way in because invariably much of their savings has been made from after-tax income earned during their working lives. Because they are dissavers—they are running down their savings—they are particularly hard hit by an expenditure tax, in this case a goods and services tax. Secondly, there is the difficulty 
 you have in guaranteeing—locking in—these sorts of compensation measures forever. It would need to be forever. It is not just persons who are close to retirement or currently retired whom we need to be concerned about. It is people who are in their 40s at the moment and who have saved considerable sums. I would be very doubtful that these sorts of measures will be in place for people who are currently in their 40s and intend retiring in 15 or 20 years time.
I, like my colleague Senator Cook, am extremely concerned at the very poor outcome that the Democrats have reached on this issue. Firstly, it is next to impossible to compensate older Australians for a consumption tax. Secondly, it is certainly impossible to guarantee that these inadequate compensation measures that they have negotiated with the government will remain locked in forever. I issue a word of warning to the Democrats. We do not need to warn the government because we know what their approach will be in a few years time—roll back these compensation measures for the elderly. That will be their approach. I warn the Democrats that, at some future date, the pressure will come on, whether they have the balance of power or not, to roll back these sorts of compensation measures. That is certainly one of my underlying concerns with the approach that has been taken by the Australian Democrats, and the very poor outcome that they have negotiated for retired people or people who are close to retirement in this country.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-28,"—I have a question that relates to my earlier point of order. We are dealing here with the A New Tax System (Bonuses for Older Australians) Bill 1998  and my question is, first of all: is Senator Newman the minister with carriage of the bill or in this instance is she sitting in for Senator Kemp? The reason I ask this is that earlier on in the debate Senator Cook asked a number of questions on issues relating to these amendments, but more importantly he asked Senator Newman whether she would briefly explain the amendments she herself moved. We have not heard either of those answers. So my question is: is Senator Newman the minister with carriage of 
 this bill? Even if she is not and is standing in for someone else, there should be some explanatory notes to go with the amendments that have been moved. I do not think it is unreasonable for the Senate to ask for a brief explanation of the amendments that are being moved.
Considering we are dealing with a bill that is intimately linked with the whole package, I also ask leave to incorporate in the Hansard six pages from Commentaries on the Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth by Quick and Garran which specifically relate to section 55 of the Constitution.
Leave granted.
The pages read as follows—
254. The Imposition of Taxation.
During the debate on the financial sections 53 and 55, the meaning of the expression ""the imposition of taxation"" was discussed, and the question raised whether a law imposing taxation and also providing for its collection would be ultra vires of the Constitution. Doubts were suggested whether the restriction that tax bills should deal only with the imposition of taxation might not be read so as to exclude from tax bills the ordinary machinery clauses, providing for the assessment and valuation of property, the subject of taxation, and for the enforcement and collection of the tax.
Referring to this point, Sir Samuel Griffith wrote: ""A more serious question is whether provisions regulating the collection of taxes should be allowed to form part of the same laws by which the amount of the tax is fixed. This point should be clearly settled and expressed."" (Notes on the Draft Federal Constitution, 1897, p.9.) Mr. Isaacs understood this note to mean that ""imposing taxation"" does not include collection and machinery. (Conv. Deb., Melb., p.2049.) Mr. Barton was inclined to think that, according to the well-known principle that the grant of a power includes all the necessary means for its effective exercise, the exclusive power given to the House of Representatives to originate bills ""imposing taxation"" would carry with it the subsidiary power to provide machinery in the same Bill for the collection of the taxes. It was pointed out that according to the practice observed in some constitutionally governed countries, taxing bills, fixing the nature, amount, and incidence of proposed taxes, were kept separate and distinct from machinery bills, dealing with such details as collection, assessment, and valuation. ""Would not the power of collection be embraced in the power to impose taxation?"" asked Sir Edward Braddon. (Conv. Deb., Melb., p.2056.) Mr. Barton said that power to collect would be, ordinarily, included in 
 the power to impose taxation, but in a section such as this, so strong in its intention to restrict laws imposing taxation to the mere imposition of taxation, it might be as well to remove doubt by adding after ""imposition"" the words ""and collection."" It was pointed out, however, that as the Senate was prohibited from amending proposed laws imposing taxation, the addition of the words ""and collection"" would have the effect of depriving the Senate of the power to amend matters in a tax Bill, relating to its method of collection.
""I confess that when I first proposed the amendment I did not see the extent to which it went. But, having appreciated the extent to which it goes, I still feel bound to adhere to it. The difficulty that would arise unless you allowed the House of Representatives to include in these Bills the ordinary powers of assessment and collection would be, that, while you might have a certain tax imposed in the Bill fixing the amount of the tax, the machinery Bill might be so subject to amendment by the Senate that the whole financial policy of the Government which introduced it, with a majority of the House of Representatives behind them, might be entirely subverted. That is a difficulty which, I think, none of us wish to create. Therefore, I am prepared to take the responsibility of adhering to the amendment. Holding the position I have always held, that the Senate should be a real body and not a mockery of State interests—while it should be a Second Chamber holding definite powers and rights as expressing the will of the people within the States which it represents—I have also held that we should only carry responsible Government into effect by making it real and effective, and a power of amending a machinery Bill to the extent of making a tax not worth collecting would be equal to the power of amending a Bill imposing taxation."" (Mr. E. Barton, Conv. Deb., Melb., p.2060.)
""All I am endeavouring to do is to attribute a meaning to words in this Constitution, which I believed in Adelaide—and I explained my belief as I have read—that they did convey, which I am inclined to believe now they do convey, without a special explanation; but as to which I am in serious doubt, because of the very strong express nature of the words `shall deal with the imposition of taxation only.' It is in order to remove that doubt, and for that purpose only, that I wish these words to be inserted, and I really do believe that the insertion of the words will carry out the real spirit of the understanding of 1891."" (Id. p. 2067.)
Mr. Barton's amendment to add the words ""and collection"" was rejected by 26 votes to 16. But see Note, 248, supra.
255. ""Shall be of No Effect.""
The next important point discussed was whether a law violating the rule forbidding the combination of taxation with any other matter, or the rule 
 forbidding a tax Act to contain more than one subject of taxation, should be void in toto, or should be void only to the extent of the irrelevancy, or to the extent of the additional subjects. Mr. G. H. Reid moved that the prohibition should not invalidate any part of the law which did not infringe the provisions of the Constitution, and that if any law imposing taxation contained more than one subject of taxation, the tax first in order of enactment should be taken to be properly passed. (Conv. Deb., Melb., p.2089.) This amendment was negatived by 27 to 15 votes. The feeling, however, prevailed in the Convention that some provision should be made in the Constitution, to the effect that only the parts of the Act in which the forbidden matter existed should be invalid. At a later stage Mr. Reid moved the insertion of the words ""and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect."" This amendment was accepted without a division. (Conv. Deb., Melb., 2415.)
256. ""One Subject of Taxation Only.""
By the first paragraph of the section, laws imposing taxation must deal only with the imposition of taxation. If the section contained no other limitation regulating and restricting the exercising of the taxing power there would be nothing to prevent the House of Representatives from sending to the Senate a bill containing a number of separate and independent taxes. The section, however, goes on to enact that laws imposing taxation shall, with the exception of those relating to customs and excise, deal with one subject of taxation only. It is necessary to explain the object of this limitation. By the second paragraph of sec. 53, the Senate is deprived of the power to amend tax bills, but it may constitutionally reject them. In order to maintain its right to veto, in detail, each specific tax to which it objects, without thereby involving the rejection of other taxes of which it approved, the Constitution prohibits the combination of taxation proposals; it requires each proposed tax to be submitted by the House of Representatives to the Senate, in a separate bill. This procedure being followed, the Senate can exercise its discretion with respect to each tax, without being coerced to pass a tax to which it objects, in order to carry a tax which it desires. In this respect the Senate will have greater control over taxation than the House of Lords enjoys.
The Papers Duties Precedent may be here referred to in illustration of the manner in which sec. 55 will operate in strengthening the Senate. In 1860, the Commons determined to balance the year's ways and means by an increase of the property tax and stamp duties, and the repeal of the duties on paper. The increased taxation had already received the assent of Parliament, when the Lords rejected the Paper Duties Repeal Bill, and thus 
 overruled the financial arrangements voted by the Commons. That House was naturally sensitive to this encroachment upon its privileges; but the Lords had exercised a legal right, and their vote was irrevocable during that session. The Commons, therefore, to maintain their privileges, recorded upon their journal, 6th July, resolutions affirming that the right of granting aids and supplies to the Crown is in the Commons alone; that the power of the Lords to reject bills relating to taxation ""is justly regarded by this House with peculiar jealousy, as affecting the right of the Commons to grant the Supplies, and to provide the ways and means for the service of the year; and that to guard, for the future, against an undue exercise of that power by the Lords, and to secure to the Commons their rightful control over taxation and supply, this House has in its own hands the power so to impose and remit taxes, and to frame bills of supply, that the right of the Commons as to the matter, manner, measure, and time may be maintained inviolate."" In accordance with these resolutions, during the next session, the financial scheme of the year was presented to the Lords for acceptance or rejection as a whole. The Commons again resolved that the paper duties should be repealed; but, instead of seeking the concurrence of the Lords to a separate bill for that purpose, they included in one bill the repeal of those duties with the property tax, the tea and sugar duties, and other ways and means for the service of the year; and this bill the Lords were constrained to accept. The budget of each year has since that occasion been comprised in a general and composite Act—a proceeding supported by precedent. In 1787, Mr. Pitt's entire budget was comprised in a single bill; and during many subsequent years great varieties of taxes were imposed and continued in the same Acts. (May's Parl. Prac. 10th ed. pp. 550-1.)
From this precedent it appears that the Commons have the right to send to the Lords a single scheme of taxation embodying the repeal of old taxes and the imposition of new taxes; the functions of the Lords being, in such a case, limited to a simple assent to the whole scheme or a simple negative of the whole scheme. Such a composite or general tax bill could not be submitted by the House of Representatives to the Senate; it would be unconstitutional, the maxim being ""one tax one bill,"" except in the case of bills dealing with customs and excise.
We have now to consider what will be the consequence if Parliament should, whether by accident or design, pass a law imposing taxation, yet dealing with more than one subject of taxation—a law, say, imposing an income tax and a stamp duty. A proposal that the tax standing first in order in the enactment should be valid, whilst the other, or others, next in order should be null and void, was rejected by the Convention. No provision is made in the Constitution, therefore, for 
 segregating the taxes and providing for the validity of one and the nullity of the others. Where the Constitution intends that one portion of an Act only shall be of no effect and the rest operative it is so expressed. The only conclusion is that an Act embodying a plurality of taxes would be absolutely and completely ultra vires.
—I thank the Senate. I would be very interested in responses from the minister in relation to the carriage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-06-28,"—The Labor Party are, of course, quite right. In considering these matters, you do have to have regard to what a future government would do. In that respect you have to have an eye on what a future Labor government would do. With that regard, past actions do indicate possible future attitudes as well as present actions. We do know, as the minister has pointed out, that in 1993 when Labor introduced the wholesale sales tax changes they did not provide compensation because they do not believe in providing compensation for regressive indirect taxes such as the wholesale sales tax. They also at that time affected self-funded retirees by taxing deemed capital gains. They did not compensate for that either. They also introduced an excessively high provisional tax and did not compensate for that either. My guess would be that, if the Labor Party vote against any of the compensation bills which are within this package, that will be a signal as to their likely attitude to whether or not they would seek to withdraw compensation—or, to use their words, roll back the package—when they perhaps come into power at the next election. I think there is a warning there for us all.
They have already, as we know, indicated that they believe food should be taxed. We do know that Senator Cook has said that that is a strategic decision and they do not really want to tax food, but I must say, having heard the shadow Treasurer on Sunday, I remained unconvinced that Labor did not want to tax food. So we have the potential of a future Labor government affecting self-funded retirees by winding back compensation and by taxing food.
—We are not going to wind back compensation. Our position is not to wind back compensation but to wind back the tax.
—Order, Senator Cook!
—I heard Senator Cook in silence. My point is that, if the Labor Party supports this bill, that will indicate that they do support compensation. If they oppose it, my view is that it indicates that they do not support compensation. I cannot put it clearer than that. As for the rolling guillotine, which I think was introduced originally by the Labor Party, I do not have to remind anyone in here that we have had the longest debate ever on these bills.
Returning to the issue laid out in the criticism of this package, as the explanatory memorandum says, it does attend to the extension of the self-funded retiree supplementary bonus to persons aged 55 years and over. Senator Cook drew attention to the Warren-Harding modelling. The minister quite rightly responded with the very clear qualification they put on that particular instance. The point is that, if self-funded retirees own their own home and do not smoke and if the real appreciation effect is taken into account, they will be $2.38 a week better off. Do I wish that they would be even better off? Of course. Everybody would like everybody to be better off. But that is as far as you can go with these things. When we look at the Access Economics modelling, we notice that their modelling did not take into account the franking credits adjustment. That is about $550 million which will be of benefit to this group of people. That was not modelled in there. Unfortunately, I am not able to do that arithmetically, but if that is taken into account their position improves even more.
I simply say in response to all this that not only have the Democrats attempted to ensure with the government that this category of persons is properly compensated in view of the introduction of the GST, despite the taking away of the WST, but also we have attempted to put them in the position where in real terms they are better off. I appreciate that that is modest, it is not a vast sum of 
 money, but nevertheless our calculations and our assessment of the matter are that they will be better off—unless, of course, a future government were to roll back compensation and to tax food.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I want to conclude my remarks in ample time for the minister to have at least a third opportunity to answer the questions that I have put. I notice that the minister has taken advantage of the opportunity to speak in this debate but she has not taken advantage of the opportunity to provide any explanation about her own amendments and she has not taken the opportunity to actually answer the questions which I sought answers to and which I put to her very early in this debate. All she has done is enter into a general political rave, some of which, but not all of which, was misleading, about what Labor is supposed to have done.
—Or not done.
—Or not done.
—Yes, and should have done.
—Okay, you can put all your qualifications up. All you allege about that is a debate we can have, because that is a debate in which you have not depicted the record of the Labor government at all accurately, nor would you, because it suits your purpose not to. I remind the minister that this is the government's legislation that is before us now and it is for the government to answer now what it is proposing to do. Harking back to history is interesting, but it is not the question that Australians want to know about today.
This is what you are proposing and this is a bill to compensate for a GST, and you decline to answer the key questions as to whether the compensation provided now is equal to the compensation offered by the Prime Minister to Senator Harradine. I have put that question to you now three times and every time you have declined to answer it. We want to know whether the Prime Minister, who said that he would deliver on what he promised Senator Harradine, has in fact 
 delivered here, despite the fact that the Democrats say, `Well, that is not entirely true. The Prime Minister has not delivered.' That is what they said on the record before. It is a question of honesty in politics. The fact that you will not answer any questions or provide any explanation is the most eloquent testimony to the fact that you have not got an explanation or an answer because, if you did provide them, you would be shown for what you are doing in these circumstances, which is not treating truthfully with the Australian electorate.
I have respect for Senator Murray, but I find it a bit rude, if I may say so, of Senator Murray to tell people what the Australian Labor Party will do in office. We are the authority on what we will do in office—not the Australian Democrats who have a vested interest in painting us black in this debate. We have said that once a GST is introduced it is almost impossible to remove it. No-one really argues that point. Think about the number of state taxes and charges that would be removed. How would you replace them? Think about the way in which the tax scales are being remodelled. How would you model them back? And think about all the extra costs and charges that will be imposed for the first time on services.
We say that it would be very difficult to unscramble this omelette once it has been made. I draw the line again in this debate. We have drawn the line in this chamber: we do not want a GST because unscrambling it is almost an impossibility. Kim Beazley has said that we will work at trying to do the best we can. The governing rule that we apply in this debate about taxation is that Australians should be treated fairly. It is a bit rude to argue that a future Labor government may withdraw compensation. That is not our position at all; we have never said that. We are not committed to do that, and nor would we be—but it takes the heat off focusing on the issue before us now.
The issue before us now is that, despite the compensation, a number of Australians will be worse off. That is the issue before us now. You said that no-one will be worse off. That is not true. The minister might try to explain 
 that in some cases these people are entitled to claim the pension. I draw attention to the evidence of Mr Bricknell on behalf of self-funded retirees before the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System. He said that many of these people do not draw the pension but live off their savings.
Let me now conclude, because I want to allow time for the minister to answer the questions I have put. The guillotine voted on by the Democrats and the government to kill this debate will descend in five minutes, so the minister will have one last shot to answer the questions about what the Prime Minister offered Senator Harradine so we can see whether we have the same deal here. Before I exit the stage, let the last word be from a self-funded retiree, as these are the people we are devoting our attention to at this stage of the debate.
In the edition of the Weekend Australian in which the tables that I referred to were published, there were a number of vignettes or snapshots of how people will be affected and what they think about it. Above the heading `Retiree', there is a photograph of a woman called Kate Arnold. It says that she is 70, is divorced and lives in Canberra. Her income is $22,000 from superannuation and a small British pension. She has a daughter aged 39. She pays no rent or mortgage and her only government payment is a health concession card. She spends about 80 per cent of her income. It is alleged under the tables of the economic modellers that she will be $41.04 ahead. What does she think about that? Let me quote what Matthew Spencer reported she said:
KATE Arnold has been around too long, she says, to accept economic modelling suggesting she will be $41.04 a week better off under the new tax package.
""I don't believe it,"" Ms Arnold says.
""It's tenuous as far as I'm concerned. Economic projections are very questionable—they're like statistics.
""Nothing is going to compensate for the increase in service charges to start with.""
The article then goes on to describe her circumstances. The last paragraph says:
However, Ms Arnold still believes the GST will fall unfairly on low-income women, particularly as there are more older women in the community.
Let the last word in this debate be from someone affected by it. Her income is within the range in the tables which shows people who will be worse off. She does not believe the modellers who make assumptions that if you do not have to pay for housing or if you do not buy cigarettes you will be better off. She does not believe the assumption that inflation will be 1.9 when, in fact, we know it will be 2.3 in the first year. She does not believe a number of the other assumptions—blithely made by economists for a nice model—which do not hold true to what people experience in real life as they struggle with their household budgets.
Kate Arnold does not believe that the cost savings will be passed on in their entirety and that no-one will bother to appropriate some of the cost savings to their profit and pocket it themselves rather than give it to the consumers. She does not believe any of that because she has come up through the world of hard knocks. She knows what happens in real life. Life does not conform to an economic model. It conforms to a whole series of imperfect applications of cost where people are trying to maximise their profits. She knows that. She also knows that the assumption of compliance costs—which we now know is $1.9 billion for small business—will be passed on. That was not included in the model either. She knows a lot of those practical, real life things. It is her last word that the Senate should have regard to.
We will support the compensation because the government is going to make sure that at this level it is done and it is not provided anymore. We will vote for this in order that someone can get something out of it, but that is not the ideal outcome—not by a long stretch. I will stop here. Perhaps, Minister, you will answer my questions.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (LUXURY CAR TAX IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-06-28,"—In the very short time that Senator Cook has quite deliberately left me, I will answer some of the 
 questions that have been raised. Senator Sherry went on and on at some length about how compensation measures do not last forever. If anybody looks at the Hansard  later on, it will reveal just how altogether ignorant he is of the compensation measures. I will not waste time on him.
Senator Margetts referred to section 55 of the Constitution. This legislation does not impose a tax, if that was your general drift, Senator Margetts—and I am the minister responsible for this legislation. I also draw senators' attention to the fact that retirees frequently have children and grandchildren. As I have gone around the country, I have found that, even where the ALP has managed to frighten older people about tax reform, those people have still constantly said to me, `Look, I'm not sure what it will do for me, but I know it will be good for my country and it will be good for my kids and my grandkids.' The ALP only looks backwards. It has its mind shut to the future. This legislation means reform for Australia for the next century and the ALP has been left behind—it is a sad thing for Australia.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-28,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Is it true that the government has sought legal advice on whether the excise reductions proposed under the ANTS package breach section 92 of the Constitution by effectively discriminating against the owners and drivers of the 60,000 petrol powered trucks of over 4.5 tonnes which operate in regional and rural Australia, who will not get any benefit from the reduced diesel excise?

 tion, when at the same time it was happy to release advice from the Acting Solicitor-General about Mr Entsch's potential breach of section 64 of the Constitution?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-06-28,"—Madam President, my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Minchin. I refer to an article in 
 today's Age  which points out that, under new federal government policy, farmers will be allowed to grow genetically modified crops that are toxic to birds, insects and grazing animals and which could make some weeds resistant to herbicides. Last week the European Union announced a moratorium on the release of such crops. Given the rapidly rising concern in Australia about this issue, is this not exactly the kind of issue for which the environment minister should take full responsibility? Is it a fact that, under the old environment laws, the Commonwealth had the power to require an environmental impact assessment for imports of such organisms and that, once the office of gene regulator was established, the Commonwealth would have had the power to require an EIS for the release of such organisms? Why, then, did the Democrats and government guillotine new environmental laws through the Senate last week which would prevent the Commonwealth from requiring an EIS on GMOs?

 able minister: what is a `significant' organism? What does the word `significant' mean in relation to genetically modified organisms? Does this not open the avenue for a complete cop-out by the Commonwealth? Secondly, I repeat the question: why did not the government and the Democrats ensure that a trigger mechanism was available to ensure full Commonwealth assessment of the impact of genetically modified organisms before their release in Australia before guillotining this legislation through last week?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Organisms </title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question

The government will, in conjunction with the establishment of the new gene technology regulator—that is, the Gene Technology Office—introduce amendments to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to ensure that decisions of this new gene technology regulator in relation to environmentally significant releases of genetically modified organisms and products are subject to environmental assessment.
The Department of Health and Aged Care is currently preparing legislation to establish this new office of the gene technology regulator and will, following that drafting, consult with all stakeholders, including environment groups and state governments, and introduce that legislation into parliament. The situation will be an improvement. Under the old EPIP Act there had been absolutely no referrals to the environment minister of GMO decisions, so we do believe this will be an improvement.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Organisms </title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-06-28,"—Last Thursday Senator Chris Evans asked me a question and I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
SENATOR CHRIS EVANS —My question is directed to Senator Herron, in his capacity representing the Minister for Aged Care. Is the minister aware that, on 1 July, aged care residents in Tasmania and Victoria will not receive full indexation to their care subsidies? Can the minister confirm that this real cut in aged care funding in Victoria and Tasmania flows from the government's policy of coalescence? Why is the government continuing with this policy when the Productivity Commission inquiry that the government initiated recommended against it proceeding, finding that it would leave the quality of care as the balancing item in the funding arrangements? Why has the government refused to respond to the Productivity Commission's report, handed to the Treasurer on 13 January this year? Will the minister now give an assurance that the 21,000 residents of nursing homes in Tasmania and Victoria will not have their care subsidies cut in real terms from 1 July?
SENATOR CHRIS EVANS —Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Contrary to the gratuitous abuse the minister provided in answer to the question, this is a very real issue. The Productivity Commission reported to the government on 13 January and recommended that they drop the coalescence proposal. It was an inquiry that the government initiated and that raised serious concerns in the community. What I want to know, Minister, and I appreciate you will take it on notice and give a proper answer, is why you have not responded to that report and why the government has not done anything to address the Productivity Commission's concern that the standard of care in Victoria and Tasmania will drop under your 
 proposal. 1 July is next week, and we still not do not know what you are going to do and whether or not you intend responding. I think it is important that the Senate and the community get an answer.
Senator HERRON —Tasmanian and Victorian providers will receive a real increase in funding on 1 July. In Tasmania, providers will receive a real increase in funding in 1999-2000 of $5.1 million, or 5.1%, over that provided in 1998-99 Victorian providers will receive a real increase in funding of $36.6 million which is a 4.5% increase
The Government will provide $3.5 billion for residential care in the next financial year—an increase of more than $200 million over 1998-99, which includes $48.9 million for indexation.
The additional funds to residential aged care services will ensure that average real funding levels are maintained to the 3008 services around Australia and that more places are available across the country.
The 1 July 1999 rates increases are part of an annual indexation of subsidies and supplements.
The Productivity Commission's report on Nursing Home Subsidies was tabled in Parliament on 31 March 1999. The report endorses the Government's objective of uniform national subsidies for residential aged care.

That, in relation to the reference of the Copyright Amendment (Importation of Sound Recordings) Bill 1999  to a committee, the reporting date 9 August 1999 be omitted and the reporting date of 30 September 1999 be substituted.
I have been asked to do this by Senator McKiernan, who has indicated that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee has met and is of the view that, given the references already before the committee, it will be impossible for the committee to meet the proposed reporting date in the selection of bills report. My understanding is that that matter has been the subject of some agreement with the government, and that is the basis of my moving the amendment.
Also, we did seek to refer the  A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Bill 1999  and three related bills to a committee. That was defeated by the committee on the vote of the government with the support of the Democrats. I believe it is unprecedented for that to occur.

I can guarantee that he will have a chance to action it on Wednesday, so the matter will be dealt with before the Senate adjourns and well before it would be necessary for the committee to start any work on the reference. It can then be discussed outside the chamber.

That the report be adopted.
This report is the 27th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identi 
 fied, in the Senate. On 27 May 1999 the President received a letter from Ms S. Quantrill, Registrar, Greenwich University, forwarding letters from certain faculty members of Greenwich University relating to remarks made by Senator Kim Carr during the adjournment debate of 22 March 1999. The President referred the letters to the committee as submissions under privilege resolution No. 5. The committee considered the submissions, together with a further submission received subsequently on 24 June 1999. It now recommends that they be incorporated in Hansard .
As the committee always reminds the Senate, in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or persons. Rather, it ensures that these persons' submissions, and ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution No. 5. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,31,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-06-28,"—The Privileges Committee has tabled this afternoon a series of statements which I have only just had a chance to glance over. They are, of course, matters that have been canvassed on other occasions in this chamber, although the letters themselves have never actually been given to me to allow a proper consideration of the content. I thank Senator Ray for his tabling of this report on behalf of the Privileges Committee. I think the committee has done the Senate a great service in that it does allow for an examination of the claims being made by a number of persons associated with the staffing of Greenwich University, one of Australia's newest universities, which we would all be aware was legally established by the Legislative Council of Norfolk Island. I think it is an important opportunity for us to examine these details, and I will endeavour to do so with greater consideration later on. Like Senator Ray, I am not in the business of perniciously or gratuitously insulting people—
—Like me.
—Like Senator Ray, I am of that view. I think the privileges of the parliament ought to be protected to allow the elected representatives of this country to speak about matters and to identify mistakes 
 that have been made by government. I think it is important that these conventions be maintained so as to allow us to exercise our responsibilities.
I have raised a number of concerns about the incompetence of this government in allowing a dodgy operation like this at Greenwich to ever get off the ground. I am particularly concerned, as are a number of other people in this country. I note, for instance, a letter I received from Mr Phil Honeywood, the Minister for Tertiary Education and Training in Victoria, who said:
As you have correctly pointed out, I have been very concerned about the lack of rigorous processes of review comparable to those carried out by the States, before the recognition of Greenwich University was given by the Parliament of Norfolk Island.
I have been campaigning to expose what are quite clearly ludicrous mistakes made by this government and made through the incredible ignorance of the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government in his abysmal handling of his portfolio. I have been particularly concerned to expose attempts by a group of shysters to circumvent the regulatory framework that exists in Australia to protect our fourth largest export industry. The education industry is entirely dependent on the maintenance of our good name and the quality of Australian education.
Many people in this country are of the view that we do have a high quality education system. It is a view which I certainly support. We need to monitor that. We need to take all necessary measures to protect it. Australia is very vulnerable to the activities of a few people, given that we now have an industry worth some $3.1 billion. Australian citizens have a right to expect exactly the same level of support that US governments—state and federal—offer their citizens insofar as their concerns have been expressed. The Californian state authorities recently indicated that diploma mills manufacturing degrees based on the ability to write a cheque rather than master a curriculum will no longer be allowed to continue. That statement was put to us as a result of questions that I raised concerning these particular matters and relating to issues associated with some of the individuals who have been named.
The establishment of Greenwich University under Australian legislation, courtesy of the Norfolk Island parliament, has been greeted with widespread dismay and disbelief throughout the higher education world. International cyberspace has resounded with jokes about the way in which Australia has endured one of the biggest bureaucratic bungles in recent decades, not to mention the gullibility of the good citizens of Norfolk Island and of our own federal minister for territories and his department. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs is also implicated in this affair.
I raised these matters in the chamber back in March. Since that time, a number of others have also raised concerns, including vice-chancellors and state ministers for education. As a consequence, this government has been obliged to establish an inquiry into this fiasco. It has been forced to inquire into the bona fides of this institution—an institution which has not been accredited in the United States and which has made numerous attempts to get into Australia through a number of backdoor means. It has finally used the venue of Norfolk Island to achieve its objective.
It is an American import, an American interloper. It is a clear example of the great diversity in the higher education system in the United States. For example, America has some of the finest universities in the world, but it also has what might best be described as degree mills or vanity universities. However, in Australia there is a wide-ranging understanding that Australia produces top quality education. In Australia in recent times there has been a series of non-traditional areas of learning. I do not think it is appropriate that we should in any way prevent the development of non-traditional areas of learning; however, we need to ensure that quality is protected.
American society has a much broader understanding of what quality means. For instance, a whole lot of new ideas are uncritically accepted in the United States. There is a huge range of beliefs and ideas which we might not regard as being founded on empirical research or rigorous intellectual data. America might be the land of the free but it 
 is also the land of Waco and the tragic Branch Davidian cult. America is a land where an astonishing 40 per cent of undergraduate science students believe in creationism, not evolution. They believe that the world was created only a few thousand years ago and they believe that `false' evidence, such as dinosaurs and fossils, was placed there as a trick by Satan. Some 15 per cent of Americans believe they have personally been abducted by aliens.
The academics who provided information to the committee were concerned that I did not know the full facts. Maybe I should examine some of the full facts. For instance, I see in this report of the Committee of Privileges—which I have only just seen—that a Mr Lindgren said:
Senator Carr also felt obliged to make a derogative remark regarding an Orthodox Order to which I belong. This order in fact possesses members of the Romanoff family, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia and is protected (patron) by His Holiness Alexy II, Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. Regarding this I think it was best summed up by a member of the Romanov family, who recently, stated: ""I have never been attacked by a member of my own Class"" . . . Enough said?
What an extraordinary defence! He continues:
Mr. Carr, once again true to his intent ignored my association in the Brotherhood of the Blessed Gerard which is a service branch of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (Catholic) and my internationally recognised Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Ignatius of Antioch (under His Beatitude Patriarch Mar Ignace Anthony II Hayeck, Uniate-Syrian Catholic Patriarch of Antioch).
Of course I did not go to all the detail. Perhaps I should have. Another example is the case of somatic studies. A Ms Mertz says:
. . . Somatic Studies is offered to bodywork and massage therapy professionals whose intention it is to enhance the profession of touch therapies through conducting research.
We can imagine the touch therapies these people are involved in! Ms Mertz continues:
A distance learning program offers these students the flexibility to integrate a variety of resources from various universities and educational institutions.
I look forward to seeing the detail of their touch therapies. Another case is energy medicine. In his letter, a Mr Shealy says:
Functional skills developed enable students to understand and make use of techniques such as: acupuncture, kinesiology, homeopathy, and biofeedback, and spiritual healing, colour, sound, aroma, psychospiritual and relaxation therapies, therapeutic physical exercise for general health, nutritional principles for diagnosis and therapy, postural effects upon health—
—Sounds like one of the Democrats has got a new job!
—Indeed! The letter continues:
. . . application of modern electrotherapy, diagnostic and therapeutic applications of medical intuition—
I wonder what the Australian Medical Association would say about that—
for the improvement of the quality of life, and clearing the blocks that interfere with vision, creativity and intuition.
What an extraordinary body of knowledge for us to be expected to accept without question. That is not the way in which Australian universities have traditionally behaved. It would be appropriate to ask questions about whether or not the post facto acceptance of this university by an incompetent and foolish minister who is behaving like a buffoon ought not be questioned. I have done so. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.

To whom this may concern:
I read the minutes from Australia's senate meeting on March 22nd 1999, and I have a few reactions. First, I must thank Senator Carr for indulging so brilliantly in insults, for this frees me to be rather direct myself. Though I don t think I'll be needing words such as shysters' to be effective.
By snickering at the concepts of Alchemy or analysis of Fairytale, Senator Carr is advertising his ignorance of a whole field of psychology, namely depth Psychology. So though Carl Jung does not need defending, Senator Carr needs informing. 

The work of Carl Jung (a Swiss Psychiatrist, 1875-1961) consists of a 20 volume collection of his research spreading well over 50 years (1902-1960), and continued since then by scholars all over the world. This research includes the translation of Old Greek, Arabic and later European texts of alchemy, fairytales and mythology dug up from the dung heap of the past. Jung carried out a comparison of the behavioural patterns revealed in these texts with those found in contemporary mythology and shamanic traditions (he travelled to India, Africa and visited native American nations to meet with medicine people in person), as well as contemporary themes in literature, art, and films, as well as in the dreams of his psychiatric patients.
Secondly, his findings made Carl Jung the father of concepts such as Extroversion/Introversion, the Collective Unconscious, and archetypal forces behind behaviour. The Collected Works have been translated in at least seven languages. He is being studied in Europe, England, the United States, Canada. South Africa, South America, and is certainly known by several Australian authors.
Originally, Jung Institutes across Europe and the USA were strictly postdoctoral programs. Since the 1980's, more universities became interested in making available a course of study that, up to this point, was very elitist and hardly accessible to anyone who was not considered ""analytical material"". There are now Jung Institutes in every major cities of the United States, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, and they also include programs for the layman. Some universities have devoted entire programs to the study and application as well as augmentation of Jung's thought. The best known such university if the Pacifica Institute in California, an accredited university which holds the library of Joseph Campbell's original works.
Anyone who has information about Carl Jung's work knows that, rather than ""doctrinal"", it is open and expansive, and subject to continuing deeper exploration. In fact its great beauty resides in the fact that it identified patterns of behaviour seated deep in the unconscious that are common to all people. This offers academics new tools with which to study human behaviour across time and cultures. Jung's findings reveal the existence of timeless interpretations of reality that are surprisingly close to contemporary quantum mechanics' or new physics' discoveries. In that sense Jung was at the vanguard of a movement towards greater unity in the world, a braking of ethnocentric barriers that are at the source of most wars, and a tool for communication among humans that bypasses local cultural boundaries. It is sad to see that, once again, an effort to apply these ideas by a brave new world (in this case, a Hawaiian university joining with an Australian university) is being attacked by outdated ethnocentric provincialism. 

In any case, I hope that this information will be useful in warning Senator Carr that, next time he plans to endeavour in the smashing of an entire body of academic studies, he better do his homework first, for surely he didn't intend to demonstrate his ignorance to the whole world.

Dear Sirs:
Let me say that I am honoured that Senator Carr would have so little to do as to reflect on my name and my achievements. I fear, however, that the Senator was either ignorant or perhaps selective in his remarks toward me. I felt that rather than ignore his remarks as being those of at best a misinformed individual I should address his comments not in the ignoble manner in which they were stated but as an educator, scholar and gentlemen.
Senator Carr in referring to my masters felt obliged to ignore my BAE, Med, and EdS from the University of Mississippi ""The University is a centre for Faulkner studies, offering one of the finest collections of the Nobel Prize winners work and maintaining his Rowan Oak home as a literary shrine. The	 Medical Centre surgeons performed the world's first lung (1963) and heart (1964) transplants in man, and its physiologists defined the role of the kidneys in controlling blood pressure. Medical Centre faculty also have constructed the world's most comprehensive computer model of the body, and the campus has been selected as one of five national sites to test GE's new twin magnet MRT (magnetic resonance therapy). Today, faculty, staff, and students are pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge, imagination, and expertise necessary for a productive life in an increasingly complex society and competitive world. They play a significant role in the country's research efforts through federally funded facilities on the Oxford campus such as the Jamie Whitten National Centre for Physical Acoustics, the National Centre for the Development of Natural Products, the National Food Service Management Institute, the Marine Minerals Technology Centre, the Centre for Water and Wetlands Resources, and the Centre for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering.
The University also plays a crucial role in Mississippi by preparing students for leadership in the state and nation. Distinguished law school alumni include nine governors, seven lieutenant 
 governors, 29 Mississippi Supreme Court justices, 12 U.S. representatives, and four U.S. senators.
Senator Carr also felt it necessary to ignore my FCP (eg. MPhil) from the world famous College of Preceptors in Essex, England and my soon to be completed (June 1999) DEd from UNISA in Pretoria.
While denouncing some of the societies to which I am proudly associated, Mr. Carr once again showed his true intent by not mentioning the Royal Historical Society (London), American Academy of Religion, Medieval Academy of America, and Orders and Medals Society of America. He also selectively ignored my fellowship in the Royal Society of Arts, Royal Asiatic Society and College of Preceptors.
Senator Carr also felt obliged to make a derogative remark regarding an Orthodox Order to which I belong. This order in fact possesses members of the Romanoff family, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia and is protected (patron) by His Holiness Alexy II, Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia.
Regarding this I think it was best summed up by a member of the Romanov family, who recently, stated: "" I have never been attacked by a member of my own Class"". . . Enough said?
Mr. Carr, once again true to his intent ignored my association in the Brotherhood of the Blessed Gerard which is a service branch of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (Catholic) and my internationally recognised Knight Commander from the Order of Saint Ignatius of Antioch (under His Beatitude Patriarch Mar Ignace Anthony II Hayeck, Uniate-Syrian Catholic Patriarch of Antioch). The Vatican also recognises this order. Finally in passing, I feel it necessary to provide once again insight into Senator Carr's lack of knowledge concerning myself or my achievements. He felt it necessary to mention the Order of the King's Daughters and Sons that I believe he must have through ignorance felt was a fake chivalric order. If he had only taken 5 minutes to either look the order up on the Internet or in some reference he would have discovered that ""The King's Daughters and Sons was founded on January 13, 1886 by Margaret Bottome of New York City, with a membership of ten women. It is a unit of interdenominational Christians dedicated to the development of spiritual life and the stimulation of Christian activities. Through a three-fold program of religion, education, and philanthropy, the organisation trains its members as well as others for Christian Service. Today, its thirty nine branches throughout the United States and Canada support ministries for the aging, handicapped and the underprivileged. The Order has an Indian department that encourages contributions to Native Americans, supports leprosy research, and contributes to American and Foreign Bible Societies. It 
 owns and operates three houses at the Chautauqua Institution in New York and provides scholarships for over forty students for summer courses there."" The society makes NO claims to being chivalric.
Shame, Mr. Carr, why don't you get on with running the government rather than talking about things you know nothing about. . . .

To Whom It May Concern:
It has come to my attention that Senator Carr has voiced uncompromising criticism of Greenwich University's graduate programs on the floor of the Australian Senate. His critique included the program in Somatic Studies. As the lead faculty for this program, I am writing to clarify its importance.
Greenwich University's program in Somatic Studies is offered to bodywork and massage therapy professionals whose intention it is to enhance the professionalisation of touch therapies through conducting research. A distance learning program offers these students the flexibility to integrate a variety of resources from various universities and educational institutions.
Regarding massage therapy, the 1993 Harvard report, ""Unconventional Medicine in the United States: Prevalence, Costs, and Patterns of Use,"" published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that possibly 12.6 million Americans used massage therapy in 1990 making 77 million visits to massage therapists. This survey has allowed the US medical establishment to become aware that massage therapy is a burgeoning health care field. As a licensed massage therapist myself, I am committed to supporting the maturation of the profession. I am a member of the Commission on Massage Training Accreditation and the editorial advisory board for the Massage Therapy Journal, published by the American Massage Therapy Association. I have been closely following developments in research, legislation, and health care policy concerning touch therapies.
Somatic Studies is a graduate degree title that has been established for programs that focus on embodiment, that is, the relationships between the body and cognition, emotion, and other dimensions of the self, exploring the body in relationship to an individual's undivided experience. It is entirely appropriate for practitioners of touch therapy modalities, whether therapeutic massage, Rolfing, 
 or the Feldenkrais Technique, to earn degrees in Somatic Studies, to contribute to knowledge concerning the human experience of embodiment with implications for health care.

To Whom It May Concern,
It has been brought to my attention that Senator Carr, speaking before the Australian Parliament on the morning of 22nd March 1999, has brought into question my qualifications to develop and guide a program in Consciousness Studies at Greenwich University. In reply, I wish to challenge this assertion. Certainly, my professional participation in the field of consciousness has been honored by my colleagues in academia, and as the following record of my achievements will demonstrate, I do have the curriculum vitae to support my appointment as Chair of the Consciousness Program at Greenwich University:
1952—Graduated from the New School for Social Research in New York City with a BA in Psychology.
1955—Graduated from City University of New York with an MA in Psychology.
1960-1965—Chief Psychologist, Kings Park State Hospital (position achieved by passing a special State examination regarding knowledge about mental illness)—a hospital run for mental patients by New York State.
1962—Licensed as a Clinical Psychologist by the New York State Department of Education.
1965 to Present—Private Practice in Clinical Psychology in New York.
1970 to 1978—Director of Mountaintop Farm in Livingston Manor, New York, privately owned and run successfully as a residential treatment center for mental patients, and continued maintaining a part-time private practice in New York City.
1972 to Present—Conducted workshops by invitation from privately owned psychotherapy centers in the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Canada, Egypt, Brazil; Lectured at conferences as an expert on a variety of aspects of consciousness in the United States (including the New York Academy of Sciences), Great Britain, 
 Portugal, Italy, Greece, Denmark, and Brazil; invited to India to lecture in 2000.
1962 to Present—Publication of over 60 articles in a variety of popular and professional magazines and peer-reviewed journals. Self-published ""The Unseen Universe: Of Mind and Matter"", a favorably received, profitable first-time venture.
1987—PhD degree in Psychology from The International Institute for Advanced Studies, currently Greenwich University.
Honors and Listings:
Who's Who in the East
Who's Who in Science and Technology
Who's Who in Medicine and Healthcare
Honorary Doctorate in Sciences (Honoris Causis) from the Open University for International Complementary Medicine, Sri Lanka, for Contributions to Science and Humanity.
Further, I wish to state that I understand how difficult it must be for uninformed people to believe that the mind is relevant to and has control over physical, no less mental, illness. Education, at least in the United States, has moved people's awareness from the dark ages of slavery to an imposed medical science to an enlightened understanding that health requires the aware participation of the person being healed. This point of view is based on a growing literature of validated scientific research by experimentalists in neuropsychology, and theoreticians in physics and biology, as well as in non-scientific reports from millions of recovered ill persons.
The program in Consciousness Studies is an invitation to the interested student to explore contemporary philosophic, psychologic and scientific literature on the subject of consciousness. This degree program provides the inquiring student with competent academic guides who can, through their own knowledge and experience, show the way to a professional approach to their careers. My professional history demonstrates that I have acquired an adequate level of knowledge and experience in my field to carry out my responsibilities more than competently.
Yours truly,

To Whom it May Concern
More than 30 years ago, Marshall McLuhan coined the phrase, ""Global Village"" in referring to the worldwide human community because of the 
 growing interdependence, rapid interchange of ideas and information, and the common need for planetary sustainability. Now at the threshold of the 21st Century, as you know, because of travel, television, satellites, computers and multinational corporations, a collective human awareness is rapidly developing. Greenwich University is respected as a higher education institutions because it can effectively address the emerging educational needs of this global community. For that reason, I am proud to be a member of the Greenwich University faculty.
In response to Senator Carr who, as an opponent to our accreditation in Australia, cited me as an example of questionable faculty credentials, thereby casting a shadow of doubt on the whole of the University, I wish to elaborate on my background. As a college student, I had the good fortune to study under a number of enlightened professors who steered me to study with great people such as Jacob Moreno, the founding father of Psychodrama; Salvador Minuchin, founder of the family therapy model; Jerzey Gratowski, the Polish Director of the Open Theatre; George Morrison, the first person to codify improvisational skills as a body of knowledge he called Theatre Games; Theo Gimbel, himself a student of Freud and friend of Carl Jung and as a graduate of the first Waldorf School in Germany, a student of Rudolph Steiner and the founder of Hygia Institute for Color, Light and Sound Therapy in England. Following their mentorship, I helped organise and found the Oregon Biofeedback Society in 1977, as a means of building and monitoring uniform standards for the emerging technology to monitor physical and psychological responses.
I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology from the State University of New York at New Paltz in 1971 and my Ph.D. in Family and Social Psychology from the Union Institute in 1993. From 1985 through 1996, I served as instructor and counsellor for the Mentat School. In private practice, I have served as a consultant to firms through the program, ""Spirituality in the Workplace"". I am currently Director of a theatre and music ensemble and author of a trilogy of plays entitled, ""Theatre as Medicine"". I have written and produced three compact discs of jazz stories and comedy and an interactive psycho-poetic workbook. I have also been facilitating a course called ""Towards a Council Of All Beings—A Global Perspective"" inspired by Australian Johanna Massey.
All of my career work has an intended therapeutic inclination and as you can determine from my more recent work and training, I am successfully contributing to the growth of the field of cultural psychology through development and leadership of projects and research in the field of Psychodrama. My work is effective as a healing art and well respected by my fellow academics and by com 
 munity workers within the localities where my work has an impact.
Any person wishing to contact me for further information should communicate with the Office of the President at Greenwich University.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
I have been made aware of the accusations made on the floor of the Australian Senate by Senator Carr with regard to the worthiness and appropriateness of a graduate program in the Science of Energy Medicine at Greenwich University. Perhaps the esteemed Senator from Australia does not know the scientific basis for all of Medical Science. Medicine in the last half of the twentieth century has emphasized the principles of biochemistry and the physical principles of surgery to assist in healing. Biochemistry is one aspect of life energy; electricity is the other. Every cellular function is both electrical and chemical at the same time. Neither can work alone. The field of Energy Medicine addresses this interface, exploring the dimensions of physiology, chemical and electrical activities, of life and the multiple influences of external and internal control of physiology, and therefore, of health and disease. Thus, all research done in support of graduate degrees in Energy Medicine must withstand rigorous scientific scrutiny and be of publishable quality, suitable for the scientific journals and of benefit to medical science.
Science recognizes as energy only the principles embodied in light and sound. However, in every culture throughout history there has been a constant that Life Energy, indeed cosmic or Divine Energy, may transcend our fourth dimensional concepts of light and sound, electricity and electromagnetism. Certainly bioenergy is widely discussed from a philosophical point of view. Energy Medicine considers the very broad field from Divine Energy and Spiritual Energy, as well as the most subtle effects of the electromagnetic realm. Robert Becker has considered bioenergy to be bioelectromagnetic to include all known and theoretical aspects of Life Energy. This obviously includes the mind and all influences upon the body, mind and emotions.
In the last 20 years, the field of psychoneuroimmunology has demonstrated many of the subtle effects of mind upon a wide variety of neurological, endocrinological, physiological and immunological functions. During this same time, the 
 concept of Holistic Medicine has evolved to include complementary, alternative, and Energy Medicine. It has now become quite clear that Energy Medicine will expand the science of psychoneuroimmunology, effectively contributing to one of the most important new fields in the past fifty years.
Students interested in Energy Medicine study the broad field of energy, learn practical and research applications of Energy Medicine, and focus intensely on one major subdivision of Energy Medicine. The broad fields include acupuncture, reflexology, kinesiology, homeopathy, color, sound and aroma therapy, psychospiritual aspects of healing, chakra energy centers, yoga, Tai Chi and physical exercise, biofeedback and autogenic training, self-regulation and relaxation, principles of nutrition and psychoneuroendorcine immunology, and intuition. The primary audience for the degrees in Energy Medicine will be the allied professionals, including all licensed and certified practitioners such as allopathic physicians, osteopathic physicians, chiropractors, nurses, physical therapists, psychologists and counselors, massage therapists, and spiritual healers.
During this last decade it has become increasingly obvious that scientific medicine with its emphasis upon drugs and surgery has failed to address spirituality, as well as the specific needs of individuals with chronic disease, which often do not respond adequately to drugs or surgery. Several surveys in the United States and one in Canada indicate that a significant percentage of patients in any given year seek therapy from alternative medical practitioners. Techniques that such individuals choose range from acupuncture to relaxation therapy, nutritional counseling and supplements, manipulative therapy, homeopathy and all of the other therapies that make up the complete field of Energy Medicine. There are no medical schools or other known clinical training programs that provide a foundation for those interested in practical applications of Energy Medicine. The post-graduate degrees in Energy Medicine are designed to fill that need.
The energy Medicine Program at Greenwich University provides the core competencies, skills and knowledge required of the mid-career professional. Functional skills developed enable students to understand and make use of techniques such as: acupuncture, kinesiology, homeopathy, and biofeedback, and spiritual healing, color, sound, aroma, psychospiritual and relaxation therapies, therapeutic physical exercise for general health, nutritional principles for diagnosis and therapy, postural effects upon health, application of modern electrotherapy, diagnostic and therapeutic application of medical intuition for the improvement of the quality of life, and clearing the blocks that interfere with vision, creativity and intuition. Greenwich graduates 
 will have the broad knowledge necessary to understand when specific tools should be applied, when referrals should be made to conventional physicians and practitioners, and they will have mastered one of the major fields of energy medicine in a way that they can apply it within their own profession.
I trust this discussion has clarified for you the importance of energy medicine as an essential field of study at the university level.

To the August Body of the Australian Senate
Regarding comments made by Senator Carr with regard to Greenwich University in general and Dr. Rick Walston in particular.
It is with deep disappointment that I note that the good Senator does not investigate into matters worthy of being presented to the Australian Senate I note with sadness that when he speaks of me, his only evidence is what he ""has been told by another,"" as he indicates. Did Senator Carr speak to me personally?  Did he communicate with me by phone, mail, fax, or email?  Did he investigate the level of academic quality that our school requires? No, no and no.
Without so much as checking to see if those things said were true, he stood before your great body and told you that I was the president of a degree mill. I would think that such a charge should be made only after careful investigation and the accumulation of corroborating evidence. Senator Carr did no such investigation nor gained any such ""evidence"": a charge that I shall prove later in this letter.
Presently, I shall point out one of our more recent doctoral graduates for evidence to the contrary: James R. White earned his Master of Theology  and Doctor of Theology  degrees from our school. Dr. White is the author of The King James Only Controversy  (which was his Master's thesis for his master's degree with our school) and The Forgotten Trinity  (which was his doctoral dissertation with our school). Dr. White's academic works with our school have been published by Bethany Publishing House, a national publisher, and his books (including at least four more than the two mentioned) are being used in other, accredited, schools as text books. Now I ask you, is it common for diploma mills to require such academic work that rises to the top of the publishing world and becomes text 
 books for other, fully accredited schools?  Obviously not.
And, then our most recent graduate is a woman named Elyn Schwartz. After transferring her credits to our school from other accredited universities, she had 32 credits remaining to earn her Bachelor of Religion with our school. She enrolled on May 25, 1995. She completed her 32 semester hours with our school on March 30, 1999. So, let me ask you another question, is it common for diploma mills to require such hard work as to lead a person through nearly four years of arduous study to complete 32 semester credits?  Obviously not.
Let me now shift to our faculty and mention that the idea that our school is a diploma mill would come as quite a shock to our faculty member R. Brinley Jones , the President of the National Library of Wales, and Chairman of the Cathedrals and Churches Commission of Wales, and who holds his D.Phil. from Oxford University, U.K. His honorary degrees include the D.Litt. from Potchefstroom University, South Africa. And, it would also come as a shock to these other distinguished faculty members:
Samuel G. Andreasen, Ed.D.  from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ
Rodney J. Crowell, D.Min.  from Dallas Theological Seminary, Dallas, TX.
Larry V. Crutchfield, Ph.D.  from Drew University, Madison, NJ.
Carl Judson Davis, Ph.D.  from the University of Sheffield U.K.
Richard Brian Davis, Ph.D.  from the University of Toronto.
Oliver Rice, Ph.D.  from Trinity Theological College, Bristol, England.
Joel Berry Robertson, Ph.D.  from the University of California, Los Angeles, CA.
I could go on but, let me ask, is it normal for degree mills to employ such fine academicians as faculty? Again, obviously not.
Let me point out the quality of recommendations that our school has gotten. Obviously Mr. Carr has his source, and I happen to know who is source is, and I also happen to know that his source is in the minority when it comes to issues academic. However, Dr. John Bear is the undisputed expert in non-traditional education. Dr. Bear's guide on distance learning education (Bears' Guide to Earning College Degrees Non-traditionally)  has sold more than 300,000 copies. He also served as the  diploma mill consultant to the FBI from 1979 to 1992. When the FBI brought diploma mill operators to justice in Federal Court, Dr. Bear appeared as the expert witness for the FBl. He has also worked with or been on the news shows 60Minutes, 20/20, 
 American Journal, and Inside Edition  helping them in their efforts to expose diploma mills.
With that background, please read the letter of recommendation that Dr. Bear wrote for placement on our web page:
To whom it may concern:
My books on non-traditional higher education have sold more than 300,000 copies, and are widely regarded as the standard reference works in this field. For more than twenty years, I have been researching and writing about degree granting institutions, both accredited and unaccredited.
Some people argue, in effect, that if a school is not accredited, then it is a degree mill. This is nonsense. For one thing, every school is unaccredited when it begins. For another thing, there are schools which, by their very nature, are academically sound, legitimately and sincerely run, appropriately licensed, but unlikely ever to gain ""traditional"" accreditation because of the innovative or experimental or non-traditional nature of their programs. Some such schools succumb to the lure of the many unrecognised (and thus useless) accrediting associations (some of which will accredit anyone who pays the fee), and, thankfully, some like Columbia Evangelical Seminary do not succumb.
In evaluating an unaccredited school, the two crucial questions that must be asked are these: who are the people behind it (and what are their credentials), and what is the quality of work being asked of, and done by, the students. On both of these criteria, in my opinion, Columbia Evangelical Seminary looks good. Fortunately, this is something that can be independently verified. Look at the credentials of Dr. Walston and his colleagues. And look at the work of the students. If this is done fairly, I think most people would agree that Columbia Evangelical Seminary is true to its mission statement, and offers its students both an education and a credential of which they can be justly proud.
- John B. Bear, Ph.D. (Michigan State University, 1966).
Oh, by the way, it might also be of special interest  to you that Dr. Bear is a contributor to the guide Country Education Profiles  of the Australian National Office on Overseas Skills (NOOSR). Dr. John Bear wrote 15 of those 87 profiles, including the United States profile.
Yes, it is beginning to appear that the one who has ""sneaked up on unsuspecting people"" is Senator Carr. All of the information that I have given you above is public record.
Now concerning me in particular, Senator Carr notes that my Ph.D. comes from Greenwich University. This is true. I earned my Ph.D. with Greenwich University under the mentorship of 
 Stanley M. Horton, Th.D., renowned Assemblies of God theologian and author of about thirteen books. However, what Mr. Carr failed to mention is that I also hold a Bachelor of Arts  degree, a Master of Religion  degree, and a Doctor of Ministry  degree all from accredited  institutions here in America. Also, I am presently a Ph.D. student with Potchefstroom University of South Africa (a significant school founded in 1896).
My last point is to prove my charge above that "" Senator Carr did no such investigation nor gained any such `evidence.'""
How can I possibly prove that Mr. Carr simply repeated information ""told"" to him and that he did not investigate the charges himself? Simple: the name of our school has not been Faraston Theological Seminary for well over a year. For more than one full year, on all of our literature, on our web site, and in our advertisements, the name of our school has been Columbia Evangelical Seminary (Faraston being our former name). A very simple phone call to this office would have turned up such ""deeply hidden"" information. A quick stop at our world wide web page would have yielded this obvious information. If Mr. Carr had taken the time within the last 15 months to contact me, or even one of our faculty members, or just one of our students, he would have known better than to refer to our old, out-of-date name.
In conclusion, I cannot vouch for any other person that Mr. Carr so demonises in his speech; however, if he did comparable ""research"" on the others he mentioned, then I would certainly caution anyone from simply accepting his charges at face value.
Thank you for this opportunity to respond.
Sincerely,

SOME RESPONSES TO SENATOR CARR
Greenwich University adopted the name Greenwich in 1989 as it desired a shorter name which was unique and had not been used before. Nearly 4 years later (when Greenwich University and its School of Theology had achieved a high level of recognition in  the United Kingdom) the Thames Polytechnic in Woolwich petitioned the Privy Council to allow itself to be known as Greenwich University. It was refused as there was already a respected Greenwich University (albeit American). It was allowed to rename itself as the University of Greenwich to avoid confusion with the established Greenwich University.
Greenwich was established in 1972 and was originally known as the International Institute for 
 Advanced Studies. Since its founding the name International Institute has been adopted in various guises by a number of schools around the world.
The International Institute for Advanced Studies still exists as a division of Greenwich and is still in good standing in the State of Missouri. Its headquarters are now on Norfolk Island.
The State of Missouri does not accredit schools or universities (including its own state university).
The State of Hawaii does not accredit schools or universities (including its own state university).
Accreditation in the U.S.A. is quite different from that in Australia. In the U.S. accreditation is a voluntary process undertaken after a university has been operating and awarding degrees for a number of years. It enables universities to receive federal funding. Greenwich does not receive government funding: it never has; it never will: it would return it if it was ever sent. Greenwich has been properly established in the U.S.A. since 1972. It has an excellent reputation.
There has never been any irregularity in any state or country.
It is no more a mail order school than the Australian National University in Canberra (which sent a Postgraduate Diploma in Law in the mail to the Chancellor of Greenwich University last year) or the University of Melbourne which also mails out degrees. (Both of these, like Greenwich, require that the students complete the course requirements beforehand.)
Greenwich has not been refused, nor did it apply, in Victoria. It has had a representative office in Victoria since 1990. Its registration was renewed for a further three years by the Victorian Government earlier this year.
Prior to the Greenwich University Act being passed the university requested both the Higher Education Division of DEETYA and the AQF (MCEETYA) if its courses  and curriculum could be submitted for evaluation and accreditation so it could have an external and independent assessment of its programmes. It was told quite clearly and firmly that the AQF and MCEETYA did not accredit courses or universities, and that the other universities resisted any form of external accreditation.
(These facts are known by Senator Carr, who has been supplied with documentation to that effect and  whose own electorate office is nearby to the AQF and MCEETYA).  Greenwich was told by DEETYA and the AQF that it would be self-accrediting and that there was no procedure for it to have its courses evaluated by the AQF or anyone else.
The Chancellor received all his degrees at accredited or state approved universities.  He has never met a Shoshone Indian. The American schools from 
 which he graduated were in California and Pennsylvania—not Nevada.
Its legislative establishment by way of a company and subsequent legislation is the same process as that used by Bond University. The Greenwich University Act is similar to that establishing Bond and Notre Dame.
There is no Brimeyer organization.
Prince Alexis (who died in January 1995) was the hereditary Head of the House of Anjou. He was a client of the Chancellor (a barrister at law) who acted for Prince Alexis and his family for a number of years.
The Chancellor is not an academic (although he has done some teaching many years ago, and has teaching qualifications including being a registered teacher in the State of Victoria).  He does not teach nor instruct nor write curriculum at Greenwich University.  He does not run Greenwich University.  Greenwich is a community of scholars run by the President, the Vice-President, the deans, the faculty and the graduates. The Chancellors position is an honorary one, and always has been. (Though one must say that if the Labour Opposition continues to use parliamentary privilege to defame in a cowardly and deceitful fashion university chancellors there will be very few people willing to accept such roles.)
If Senator Carr really believes what he said under parliamentary privilege then he should repeat his statements outside the Senate and in a public forum. This would then allow the university, its staff, its faculty, its students and its graduates take both individual and collective legal action in the courts of Australia, the United States of America and in the other countries of the world where the university  community is situated.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I present the 77th report of the Committee of Privileges entitled Persons referred to in the Senate: certain faculty members of Greenwich University .
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the report be adopted.
This report is the 27th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identi 
 fied, in the Senate. On 27 May 1999 the President received a letter from Ms S. Quantrill, Registrar, Greenwich University, forwarding letters from certain faculty members of Greenwich University relating to remarks made by Senator Kim Carr during the adjournment debate of 22 March 1999. The President referred the letters to the committee as submissions under privilege resolution No. 5. The committee considered the submissions, together with a further submission received subsequently on 24 June 1999. It now recommends that they be incorporated in Hansard .
As the committee always reminds the Senate, in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or persons. Rather, it ensures that these persons' submissions, and ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution No. 5. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,31,2,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-06-28,"—The Privileges Committee has tabled this afternoon a series of statements which I have only just had a chance to glance over. They are, of course, matters that have been canvassed on other occasions in this chamber, although the letters themselves have never actually been given to me to allow a proper consideration of the content. I thank Senator Ray for his tabling of this report on behalf of the Privileges Committee. I think the committee has done the Senate a great service in that it does allow for an examination of the claims being made by a number of persons associated with the staffing of Greenwich University, one of Australia's newest universities, which we would all be aware was legally established by the Legislative Council of Norfolk Island. I think it is an important opportunity for us to examine these details, and I will endeavour to do so with greater consideration later on. Like Senator Ray, I am not in the business of perniciously or gratuitously insulting people—
—Like me.
—Like Senator Ray, I am of that view. I think the privileges of the parliament ought to be protected to allow the elected representatives of this country to speak about matters and to identify mistakes 
 that have been made by government. I think it is important that these conventions be maintained so as to allow us to exercise our responsibilities.
I have raised a number of concerns about the incompetence of this government in allowing a dodgy operation like this at Greenwich to ever get off the ground. I am particularly concerned, as are a number of other people in this country. I note, for instance, a letter I received from Mr Phil Honeywood, the Minister for Tertiary Education and Training in Victoria, who said:
As you have correctly pointed out, I have been very concerned about the lack of rigorous processes of review comparable to those carried out by the States, before the recognition of Greenwich University was given by the Parliament of Norfolk Island.
I have been campaigning to expose what are quite clearly ludicrous mistakes made by this government and made through the incredible ignorance of the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government in his abysmal handling of his portfolio. I have been particularly concerned to expose attempts by a group of shysters to circumvent the regulatory framework that exists in Australia to protect our fourth largest export industry. The education industry is entirely dependent on the maintenance of our good name and the quality of Australian education.
Many people in this country are of the view that we do have a high quality education system. It is a view which I certainly support. We need to monitor that. We need to take all necessary measures to protect it. Australia is very vulnerable to the activities of a few people, given that we now have an industry worth some $3.1 billion. Australian citizens have a right to expect exactly the same level of support that US governments—state and federal—offer their citizens insofar as their concerns have been expressed. The Californian state authorities recently indicated that diploma mills manufacturing degrees based on the ability to write a cheque rather than master a curriculum will no longer be allowed to continue. That statement was put to us as a result of questions that I raised concerning these particular matters and relating to issues associated with some of the individuals who have been named.
The establishment of Greenwich University under Australian legislation, courtesy of the Norfolk Island parliament, has been greeted with widespread dismay and disbelief throughout the higher education world. International cyberspace has resounded with jokes about the way in which Australia has endured one of the biggest bureaucratic bungles in recent decades, not to mention the gullibility of the good citizens of Norfolk Island and of our own federal minister for territories and his department. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs is also implicated in this affair.
I raised these matters in the chamber back in March. Since that time, a number of others have also raised concerns, including vice-chancellors and state ministers for education. As a consequence, this government has been obliged to establish an inquiry into this fiasco. It has been forced to inquire into the bona fides of this institution—an institution which has not been accredited in the United States and which has made numerous attempts to get into Australia through a number of backdoor means. It has finally used the venue of Norfolk Island to achieve its objective.
It is an American import, an American interloper. It is a clear example of the great diversity in the higher education system in the United States. For example, America has some of the finest universities in the world, but it also has what might best be described as degree mills or vanity universities. However, in Australia there is a wide-ranging understanding that Australia produces top quality education. In Australia in recent times there has been a series of non-traditional areas of learning. I do not think it is appropriate that we should in any way prevent the development of non-traditional areas of learning; however, we need to ensure that quality is protected.
American society has a much broader understanding of what quality means. For instance, a whole lot of new ideas are uncritically accepted in the United States. There is a huge range of beliefs and ideas which we might not regard as being founded on empirical research or rigorous intellectual data. America might be the land of the free but it 
 is also the land of Waco and the tragic Branch Davidian cult. America is a land where an astonishing 40 per cent of undergraduate science students believe in creationism, not evolution. They believe that the world was created only a few thousand years ago and they believe that `false' evidence, such as dinosaurs and fossils, was placed there as a trick by Satan. Some 15 per cent of Americans believe they have personally been abducted by aliens.
The academics who provided information to the committee were concerned that I did not know the full facts. Maybe I should examine some of the full facts. For instance, I see in this report of the Committee of Privileges—which I have only just seen—that a Mr Lindgren said:
Senator Carr also felt obliged to make a derogative remark regarding an Orthodox Order to which I belong. This order in fact possesses members of the Romanoff family, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia and is protected (patron) by His Holiness Alexy II, Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. Regarding this I think it was best summed up by a member of the Romanov family, who recently, stated: ""I have never been attacked by a member of my own Class"" . . . Enough said?
What an extraordinary defence! He continues:
Mr. Carr, once again true to his intent ignored my association in the Brotherhood of the Blessed Gerard which is a service branch of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (Catholic) and my internationally recognised Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Ignatius of Antioch (under His Beatitude Patriarch Mar Ignace Anthony II Hayeck, Uniate-Syrian Catholic Patriarch of Antioch).
Of course I did not go to all the detail. Perhaps I should have. Another example is the case of somatic studies. A Ms Mertz says:
. . . Somatic Studies is offered to bodywork and massage therapy professionals whose intention it is to enhance the profession of touch therapies through conducting research.
We can imagine the touch therapies these people are involved in! Ms Mertz continues:
A distance learning program offers these students the flexibility to integrate a variety of resources from various universities and educational institutions.
I look forward to seeing the detail of their touch therapies. Another case is energy medicine. In his letter, a Mr Shealy says:
Functional skills developed enable students to understand and make use of techniques such as: acupuncture, kinesiology, homeopathy, and biofeedback, and spiritual healing, colour, sound, aroma, psychospiritual and relaxation therapies, therapeutic physical exercise for general health, nutritional principles for diagnosis and therapy, postural effects upon health—
—Sounds like one of the Democrats has got a new job!
—Indeed! The letter continues:
. . . application of modern electrotherapy, diagnostic and therapeutic applications of medical intuition—
I wonder what the Australian Medical Association would say about that—
for the improvement of the quality of life, and clearing the blocks that interfere with vision, creativity and intuition.
What an extraordinary body of knowledge for us to be expected to accept without question. That is not the way in which Australian universities have traditionally behaved. It would be appropriate to ask questions about whether or not the post facto acceptance of this university by an incompetent and foolish minister who is behaving like a buffoon ought not be questioned. I have done so. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.
In accordance with the resolution of the committee, the submissions are incorporated in Hansard.

To whom this may concern:
I read the minutes from Australia's senate meeting on March 22nd 1999, and I have a few reactions. First, I must thank Senator Carr for indulging so brilliantly in insults, for this frees me to be rather direct myself. Though I don t think I'll be needing words such as shysters' to be effective.
By snickering at the concepts of Alchemy or analysis of Fairytale, Senator Carr is advertising his ignorance of a whole field of psychology, namely depth Psychology. So though Carl Jung does not need defending, Senator Carr needs informing. 

The work of Carl Jung (a Swiss Psychiatrist, 1875-1961) consists of a 20 volume collection of his research spreading well over 50 years (1902-1960), and continued since then by scholars all over the world. This research includes the translation of Old Greek, Arabic and later European texts of alchemy, fairytales and mythology dug up from the dung heap of the past. Jung carried out a comparison of the behavioural patterns revealed in these texts with those found in contemporary mythology and shamanic traditions (he travelled to India, Africa and visited native American nations to meet with medicine people in person), as well as contemporary themes in literature, art, and films, as well as in the dreams of his psychiatric patients.
Secondly, his findings made Carl Jung the father of concepts such as Extroversion/Introversion, the Collective Unconscious, and archetypal forces behind behaviour. The Collected Works have been translated in at least seven languages. He is being studied in Europe, England, the United States, Canada. South Africa, South America, and is certainly known by several Australian authors.
Originally, Jung Institutes across Europe and the USA were strictly postdoctoral programs. Since the 1980's, more universities became interested in making available a course of study that, up to this point, was very elitist and hardly accessible to anyone who was not considered ""analytical material"". There are now Jung Institutes in every major cities of the United States, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, and they also include programs for the layman. Some universities have devoted entire programs to the study and application as well as augmentation of Jung's thought. The best known such university if the Pacifica Institute in California, an accredited university which holds the library of Joseph Campbell's original works.
Anyone who has information about Carl Jung's work knows that, rather than ""doctrinal"", it is open and expansive, and subject to continuing deeper exploration. In fact its great beauty resides in the fact that it identified patterns of behaviour seated deep in the unconscious that are common to all people. This offers academics new tools with which to study human behaviour across time and cultures. Jung's findings reveal the existence of timeless interpretations of reality that are surprisingly close to contemporary quantum mechanics' or new physics' discoveries. In that sense Jung was at the vanguard of a movement towards greater unity in the world, a braking of ethnocentric barriers that are at the source of most wars, and a tool for communication among humans that bypasses local cultural boundaries. It is sad to see that, once again, an effort to apply these ideas by a brave new world (in this case, a Hawaiian university joining with an Australian university) is being attacked by outdated ethnocentric provincialism. 

In any case, I hope that this information will be useful in warning Senator Carr that, next time he plans to endeavour in the smashing of an entire body of academic studies, he better do his homework first, for surely he didn't intend to demonstrate his ignorance to the whole world.
Sincerely,

Dear Sirs:
Let me say that I am honoured that Senator Carr would have so little to do as to reflect on my name and my achievements. I fear, however, that the Senator was either ignorant or perhaps selective in his remarks toward me. I felt that rather than ignore his remarks as being those of at best a misinformed individual I should address his comments not in the ignoble manner in which they were stated but as an educator, scholar and gentlemen.
Senator Carr in referring to my masters felt obliged to ignore my BAE, Med, and EdS from the University of Mississippi ""The University is a centre for Faulkner studies, offering one of the finest collections of the Nobel Prize winners work and maintaining his Rowan Oak home as a literary shrine. The	 Medical Centre surgeons performed the world's first lung (1963) and heart (1964) transplants in man, and its physiologists defined the role of the kidneys in controlling blood pressure. Medical Centre faculty also have constructed the world's most comprehensive computer model of the body, and the campus has been selected as one of five national sites to test GE's new twin magnet MRT (magnetic resonance therapy). Today, faculty, staff, and students are pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge, imagination, and expertise necessary for a productive life in an increasingly complex society and competitive world. They play a significant role in the country's research efforts through federally funded facilities on the Oxford campus such as the Jamie Whitten National Centre for Physical Acoustics, the National Centre for the Development of Natural Products, the National Food Service Management Institute, the Marine Minerals Technology Centre, the Centre for Water and Wetlands Resources, and the Centre for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering.
The University also plays a crucial role in Mississippi by preparing students for leadership in the state and nation. Distinguished law school alumni include nine governors, seven lieutenant 
 governors, 29 Mississippi Supreme Court justices, 12 U.S. representatives, and four U.S. senators.
Senator Carr also felt it necessary to ignore my FCP (eg. MPhil) from the world famous College of Preceptors in Essex, England and my soon to be completed (June 1999) DEd from UNISA in Pretoria.
While denouncing some of the societies to which I am proudly associated, Mr. Carr once again showed his true intent by not mentioning the Royal Historical Society (London), American Academy of Religion, Medieval Academy of America, and Orders and Medals Society of America. He also selectively ignored my fellowship in the Royal Society of Arts, Royal Asiatic Society and College of Preceptors.
Senator Carr also felt obliged to make a derogative remark regarding an Orthodox Order to which I belong. This order in fact possesses members of the Romanoff family, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia and is protected (patron) by His Holiness Alexy II, Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia.
Regarding this I think it was best summed up by a member of the Romanov family, who recently, stated: "" I have never been attacked by a member of my own Class"". . . Enough said?
Mr. Carr, once again true to his intent ignored my association in the Brotherhood of the Blessed Gerard which is a service branch of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (Catholic) and my internationally recognised Knight Commander from the Order of Saint Ignatius of Antioch (under His Beatitude Patriarch Mar Ignace Anthony II Hayeck, Uniate-Syrian Catholic Patriarch of Antioch). The Vatican also recognises this order. Finally in passing, I feel it necessary to provide once again insight into Senator Carr's lack of knowledge concerning myself or my achievements. He felt it necessary to mention the Order of the King's Daughters and Sons that I believe he must have through ignorance felt was a fake chivalric order. If he had only taken 5 minutes to either look the order up on the Internet or in some reference he would have discovered that ""The King's Daughters and Sons was founded on January 13, 1886 by Margaret Bottome of New York City, with a membership of ten women. It is a unit of interdenominational Christians dedicated to the development of spiritual life and the stimulation of Christian activities. Through a three-fold program of religion, education, and philanthropy, the organisation trains its members as well as others for Christian Service. Today, its thirty nine branches throughout the United States and Canada support ministries for the aging, handicapped and the underprivileged. The Order has an Indian department that encourages contributions to Native Americans, supports leprosy research, and contributes to American and Foreign Bible Societies. It 
 owns and operates three houses at the Chautauqua Institution in New York and provides scholarships for over forty students for summer courses there."" The society makes NO claims to being chivalric.
Shame, Mr. Carr, why don't you get on with running the government rather than talking about things you know nothing about. . . .

To Whom It May Concern:
It has come to my attention that Senator Carr has voiced uncompromising criticism of Greenwich University's graduate programs on the floor of the Australian Senate. His critique included the program in Somatic Studies. As the lead faculty for this program, I am writing to clarify its importance.
Greenwich University's program in Somatic Studies is offered to bodywork and massage therapy professionals whose intention it is to enhance the professionalisation of touch therapies through conducting research. A distance learning program offers these students the flexibility to integrate a variety of resources from various universities and educational institutions.
Regarding massage therapy, the 1993 Harvard report, ""Unconventional Medicine in the United States: Prevalence, Costs, and Patterns of Use,"" published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that possibly 12.6 million Americans used massage therapy in 1990 making 77 million visits to massage therapists. This survey has allowed the US medical establishment to become aware that massage therapy is a burgeoning health care field. As a licensed massage therapist myself, I am committed to supporting the maturation of the profession. I am a member of the Commission on Massage Training Accreditation and the editorial advisory board for the Massage Therapy Journal, published by the American Massage Therapy Association. I have been closely following developments in research, legislation, and health care policy concerning touch therapies.
Somatic Studies is a graduate degree title that has been established for programs that focus on embodiment, that is, the relationships between the body and cognition, emotion, and other dimensions of the self, exploring the body in relationship to an individual's undivided experience. It is entirely appropriate for practitioners of touch therapy modalities, whether therapeutic massage, Rolfing, 
 or the Feldenkrais Technique, to earn degrees in Somatic Studies, to contribute to knowledge concerning the human experience of embodiment with implications for health care.

To Whom It May Concern,
It has been brought to my attention that Senator Carr, speaking before the Australian Parliament on the morning of 22nd March 1999, has brought into question my qualifications to develop and guide a program in Consciousness Studies at Greenwich University. In reply, I wish to challenge this assertion. Certainly, my professional participation in the field of consciousness has been honored by my colleagues in academia, and as the following record of my achievements will demonstrate, I do have the curriculum vitae to support my appointment as Chair of the Consciousness Program at Greenwich University:
1952—Graduated from the New School for Social Research in New York City with a BA in Psychology.
1955—Graduated from City University of New York with an MA in Psychology.
1960-1965—Chief Psychologist, Kings Park State Hospital (position achieved by passing a special State examination regarding knowledge about mental illness)—a hospital run for mental patients by New York State.
1962—Licensed as a Clinical Psychologist by the New York State Department of Education.
1965 to Present—Private Practice in Clinical Psychology in New York.
1970 to 1978—Director of Mountaintop Farm in Livingston Manor, New York, privately owned and run successfully as a residential treatment center for mental patients, and continued maintaining a part-time private practice in New York City.
1972 to Present—Conducted workshops by invitation from privately owned psychotherapy centers in the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Canada, Egypt, Brazil; Lectured at conferences as an expert on a variety of aspects of consciousness in the United States (including the New York Academy of Sciences), Great Britain, 
 Portugal, Italy, Greece, Denmark, and Brazil; invited to India to lecture in 2000.
1962 to Present—Publication of over 60 articles in a variety of popular and professional magazines and peer-reviewed journals. Self-published ""The Unseen Universe: Of Mind and Matter"", a favorably received, profitable first-time venture.
1987—PhD degree in Psychology from The International Institute for Advanced Studies, currently Greenwich University.
Honors and Listings:
Who's Who in the East
Who's Who in Science and Technology
Who's Who in Medicine and Healthcare
Honorary Doctorate in Sciences (Honoris Causis) from the Open University for International Complementary Medicine, Sri Lanka, for Contributions to Science and Humanity.
Further, I wish to state that I understand how difficult it must be for uninformed people to believe that the mind is relevant to and has control over physical, no less mental, illness. Education, at least in the United States, has moved people's awareness from the dark ages of slavery to an imposed medical science to an enlightened understanding that health requires the aware participation of the person being healed. This point of view is based on a growing literature of validated scientific research by experimentalists in neuropsychology, and theoreticians in physics and biology, as well as in non-scientific reports from millions of recovered ill persons.
The program in Consciousness Studies is an invitation to the interested student to explore contemporary philosophic, psychologic and scientific literature on the subject of consciousness. This degree program provides the inquiring student with competent academic guides who can, through their own knowledge and experience, show the way to a professional approach to their careers. My professional history demonstrates that I have acquired an adequate level of knowledge and experience in my field to carry out my responsibilities more than competently.
Yours truly,

To Whom it May Concern
More than 30 years ago, Marshall McLuhan coined the phrase, ""Global Village"" in referring to the worldwide human community because of the 
 growing interdependence, rapid interchange of ideas and information, and the common need for planetary sustainability. Now at the threshold of the 21st Century, as you know, because of travel, television, satellites, computers and multinational corporations, a collective human awareness is rapidly developing. Greenwich University is respected as a higher education institutions because it can effectively address the emerging educational needs of this global community. For that reason, I am proud to be a member of the Greenwich University faculty.
In response to Senator Carr who, as an opponent to our accreditation in Australia, cited me as an example of questionable faculty credentials, thereby casting a shadow of doubt on the whole of the University, I wish to elaborate on my background. As a college student, I had the good fortune to study under a number of enlightened professors who steered me to study with great people such as Jacob Moreno, the founding father of Psychodrama; Salvador Minuchin, founder of the family therapy model; Jerzey Gratowski, the Polish Director of the Open Theatre; George Morrison, the first person to codify improvisational skills as a body of knowledge he called Theatre Games; Theo Gimbel, himself a student of Freud and friend of Carl Jung and as a graduate of the first Waldorf School in Germany, a student of Rudolph Steiner and the founder of Hygia Institute for Color, Light and Sound Therapy in England. Following their mentorship, I helped organise and found the Oregon Biofeedback Society in 1977, as a means of building and monitoring uniform standards for the emerging technology to monitor physical and psychological responses.
I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology from the State University of New York at New Paltz in 1971 and my Ph.D. in Family and Social Psychology from the Union Institute in 1993. From 1985 through 1996, I served as instructor and counsellor for the Mentat School. In private practice, I have served as a consultant to firms through the program, ""Spirituality in the Workplace"". I am currently Director of a theatre and music ensemble and author of a trilogy of plays entitled, ""Theatre as Medicine"". I have written and produced three compact discs of jazz stories and comedy and an interactive psycho-poetic workbook. I have also been facilitating a course called ""Towards a Council Of All Beings—A Global Perspective"" inspired by Australian Johanna Massey.
All of my career work has an intended therapeutic inclination and as you can determine from my more recent work and training, I am successfully contributing to the growth of the field of cultural psychology through development and leadership of projects and research in the field of Psychodrama. My work is effective as a healing art and well respected by my fellow academics and by com 
 munity workers within the localities where my work has an impact.
Any person wishing to contact me for further information should communicate with the Office of the President at Greenwich University.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
I have been made aware of the accusations made on the floor of the Australian Senate by Senator Carr with regard to the worthiness and appropriateness of a graduate program in the Science of Energy Medicine at Greenwich University. Perhaps the esteemed Senator from Australia does not know the scientific basis for all of Medical Science. Medicine in the last half of the twentieth century has emphasized the principles of biochemistry and the physical principles of surgery to assist in healing. Biochemistry is one aspect of life energy; electricity is the other. Every cellular function is both electrical and chemical at the same time. Neither can work alone. The field of Energy Medicine addresses this interface, exploring the dimensions of physiology, chemical and electrical activities, of life and the multiple influences of external and internal control of physiology, and therefore, of health and disease. Thus, all research done in support of graduate degrees in Energy Medicine must withstand rigorous scientific scrutiny and be of publishable quality, suitable for the scientific journals and of benefit to medical science.
Science recognizes as energy only the principles embodied in light and sound. However, in every culture throughout history there has been a constant that Life Energy, indeed cosmic or Divine Energy, may transcend our fourth dimensional concepts of light and sound, electricity and electromagnetism. Certainly bioenergy is widely discussed from a philosophical point of view. Energy Medicine considers the very broad field from Divine Energy and Spiritual Energy, as well as the most subtle effects of the electromagnetic realm. Robert Becker has considered bioenergy to be bioelectromagnetic to include all known and theoretical aspects of Life Energy. This obviously includes the mind and all influences upon the body, mind and emotions.
In the last 20 years, the field of psychoneuroimmunology has demonstrated many of the subtle effects of mind upon a wide variety of neurological, endocrinological, physiological and immunological functions. During this same time, the 
 concept of Holistic Medicine has evolved to include complementary, alternative, and Energy Medicine. It has now become quite clear that Energy Medicine will expand the science of psychoneuroimmunology, effectively contributing to one of the most important new fields in the past fifty years.
Students interested in Energy Medicine study the broad field of energy, learn practical and research applications of Energy Medicine, and focus intensely on one major subdivision of Energy Medicine. The broad fields include acupuncture, reflexology, kinesiology, homeopathy, color, sound and aroma therapy, psychospiritual aspects of healing, chakra energy centers, yoga, Tai Chi and physical exercise, biofeedback and autogenic training, self-regulation and relaxation, principles of nutrition and psychoneuroendorcine immunology, and intuition. The primary audience for the degrees in Energy Medicine will be the allied professionals, including all licensed and certified practitioners such as allopathic physicians, osteopathic physicians, chiropractors, nurses, physical therapists, psychologists and counselors, massage therapists, and spiritual healers.
During this last decade it has become increasingly obvious that scientific medicine with its emphasis upon drugs and surgery has failed to address spirituality, as well as the specific needs of individuals with chronic disease, which often do not respond adequately to drugs or surgery. Several surveys in the United States and one in Canada indicate that a significant percentage of patients in any given year seek therapy from alternative medical practitioners. Techniques that such individuals choose range from acupuncture to relaxation therapy, nutritional counseling and supplements, manipulative therapy, homeopathy and all of the other therapies that make up the complete field of Energy Medicine. There are no medical schools or other known clinical training programs that provide a foundation for those interested in practical applications of Energy Medicine. The post-graduate degrees in Energy Medicine are designed to fill that need.
The energy Medicine Program at Greenwich University provides the core competencies, skills and knowledge required of the mid-career professional. Functional skills developed enable students to understand and make use of techniques such as: acupuncture, kinesiology, homeopathy, and biofeedback, and spiritual healing, color, sound, aroma, psychospiritual and relaxation therapies, therapeutic physical exercise for general health, nutritional principles for diagnosis and therapy, postural effects upon health, application of modern electrotherapy, diagnostic and therapeutic application of medical intuition for the improvement of the quality of life, and clearing the blocks that interfere with vision, creativity and intuition. Greenwich graduates 
 will have the broad knowledge necessary to understand when specific tools should be applied, when referrals should be made to conventional physicians and practitioners, and they will have mastered one of the major fields of energy medicine in a way that they can apply it within their own profession.
I trust this discussion has clarified for you the importance of energy medicine as an essential field of study at the university level.

To the August Body of the Australian Senate
Regarding comments made by Senator Carr with regard to Greenwich University in general and Dr. Rick Walston in particular.
It is with deep disappointment that I note that the good Senator does not investigate into matters worthy of being presented to the Australian Senate I note with sadness that when he speaks of me, his only evidence is what he ""has been told by another,"" as he indicates. Did Senator Carr speak to me personally?  Did he communicate with me by phone, mail, fax, or email?  Did he investigate the level of academic quality that our school requires? No, no and no.
Without so much as checking to see if those things said were true, he stood before your great body and told you that I was the president of a degree mill. I would think that such a charge should be made only after careful investigation and the accumulation of corroborating evidence. Senator Carr did no such investigation nor gained any such ""evidence"": a charge that I shall prove later in this letter.
Presently, I shall point out one of our more recent doctoral graduates for evidence to the contrary: James R. White earned his Master of Theology  and Doctor of Theology  degrees from our school. Dr. White is the author of The King James Only Controversy  (which was his Master's thesis for his master's degree with our school) and The Forgotten Trinity  (which was his doctoral dissertation with our school). Dr. White's academic works with our school have been published by Bethany Publishing House, a national publisher, and his books (including at least four more than the two mentioned) are being used in other, accredited, schools as text books. Now I ask you, is it common for diploma mills to require such academic work that rises to the top of the publishing world and becomes text 
 books for other, fully accredited schools?  Obviously not.
And, then our most recent graduate is a woman named Elyn Schwartz. After transferring her credits to our school from other accredited universities, she had 32 credits remaining to earn her Bachelor of Religion with our school. She enrolled on May 25, 1995. She completed her 32 semester hours with our school on March 30, 1999. So, let me ask you another question, is it common for diploma mills to require such hard work as to lead a person through nearly four years of arduous study to complete 32 semester credits?  Obviously not.
Let me now shift to our faculty and mention that the idea that our school is a diploma mill would come as quite a shock to our faculty member R. Brinley Jones , the President of the National Library of Wales, and Chairman of the Cathedrals and Churches Commission of Wales, and who holds his D.Phil. from Oxford University, U.K. His honorary degrees include the D.Litt. from Potchefstroom University, South Africa. And, it would also come as a shock to these other distinguished faculty members:
Samuel G. Andreasen, Ed.D.  from Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ
Rodney J. Crowell, D.Min.  from Dallas Theological Seminary, Dallas, TX.
Larry V. Crutchfield, Ph.D.  from Drew University, Madison, NJ.
Carl Judson Davis, Ph.D.  from the University of Sheffield U.K.
Richard Brian Davis, Ph.D.  from the University of Toronto.
Oliver Rice, Ph.D.  from Trinity Theological College, Bristol, England.
Joel Berry Robertson, Ph.D.  from the University of California, Los Angeles, CA.
I could go on but, let me ask, is it normal for degree mills to employ such fine academicians as faculty? Again, obviously not.
Let me point out the quality of recommendations that our school has gotten. Obviously Mr. Carr has his source, and I happen to know who is source is, and I also happen to know that his source is in the minority when it comes to issues academic. However, Dr. John Bear is the undisputed expert in non-traditional education. Dr. Bear's guide on distance learning education (Bears' Guide to Earning College Degrees Non-traditionally)  has sold more than 300,000 copies. He also served as the  diploma mill consultant to the FBI from 1979 to 1992. When the FBI brought diploma mill operators to justice in Federal Court, Dr. Bear appeared as the expert witness for the FBl. He has also worked with or been on the news shows 60Minutes, 20/20, 
 American Journal, and Inside Edition  helping them in their efforts to expose diploma mills.
With that background, please read the letter of recommendation that Dr. Bear wrote for placement on our web page:
To whom it may concern:
My books on non-traditional higher education have sold more than 300,000 copies, and are widely regarded as the standard reference works in this field. For more than twenty years, I have been researching and writing about degree granting institutions, both accredited and unaccredited.
Some people argue, in effect, that if a school is not accredited, then it is a degree mill. This is nonsense. For one thing, every school is unaccredited when it begins. For another thing, there are schools which, by their very nature, are academically sound, legitimately and sincerely run, appropriately licensed, but unlikely ever to gain ""traditional"" accreditation because of the innovative or experimental or non-traditional nature of their programs. Some such schools succumb to the lure of the many unrecognised (and thus useless) accrediting associations (some of which will accredit anyone who pays the fee), and, thankfully, some like Columbia Evangelical Seminary do not succumb.
In evaluating an unaccredited school, the two crucial questions that must be asked are these: who are the people behind it (and what are their credentials), and what is the quality of work being asked of, and done by, the students. On both of these criteria, in my opinion, Columbia Evangelical Seminary looks good. Fortunately, this is something that can be independently verified. Look at the credentials of Dr. Walston and his colleagues. And look at the work of the students. If this is done fairly, I think most people would agree that Columbia Evangelical Seminary is true to its mission statement, and offers its students both an education and a credential of which they can be justly proud.

Oh, by the way, it might also be of special interest  to you that Dr. Bear is a contributor to the guide Country Education Profiles  of the Australian National Office on Overseas Skills (NOOSR). Dr. John Bear wrote 15 of those 87 profiles, including the United States profile.
Yes, it is beginning to appear that the one who has ""sneaked up on unsuspecting people"" is Senator Carr. All of the information that I have given you above is public record.
Now concerning me in particular, Senator Carr notes that my Ph.D. comes from Greenwich University. This is true. I earned my Ph.D. with Greenwich University under the mentorship of 
 Stanley M. Horton, Th.D., renowned Assemblies of God theologian and author of about thirteen books. However, what Mr. Carr failed to mention is that I also hold a Bachelor of Arts  degree, a Master of Religion  degree, and a Doctor of Ministry  degree all from accredited  institutions here in America. Also, I am presently a Ph.D. student with Potchefstroom University of South Africa (a significant school founded in 1896).
My last point is to prove my charge above that "" Senator Carr did no such investigation nor gained any such `evidence.'""
How can I possibly prove that Mr. Carr simply repeated information ""told"" to him and that he did not investigate the charges himself? Simple: the name of our school has not been Faraston Theological Seminary for well over a year. For more than one full year, on all of our literature, on our web site, and in our advertisements, the name of our school has been Columbia Evangelical Seminary (Faraston being our former name). A very simple phone call to this office would have turned up such ""deeply hidden"" information. A quick stop at our world wide web page would have yielded this obvious information. If Mr. Carr had taken the time within the last 15 months to contact me, or even one of our faculty members, or just one of our students, he would have known better than to refer to our old, out-of-date name.
In conclusion, I cannot vouch for any other person that Mr. Carr so demonises in his speech; however, if he did comparable ""research"" on the others he mentioned, then I would certainly caution anyone from simply accepting his charges at face value.
Thank you for this opportunity to respond.
Sincerely,
(signed)

President of Columbia Evangelical Seminary
SOME RESPONSES TO SENATOR CARR
Greenwich University adopted the name Greenwich in 1989 as it desired a shorter name which was unique and had not been used before. Nearly 4 years later (when Greenwich University and its School of Theology had achieved a high level of recognition in  the United Kingdom) the Thames Polytechnic in Woolwich petitioned the Privy Council to allow itself to be known as Greenwich University. It was refused as there was already a respected Greenwich University (albeit American). It was allowed to rename itself as the University of Greenwich to avoid confusion with the established Greenwich University.
Greenwich was established in 1972 and was originally known as the International Institute for 
 Advanced Studies. Since its founding the name International Institute has been adopted in various guises by a number of schools around the world.
The International Institute for Advanced Studies still exists as a division of Greenwich and is still in good standing in the State of Missouri. Its headquarters are now on Norfolk Island.
The State of Missouri does not accredit schools or universities (including its own state university).
The State of Hawaii does not accredit schools or universities (including its own state university).
Accreditation in the U.S.A. is quite different from that in Australia. In the U.S. accreditation is a voluntary process undertaken after a university has been operating and awarding degrees for a number of years. It enables universities to receive federal funding. Greenwich does not receive government funding: it never has; it never will: it would return it if it was ever sent. Greenwich has been properly established in the U.S.A. since 1972. It has an excellent reputation.
There has never been any irregularity in any state or country.
It is no more a mail order school than the Australian National University in Canberra (which sent a Postgraduate Diploma in Law in the mail to the Chancellor of Greenwich University last year) or the University of Melbourne which also mails out degrees. (Both of these, like Greenwich, require that the students complete the course requirements beforehand.)
Greenwich has not been refused, nor did it apply, in Victoria. It has had a representative office in Victoria since 1990. Its registration was renewed for a further three years by the Victorian Government earlier this year.
Prior to the Greenwich University Act being passed the university requested both the Higher Education Division of DEETYA and the AQF (MCEETYA) if its courses  and curriculum could be submitted for evaluation and accreditation so it could have an external and independent assessment of its programmes. It was told quite clearly and firmly that the AQF and MCEETYA did not accredit courses or universities, and that the other universities resisted any form of external accreditation.
(These facts are known by Senator Carr, who has been supplied with documentation to that effect and  whose own electorate office is nearby to the AQF and MCEETYA).  Greenwich was told by DEETYA and the AQF that it would be self-accrediting and that there was no procedure for it to have its courses evaluated by the AQF or anyone else.
The Chancellor received all his degrees at accredited or state approved universities.  He has never met a Shoshone Indian. The American schools from 
 which he graduated were in California and Pennsylvania—not Nevada.
Its legislative establishment by way of a company and subsequent legislation is the same process as that used by Bond University. The Greenwich University Act is similar to that establishing Bond and Notre Dame.
There is no Brimeyer organization.
Prince Alexis (who died in January 1995) was the hereditary Head of the House of Anjou. He was a client of the Chancellor (a barrister at law) who acted for Prince Alexis and his family for a number of years.
The Chancellor is not an academic (although he has done some teaching many years ago, and has teaching qualifications including being a registered teacher in the State of Victoria).  He does not teach nor instruct nor write curriculum at Greenwich University.  He does not run Greenwich University.  Greenwich is a community of scholars run by the President, the Vice-President, the deans, the faculty and the graduates. The Chancellors position is an honorary one, and always has been. (Though one must say that if the Labour Opposition continues to use parliamentary privilege to defame in a cowardly and deceitful fashion university chancellors there will be very few people willing to accept such roles.)
If Senator Carr really believes what he said under parliamentary privilege then he should repeat his statements outside the Senate and in a public forum. This would then allow the university, its staff, its faculty, its students and its graduates take both individual and collective legal action in the courts of Australia, the United States of America and in the other countries of the world where the university  community is situated.

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1999-06-28,"—On behalf of Senator McKiernan, I seek leave to table the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 101st Inter-Parliamentary Conference.
Leave granted.
—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 101st Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in Brussels and a bilateral visit to Norway which took place between 10 and 21 April 1999, and I seek leave to incorporate a brief statement in relation to the visit in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I am mindful of the time constraints that we have in this the last week of this session. However, I think it important to place on the record some brief comments on the report that I have just tabled on 
 the Australian Delegation to the 101st IPU Conference and also a bi-lateral visit to Norway.
Firstly—the IPU: As one of the two new continuing delegates to the IPU Council I found my first Conference, at first mystifying but by the end of the week very rewarding. Even with extensive oral and written briefs, the workings of the IPU are not easy to understand. Unperturbed, my colleagues and I confronted the challenge and I believe we made a significant contribution on behalf of this Parliament. The report presents in detail the work of the IPU and highlights the individual contribution made by each of the Australian delegates. In this regard, I would commend to the Senate the meeting of the Speaker of the House, Neil Andrew and Senator Jacinta Collins with the Yugoslav delegation at which he made the strongest possible representations for the release of the Australian aid workers being detained in that country.
I was pleased to participate in the IPU debate on:
Parliamentary action to encourage all countries to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty prohibiting all nuclear testing, to encourage universal and non-discriminatory nuclear non-proliferation measures and to work towards the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons .
and was appointed to the drafting committee that is charged with the responsibility of preparing a final resolution for adoption by the IPU as a whole. I was then privileged to be elected President of that drafting committee—this was a formidable task that required over five hours of negotiation between the nine members of the drafting committee in order to finalise the draft.. I was most gratified when this resolution, with some minor amendments, was adopted by the overwhelming majority of the plenary session of the IPU.
Secondly—to Norway
Bi-lateral visits give parliamentarians a unique opportunity to appreciate different political systems, cultures and societies, as well as meeting a diverse range of interesting people.
In Norway, the Delegation was honoured to meet with
.	 The Prime Minister;
.	 The Minister for Foreign Affairs;
.	 Presiding officers of the Norwegian Storting and members of the Norwegian parliament; and
.	 Representatives of business and industry.
The Delegation's report records in detail these meetings and the extent to which aims and objectives of the visit were met.
Although meetings of this type are important and let me say the visit was highly successful, there are 
 other special occasions that characterise the visit and remain with you.
I well remember the Delegation, having travelled by bus and ferry through a snow-covered landscape, meeting with Mr Ole Oskal, his mother, his wife and children. We sat cross-legged on sticks around the perimeter of a Sami tent, with a warming fire in the centre, sipping reindeer soup, discussing indigenous affairs, the Sami people and traditional culture and lifestyle. As Senator Collins will attest I failed miserably in my attempts to lasso a reindeer, notwithstanding that it was tethered to a pole six feet away from me.
In conclusion, I record my thanks to Mr Speaker for the excellent way in which he led the Delegation—and as Deputy Leader I very much appreciated the co-operation and goodwill of the other delegates.
There are always many  people who contribute to our work. Foremost among these, was Ambassador Stephen Brady and his staff who did a superb job in coordinating and advising the Delegation during its visit to Norway.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>101st Inter-Parliamentary Conference</title>,Delegation Reports,35,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-06-28,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present report No. 22, entitled Five treaties tabled on 11 May 1999 , together with submissions, Hansards  and minutes of proceedings. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have my tabling statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The Report I have just tabled is the latest in the Committee's reviews of groups of treaties tabled in the Parliament from time to time.
This is the fifth report we have tabled since March of this year. In the 39th Parliament, the Treaties Committee continues to deal with a heavy workload.
The five treaties tabled on 11 May 1999 were:
.	 a proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with India; 

.	 a proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with Lithuania;
.	 a proposed Trade and Economic Relations Agreement with Fiji;
.	 amendments proposed to the Constitution of the World Health Organisation; and
.	 a proposed Mutual Recognition Agreement with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
Our review of these five treaties followed our standing practice: they were advertised nationally and we held two short public hearings, taking evidence from officials in the appropriate Government agencies.
Two treaties in this group raised some significant issues.
The proposed Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with India is an important agreement with a significant trading partner. The obvious comparison is- with the IPPA with Pakistan, considered by the Committee in its Fifteenth Report  which was tabled on 2 July 1998.
In that Report, we drew attention to nuclear tests in South Asia 1998, adding that these tests had added `a considerable irritant' to the bilateral relationship with Pakistan.
Since then, there have been further missile tests and, more importantly, fighting in Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan. In spite of a number of earlier and more positive indicators this shows no signs of resolution and may in fact become.the fourth major conflict between the two nations.
Unfortunately, there are domestic reasons on both sides that explain why such a conflict has continued and could develop from a conflict in the disputed territory.
We support our Government's approach towards nations in this region, and believe that the Australian position in dealings with these two nations must be absolutely even-handed.
Last year, we recommended that ratification of the IPPA with Pakistan should be delayed until Ministerial and senior official contacts resumed. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advised during our review of the proposed IPPA with India that there had been some movement, by both India and Pakistan, to comply with some of the elements of the UN Security Council's resolution about nuclear testing.
In the current situation, where the outcome of the fighting is not yet clear, we believe that little purpose would be served by delaying implementation of the proposed IPPA.
During the negotiation of IPPAs, Australia uses its own Model text. In the case of this proposed IPPA with India, there were a number of changes to this 
 text because India also has its preferred version. It was necessary to reconcile the two texts and, while some minor changes were required to the Australian version, the proposed IPPA is consistent with our requirements to protect investments.
The other significant agreement tabled on 11 May 1999 was the proposed Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) with Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
In Report 20 , the Committee reviewed the proposed MRA with the European Community. We expressed some concerns about the understanding of the EU rules of origin, and hoped that the efforts of Australian companies to export goods assembled here would not be hampered by the new arrangements.
Implementation of this Agreement has not been very smooth, with considerable delays in finalising it after signature.
In conjunction with the MRA for the EU, the proposed Agreement will ensure that uniform conformity assessment provisions apply between European Economic Area countries. New examination requirements are intended to ensure free movement of Australian goods from particular product areas into and between those countries. The MRA deals with competence to test and certify a specified range of products to meet domestic regulatory requirements. It will provide alternative mechanisms for importers/exporters to comply with regulatory requirements while avoiding delays and costs. Thus, when the proposed MRA is operating, one examination in Australia by conformity assessment bodies will suffice for both domestic and export markets.
We have concerns about this proposed Agreement which are highlighted by the position in which a company, Nulite Systems International Pty Ltd. found itself in connection with the MRA with the European Community.
This firm found out the hard way that in the area of its products, non-metallic, bio-material dental restoratives and associated products, the EU's standards for these products were considerably higher than Australia's. The firm incurred additional costs to have another audit done of its manufacturing process and, as a result of its experiences, will not be involved in exporting to the European market.
We are not in a position to adjudicate in detail one way or another on this matter, but we believe that the attitude taken by the responsible agencies towards Nulite has been dismissive and that the firm is right to feel aggrieved about its treatment.
During the public hearing on 7 June into this matter, we were told that the proposed Agreement will provide additional benefits at minimal cost by extending the number of countries covered by 
 MRAs. Since regulations for these three countries are identical to those applying in the EC, we were informed, Australian conformity assessment bodies will not have to incur additional costs or burdens in being designated under the proposed Agreement.
We trust that our concerns are groundless, and that other firms do not find themselves in the same unhappy situation as Nulite Systems International.
The amendments proposed to the Constitution of the World Health Organization are routine. They seek to increase representation on its governing body in line, with increases to membership in its various geographic regions.
The proposed Trade and Economic Relations Agreement with Fiji seeks to strengthen the bilateral trade and economic relationship between Australia and Fiji. We are an important market for that Counter, and the proposed Agreement could play an important role in that relationship.
While Australia has strong ties with all the three Baltic States, there is little trade with any of them. The proposed IPPA with Lithuania should encourage more bilateral trade and economic activity. This matter has been under negotiation since 1995. During our inquiry, we were told that resource constraints had prevented negotiation of IPPAs with Estonia and Latvia.
We were not totally convinced by all of DFAT's views on Lithuania's position as an entry point to Russian, CIS and other former Soviet Bloc countries in that region. If there are opportunities for Australians exporters in this area, however, IPPAs will assist them in their efforts.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I rise tonight to speak on the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Bill 1999  and the three related bills. I rise to speak a bit earlier than I planned but I am glad to see we are making good progress. First of all I want to indicate at the outset that the Labor opposition supports the thrust of the major bill in that it seeks to consolidate 12 existing family payments into two and to simplify two child-care payments by creating one single regime. Labor supports those measures as being a step in the right direction in terms of simplifying it and making it more understandable for Australian families to access social security payments.
I remember lobbying the then Labor social security minister about that issue some years ago. I know he was committed to a similar process of finding a way to make things more simplified but of course the difficulty always with those sorts of processes is to make sure that, in going for simplicity over complexity, you do no erode the very important basis on which a number of those payments were erected; that is, to reflect the needs of different types of families and their different types of problems. We have a very diverse and complex set of families with a diverse and complex set of needs and so, while I think we all support the need for simplicity, transparency and the least complicated system possible, clearly we also want the system to reflect and accommodate those different needs. That is always a task and a challenge, one that has bipartisan support as we try and work our way through these sorts of issues.
So, while simplification is laudable, the test will be whether or not we meet the needs of all Australian families and move into a more simplified and hopefully more transparent social system. I know one of the concerns always in this area is making sure that families get their entitlements. There has been a whole range of measures over the years, introduced by both sides of politics, that have not been as successful as they should have 
 been because people have not been able to work out that they are entitled to them or how to access them, so that will be one of the tests for this measure. So, as I say, we do support the general thrust and we hope that, as well as rationalising the system, there are rational outcomes as well.
I do want to say that it is unfortunate that these measures have been linked to the goods and services tax debate. The Labor Party's fundamental proposition is that the goods and services tax is a regressive measure that will impact unfairly and harshly on families. To have this measure tied up with the goods and services tax legislation, from our point of view is unfortunate and tends to prevent us from focusing properly on the measures contained in these bills. But, if nothing else, I am a realist. We have had the debate on the GST and, while there are other measures to go, it is quite clear that this parliament is going to carry those bills.
I am pleased to say that these bills will be far more beneficial and will make some contribution to ameliorating the worst impacts of the GST, but they will not provide the sort of protection that I believe is necessary for Australian families, because the GST will be regressive in its impact. It will impact on families more harshly than the current taxation regime, it will have a disproportionate impact on low income families, and it will have a disproportionate impact on people like disability pensioners and others who rely a great deal on services which currently are not taxed. So, while we are prepared to support this measure, its linkage with the GST is highly unfortunate and means that it has not had the sort of attention that the measure deserved. But, as I say, we are prepared to take a rational view of these things and, because we think it is generally a beneficial measure, we will be supporting the bill.
I want to address a couple of other measures in the related bills. As a result of the agreement between the government and the majority of Democrat senators, we have not really had proper time to look at the consequential bills that are included in this package. I have a couple of concerns which are the subject of amendments I will be moving 
 in the committee stage, but I have a more general concern that the speed with which these bills have been introduced—pushed through the House of Representatives and then into the Senate without any committee inquiry process or any great public consultation—is a very poor process and leaves me concerned that there may well be aspects of these related bills that have not received the scrutiny that they need and that we will not make properly informed judgments on these bills.
I know there is always a bit of time pressure, but these bills have been introduced at very short notice and with very scant consideration. I think we would all agree that in terms of process that is not desirable, and so I have put a caveat on my support for some of the measures in these bills because I do not think either the parliament or the community more generally have had a chance to get on top of some of the issues. As they go to questions of administration, they are quite complex and there are potential problems that have not been considered, so I have some concern about that.
Of particular concern is the approach taken in these bills in relation to child-care matters. When we were briefed  by the minister's staff on the family assistance package as it related to child care, we were told that the details of the child-care issues at stake in the new regime—the questions of how people would be paid, who would be a qualified carer and all those sorts of things—would all be contained in the  A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999 . In the last couple of days I have been able to have a look at the bills, and I have found that the child-care issues have not been included. Today I received the Library's Bills Digests on these bills. It quite rightly makes the same point—that the treatment of child-care regulation or child-care arrangements under these bills is quite different. I quote the Library's Bills Digests:
Rather than set out the requirements in the bill concerning claims, determinations and payments, new division 4 basically provides for the making of regulations about how individuals in approved child-care services can become entitled to have 
 payments of child-care benefit made and how such payments are to be made.
So, rather than the bill containing, as we were assured, the details of the regime in terms of child care, it has been treated quite differently from the approach in the more general social security matters, and the matters will all have to be dealt with by way of regulation. I know many of those will be disallowable instruments, and the parliament will have the opportunity to consider those regulations in due course, but I do think that that is not a proper way to go. It is a case of giving too much authority and too much content in regulations and not enough in the primary legislation.
There has always been a tendency or a temptation on behalf of government to adopt that sort of approach because it does mean that parliament has less scrutiny of the detail and less ability to influence the detail. I am sure that was not the case on this occasion—maybe it was the speed with which things were done—but it does leave the parliament with less ability to properly scrutinise and determine how those arrangements are put in place.
While I have received assurances from the government about the new regime that there will be very little change to the current regime that is in place, I do have some concerns about this method. I put the government on notice that the Labor opposition will scrutinise those regulations very carefully and will not hesitate to use the power to block those regulations if they are not in accordance with both proper practice and the assurances given to us. I am sure the Democrats will also take a fairly critical look at them because we are not getting the opportunity on this occasion to examine them because of the way this has been structured. As I say, I hope there is nothing more sinister or devious involved in this approach.
As the opposition child-care spokesperson, I will be taking a very keen interest to make sure that the industry receives reassurance about the concerns that it has about some of the options the government was considering. The government has given commitments on a number of those matters, such as payment 
 in arrears rather than in advance and a couple of other issues. I do want to note that, while the government has lived up to its election commitment to provide that parents should be able to choose to be paid directly, I think the reality of the bill's measures is that the current system will stay in place for the majority of families. For people to take the annual payment option, I think they would need to be very high income earners; otherwise they would not be able to carry the cost of their child care each week.
While I am sure the government will be keen to claim that this measure meets its election commitments, I think good sense has prevailed and most families will continue to operate under the regime currently in place. That will provide much more security to child-care providers who, I think, felt very threatened by the move to an alternative regime, because they thought that they could end up with substantial bad debt problems. As we all know, bad debt is a constant threat to small businesses at the best of times. Child-care centres have some problems in that area, but I think they were most concerned that that would be exacerbated. So I am pleased that the regime in place within this legislative framework will prevent that becoming a more significant problem for the sector.
The other thing to note about the level of child-care assistance is that, while the extra assistance for child care will be welcomed, it does not apply until July 2000. I think, then, it will basically go only part way to compensating for the cap that the government has imposed on child-care assistance for the last two years and does nothing to address the real structural issues at stake in the child-care industry in this country. The affordability problem is driving closure of centres and forcing families to remove children from formal child care. I am afraid the beneficial measures contained in this bill will come too late to halt that process and, I think, come too late for many families in terms of them accessing the formal child-care sector. Any assistance will obviously help, but I do not think it will be enough. It will be very much a case of too little, too late. When combined with the government's other measures of 
 reducing funding for child care and the other structural changes made by this government over the last couple of years, I think we will continue to see enormous pressure on families' capacity to afford child care and enormous stress on the industry's ability to cope, given that significant drop in demand.
But with those comments, I wish to reiterate that we will be supporting the bills. I have circulated a couple of amendments to the  A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999 , and I see that Senator Bartlett has moved what I suspect are similar amendments—at least in one respect. I hope those are supported, because they raise very serious issues about people's access to review of decisions. I will address those concerns in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-06-28,"—The Senate is debating in the second reading stage the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Bill 1999 , the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Consequential and Related Measures) Bill (No. 1) 1999 , the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Consequential and Related Measures) Bill (No. 2) 1999  and A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999 . This legislation contains a number of improvements to family assistance measures to lighten the burden placed on many families by the government's youth allowance package last year and, as the previous speaker indicated, has been linked to the overall package of changes as part of the A New Tax System package.
The Democrats certainly support measures which give greater financial support to families and measures that raise the income test threshold to a more realistic rate and address the poverty trap caused by the current 50 per cent taper rate. The impact of poverty traps under existing legislation is certainly one of the biggest disincentive measures, and the Democrats welcome the moves in this legislation to mitigate that, as we did other measures relating to pensions. We certainly hope that the government does consider acting in the future in the area that I believe is perhaps the one most in need of action, which is the poverty trap or taper rate applying to unem 
 ployed people. We certainly welcome this improvement in the taper rate contained in this legislation.
I would like to put on the record the Democrats' continuing concerns with definitions of age of independence. Defining the age of independence for a student as 25 and for a young unemployed person as 21 is inconsistent with definitions of adulthood and independence in other legislation and perpetrates an irrational view of young people's circumstances and real responsibilities. Senator Harradine, as senators would be aware, in debates over the youth allowance legislation last year put on record his concerns at the pressure that would be put on lower and middle income earners who would be hit harder because they face the financial burden of supporting young adult children up to the age of 21 for young unemployed and up to 25 years old for students. The Democrats are still of the belief that 18 should be the recognised age of independence, whether people are unemployed or students. It provides a more accurate reflection of the realities of society and also the reality of financial burdens that young adults face.
This legislation provides some relief for families who were impacted by the youth allowance measures implemented last year. At that time, the government gave the following undertaking to Senator Harradine with respect to support for those families. They assured Senator Harradine that:
. . . in restructuring the Australian taxation system, to which this government is committed, the government will give further recognition and help to Australian parents concerning their responsibilities in . . . raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers.
While this concern was not initially honoured by the government, this bill finally makes good that commitment by increasing the family tax benefit part A to $50 per fortnight and by increasing eligibility for it. Certain young persons aged 21 to 25 who are engaged in full-time study and young unemployed persons aged 18 to 25 will be eligible for the family tax benefit part A. Where they would attract a higher rate of income support as a family tax benefit child than they would as a youth allowance recipient, they will be 
 able to opt for the former, with the payments going to an adult. This measure involves an additional $50 million in expenditure per year by the government, and that will address some of the financial hardships suffered since the implementation of the youth allowance last year.
Of course, there is still some way to go in this area. I note concerns raised within the welfare sector that these amendments will benefit higher income families while less relief will be afforded families where the young person is eligible for a higher rate of youth allowance. These are measures that the Democrats believe do need ongoing attention; however, we welcome the financial relief contained in this bill as an important first step to redressing some of the other anomalies contained in the provision of family and youth income support. There are some significant advances here and, as always when advances occur, the Democrats are quite happy to acknowledge them and support them, as we will do. As Senator Evans indicated, there are a couple of areas where there are some amendments, which we will address in the committee stage, and I will outline my rationale for those at the time. In closing, Madam Acting Deputy President, I would like to check whether there any other speakers on this bill present in the chamber.
—It appears not.
—In which case, I could wax lyrical for another five minutes or we could have an early dinner break; I thought I would spare you the trauma and let you have dinner four minutes earlier. I do have one sentence left. Whilst it is important that the measures in this bill help address the financial needs of families—and the Democrats welcome those—I would like to emphasise that one of the growing areas of poverty in society is that of young single people. The needs of single people is an area of society which I think, perhaps in the rush to try to address the very real financial needs of families, has been a bit obscured by that. It certainly does appear from recent research that young single people are often amongst the biggest growing group in society in terms 
 of poverty levels, and it is an area that I think we do need to pay more attention to when we are looking at income support and other forms of financial assistance and legislation of that type. So I would like to certainly flag the Democrats' interest in ensuring that that group in society is not forgotten. That is not to say, of course, that families are not important or that they do not have extra financial burdens; we are pleased that this legislation does go a long way towards addressing some of those burdens. It is legislation that the Democrats support.
Sitting suspended from 6.26 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—Order! The question is that the bills be now read a second time.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bills read a second time.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I rise to speak on the A 
 New Tax System (Closely Held Trusts) Bill 1999 and two other bills relating to non-disclosure—A New Tax System (Ultimate Beneficiary Non-disclosure Tax) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and A New Tax System (Ultimate Beneficiary Non-disclosure Tax) Bill (No. 2) 1999 . The issue of tax avoidance through family trusts is one that we on the Labor side of the chamber have been concerned about for a long time. We have been calling on the government to take action and, most recently, to abide by its undertaking to provide consistent treatment of tax entities so that trusts are taxed in the same way as companies.
In announcing that it intends to do this, the government has claimed a positive budgetary impact of $1.67 billion in the year 2000-01, declining to $650 million in the year 2002-03. However, we have not yet seen those bills. We have only seen the ones that are now before the chamber. It is a small measure to deal with some of the abuses of tax structures for the purpose of tax avoidance and evasion. It requires the disclosure of the ultimate beneficiaries of income from trusts. That is so that the Commissioner of Taxation can check whether each beneficiary has properly disclosed the net income of their net assets, including the receipt of any tax preferred amounts. Failing that disclosure, the income of the trust will be taxed at the top marginal rate, plus the Medicare levy.
However, these requirements apply only to closely held trusts, which are defined in the bill—and I will not read the provision—and discretionary trusts, which are also defined in the bill. I will not read that provision either, except to say that a discretionary trust is a trust that is not a fixed trust—that is, one where persons have fixed entitlements to all the income and assets of the trust. A fixed entitlement is an indefeasible interest in a share of the income or assets of a trust.
The bills before us specifically exclude unit trusts with units listed on the Stock Exchange—complying superannuation funds, deposit funds, pooled superannuation trusts and deceased estates until the fifth anniversary of the death. The fact that it is only expected to raise an additional $30 million a year is a demonstration of how limited this measure 
 is. There are many greater tax avoidance and evasion issues associated with trusts. The government's reluctance to come to grips with these avoidance and evasion issues shows how uninterested it is in real tax reform that protects the revenue and makes everyone pay their fair share.
There is every sign that the government wants little more than a few measures it can point to to deflect criticism about its lack of action. The lack of speed and commitment in this area has now reached the dimensions of a scandal of such proportions that, in the context of this bill, it requires a second reading amendment. I was going to apologise to the chamber for not being able to circulate this amendment because we have been moving faster than I anticipated, but the Clerk has acknowledged that it has been circulated. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
""but the Senate is of the view that:
	 (a)	 in relation to tax avoidance:
		 (i)	 the Government has failed for three years to take adequate action to deal with major tax avoidance and evasion by high wealth individuals using complex trust structures;
		 (ii)	 lack of action is causing major ongoing losses of revenue;
		 (iii)	 at the time these aggressive tax avoidance and evasion schemes were first identified by the Australian Taxation Office in late 1995 and early 1996 an amount of $800 million was being evaded by 80 high wealth individuals;
		 (iv)	 some of the high wealth individuals participating in these schemes were manipulating their taxable incomes to declare as little as $20,000 a year and so claim various government benefits;
		 (v)	 the legislative action required to eliminate these schemes is well understood by the Australian Taxation Office; and
		 (vi)	 the lack of adequate action on tax avoidance and evasion using trusts is an indicator of the Government's failure to provide proper and fair tax reforms; and
	 (b)	 in relation to so called taxation reform, of which this bill forms a part as a component of the New Tax System: 

		 (i)	 the government has not achieved real tax reforms in Australia, it has merely agreed to introduce an unfair GST;
		 (ii)	 the new Howard/Lees GST will involve a massive tax mix switch which will hurt ordinary families, which is directly contrary to the balloted policy of the Australian Democrats;
		 (iii)	 the Howard/Lees deal will actually increase the tax on food in Australia;
		 (iv)	 ordinary people will now face a GST on top of state indirect taxes on bank accounts; and
		 (v)	 the amended tax package is still unfair and will also damage the environment"".
It is obvious to anyone with a serious interest in tax policy that there is scope for tax avoidance and evasion using tax structures. Throughout 1994 and 1995 the Treasurer's office pressed Treasury for advice on the extent of the problem and the possible remedies. It was raised on an almost weekly basis in meetings with the department. Nothing was forthcoming until 9 November 1995 when the Australian Taxation Office, not the Treasury, advised that they had uncovered a significant problem using multiple trust structures. They had been using new software which was capable of finding patterns in large amounts of seemingly unrelated information. They had found that large numbers of seemingly unrelated trusts were in fact related and a range of techniques were being used by high-wealth individuals to reduce tax liabilities to low or negligible levels.
Treasury and the tax office worked on the issue over the next three months, eventually advising the Treasurer that it would be appropriate to make a public announcement that the government would act to end these practices. The press release issued by Treasurer Ralph Willis on 11 February 1996 accurately set out the issues. It was entitled, `High-wealth individuals: taxation of trusts.' I have indicated a copy of this press release to the minister, who is not at the table but is in the chamber. I would seek leave to incorporate the text of this press release because it does set the record straight. The minister did indicate to me that that was an acceptable action.
Leave granted.
The document  read as follows—
On November 9, 1995 I was informed by the Australian Taxation Office that as part of the Compliance Enforcement Strategy authorised by the Government, it had conducted analysis of the accumulation of wealth by certain individuals and the taxes paid by them. That analysis revealed that some high wealth individuals were employing strategies which allowed them to accumulate wealth, enjoy a lavish lifestyle, but pay little or no tax. The analysis was in its early stages but the ATO believed the revenue implications might amount to several hundred million dollars.
At my request, the ATO and Treasury provided more extensive advice and analysis on December 20 1995. It revealed that in the 1993 financial year, 80 individuals each with a net work of over $30 million had returned taxable incomes of $20,000 or less. This enabled some of them to qualify for low income rebates, Medicare exemptions, deferral of HECS payments and reduced child support payments. The tax minimisation techniques employed by these individuals mainly involved the use of trusts.
By January 19, 1996, the ATO and Treasury were able to advise that on the basis of the work undertaken to date in respect to 100 wealthy individuals alone, appropriate measures to deal with a range of specific tax minimisation techniques using trusts would produce additional revenue of at least $500 million. Later at a meeting on January 23, 1996, Treasury gave me verbal advice raising that estimate to $800 million. Some amount could be forthcoming in 1996-97, but the first full year effect would be in 1997-98.
The January 19, 1996 advice also included separate revenue estimates in addition to the $800 million for techniques involving thin capitalisation and abuses of the provisions for payments by trusts to foreign charities.
The ATO has identified a number of complex tax planning arrangements used by some wealthy individuals to avoid tax, these include:
-	 the characterisation of income as capital by the use of multiple trust structures to conceal a common controlling mind. If the activities of the various trusts and associated companies were viewed as a whole, the profits of the group could be treated as trading income. The ATO has found a number of cases of wealthy individuals operating over 100 trusts;
-	 the creation of artificial losses (revenue as well as capital) to neutralise otherwise taxable profits, particularly through the use of related party transactions;
-	 distributions to wealthy individuals and family members being disguised as loans and other benefits which are claimed to be non-taxable. In relation to companies this includes exploitation of 
 alleged weaknesses in section 47A and 108 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, of the deemed dividend provisions;
-	 the continued use of offshore trusts to hold significant funds which seem to be applied for the benefit of wealthy individuals and their families; and
-	 the use of Australian charitable trusts and overseas organisations to disguise benefits provided by family trading trusts to family members.
Obviously, these are not techniques which are practised by the overwhelming majority of trusts operated by and for Australians. Trusts provide an appropriate structure to meet a range of legitimate needs such as for charities, education and non-profit organisations, deceased estates, a variety of family purposes, and for solicitors and other professionals. The Government will not interfere with these arrangements. The Government undertakes that the measures it will adopt will ensure that activities not involving tax avoidance are not adversely affected.
No responsible government could stand back and let blatant abuse of the tax system by extremely wealthy individuals continue. The ATO is undertaking action to test the effectiveness of the existing law to deal with some of these practices. However, it is not expected that an outcome will be achieved by these means in the near future due to the long time frames involved in testing issues before the courts. The ATO has advised that it is particularly difficult to run test cases in these areas because the individuals concerned will settle at the end of the day rather than have their private affairs or practices exposed to the public.
On January 29, 1996, I wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner for Taxation, asking them as a matter or urgency to develop a legislative response to cover income from the 1996-97 financial year. The new tax measures which the Government will introduce to deal with these specific areas of tax avoidance will be prospective not retrospective.
One of the most important things this Labor Government has given Australia since it was elected in 1983 is a tax system based on the principle of integrity and fairness. Maintaining that basic integrity and fairness requires stamping out tax avoidance wherever and whenever it emerges.
The reason these measures are being announced today is because the Government is seeking a mandate to deal with this area of tax avoidance. We call on the other parties in this election to support these reforms. I am offering Mr Howard a briefing this afternoon from the Commissioner of Taxation.
The Treasurer
Ralph Willis
11 February 1996 

When you read that press release you will see a very clear case for reform and the proposals that the Labor government—had it been returned—would have carried through. The press release also refers to the shadow Treasurer. I understand he received a briefing the very next day.
More than three years have passed and the two substantial things that have changed are the government and the fact that Australia no longer has a government that will do anything about the scandal. If the Howard government had any interest in the fairness and integrity of the Australian tax system, it would have legislated in its first year to put an end to this abuse. Two weeks before the 1998 election, when the government needed money to fund the tax cuts contained in its ANTS package and when it knew Labor would raise this issue, it came out with a plan to tax trusts as companies. Eight months later, we have still not seen the legislation. But it is not just eight months since the task was put in front of it; it is three years, three months and 25 days. Perhaps the Treasurer is shooting for the record on inaction on major tax fraud. Former Fraser government Attorney-General Peter Durack left the prosecution files of the bottom of the harbour schemes in his bottom drawer for seven years. If the Liberal government—surprisingly to all of the critics—were to win, for example, the next election, the Treasurer has a chance of beating the Durack record on inaction.
We are now being told that the government will produce its solution to this problem in the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. It is a bit more urgent than that. It has been a bit more urgent than that for more than three years. In the 1998 federal election, Labor indicated its preparedness to tax trusts as companies, so it is not a matter of political debate between the Labor and Liberal parties. The remedies on trusts are clearly set out in the ANTS package by the Treasurer. Labor wants them implemented as quickly as possible, but now the election is out of the way and the issue has been put off. Why has a policy which was clear enough to be included in the government's election policies been too difficult? Why is this the case when we have 
 been hearing regularly over a year from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer about their determination to stamp out abuse in this area? On 30 September 1997 the Australian Financial Review reported:
The Prime Minister ruled out an attack on the abuse of trusts for taxation purposes on the spurious grounds that such a move would hurt small business.
The Prime Minister was sufficiently incensed by this to make a personal explanation to the House the same day. He said:
Can I say that I have done no such thing. What I have said, and I am happy to repeat it today, is that I have assured the members of the government parties that in any taxation changes we make we will not be acting in a manner that would seriously damage, or indeed damage at all, small business. But at no stage have I said that my government would never take action against the abuse of trusts. We will always take action against abuses within the tax system.
On 24 February 1998 the Treasurer was reported in the Herald Sun  announcing that family and company trusts would be taxed at the same rate as company profits as part of the government's crackdown on tax loopholes. The Australian Financial Review  quoted him on the same day as saying:
In an ideal tax system, taxes would relate to the economic activity that is being carried on, rather than the legal vehicle which houses that activity.
The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are very adept on this issue. They say one thing but they do nothing. Any move to stop tax evasion and avoidance always meets resistance. Someone will try to characterise the measures as draconian or claim that their activities are legitimate or essential. According to the Australian Financial Review  of 30 September 1998, the coalition's policy was being undermined by the Leader of the National Party even before election day with his letter of 22 September 1998 in political doublespeak to the Australian Cane Farmers Association:
I can assure you that whilst the National Party is committed to stopping any practice of `rorts' through FBT or trusts, it will take all necessary action to ensure that genuine use of distributions of capital from family trusts to beneficiaries will not be subjected to fringe benefits tax.
This contradicted the government's tax policy which said FBT would be:
. . . extended to benefits in excess of $1,000 a year provided by companies to their shareholders or by trustees to trust beneficiaries, where the benefits were not taxed currently.
There was a report in the Australian Financial Review  on 30 March this year, following a National Party meeting, that Senator Winston Crane was focusing his attention on preserving the rights of `legitimate' business trusts. Senator Crane claimed he had received a lot of support from his coalition colleagues. The next day AAP reported that Queensland state opposition leader Rob Borbidge had announced that the Queensland National Party would oppose any attempts to tax trusts like companies and that both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister had been told of the Queensland Nationals' position.
On 25 May 1999, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that National Party concerns that the Review of Business Taxation proposals would reintroduce death duties on family farms by cracking down on discretionary family trusts had been given a sympathetic hearing among coalition parliamentarians. The report said it was understood the cabinet secretary, Senator Bill Heffernan, was investigating the matter further following a presentation from Queensland solicitors Cleary and Hoare—more about Senator Heffernan in a moment—who were representing more than 200 farmers. The National Party is apparently hoping the Review of Business Taxation will not pursue proposals to tax trusts as companies.
On 24 May, Glenn Milne reported in the Australian that the Deputy Prime Minister had said, `We'll kill this in Cabinet.' Parliament has sat for several weeks since then, but there has been no personal explanation like the Prime Minister's. On the Sunday program about a month ago, the Deputy Prime Minister was again trying to characterise taxing trusts as companies as a death duty. His exact words were:
But, at the end of the day, are we about to retrospectively reintroduce death duties by a some approach to trusts? No.
And:
The Government's made no decisions, and we still haven't got the Ralph report, and it will be a little while yet. 

This was immediately contradicted, first by Mr Ralph, reported in the Australian Financial Review  as saying:
We can't see where there is any negative effect arising out of proposals being considered that would give effect to an inheritance tax.
It was then contradicted by the Treasurer when he responded to a question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the House, who asked him to:
. . . confirm that full implementation of the proposal to tax trusts as companies outlined in your original GST package had been factored into the budget surplus projections?
The Treasurer replied:
The government's policy as announced in A New Tax System, ANTS, stands. The government is proceeding to implement that. In relation to those matters that are fully costed as part of ANTS, they have of course been taken into the budget position.
The noise was coming from the National Party even before the election was over, and it is still coming today. That explains the last eight months procrastination. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are going to have to decide very soon whether their position is best summed up by an incisive comment made by the Minister for Sport and Tourism in her backbench days. On 2 October 1997, she was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald  as saying:
Carmody should stop attacking Australians for not paying tax.
That sums up where the Liberal Party have been coming from for the last three years. Nor should we forget in the context of this debate that there are 20 members of the government frontbench who have trusts themselves. We saw today how this government treats conflicts of interest. We can only wait and see what the next excuse will be. Which interest groups and what misrepresentation will we see next? Meanwhile, the tax evaders and avoiders are using Australia as a tax haven and treating the rest of the community with contempt. The tax commissioner can have a good enforcement regime, but he will not be effective if the government fails to give him the tax law to do his job. Any government that lets tax avoidance and evasion of this magnitude go unchecked can never be taken seriously on tax reform.
I made a reference in my remarks to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet, Senator Bill Heffernan. We do know that about 20 out of 27 of the government frontbench have trusts. We do know that, in the last government, Senator Warwick Parer had a web of deceit that outlined his involvement in trusts.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: to suggest that a colleague, Senator Parer, has a web of deceit is outside the standing orders and should be withdrawn. It is untrue and should not be said.
—I would ask you to withdraw that comment, Senator Cook.
—I withdraw. We do know, however, that Senator Heffernan is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet, that he is the self-professed cardinal or the eyes and ears of the Prime Minister, John Howard, in the New South Wales Liberal Party and that he is a holder of six family trusts and one unit trust which he says he needs for succession planning in his family. If, under his proposal, he distributes $5,400 to each of 10 beneficiaries, due to the tax-free threshold no tax would be paid on $54,000. That should be compared to what a wage earner would have to pay on $54,000—$16,000—in tax. Not many ordinary Australian battlers get access to this level of tax avoidance.
The issue of the use of family trusts and the interlocking nature of family trusts to split income and to lower levels of taxation are matters of considerable concern in Australia. It is about time that the government followed what the Labor government would have done had it been re-elected in 1996 and legislated in the form that Ralph Willis had announced in, as I recall, February of that year. The fact that the government sit back, fail to act and refer to it in their ANTS package but do not carry it through in their legislation giving rise to the ANTS package—flip it off to the Ralph inquiry—indicates a degree of massive insincerity. 
We will be watching very closely when the Ralph inquiry reports. We will expect the Ralph inquiry to take up the issue of tax 
 evasion and avoidance through the use of family trusts and, if it does, we will then expect this government to act quickly. We do not hold much hope that it will. While it should, in the interests of the Australian community, we are aware of the vested interests of many members of its own frontbench. This has been one of the reasons, I believe, why it has failed to police this matter up until now.
—You had 13 years.
—I take the interjection. I go back to the facts. It is very rare that we are able to nail the Assistant Treasurer in a debate, because he is so slippery—he trades in platitudes and argues whatever is the platitudinous version of the truth. The facts are that a former Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia, Ralph Willis, a highly respected Australian and a well-regarded Treasurer, sought from Treasury—and finally got from the Taxation Office—advice on what was occurring with family trusts and, upon receipt of that advice, acted promptly to do something about it.
The other fact is that the election intervened, and the advice has been sitting there for three years—unaddressed by this government and now the subject of consideration within the Ralph review. I think what says it all is that 20 members of your own frontbench are potential beneficiaries of this inaction, and that is a disgrace. However, we will wait and see what the Ralph inquiry puts, and we will be expecting the government to move promptly to end tax avoidance by the use of trusts in this manner.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (CLOSELY HELD TRUSTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-06-28,"—In rising to speak on the A New Tax System (Closely Held Trusts) Bill 1999  and related bills I think I should begin, as is appropriate, by a declaration of interest. I have an interest in a family trust, as has been previously outlined, and I think that it is appropriate to disclose that with each bill which affects trusts coming through.
The Bills Digest No. 189 of 1998-99 indicates that, in 1993—which was the year that Paul Keating, the previous Prime Minister, won his first election in his own right—there were 331,000 trusts. By 1996—which was the 
 first year that John Howard, now the Prime Minister, won his first election in his own right—the number was 427,000. Those figures indicate that the number of trusts and the nature of trusts have been with us a very long time under both Labor and coalition governments, and the problems attached to them have been with us for that same period of time.
The Bills Digest also outlines the fact that, while the number of trusts and companies have both risen, the annual growth rate for trusts has increased while the growth rate for companies has decreased relatively. They go on to say:
The Australian Taxation Office has stated that the relative rates of growth of trusts and companies could reflect the different tax treatment of trusts and companies.
I think the `could' is a bit of a qualifier, because they do. The reason that so many Australians are in trusts is they get tax advantages as a result, and it is that area which needs serious attention. In the Ralph review preliminary report No. 2, produced, I think, by Arthur Andersen, they illustrated the fact that, in internationally comparative terms, Australia and New Zealand have a remarkably high number of trusts which operate as business entities, as opposed to the other categories of trusts, and that is because of the development in Australian law under the Labor government and continued under the coalition government of advantaging trusts in that regard. Trusts are now very much a part of many Australians' lives. Ordinary Australians invest in unit trusts, property trusts or investment trusts. There are many varieties of trusts. Of course, we all know about family trusts and the reasons for which they are constructed. But the fact is that trusts of all kinds are very heavily used by Australians.
It is the opinion of the Democrats that the  A New Tax System (Closely Held Trusts) Bill 1999  is a good advance in the direction of ensuring that trusts are appropriately taxed. These days it is often shorthand to say that trusts should be taxed as companies, but it is my opinion that we should rather say that like business activities, whether in trusts, companies, partnerships or individual operations, 
 should be taxed alike. That is probably one of the major issues—that, depending on the legal entity, business activity is in fact taxed differentially—and is something to which we hope the government will attend. The government, and everyone else, is aware that the way in which trust activities end up being taxed is at the beneficiary end and not within the entity. By and large, most trusts are not taxed at all; taxation is in the hands of the trustee or the beneficiaries, and the trust itself is a throughput mechanism. Nevertheless, I think it is still appropriate to say that business activities, regardless of the entity, should always be treated similarly.
This particular bill imposes an obligation on the trustees of closely held trusts to disclose the identity and tax file numbers of the ultimate beneficiaries of net income and tax preferred amounts. People who are not attuned to these things can sometimes skip over the meaning of that, but the ultimate beneficiary is in fact clearly defined in the closely held trust as an individual or up to 20 individuals who, between them, directly or indirectly have fixed entitlements to a 75 per cent or greater share of the income or capital of the trust. Identifying the ultimate beneficiary is in fact a great march forward in tax law, because the ultimate beneficiary in a trust has quite often, in my view, been able to slide past their tax obligation.
I notice from the financial impact statement that the Treasury calculate that this measure `is estimated to raise revenue of $30 million in each of the following financial years'. I note that the Treasury advisers are sitting in the chamber. Through you, Minister, and Mr Acting Deputy President, I say to them: I am going to guarantee to you that your estimate of $30 million is way short of the mark, and what you are introducing will in fact pinch a lot more people than that $30 million implies. I look forward to the statistics being produced in a couple of years time. I think this is going to be one of the great underestimations of how much revenue is earned, because the fact is that, through this device, you are going to be able to pin who the ultimate beneficiaries are—they are going to have to be declared. It is always worthwhile, Minister, as a govern 
 ment and as a Treasury to underestimate your future revenue stream. I think you are pretty safe on this one. I think this bill goes a lot further than people have woken up to.
To continue with the nature of the bill itself, the bill does provide that, if the trustee fails to notify the tax department of the ultimate beneficiary or if there is no ultimate beneficiary—and such a thing is hard to conceive—it can provide for taxation at a penalty rate or for offences under the Income Tax Act. Those penalties and offences are outlined in the bill and include the trustee being liable to pay the tax or, if the trustee is a company, the directors being also jointly and severally liable to pay tax. I notice there are fines under section 8C of the TAA `not exceeding $2,000 for the first offence, increasing to $5,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months for subsequent offences'. So there are some quite sharp penalties for failure to disclose these things. We then notice that, within the content of the bill, the ultimate beneficiary characteristics are defined quite tightly. The various mechanisms are carried through in consequential amendments to other bills.
I do not choose to say much more, Minister, other than I think that this is quite an effective bill. I think there is lots more to come on the trusts area, and the government has indicated that in the ANTS package. It is the opinion of the Australian Democrats that this bill should be strongly supported as one of the first tranches of legislation which will tighten up an area which badly needs tightening. Accordingly, as you will have recognised from my remarks, we will support the bill.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (CLOSELY HELD TRUSTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-06-28,"—I rise to speak to the Labor Party amendment on sheet 1460, as circulated. It sets out a range of issues that, unfortunately, are not dealt with in the bill. I appreciate that the Democrats are in a situation where they have reached an agreement with the government on a tax—
Senator Murray interjecting—
—I am supporting my own amendment, thank you, Senator Murray. It is, I appreciate, quite late in the day. Sena 
 tor Woodley, I am pleased to see you with us today.
—Don't provoke me.
—I am disappointed. Many in the media have commented on the fact that they thought the deal reached between the government and the Democrats—as the Prime Minister put it—reflected 85 per cent of their desires. There would be many in the broader community, as well as in their own group—as we witnessed in Friday's voting—who felt that the Democrats did not drive a hard enough bargain. This is probably an area where, I feel, they were absolutely right. There are some who have described the deal between the Democrats and the government as akin to that between the Americans and the Indians over Manhattan Island, where the government got away with beads and blankets for Manhattan Island. I would have to say that I think that is a fair description of the willingness of the Democrats to accept the limelight at such a small price. This is an area where there has been massive avoidance and growth in avoidance—
—During the previous government.
—Thank you, Senator Woodley. I am glad you want to contribute to one of the debates; I am hoping you might speak on this one.
—Yes, I would like to.
—I wish you would, because I know what you truly believe. I know what is in your heart on these issues, Senator Woodley, as opposed to how you have been voting.
—What a shocking thing to say!
—He picks on me, you know.
—Order! Address interjections and speeches through the chair.
—Don't impugn his motives.
—I am not impugning his motives at all. I am just suggesting that Senator Woodley knows deep down that, in 
 a few years time, when he goes back to work for the Uniting Church in the charity area, which I know he will do once he leaves the parliament, and he is face to face with the consequences of how he has been voting, he will look back and regret what he has done. I think that is what will happen, Senator Woodley.
—You can get a two per cent return on your super fund.
—Thank you, Senator Kemp. I can report to you that the TWU super fund for this financial year is going to have one of the highest returns among the industry funds, which I know you will be pleased about. I know you have been concerned about the returns for TWU members.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Kemp, let us have a reasonably orderly debate.
—I will happily take them on one at a time; I just wish they would interject one at a time, not both at the same time. This is an area which, as Senator Murray knows, I am very passionate about. We have clashed in the chamber on the issue of trusts in the past, and harsh words have been exchanged on this issue.
—I'm surprised you're off the mat.
—You should just stick to barracking for your footy team, Senator Kemp. Notwithstanding the interjection from Senator Woodley about it happening under the Labor Party, it is acknowledged that avoidance was happening under the Labor Party. The Labor Party had the tax commissioner, Mr Carmody—before he became a poodle to this government—come forward and say, `This is a growth area. This is a problem and here is what I recommend you do about it.' That is what happened. We went to that 1996 campaign highlighting the sorts of revenue losses that were being gouged out of the government's tax base. I think Senator Cook has already described how individuals have not just one but 10, 20, 30 or 40 artificially organised trusts, just for the purposes 
 of spreading it around and creating maximum confusion.
This is the sort of issue which this government has been loath to tackle. We have seen reports of the National Party and what they think about this issue. They have made it clear from day one that they will not be in it. They will not be in any meaningful addressing of the tax avoidance trust issue. The Deputy Prime Minister is on the record as saying, `We will roll it in cabinet.' What about you, Senator McGauran? You have been attending those meetings. You have been prepared to make sure, in joining in that sentiment, that there is no way that you are willing to face up to it. I am pleased that Senator Kemp is still here and is still actively participating in the debate and interjecting from the other side, because we will be looking to Senator Kemp—
—This is one of your weakest efforts.
—I appreciate—as always—your support, Senator Kemp; but, if you can control yourself a little longer, we have a situation where this government has not been serious about trusts. That was evidenced by the trafficking in trust losses where, in actual fact, this government widened the loophole for trafficking in family trust losses. I know that that was a matter of some debate.
The Battlers of Brighton staged an enormous write-in campaign to the Senate committee that was investigating the issue. We had hundreds of letters from the Battlers of Brighton about the implications of trust losses and trafficking in them—notwithstanding that every person who appeared before the committee denied that they had ever seen any trafficking in trust losses. This bill had an opportunity to address a variety of the issues at stake in this debate. And we unfortunately have seen the Democrats squib it. I am disappointed that Senator Murray is briefly out of the chamber. I know he likes to stay—
—He is coming back.
—I am sure he is coming back and I am hoping he will, be 
 cause there are a couple of comments that I would like to make with him present.
—I will pass them on.
—Senator Woodley knows that just taxing trusts at a company level, which is what the National Party committee is stopping, does not in actual fact fix this particular problem. It is not the panacea that the government have tried to pretend that it is. It is an important step; it will at least see a greater level of taxation of the distributions but it does not actually stop the complex avoidance arrangements that the rich end of town has practised, and continues to practise. We have not seen cries of outrage from the Battlers of Brighton with this particular bill, because it does not really address what they get up to.
—Where do you live, Senator Kemp?
—Senator Kemp lives very close to Brighton, thank you, Senator Collins—very close indeed. It is probably a coincidence that his brother is actually the member representing that area. That could be one of the reasons. I do not think that whenever we have had a declaration of interests on these sorts of votes, Senator Kemp, you have ever had to disclose that you have a family trust. I think that is right.
—Have you disclosed that you have a brother?
—He has disclosed that he has a brother. He has snuck onto the political scene every now and then. Senator Kemp is, in actual fact, not one of those who has ever had to disclose, from recollection, this question of potential conflict of interest over trafficking in trust losses. But we are looking forward to the vote shortly on this issue—where, once again, the Liberal Party will be forced to fess up and forced to confess why they are not really dealing with this issue in this bill. We will see members and senator after senator get to their feet to declare that they are in actual fact involved in trusts. There were 19 in the last parliament, I think.
We have not bothered to go through and collect the list of names again for this debate but what we do know is that Senator 
 Heffernan has some trusts—as we discovered recently. Senator Heffernan, the Cardinal—the `eyes and ears of the Prime Minister', as he likes to be known in New South Wales—is one of those people who have indicated that they are prepared to take up the concerns of the National Party. And that is why this is such a squib of a bill and why I say to Senator Woodley that, unfortunately, it is such a disappointment that the Democrats have signed up to a bill that does not actually deal with one of the core issues that I thought the Democrats represented in this chamber.
—Are you supporting this bill?
—I am a strong supporter of this bill. It just does not go far enough. And I am supporting the amendments. Perhaps you would be willing to support the amendments, Senator Kemp, just to indicate that you were fair dinkum. Do not be stood over by the National Party. Do not be stood over by Bill Heffernan, just because he is the Prime Minister's hatchet man. Do not be intimidated by him. Do not be intimidated by Senator Parer and his web of trusts. Do not let them stand over you. Indicate your support for these amendments.
As I said, Senator Woodley, it is disappointing that the Democrats have seen their opportunity go to waste for meaningfully addressing massive amounts of tax avoidance by the big end of town. The second biggest furphy about the GST package, and this bill as part of it, is that we will get those tax avoiders and make those people who do not pay their tax pay it. That has been one of the cruellest hoaxes in this debate, because the big end of town, because of weak tax trust laws like this, will still exploit and rip off, and we will still see many people paying minimal tax.
How does it work? I think Brian Toohey probably summed it up. Maybe some people in the chamber at the moment have read his articles. Maybe some people are familiar with this particular one. He said let us find out how fair dinkum these people are about trusts by abolishing the tax-free threshold and seeing how long all those people involved in family trusts actually stay in trusts—because 
 once you abolish the tax-free threshold, you take away the incentive to be in them.
Then you would find out who is fair dinkum, who is about structuring their arrangements to pass on to the family the family farm that Senator Heffernan loves to talk about or that some of the other Liberals and Nationals love to talk about. Let us see what happens after you take away the ability to split income—because that is all this game is about when it comes to trusts and family trusts. It is about spreading your income among as many non-income earners as possible, to use their tax-free threshold. There are some people in this room who know that. Take away the capacity to access that tax-free threshold and let us see how fair dinkum they are. Take away the monetary incentive to be in a trust, and let us find out.
These are the sorts of issues that Treasury should have been putting up as part of the package. These are the sorts of issues they know they would have been run out of town on. They know that this is the sort of issue on which they could have made meaningful tax reform. The Democrats had the opportunity, but the blankets and beads from Manhattan Island were too much for them. It was all too much for them: having all the national media following them around for a few days saying, `Will you? Won't you?'; being invited into 4 Treasury Place and sitting around the table with the fine china out; the prime ministerial charm being on; the chockie bikkies being out instead of the Milk Arrowroots—
—I wish I'd been invited.
—I wish you had been invited too, Senator Woodley, because I might have had more confidence in where your party ended up. If I had known you were in the debate, if I had known you were reflecting what you truly believe—
—I am reflecting on chocolate biscuits at the moment; I did not get any.
—I would feel sold out too. But I tell you what: the rest of your party fell for the Tim Tam.
—They couldn't have taken Senator Woodley. He'd carve his initials in the table.
—That is absolutely right. I do not blame you for being disappointed, Senator Woodley. I would be disappointed, too. I know Senator Kemp did not get any of the chockie biscuits either, because they did not invite him to the negotiations. We all saw who was there, and we know Senator Kemp was not.
—I was in here listening to you.
—Hopefully, you would have learnt something, Senator Kemp.
—No, I learnt nothing.
—Treasury have failed this country. Treasury have championed the GST and this package for 10, 15 or 20 years. Treasury officials who have been involved in this know what needs to be done in the taxing of trusts area. And where is it? They fight a constant battle to shore up the tax base as the accountants get more and more complicated and the lawyers find new ways to get round the system. Treasury and the tax office are left struggling, trying to fill in the loopholes. Here was their chance for a bit of integrity in the tax package. Here was the government's chance to say to the Labor Party, `You will never be able to taunt us about family trusts again.' It was your big opportunity, Senator Kemp, and you have left it to the Heffernans of this world, the Parers of this world, the national parties of this world. Julian McGauran has stood over you on this issue—
Senator Brownhill interjecting—

—Order! It is Senator McGauran.
—Sorry; Senator McGauran has stood over you on this issue. And here he comes now, the eyes and ears of the Prime Minister, the Cardinal. Senator Heffernan has come in to make sure Senator Kemp does not weaken on this issue, to make sure Senator Kemp votes the way he is supposed to. He is not going to allow—
—He is God's gift to the Grange women. Grow up, you dope!
—Senator Heffernan, you need to be careful. If you want to get down in the gutter, Senator Heffernan, it is a two-way street—
—Grow up, you dope. Get to the Grange.
—If you want to get down in the gutter, Senator Heffernan, you will regret it.
—Is that a threat or a promise?
—No, I am just saying that you will regret it.

—Order, please, Senator Heffernan and Senator Conroy! No more interjections, please, Senator Heffernan.
—I am pleased that I have excited some interest in the chamber tonight and I am pleased that some senators have come in to join in the debate. I look forward to them standing and giving a speech about some policy. I look forward to them breaking their duck. I look forward to them giving a speech on a bill about a policy, a tax policy—I would not mind it being any policy. There are 27 bills that we have been debating here today and over the last week or two, and you have had ample opportunity to pick one you knew something about and stand up and talk. And what happens? You leave the chamber again after coming in for a few gutter interjections. There is an opportunity to debate the substance of the bill for 20 minutes tonight, and what happens? You come in, you make a few gutter interjections, and then you leave.
Senator Kemp often says it is 10 steps to courage. In the case of some senators in this chamber, it is as much courage as standing up in front of your microphone and talking on a bill. It is disappointing that they come in, they hurl the gutter insults around, and then they turn round and walk out of the chamber. But I guess we are used to it from some of the senators in this chamber. If you have managed to clock up an entire 15 minutes since you became a parliamentary secretary—15 
 minutes in eight months—I guess you are entitled to just wander in and out of the chamber and be the eyes and ears. But no, you reckon you are an expert on an issue, you are lobbying behind the scenes, you have more family trusts than you can count on one hand—you are entitled to lobby privately. But I just wish you would come in and lobby publicly and have the debate. Don't come in and stand over Senator Kemp like that and make sure he knows that the eyes and ears of the Prime Minister are bearing down on him. Come in and have the debate.
They are the sort of people you are associated with now, unfortunately, Senator Woodley: the sort of people who do not want to disclose where they have these sorts of interests, who do not want to meaningfully address the question of taxing trusts, who have allowed the deluge to get bigger and bigger till the drip has become a deluge. Then, when you get meaningful opportunity, Treasury squibs it and government squibs it. The last hope in the line here was the Democrats, and they squibbed it as well. It is disappointing. I know that many of the people listening tonight will be shaking their heads and saying, `Well, what happened to the Democrats? They used to believe in social justice. They used to believe in meaningful tax reform. They used to care about the people downtrodden in our society. They used to represent those sorts of values.' But for a few trinkets, a few beads and blankets, the Democrats were willing to give it up. The microphones are available any time any senator wants to come back into the chamber. Rather than stick their head in the door and run away again, they have the microphone here. Twenty minutes is available for any senator who wants to come into the chamber right now, after I sit down.
It is a great disappointment to see where the Democrats have got to on this. They still have one last chance. There is an amendment here that will be about meaningfully taxing these tax avoiders and putting meaning into the Prime Minister's words that we will get some of  these  people  to  pay  tax  at  last.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-06-28,"—I have been a member of parliament for about nine years and, to be quite frank, I do not think I have ever heard a worse speech. Senator Conroy rambled on, constantly repeating himself and filling up time, I might say, on the totally mistaken assumption that this debate was being broadcast. Didn't anyone tell Senator Conroy that it is not being broadcast? Had they done so, we might have saved ourselves a 20-minute ramble. It is useful to have a debate about some substance, but Senator Conroy's speech was utterly devoid of substance. He has adopted a style of constantly attacking the integrity of his political opponents, including my two colleagues Senator Bill Heffernan and Senator Parer.
Senator Conroy, you were given a challenge the other day. If you felt so strongly about these people and the personal attacks you made on their integrity, the challenge was there for you to repeat your accusations outside this chamber. But as always happens when people wish to use the cowards' castle, this chamber, to defame other people, you failed to repeat outside the accusations you made. It reflects rather badly on you, Senator Conroy. We know that you have your eye on Senator Faulkner's chair. After his performance in recent years there is clearly a vacancy going for the leadership of the opposition in the Senate. But even you will have to up your game, Senator, before you are able to achieve that prize. I thought there was some chance that you might have achieved this in the short run. I think that after tonight's speech you have to say that your ambitions will have to be put back on hold, at least for a while.
Senator O'Brien interjecting—
—Senator, I do not have any ambitions. I am just here to do my duty and to make sure that good public policy is put into effect. From what I could ascertain from the Labor Party position, they are supporting this bill. That is excellent. There was very strong support from the Democrats for the bill. There was a lot of waxing on about trusts and Senator Conroy's concern. I guess Senator Sherry, who has been a member of the Senate a little longer than I have, 
 would recall that Labor was in office for 13 years and did absolutely nothing.
The trouble is that the Labor Party has got form on so many issues. Labor stands up in debates and attacks the government for this and that and people say, `Hey, what's the Labor Party policy?' No-one knows what the Labor Party policy is, to be quite frank, because an absolute prohibition has been put on Labor Party people making serious policy statements. It is absolutely pathetic. You say, `They were evincing enormous concern about trusts' and we say, `Well, they were in government for 13 years. What did they do about it?'
—Not a GST.
—No, there wasn't a GST. That is true. There was no tax reform under the Labor Party. Looking back on those 13 wasted years, it was a great pity that we did not have a government that was prepared to take a lead and pursue difficult policy positions for the good of the country. The trouble is that the Labor Party has got form. Even worse, from your point of view, Senator Collins, the Labor Party is completely irrelevant to major policy in this country. You ducked the challenge on tax reform. We are all waiting to see your approach to the Ralph reforms. Given Senator Conroy's performance today—I think he is your leading spokesman in this area—you would not hold out any hopes. You would not hold out any hopes at all that a sensible policy position will emerge from the Labor Party. That is a great pity for the Labor Party, but it is a sad reflection on what was once a party that enjoyed some community respect. Now it is just a joke. It has a leader who is a joke. It has a shadow minister for financial services who rambled on for 20 minutes.
—Senator Kemp, that comment should be withdrawn. It is unparliamentary.
—Which comment?
—The comment about the joke. It should be withdrawn. It is unparliamentary.
—I am always one to ensure that my comments are of a parliamentary nature. If I stray to an unparliamentary phrase, I certainly withdraw it.
—Thank you.
—You would have to agree that that was a very gracious withdrawal.
Mr Acting Deputy President, the measures before us are part of a tax reform package. These measures are meant to counter practices where entitlements pass through a series of trusts. For instance, part or all of the net income of a trust may be passed through a series of trusts with no ultimate beneficiary being assessed on that income, either because there is no ultimate beneficiary or because the ultimate beneficiary cannot be identified. Other assets of a trust may be said to be distributed through a series of trusts, yet the assets may never be reflected in the assets of any ultimate beneficiary, or there may be taxpayers whose assets are said to reflect trust distributions which cannot be traced back to the succession of trusts to which they are ascribed.
To control the use of such trusts to avoid tax, these bills require trustees of closely held trusts with trustee beneficiaries to disclose to the Commissioner of Taxation the identity of the ultimate beneficiaries of a trust net income and taxed preferred amounts to which another trust is entitled. The commissioner needs this information to check that the beneficiary who should do so has included his or her share of the net income of the trust in his or her assessable income for the year and to make sure that a beneficiary's assets include any tax preferred amounts which should be included. To reduce compliance costs, a certain number of closely held trusts, such as compliant superannuation funds and deceased estates, have been excluded from the measure.
Furthermore, a trustee need trace an entitlement to net income no further than any range of listed persons, including exempt bodies, charitable trusts and widely held trusts. This also reduces compliance costs. Where a trustee does not give the necessary information in relation to net income of the trust, the bills will impose tax on the trustee in relation 
 to that part of the net income at the top marginal rate plus Medicare levy. If a trustee of a closely held trust does not give the required information about a tax preferred amount, the trustee may be guilty of an offence. We will of course not be supporting the second reading amendment moved by the Labor Party. I commend the bill to the Senate.
—There is a second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook on behalf of the opposition. I intend to put the amendment.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-06-28,"—Last week I advised the Senate of the circumstances that led to the appointment of Mr Laurie Foley to the position of Assistant Director, Air Safety Compliance, with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Mr Foley, as a CASA board member, had participated in the development and approval of a new management structure for the authority. That process created a number of new senior positions. Mr Foley participated in the selection of a recruitment agency to assist CASA in filling those positions. He was also a candidate for one of those positions, but he did not declare an interest.
As I told the Senate last week, at a board meeting on 15 May the process to be followed in interviewing candidates for these jobs and the role of the board in that process were discussed. The process was to involve a number of panels with a member of the board sitting on each panel. Mr Foley told the board he was not able to participate in that process 
 but did not advise his fellow board members as to why he was unavailable.
In fact, Mr Foley did not advise the Chairman, Mr Smith, that he was a candidate for the position of Assistant Director, Air Safety Compliance, until 4 June. That was several months after he had discussions with Spencer Stuart about a possible job—Spencer Stuart being the headhunter consultant being used to fill the vacant positions. It was one month after he had met with the CASA recruitment firm to discuss his candidacy and one month—less two days—after he told Spencer Stuart he was an applicant for the position of Assistant Director, Air Safety Compliance. It was nearly three weeks after he had declined to participate in the staff selection process but had omitted to tell anyone he was a candidate in that process. Mr Foley then waited a further three weeks before he formally tendered his resignation to the minister.
This process is in sharp contrast to the Auditor-General's corporate code of conduct. The Auditor-General said the behaviour of the board affects the integrity, ethics, values and other aspects of corporate culture. What sort of integrity, what sorts of ethics and what sorts of values are conveyed to CASA employees by the manner in which Mr Foley conducted himself?
The CASA board has been quick to criticise some staff for being too close to the industry they regulate. Dick Smith and Mr Toller used terms like `mateship' and `cronyism' when talking about their own staff at the February estimates committee hearings. I do not have to ask what CASA staff think of the manner in which Mr Foley was appointed to a job worth at least $150,000 a year. I do not have to ask what they think of the role played by Mr Willoughby, Mr Smith and possibly others in the creation and filling of a senior management position with one of their own. I know what they think of it.
I now wish to advise the Senate of the actual selection process followed that led to the appointment of Mr Foley. Spencer Stuart advertised these positions in the national press on 1 and 2 May last year. They received 61 applications. Five applicants were short-listed and, according to Mr Toller, three candidates 
 were interviewed. Two were interviewed on or before 24 May—which was a Sunday—and Mr Foley was not interviewed until 1 July. Mr Toller told the committee he interviewed one of the candidates, and possibly both, prior to receiving a report from the recruitment firm. He did not explain why he chose to do the interview prior to getting expert advice from Spencer Stuart. He did say he was asked by Mr Smith to interview one candidate and he did so.
Although Mr Toller alone interviewed the three candidates for the Foley position—at his initiative—he did not look at the original list of applicants or even at an intermediate list. He only received the short list of three candidates. He did, however, see an intermediate list for all of the other positions. I think there were at least three other positions being filled at the same time. The selection panel for the other positions consisted of Mr Toller, a board member, Mr Willoughby and Mr Wheatley from Spencer Stuart.
Despite the fact that Mr Toller had interviewed two of the three candidates for the Foley job on or about 24 May, it was not until 17 June—three weeks later—that Mr Willoughby provided the board with a list of all candidates for all positions and summaries of the leading contenders. Mr Foley was not included in that mail-out. As I said, Mr Toller interviewed Mr Foley on 1 July. Mr Foley was advised on 1 July—the same day—that he had been successful in his application. That appointment, and Mr Foley's resignation from the CASA board, was announced on 3 July.
Despite earlier advice from Mr Toller that there were only three candidates on the short list for the Foley position, there were in fact five. It is not clear who the other short-listed candidates were or why they were not interviewed. There were also two other candidates for the Foley position. Mr Toller thought they were not on the short list of five but Mr Wheatley and Mr Willoughby interviewed them both on the afternoon of 26 June. One was a senior CASA officer from Darwin and the other a senior CASA officer from Adelaide. Both, before they attended the interviews, sought a clear statement that they were 
 being considered for the job. Neither wanted to spend hours in an aircraft—one was flying from Darwin to Canberra—if they were only going to be used to legitimise the interview process.
But that is exactly what happened. Both candidates flew in for the interview. One was interviewed at 2.30 p.m. and the other at 3 p.m. and that was it—half-hour interviews. Mr Toller said the headhunter advised that neither candidate was up to the mark. The committee was told these candidates were interviewed as a result of a decision of the CASA board. I asked whether that decision was minuted. I was assisted at the estimates hearings by Mr Elder, an officer of CASA, who told me that he did not think it was. He said that the decision was possibly taken in a closed or private session. He said:
It would not always be minuted.
Somewhat surprised by that answer, I then asked, `If the board makes a decision, it is a decision, and presumably the board decisions are minuted.' Mr Toller replied:
No, not all decisions. The board makes formal decisions and the board makes informal decisions. All resolutions of the board will be minuted, but informal decisions will not necessarily be minuted.
I then asked what status informal decisions had. I was told that, if they were board decisions and all board members abided by them, they had the power of the board—whatever that means. Mr Elder said that, as far as board decisions taken outside the formal process are concerned, if the board wished to have a decision minuted for the formal record they would advise him and he would record it.
The CASA board has a two-tier system of decision making: a formal decision making process that is minuted, and an informal decision making process that is not minuted. This sits very awkwardly with Mr Barrett's rules. Based on the evidence from both Mr Toller and Mr Elder, minutes from CASA board meetings do not accurately record outcomes from meetings; those minutes only record some decisions. Under such a system, how can the board be properly held accountable for decisions it takes if they are not all recorded? 
My own recent experience allows me to illustrate this point very simply. On 21 July last year I asked a question on notice—question No. 1248—about Mr Foley's application for, and appointment to, the position of Assistant Director. An answer to that question was never provided to me through the normal channels. I actually received a copy of the answer via a freedom of information request. Clearly, the answer was held back in the minister's office. The answer that was prepared contained an error. The error was detected by CASA and corrected. Mr Elder, then General Manager, Corporate Relations, wrote to Carol Boughton, Assistant Secretary, Aviation Industry Division of the department, on 13 October.
The first version of the answer stated the recruitment firm Spencer Stuart had approached Mr Foley on 5 June 1998 and that Mr Foley had agreed to be considered for the position on 7 June. Those dates put the contact between Mr Foley and the recruitment firm one day after he told the board of his intention to apply for the job. Mr Elder advised that the dates should read 5 May and 7 May—a month before the board was advised of his intention. An ungenerous person might conclude that this answer was designed to deceive. A generous person might conclude that CASA's records were inaccurate or incomplete.
In the estimates hearings Mr Toller was also forced to correct another error in that answer No. 1248. The answer claimed that Mr Toller and Mr Willoughby conducted interviews for the Foley position. As we know, Mr Toller alone conducted those three interviews. The same ungenerous person might see this as another attempt to mislead and the same generous person might conclude there were further inaccuracies or omissions in CASA records. Mr Elder was also forced to write to the committee to correct an answer about the timing of the board meeting at which Mr Willoughby proposed a process to select candidates. The original date was given as 15 April; the new date was 15 May.
On 1 June Mr Toller emailed all staff a memo. The subject was a code of conduct and ethics. In a covering note Mr Toller said:
Research has shown that ethical standards of an organisation impact on staff job satisfaction, commitment to the organisation, turnover and levels of stress.
He said that management is about leading by example. He might also like to send a copy of his code of conduct to the board.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Appointment of Mr Laurie Foley</title>,Adjournment,39,1,speech
