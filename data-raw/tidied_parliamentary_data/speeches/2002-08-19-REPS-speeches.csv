"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2002-08-19,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	condemns the action of foreign nationals:
(a)	illegally fishing in the Heard Island and McDonald Zone and stealing an estimated 2,000 tons of Patagonian tooth fish per month;
(b)	for their flagrant disregard for the sovereignty of Australia's exclusive economic zone;
(c)	for decimating an endangered species of albatross and other seabirds by using illegal fishing methods, flouting Australian and international environment regulations; and
(d)	for threatening the future of the species in the area and the commercial sustainability of the Patagonian tooth fish fishery;
(2)	notes that the Australian fishing industry is limited to catching 2,815 tons of Patagonian tooth fish this year;
(3)	notes that if this practice continues, it threatens the estimated $30 million earned annually by the Australian fishing industry, puts at risk the direct employment of approximately 120 people and the indirect employment of approximately 500 people;
(4)	commends the Australian Government for its decision to propose the listing of Patagonian tooth fish on schedule two of the Convention in International Trade and Endangered Flora and Fauna;
(5)	commends the Australian Government for its previous successful apprehension by the Australian Navy of several illegal foreign fishing vessels; and
(6)	in light of the continuing serious breaches, calls on the Government to further strengthen action to prevent any further illegal incursions of our southern exclusive economic zone by:
(a)	continuing naval action to apprehend those responsible for this illegal action;
(b)	implementing a civilian surveillance patrol with an armed boarding capacity;
(c)	substantially increasing the financial penalties to a level that deters future offences;
(d)	working closely with the Australian fishing industry to strengthen surveillance and apprehend offenders;
(e)	seeking further co-operation with the French Government whose territorial integrity is similarly threatened;
(f)	pursuing offenders through dialogue with various countries where operations supporting illegal fishing are based;
(g)	ensuring Australian territorial integrity is maintained. 
Mr Speaker, may I welcome you and my colleagues back and to this next sitting of parliament.
—Thank you.
—I am pleased to be able to speak today on a matter of considerable importance not only to Western Australia but to Australia as a whole. This motion condemns the action of foreign nationals for: (a) illegally fishing in the Heard Island and McDonald Zone and stealing an estimated—by industry—2,000 tons of patagonian toothfish per month; (b) their flagrant disregard for the sovereignty of Australia's exclusive economic zone; (c) decimating an endangered species of albatross and other seabirds by using illegal fishing methods, flouting Australian and international environment regulations; and (d) threatening the future of the species in the area and the commercial sustainability of the patagonian toothfish fishery.
This motion calls for actions to be taken and it also notes that the Australian fishing industry is limited to catching 2,815 tons of patagonian toothfish this year. This figure changes from year to year, depending on the situation. The motion notes that if this practice continues—that is, the poaching of large quantities of patagonian toothfish from our southern oceans—it will threaten the estimated $30 million earned annually by the Australian fishing industry and put at risk the direct employment of 120 people and the indirect employment of around 500 Australians.
The motion commends the Australian government for its decision to propose the listing of the patagonian toothfish on schedule 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. It commends the Australian government for the previous successful apprehension by the Australian Navy of several illegal foreign fishing vessels. I am very pleased that, since this motion appeared on the Notice Paper just prior to parliament rising, the minister has announced further tougher measures to deal with illegal poaching of the patagonian toothfish in Australian waters.
I, and my Western Australian colleagues who also are going to speak on this motion today, commend our government on that action. In light, though, of the continuing serious breaches, we call on the government to further strengthen the action to prevent further illegal incursions into the southern exclusive economic zone. The actions we call for are to: continue naval action to apprehend those responsible for the illegal action; implement a civilian surveillance patrol with an armed boarding capacity; substantially increase the financial penalties to a level that deters future offences; work closely with the Australian fishing industry to strengthen surveillance and apprehend offenders; seek further cooperation with the French government, whose territorial integrity is similarly threatened; pursue offenders through dialogue with various countries where operations supporting illegal fishing are based; and pursue a course to ensure that Australian territorial integrity is maintained.
There are four Australian companies legally allowed to fish in the Heard Island-McDonald Island region; however, only two Western Australian companies are operating fishing boats in that region. These are the trawlers the Austral Leader and the Southern Champion. They are based at Albany, in the electorate of my colleague the member for O'Connor, who is not, at present, in the House. These two companies fish for patagonian toothfish. It is a highly prized fish used for Japanese sashimi, amongst other things. It is also a highly valued fish. This industry contributes $30 million per annum to the Australian economy. These fishing boats fish in some of the most treacherous and rough waters in the world, and our fishermen adhere to strict controls enforced by the Australian government. Australia in fact has one of the best managed toothfish industries in the world—indeed, it has one of the best managed fisheries industries in the world—and it applies very stringent environmental controls on every aspect of our legal industry operators.
We can be very proud of the degree of cooperation that has developed to ensure the long-term viability of our fish stocks. Industry, government and our conservation groups have worked very hard to ensure the best management of our toothfish resources. This attention to management and the strict controls imposed by the government have made toothfishing in the southern oceans a very lucrative operation and, with the fish decimated in other regions due to a lack of appropriate controls and management and a failure to deal with illegal fishing, Australia's southern waters have now become very attractive to illegal poachers.
In the early 1990s, illegal fishing for toothfish began around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands in the Atlantic Ocean and moved to the Falkland Islands zone as controls were implemented by the British government. As the British stepped up the patrols by boarding the illegal boats and prosecuting the offenders, the poachers began moving their operations to around the French island of Crozet and into the South African regions of Prince Edward and Marion islands. Within two years the catches around Prince Edward and Marion islands were so low that the area was regarded as commercially non-viable, and this is the kind of threat that we are faced with if we do not take tough action to deal with poaching. The poachers then moved south and began to illegally fish around the Heard and McDonald islands in Australian territorial waters from 1996.
Unless we take immediate and tough action to stop this poaching the patagonian toothfish will no longer be a commercially viable industry in Australian territorial waters and an industry worth $30 million per annum and providing around 500 jobs will be lost.
In June this year our Minister for the Environment and Heritage announced further protection for two fish species, including the patagonian toothfish, nominating them for inclusion on schedule 11 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, otherwise known as CITES. If that nomination is successful, 159 countries worldwide will impose strict trade regulation on toothfish cargoes entering their ports, demanding certification that the catch is legal. That action is commendable, but, without also taking the tough measures outlined in this motion, the future of the species is doomed.
I am pleased of course to hear of recent cabinet decisions toughening up our actions by increasing patrols; establishing a high-level policy group, which will be particularly welcome; and increasing efforts to apply diplomatic pressure to target the poachers. However, we need to do more. It is imperative that further cooperation is sought from the French government as the poachers are crossing into French territory. There is currently no complementary legislation between our two countries to deal with problems arising from fishing in an area where we have a 200-mile common zone boundary. I am told that the illegal fishermen are known to work just either side of that boundary. The reason for this is that, without complementary legislation between the French and Australian governments, the illegal boats can border hop if they are being chased and so avoid prosecution. If illegal fishing is taking place in the Australian zone, illegal fishers slide into French waters when they see an Australian patrol vessel and the Australian fisheries officers cannot board or prosecute them in French territory. In addition, cooperation would enable cost-effective surveillance and policing of the region.
This motion also calls for increased fines for skippers of illegal vessels. In a recent case the skipper of the Lena was fined $50,000 and his two officers $25,000 each. They do not own the catch on board the boats; they get a percentage. It is good money for two months work; they are paid well. We do not feel that the fines are adequate to discourage illegal poaching.
As outlined in the motion, I commend the government for the recent cabinet decision. Our environment and our commercially viable fish stocks are endangered by this illegal activity. I would like to see further action taken to ensure that Australian territorial integrity is maintained so that we have a viable fishing industry in Australia. We must not only support our fishing industry, which already has tough regulations, but also ensure that those concerned abide by the regulations. We must work cooperatively with the government and conservation groups to ensure a future for the patagonian toothfish.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Fisheries: Illegal Operators</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—I am delighted to support the motion on illegal fishing—not in all of its language but in the sentiments it expresses. I resist expressing my support for it on a word-for-word basis because I do have some reservations, which I will come to later, regarding the congratulations the member for Pearce extended to the government in relation to the actions it has taken. Her view is that more should be done in this area—a view that I share, and one that I hope we will all join in. 
The fishing of our open oceans and our economic zones is amongst the most difficult issues that we have to confront. Essentially the fishing industry is one where a market solution cannot obtain unless governments create and enforce a market based solution. Fishing is one of those terrible industries where we have seen time and time again a resource entirely destroyed. If people believe there is illegal and illicit action, they will continue to strip the resource away because they believe that, if they do not take that resource, someone else will. In my own state of Tasmania the scallop industry was virtually wiped out and orange roughy was almost eliminated as a species. When you have what is called a `commons'—that is, a resource that is simply pelagic if it swims or aerial if it flies—unless you get a solution that covers all those who would exploit that resource you end up either removing its economic value or perhaps exterminating the species entirely. 
When it comes to extinction stories, the greatest story relates to the passenger pigeon in the United States. When Europeans first went to the United States they said that the skies went grey for weeks, that you could not see the sun for passenger pigeons, yet, within 60 years, the last passenger pigeon had died. Everyone saw it as simply a resource that could not be exterminated; yet it was.
We have seen the pelagic species toothfish virtually wiped out, right across those southern water ridges. The Falkland Islands and a number of other places have been mentioned. Essentially, the pirates—the carrion of the sea that come and exploit this resource illegally—have no respect whatsoever for the environmental consequences, let alone the economic consequences for the governments that might otherwise benefit from a share in that resource. They are pirates. We need an effective policing regime. We have not had that in the past, notwithstanding what the government might now say about defensive actions previously taken. We have chartered a couple of vessels from time to time to go down to the region, but they are not there on patrol most of the time. It is sporadic; it is hardly a deterrent. The vessels that we do charter do not have the capacity to board or seize vessels at sea. The only instance where a vessel of any large scale has been seized was as a result of a slow pursuit all across the southern oceans, right to South Africa. `Chug, chug, chug', is how it followed this vessel. If it had half a knot more speed, it would have got away. That was one episode. We do not have a deterrent; we have a sham. Let us do more about that.
The Labor Party proposed to the last government the establishment of a coastguard. As part of that coastguard strategy, we wanted to integrate the leasing arrangements of the fisheries into a purpose designed fleet of vessels to do the tasks that would be required to not just prevent illegal immigration, drugs and what have you but also enforce quarantine and fisheries laws and protect all those economic resources that matter to Australia for environmental reasons. We need to have some decent sized vessels to deal with the very decent sized vessels that these pirates are using. We need legal regimes to impose very high penalties. There are stronger penalties for poaching abalone in Bass Strait than for sweeping up like a Hoover vacuum cleaner these pelagic resources in tonnes and tonnes, diminishing our economic resources and perhaps condemning that species to the fate of the passenger pigeon. There is an environmental responsibility nationally and internationally—a responsibility that this nation has not yet met. I commend the member for Pearce for putting this matter back on the agenda of this House and I wish the motion well.

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2002-08-19,"—I commend the members for Pearce and Denison for addressing this important issue. The patagonian and antarctic toothfish is a high-value table fish found in remote southern oceans, including Australian waters around Heard, McDonald and Macquarie islands. The high value of toothfish in the United States, Japan, Canada and Europe has made it a prime target for illegal fishermen. Illegal fishing for toothfish began—as the member for Pearce mentioned—around South Georgia and the south Sandwich Islands in the Atlantic in the early 1990s, and moved into the Falkland Islands zone soon after. As stringent controls were exerted over illegal fishing by the UK government in that area, the poachers moved eastward to less well patrolled areas—hence proving that patrols do work. By 1996 the poachers had centred their operations on the French island of Crozet and South African regions of Prince Edward and Marion islands. Within two years the catches in this area were so low, even for the poachers, that the area became commercially non-viable. The poachers then moved south and began to fish illegally around France's Kerguelen Island and Australia's Heard and McDonald islands.
Australia has one of the best managed toothfish fisheries in the world, with strictly enforced controls on every aspect of the industry, to protect the environment and to ensure the sustainability of the fishing ground. It has been developed with strong cooperation from the industry itself, together with government and conservation groups. It is precisely because it is so well managed and regulated that it has become one of the most lucrative fishing grounds for the poachers. The current total allowable catch level for toothfish in the Australian exclusive economic zone around Heard and McDonald islands is 2,815 tonnes for this year. This is a reduction of almost 1,000 tonnes per year from the level that was set in 1988, and represents a loss of approximately $7 million annually. Significantly, this reduction in the total allowable catch is due directly to illegal fishing.
The legal operators who require to fish for toothfish use a trawl method of fishing—that is, using nets which are towed behind the boat. The poachers, however, use long-lines—a method where thousands of hooks are set along the bottom attached to a main line. Long-line fishing is notorious for catching seabirds on hooks as the lines are being set. I have seen video footage of thousands of birds being swamped and drowned, and they wind up becoming the bait. It is posing a major threat to many species of seabird, including the albatross.
The French and Australian territories have a common 200-mile zone boundary. As the member for Pearce mentioned, these illegal fishermen know how to work this boundary very well. They do this because as yet we have no concrete arrangement in place between us and the French government, although that is happening. They just jump from each side of the boundary and elope from our pursuit. If they are fishing in Australian waters, it means they just shoot over to the French side and frustrate us. If they are fishing in the French waters and the French attack, they come to our side and frustrate the French. I am sure that neither the French nor the Australians like to be frustrated. A joint arrangement with the French would enable cost-effective surveillance and the policing of the region. The only way to stop the poachers is to have a constant, regular presence of compliance officers with the power to apprehend illegal fishermen in either zone.
The fines imposed on the skippers of illegal fishing vessels are paltry. The value of the illegal catch is frequently $2 million to $3 million, so fines of a mere $25,000, $50,000 or even $100,000 are hardly a deterrent. It is estimated that, if illegal fishing continues at present levels, the fisheries will be seriously compromised by 2014. If fishing increases—which it probably will—the time frame becomes smaller. The companies which operate legally in the area fear that their operations will be prevented far in advance of 2014. Their information on current illegal catches, which has been passed on to the Australian Federal Police and government agencies, suggests that legal fishing in the area could be closed down within two years. This is a multifactorial problem and needs to be addressed in a very serious manner. I again thank the member for Pearce for bringing it to the attention of the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Fisheries: Illegal Operators</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—I too support the intent of this motion on illegal fishing and acknowledge the challenges facing authorities in managing Australia's fishery in subantarctic waters around Heard Island and the McDonald islands. I also want to talk about some issues confronting our fishing industry much closer to home—in particular, in Tasmania—which I will come to shortly.
Pressure has been mounting on the government for a considerable time, particularly since 1997, to properly defend our Southern Ocean fisheries in the face of an onslaught by illegal fishers. It is clear that the government must do more to protect endangered fish stocks and the broader marine environment in this region. A feature article in the Bulletin of 19 March this year reported that illegal fishing in the vast and inhospitable southern waters has `become an environmental and security nightmare for Australia'. Indeed, this is the case. The international community is closely watching Australia's response—which, to date, could best be described as spur of the moment and underprepared. What is at stake, though, is a unique marine environment in our most remote fishery. The government finally agreed recently to seek further protection from illegal fishing of an endangered fish species in the remote Antarctic waters by nominating the patagonian toothfish for inclusion on schedule 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. I commend the government for at least that action.
Ultimately, it is hoped that this will be a powerful trade regulating measure. It is evident that the trade must be controlled if we are to have a sustainable fishery. It is crucial that Australia works with toothfish trading countries to restrict market access for the illegal catchers. Illegal catches of the highly sought after patagonian toothfish—also known as Chilean sea bass—which fetch up to $100 a kilogram, are costing the Australian fishing industry dearly. It has been estimated that, at the current rate, the viability of the legal fishery could be threatened in three to five years. The Australian fishing industry is limited to catching 2,815 tonnes of patagonian toothfish this year. Yet, on the government's estimates—and on the AFFA web site, where there is more information pertaining to this—21,000 tonnes of toothfish have been illegally taken from the region over the past four years, since a larger number of fishing boats were detected illegally fishing in the area. The stolen catch is estimated to be valued at $129 million. It should also be noted that the illegal fishing vessels are long-liners, which are responsible for killing thousands of endangered albatross. Therefore, the method of fishing is as much an issue as is the magnitude of the poaching.
The mover of this motion, the member for Pearce, seeks to commend the government for the successful apprehension by the Australian Navy of several illegal foreign fishing vessels in the region. But what about the ones that got away? I think the saga of that story was aptly described by my colleague the member for Denison. I note that the legal Western Australian based fishing fleet that works this region of the Southern Ocean wants patrols of Australia's Antarctic territory waters stepped up to help stamp out poaching of the patagonian toothfish. That would appear to be a reasonable request if the fishery were to be properly policed. Who could do the policing and what kinds of vessels would be needed, or be best suited, given the notorious southern seas? What about the cost? Should it be the responsibility of the Navy—and one doubts whether it would be all that interested—or a Customs fleet? These issues are yet to be sorted out and are very important.
The mover of this motion calls on the government to continue naval action to apprehend those responsible for illegal fishing as well as to implement a civilian surveillance patrol, with an armed boarding capacity and which would work closely with the Australian fishing industry, to strengthen surveillance and to apprehend offenders. Maybe this role would better sit with an Australian coastguard—that is, if we had one. Remember, the Labor Party at the last election proposed an Australian coastguard and yet the government dismissed the suggestion out of hand. It does not sound like a bad idea at the moment—noting also that the French have three vessels on constant patrols in their waters.
Closer to home, I would like to talk about the management of Commonwealth fisheries, where it is no less important. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority is seeking public comment on a draft proposal to bring our most important fisheries under a single management plan. These fisheries include the South East Trawl Fishery, the South East Non-Trawl Fishery, the Southern Shark Fishery and the Great Australian Bight Trawl Fishery. I urge all those who would be working under the new plan to join together with organisations to make their voices clear on these matters.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2002-08-19,"—I commend the motion on illegal fishing to the House, and congratulate the member for Pearce for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. All members of this House should be very concerned about not only the patagonian toothfish but also protecting Australian resources and Australia's borders—in this case, its southern borders. I spoke about this issue in the adjournment debate some months ago and I have been following it very closely ever since—as have other members. It has moved considerably since then in terms of the government's action and the actions of the illegal poachers or pirates. At that stage, I listed the details—and named a number of the fleet that are in the Southern Ocean—that need to continue to be monitored.
One of the things that needs to be known is that this illegal activity is largely based in Hong Kong and is run by a Hong Kong businessman who has shifted his company internationally. It has involved an element of the Russian mafia, and it has overtones of the behaviour of pirates—as I have said—pirating our fish stocks in the Southern Ocean. This Hong Kong businessman is very clever, as he registers several veneers of company names in many countries—rebadging the boats' names and rebadging their ownership—and it is very difficult for any authority to track down the ownership, the destination or the control of not only the boats but also the companies that purport to run this illegal business. It is a very lucrative business, as we have already found out. One trip to the Southern Ocean nets one of these illegal boats something like $3 million in catch. We should be very concerned, as the member for Braddon has already mentioned, that something like $120 million is being plundered from our ocean.
If we were allowing people to come and plunder us a bit closer to home, you could imagine the hue and cry. But, because it is a bit further down towards the Southern Ocean, it is a case of out of sight, out of mind. I note that the government has taken action through the minister in relation to a recent cabinet submission. I too would like to see greater evidence of activity in the Southern Ocean, because these people are still down there with their boats at the moment. Because of my continued monitoring of this matter, I am informed that the Jackson and TheIsabel are currently down there. Two more boats are under construction in Taiwan and will be sent down to the Southern Ocean. This business is so lucrative that these boats continue to be built. In one trip they virtually pay for themselves. After two trips, it is a handsome profit.
I, like other members, have been over the South Tomi, the Lena and the Volga, which are tied up at Henderson and Fremantle. These boats have been heavily modified for the Southern Ocean: they are closed in because of the rough seas and cold climate; they are really sweatshops. As I have mentioned previously, there are tiers of workmen on these boats, from Spanish skippers to processors from Third World countries, and Thailand and other South-East Asian countries. These people operate for just a few dollars a day, hooking up these long-lines which, as the member for Braddon has said, is a great tragedy in Southern Ocean fishing. Australian fishermen are restricted to trawling. They are monitored by people from the Australian fishing industry who check that the waste from processing is not thrown overboard to interfere with the pristine condition of the Southern Ocean. They also make sure that the bycatch is released back into the ocean. The long-liners catch anything and, quite often, they lose them, so the whole catch sits on the bottom of the ocean, including the albatrosses and all the other endangered species in this part of the world. I do not want these boats sold back to the market. It is crazy that these boats can be retendered and sold back to the market to be used again.

"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—It is my pleasure to join with the honourable member for Pearce and other colleagues—particularly so many Western Australian colleagues—in condemning the actions of foreign nationals illegally fishing in Australia's fishing zone for their disregard of Australia's sovereignty as well as for ignoring both Australian and international environment regulations. Not only do their actions threaten the future of the patagonian toothfish species itself in this area but, ultimately, they threaten the commercial viability of the fishery, a very important fishing industry, particularly from a Western Australian point of view. It is estimated that well in excess of 16,000 tonnes of patagonian toothfish has been taken illegally in the last five years.
I particularly want to commend the work of officers of the Western Australian Department of Fisheries for the successful delivery of fisheries compliance services in the Commonwealth waters adjacent to Western Australia and the offshore territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Heard Island and McDonald islands in the Australian fishing zone. The Department of Fisheries carries out compliance services under contract to and on behalf of the Commonwealth under a surveillance and enforcement program funded and managed by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. Generally, what this means is that the WA department provides highly skilled and experienced fisheries officers for deployment on patrol in the Southern Ocean who are responsible for gathering and interpreting intelligence, leading surveillance patrols, carrying out surveillance duties, undertaking investigations, apprehending offenders, providing briefs of evidence and giving evidence for prosecution purposes, along with the caretaking and possible repatriation of apprehended crews and their associated fishing vessels. I think it is important to note and also commend the work of the dedicated group of officers, stationed in both Perth and Broome, involved in patrols onboard Royal Australian Navy vessels, along with Coastwatch and Royal Australian Air Force aircraft. 
I also join honourable members in calling on the government to strengthen actions to prevent further illegal incursions into the Australian fisheries zone. It seems somewhat ironic that a report on Coastwatch was undertaken during the last parliament and saw a government majority call for the strengthening of Coastwatch. Ironically, the same majority report denigrated the Labor opposition's proposal for the introduction of a coastguard. Nevertheless, report No. 384, undertaken by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit, was tabled in August last year. Despite this government's attention to so-called border protection over the last 12 months, there has been no effective government response to this report. Clearly, there are problems with fisheries surveillance under the current government arrangements. For example, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority chartered a vessel, the MV Cape Grafton, to carry out monitoring and surveillance patrols of Heard and McDonald islands because the Australian Fisheries Management Authority does not have a vessel with long-range capability. As we have heard from other speakers, there was one patrol in 1999 of 40 days and one patrol in early 2000 of some 50 days duration. Both patrols were led by officers from the WA Department of Fisheries. It seems to me that the purchase of such long-range vessels would better enable the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to protect the Australian fishing zone and the associated fishing industry. I urge the government to act upon this matter with some urgency. Illegal fishing is clearly a coordinated criminal activity and, indeed, the last two vessels that were apprehended had fish worth in excess of $2 million on board.
I commend the Australian government for its decision to propose the listing of the patagonian toothfish on schedule 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. While commending the government on tackling this issue I also express my great concern at the lack of action by the government on other important environmental issues impacting on all Australians, our biodiversity and our economy. I particularly note the so-called expenditure which was intended to be spent on civil maritime surveillance and response which was underspent by some $132 million last year. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Fisheries: Illegal Operators</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2002-08-19,"—I support this motion by my colleague the member for Pearce. It is crucial in the campaign to ensure the illegal poaching of patagonian toothfish is stamped out. This is no backyard fishing enterprise that we are concerned about; this is organised crime designed to exploit a highly prized and endangered fish, and this criminal activity is undermining our Australian fishing industry. International corporate criminals fund fishing boats to provide this endangered species to a growing and lucrative black market, mainly in the United States, Europe and Japan. These criminals are prepared to risk atrocious weather, arrest, imprisonment, huge fines and the forfeiture of vessels to illegally take patagonian toothfish. The catch from one voyage can bring the poachers rewards of up to $4 million; that is $4 million out of the pockets of Australian people. Targeting Australia's exclusive economic zone in the sub-Antarctic waters near Heard and McDonald islands, they blatantly snub their noses at what is our sovereign authority. This is not only humiliating Australia internationally but is risking our chances to claim and secure further zones for gazettal as Australian. If we cannot patrol and control activity in our existing zones, what makes us think we can responsibly take control and authority for others in the future?
The patagonian toothfish is an impressive species. It can reach over two metres in length and over 100 kilograms in weight. Research at the Australian National University in Canberra has indicated that toothfish can live to more than 35 years of age. The flesh is highly prized in many countries, including the US, and can demand up to $100 a kilo. I welcome and also commend the federal government's actions in June to nominate the patagonian and antarctic toothfish for listing under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and look forward to the outcome of that nomination. The fishing industry puts our chances in gaining that listing as slim, and that is a fair statement. This is the first time a commercial-scale fish has been nominated for listing and we need to argue our case with 153 other countries in Chile in October. I believe that, even if listing is not achieved, bringing the problem yet again to international attention is imperative. We need to raise awareness of the severity of the problem both here in Australia and in those countries where the black market exists. We need international recognition that this is a fish species at risk of commercial extinction and we need international support behind us as we put in place tough measures aimed at protecting both the species and our industry.
The patagonian toothfish is a relatively new catch for Australia's fishing industry and one that, with careful monitoring and control, could be very rewarding. Illegal fishing is putting that entire industry at risk. It is no exaggeration to claim that, at the current level of unlicensed overfishing, commercial stocks could start crashing to commercial extinction within a very short time. We have a responsibility to act with whatever it takes to stop this. If this requires the continued use of force or armed surveillance, then those processes should be kept in place and increased. The defence forces have been armed when apprehending a number of boats and I would encourage the continuation of this method. Presently, the legitimate fishing industry is netting a legal total allowable catch of over 2,000 tonnes of patagonian toothfish per annum, with an estimated 3,000 tonnes each year taken illegally by poachers. The legal industry has an estimated annual revenue of $30 million and employment of more than 100 people.
The Hon. Ian Macdonald, the minister responsible for the fisheries portfolio, says the patagonian fishery could be deemed exhausted in just seven years if some control is not put in place urgently. His estimation is that, should illegal fishing continue at the current rate, the fishery will be exhausted by 2014 and, if the poachers double their current catches, then it will be gone in just seven years. The key to a sustainable fishery is monitoring and control of quotas taken. At the current rate, legitimate quotas cannot be increased without severe detriment to the fishery. If the illegal fishing catch can be cut, the fishery can continue indefinitely.
The federal government has not been complacent in its fight against illegal fishing and should be commended for introducing measures to deter, apprehend and punish offenders. Together with increasing patrols, new measures in the Heard and McDonald islands fisheries include establishing a high-level policy group, enhancing international agreements and increasing diplomatic pressure to target poachers. The courts also need to ensure that the full force of the law comes down on those who flout our fishing regulations. Of the five boats apprehended in the past few years, some of the vessels have been forfeited and heavy fines have been imposed. But I use the example of the apprehension of the fishing boat Eternal, which was chased for 12 hours in early July this year. This is the second time this year that the particular vessel has been caught poaching patagonian toothfish. Previously named the Arvisa-One, it was discovered by the Perth based Austral fishery ship Southern Champion. In order to protect this resource we need international cooperation, naval patrols—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Fisheries: Illegal Operators</title>,Private Members' Business,1,1,speech
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—The motion put forward by the honourable member for Pearce is worthy of our support. It addresses the serious economic, security and environmental concerns that are held by the Australian community generally with regard to illegal and unregulated poaching of our flora and fauna, but in particular this motion supports concerns regarding the illegal fishing of the patagonian toothfish within the Australian exclusive economic zone in the Southern Ocean. The concerns that Australians hold are directly related to protecting Australian jobs and local enterprises as well as the protection of our endangered and threatened species. 
The patagonian toothfish is highly prized and therefore is the subject of a great deal of poaching. It does have a relatively low fecundity rate and so the size of the illegal catches at the moment clearly threaten this species. Currently the value of illegal fishing is put between $250 million and $1 billion per annum, depending on the final retail price of those catches. That is a serious threat to our local industry in our southern waters. That industry currently generates $30 million per year and provides 120 direct and 500 indirect jobs. Environmentally, the illegal use of the long-line fishing method by poachers of the toothfish has a secondary effect, threatening particularly the albatross as well as other seabirds caught in the hundreds of hooks that are used. The motion also supports the government's action in proposing the listing of the patagonian toothfish on schedule 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. This measure is to be encouraged. It is a stronger measure that enables a more global approach to monitoring illegal poaching of the toothfish and enlists the support of many more countries in policing the illegal trade of this species.
The motion also notes the success of previous pursuit and apprehension activities by our Australian Defence Force, and it proposes tougher measures to be pursued. It is absolutely essential for the Australian government to take stronger measures against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in our exclusive economic zone. To enforce that requires strong measures indeed. This motion proposes measures that should provoke consideration and debate rather than disagreement. To be successful, the measures require international diplomacy. That means raising these issues at international forums, entering into trade agreements that are mutually respectful and assisting neighbour nations such as Indonesia, where home porting is frequently an issue. To successfully track the trade in toothfish and locate sales and sources requires strong international cooperation. It seems that this government needs to lift its game in foreign diplomacy regarding trade and international relations.
The motion also suggests that we need to build on the successful interception of three vessels over the past year. This raises issues of coastal surveillance, satellite monitoring and the presence of our ships around the Australian coastline. It is important that we be prepared to show our strength in policing our waters. This motion recommends something like a coastguard, to complement a naval presence.
Having just come back from a week on a naval vessel in the north of Australia, I am very much aware of the current high level of demand on our Navy. I welcome the call for a coastguard presence, but I also think the government needs to reorder its priorities and to stop wasting funds on the Pacific solution so we can give our Australian Defence Force the resources it needs to effectively deal with the surveillance of our waters and the protection of our species.
The other area that requires government attention for successful results is our support for international efforts aimed at better corporate regulation. Multiple front companies in ownership structures, organised crime, reflagging vessels to countries prepared to turn a blind eye to the source of the catch and bogus catch documentation papers are some of the things taking place. It seems to me that this is another area of corporate regulation that the government needs to give attention to. I support the motion and the proposed government action.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—The most contentious transport issue in my electorate concerns the federal government's failure to fully fund the M5 ramps at Ingleburn, even though this project is part of the National Highway Network, a very clear federal government responsibility. The transport minister, Mr Anderson, announced last month that he was only willing to meet two-thirds of the estimated $7 million cost. This is an example of federal government cost shifting onto state and local government. The government has an inquiry into cost shifting; this instance should be exhibit A. Instead of attacking Campbelltown Council over this issue, the member for Macarthur, Mr Farmer, should be fighting for full federal funding. As he admitted at a public meeting on 3 July, the Howard government did nothing about the ramps for six years. The member for Macarthur said that he was the first federal MP from Campbelltown to personally approach Mr Anderson on this issue. This is a terrible reflection on his Liberal predecessor in the seat of Macarthur, Mr John Fahey. According to Mr Farmer, John Fahey sat at the same cabinet room table with the minister for transport for six years, and never raised the issue of the M5 ramps—an essential piece of infrastructure in south-west Sydney. They reckon that I am tough on the Liberal Party; here is one of their own attacking his Liberal Party predecessor, John Fahey—someone who is recovering from the trauma of lung cancer. He has been pretty hard on his own side, but I suppose, at one level, there is some truth in what he says: the government did nothing for six years about the M5 ramps at Ingleburn, and now we have a lame-duck announcement from the Minister—just two-thirds of the funding—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Roads: National Highways Network</title>,Statements by Members,2,1,speech

An attack on Iraq at this time would seriously jeopardise, if not destroy, the global campaign against terrorism we have undertaken.
Does the minister agree or disagree with the former national security adviser's position?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2002-08-19,"—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have had the opportunity to read Brent Scowcroft's article, and I think that, at the end of the day, these are balance of judgment arguments about a hypothetical proposition. The important thing to understand here is that, first of all, the international community, including the United States, needs to maintain as much pressure as it possibly can on Iraq to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions and to allow in United Nations inspectors from UNMOVIC to ensure that all weapons of mass destruction capabilities within Iraq are destroyed. The task at the moment is to make sure that everything is done to achieve that.
If the United States eventually comes to a conclusion that it has no alternative but to take military action—and that is, of course, a hypothetical proposition—and when that time comes, if it ever does come, then I do not doubt that the sorts of issues that Mr Scowcroft and others who have been participating in this debate have raised will be taken into account. But obviously, at the end of the day, these issues are always difficult issues and always boil down to a very complex balance of judgment, and the judgment about a question of going to war would be one that no doubt the United States administration, in particular the President, would weigh very heavily. No doubt there would be substantial consultations with allies. All of this, if that situation were to arise, would arise in circumstances where it was perfectly clear that United Nations efforts, which are still going on, would irretrievably have broken down—there is no question of that. Today, in August 2002, efforts are still being made fervently by UNMOVIC, the United Nations agency which is responsible for the inspections in Iraq, and by the Secretary-General himself, so we wish them well.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2002-08-19,"—There is a statement I want to make to the House before we move to any questions to the Speaker. On Thursday, 27 June I was asked a number of questions about the application of standing order 152, relating to the addressing of questions to the Speaker at the conclusion of question time. I was specifically asked if a question addressed to the Speaker on that day constituted a precedent and, if so, the implications of that.
There are many precedents since the provisions of the standing order became operative in 1994 of a minister or parliamentary secretary asking the Speaker questions. These precedents cover members of both political persuasions. The questions have related to the Speaker's administrative functions, which are within the strict application of standing order 152, as well as being on procedural matters. Again, Speakers originating from both sides of politics have allowed the application of standing order 152 to encompass procedural as well as administrative matters.
In raising the issue, the members for Fraser and Brand cited House of Representatives Practice, pages 520-521. This section deals with questions without notice and points out that ministers and parliamentary secretaries may not ask such questions. As I understand it, this stipulation relates to the convention of collective cabinet or ministerial responsibility, mentioned at pages 47 and 48 of House of Representatives Practice. Such questions should not be openly addressed during question time. I believe that many of us have a suspicion from time to time that a particular question may be what is colloquially called a `dorothy dixer'. To permit ministers to address questions to each other in question time would raise dorothy dixers to an art form.
Pages 177 and 525 of House of Representatives Practice address questions to the Speaker under standing order 152. The commentary states that such questions may be put by `Members', and there is no suggestion that ministers or parliamentary secretaries are excluded. The fact that standing order 152 provides that questions to the Speaker occur at `the conclusion of the question period' clearly indicates that these questions are distinguishable from questions without notice. The prohibition on ministers and parliamentary secretaries in relation to questions without notice does not apply to questions put to the Speaker.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Standing Order 152</title>,Questions to the Speaker,7,1,speech

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—I have a question to you, Mr Speaker. During question time you indicated to the House that, after a conference at which you had spoken, you had responded to questions, including a question from the Australian journalist Matt Price as to a conversation you had had with the Leader of the House about question time conduct. You might recall, Mr Speaker, a question I asked you on 29 May about a conversation you had had with the Leader of the House about question time conduct. In reply to me, you said:
... yes, I did have words with the minister. No, I do not intend to canvass the matter any further, any more than I would any other conversation I had had with any other member of this House.
Given your comments at question time, does this mean a change of approach on your part?

"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2002-08-19,"—The member for Perth I know asked the question with good intent. There has probably been some confusion as a result of my hurried response to, I think, a point of order from the member for Swan. First, I should say that the conversation with Mr Price was, as far as I know, unrelated to the conference I had just addressed. I was returning from the conference when he called me on the car phone and he was asking about question time procedure and things like that, in view of the opening of the spring session. 
I did not canvass with Mr Price any of the proposals that I had discussed with the Manager of Government Business. I merely indicated to Mr Price that in advancing these proposals I had had casual conversations actually with the member for Lilley and with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations had been supportive of standing order changes that would allow changes to occur to question time. There was nothing more precise or specific than that. I can understand, given that the conference preceded this, and given my earlier reply, that it may have implied that whatever I had said in answer to questions at the conference had been followed up by Mr Price.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Question Time: Conduct</title>,Questions to the Speaker,9,1,answer

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2002-08-19,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes with alarm the serious decline in the population of the Great Apes-gorillas, bonobos, orangutans and chimpanzees, which could lead to their extinction in the next 10 years;
(2)	recognises that habitat destruction due to illegal logging, mining and associated activities including poaching, are all contributing to this threat of extinction;
(3)	acknowledges that war, civil unrest and a breakdown in law and order also contribute to the problems in many of these habitat areas;
(4)	notes Australian Government participation, principally through zoos and also with the Humane Society International, in the conservation of the Great Apes;
(5)	notes the support of the UK Government for the Great Apes Survival Project, which is backed by the UN Environment Programme; and
(6)	calls on the Federal Government to increase its support for the efforts of the UN Environment Programme to help save the Great Apes.
I think this is a very important motion. This has been brought to my attention by a constituent of mine, Dr Selby King. When you look at what is happening with the great apes in the world, it is extremely disturbing. By way of background, the great apes are made up of chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans. I will go through them one by one. Firstly, there are two species of gorillas—the eastern and the western—and these are further divided into several subspecies, the Eastern Lowlands Gorilla and the Mountain Gorilla. These are severely threatened by habitat loss and poaching. Both inhabit Africa's Great Lakes region, which has endured more than a decade of armed conflict. It is estimated that there are currently around 650 Mountain Gorillas in existence.
The Eastern Lowlands Gorilla is threatened by bushmeat hunters and by encroachment. The Western Gorilla species is divided into two subspecies—the Western Lowlands Gorilla and the Cross River Gorilla. The exact number of Western Lowlands Gorillas is unknown but has been estimated to be around 111,000; however, the hunting of these gorillas for bushmeat as logging companies have opened up major forest areas may have significantly reduced the numbers. There are far fewer Cross River Gorillas—there are possibly only 1,000 left in the world—because the restricted habitat of this ape places it under pressure. 
There are four subspecies of chimpanzees, and some sources have suggested that chimpanzees may number up to 200,000; however, the actual figure is probably closer to 100,000. Separate populations range in size from 12,000 Western Chimpanzees, which are distributed from Nigeria to Senegal, to around 80,000 Central Chimpanzees, which are found mainly in Gabon, Cameroon and the Congo. All the species are listed as endangered on the 1996 International Union for Conservation Red List of Threatened Animals. Along with bonobos, chimpanzees are our closest living relatives. They live in complex communities and are believed to be extinct in five African countries. Their numbers are declining over most of their range.
The orang-outang fits into two subspecies—those living in Sumatra and those living in Borneo. Their numbers in the wild are currently estimated at less than 25,000, which is a decline of between 30 and 50 per cent over the last decade. That is quite disturbing. The estimated population in the Gunung Leuser National Park and the surrounding area was 9,200 in 1993. Since then, the numbers have declined by 45 per cent. The destruction of their rainforest habitat has placed them in great danger of extinction. This habitat has been subjected to illegal logging and to conversion for use by humans. 
Bonobos are sometimes referred to as pygmy chimpanzees, and their habitat is, unfortunately, limited to the war-ravaged Congo. There are indications that these apes are being killed for bushmeat and that their orphaned young are being sold to the pet trade.
The question is not only why do we want to see the great apes preserved but also why do we see them as being so special? There are many reasons. Significantly, chimpanzees and bonobos share 98.4 per cent of our human DNA, gorillas share 97.7 per cent, and orang-outangs share 96.4 per cent. They are our closest cousins in the animal kingdom. As I have said, considerable pressure is being placed on their habitats, and their populations have fallen dramatically. The threats that now face ape populations include all of what I have said before as well as war, conflict, human expansion, mining, agriculture, logging, forest fires, hunting for bushmeat, and the capture of live specimens for sale. 
It is interesting to note that significant scientific studies over the past 50 years have substantially improved our knowledge of the great apes. Studies show that they possess self-awareness, remarkable intelligence and an ability to communicate by using signs and symbols. It seems quite ironic that the great apes are legally protected in every country they inhabit but that this legal protection is not matched by enforcement in many of these countries. It is also important to note that international trade of the animals for primarily commercial purposes is banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and yet high prices still lure illegal hunters and traders.
There are a number of reasons for the decline in numbers of the great apes. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature there are six categories, and I would like to elaborate on them. The first category is habitat loss. The destruction of tropical rainforests is the biggest threat to the survival of the great apes in both Asia and Africa. Even where apes such as gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos adapt to selective logging by using small clearings and secondary forests, they can be at greater risk from hunting. In the case of the orang-outang, mining and logging have resulted in greater hunting pressure.
The second category is illegal hunting, which is of great concern. Despite the fact that hunting of the animals is illegal, it is still occurring widely. The third category is trade in live apes. Despite the ban on international trade under the CITES convention, it is estimated that, in the 20 years up to the late 1980s, between 40,000 and 90,000 animals were taken for this trade—which is quite staggering. In 1990 it was estimated that at least 230 orang-outangs were kept as pets, as part of nightclub attractions, or in private zoos in Taiwan.
The fourth category of threat is disease. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Veterinary Specialist Group, the great apes display scant resistance to some of the pathogens which affect their human relatives. The fifth category is medicine. Body parts of great apes have been used for medicinal purposes in Africa and in Asia. Where great ape populations are small, killing of individual animals can be significant, such as in Nigeria, where Western Lowland Gorillas are critically endangered. Uncontrolled use of gorilla body parts for medicine could threaten survival of the whole population. The sixth category is civil unrest. For example, Mountain Gorillas were killed by soldiers during civil unrest in Rwanda and Zaire. 
What is being done? The United Nations Environment Program and the Great Apes Survival Project are very important. In September last year, the UN Environment Programme welcomed a pledge by the United Kingdom for substantial support for an international effort to save the remaining great apes. The UK government, the first government to formally support the Great Apes Survival Project, is to be congratulated on that. There are a number of other programs, but in the time that remains to me I want to quote from a letter I received from the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Program, Mr Klaus Topfer. The letter stated:
The Sydney Olympics, which have been described as the `greenest Olympics ever', illustrated to the world how environmentally aware Australia is. Recent surveys have shown that the great majority of Australians consider environmental protection to be at least equally important to the rate of economic growth. Australia would be a powerful and much needed member of the GRASP alliance.
Mr Topfer also pointed out in his letter that our minister for the environment, Dr Kemp, has already recognised and supported the Great Apes Survival Project. I hope that we can see more done. I commend the motion to the House.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—I commend the member for Wannon for bringing forward this motion on the great apes. The opportunity to speak on this motion reminds me of the nature of the work we do and the range of issues we concern ourselves with as members of the House of Representatives. For me this motion has particular relevance and interest: it allows me to make some comments about the work being undertaken at Perth Zoo, which is located within my electorate of Swan, and their efforts to protect one of the species of great apes—the orang-outangs. I commend the work of the zoo; in particular, the work of the curator of the endangered species section, Mr Leif Cocks, whom I had the pleasure of meeting last week.
Orang-outangs are one of our closest biological relatives, with around 97 per cent human genetic make-up. They are so close to humans that I have been informed that, when they have a surgeon perform operations on orang-outangs, they use a surgeon for humans. Often, they use the operations in demonstrations to medical students without advising the students that they are actually watching an ape being operated on; they think it is a human. Orang-outangs' organs are organised in such a way that it is very hard to tell the difference. The intelligence level of orang-outangs is quite dramatic: it is equivalent to that of a five- or six-year-old child. It was suggested that, if the Liberal Party seconded some to the front bench, they might double the IQ of cabinet! But the great apes are wonderful creatures.
The Sumatran orang-outang is a critically endangered species and faces extinction in the wild within five years due to illegal logging, land clearing, forest fires and poaching. Only 3,000 orang-outangs survive in the wild in Sumatra and 10,000 in Borneo, with an average of 1,000 lost each year. At this rate orang-outangs will be extinct in the wild in Sumatra by 2005 and in Borneo by 2010. Perth Zoo is a world leader in the captive breeding of Sumatran orang-outangs. Its breeding program is one of the most successful in the world; since 1970 a world record of 24 orang-outangs have been born at Perth Zoo. The orang-outang colony presently comprises 10 Sumatran orang-outangs; the one male and nine females include some of the oldest captive-breeding orang-outangs in the world, and Puan is the most successful captive-breeding female.
On World Environment Day this year, Perth Zoo unveiled its state-of-the-art orang-outang enclosure. This enclosure is a world first in design, boasting a 12.5-metre climbing structure and an elevated public viewing area. It is the first stage in the redevelopment of Perth Zoo's existing 20-year-old orang-outang exhibit. I recently had the opportunity to inspect this new enclosure and see the level of planning that was undertaken prior to its construction. Sumatran orang-outangs are powerful, intelligent, inquisitive and agile, capable of picking locks, undoing nuts and bolts, and unscrewing fasteners. Their destructive habits mean that man-made trees, complete with moveable branches, have been used in this new enclosure to mimic the way a rainforest functions. Climbing structures have been used to increase the interior vertical space, and complement above-ground horizontal pathways and platforms. They incorporate swaying poles and food dispensing devices so the enclosure recreates the orang-outangs' natural environment. Play items such as a water cannon, and environmental enrichment such as hoists, dip tubes and puzzle boxes designed to encourage mental and physical exercise, have also been incorporated into the enclosure.
The new enclosure employs design principles unlike those of any captive orang-outang facility in the world. For the orang-outangs the new exhibit is a more natural environment; it allows them to live in a way more like that of the wild. They will even appear more natural than they do in existing enclosures, because of the types of movement and behaviour these enclosures restrict them to. The new enclosure and future phases of the redevelopment will provide facilities for Perth Zoo to breed its third generation of Sumatran orang-outangs. When I was there I noted—we were on the roof, looking at the way the enclosures were set out—that, when the orang-outangs are up in their trees, they can look across and see each other, which is quite a unique facility. It generates a feeling very similar to that of the wild, because there they do not congregate as a group—females will usually be separate from the males—but they like to see each other across the treetops. They can actually do that at this zoo.
The Western Australian government is to be congratulated for funding this important project—along with support from a number of private sector organisations. Unfortunately, there are serious doubts about the long-term survival prospects of the remaining small and fragmented wild populations of orang-outangs in Sumatra and Borneo. Captive breeding programs, such as the one undertaken by Perth Zoo, are a lifeline for these magnificent creatures. Perth Zoo will be playing an important role in preserving the gene pool of the orang-outang, which will help to keep declining wild populations healthy. The Sumatran orang-outang is representative of what is at risk if this generation does not act to protect the environment. Environmental protection is the responsibility of all of us. The Sumatran orang-outang's evolutionary span can be tracked back four million to five million years. It has managed to survive tumultuous environmental and climatic change, but it now faces its greatest threat: mankind. But we can be part of the solution.
I fully support paragraph (6) of this motion and additional funding to the United Nations Environment Program towards efforts to save the great apes. Australia should be doing much more to save orang-outangs from extinction. In September 2001 the United Kingdom announced its commitment of expertise and financial support to the United Nations Environment Program Great Apes Survival Project, known as GRASP. GRASP will target a number of projects in Asia towards tackling the different threats to wild orang-outangs. The United Kingdom government has committed the equivalent of $A500,000 towards this project in addition to its other funding of the United Nations Environment Program. The United Kingdom was also the first country to endorse the GRASP project and has backed its words with actions by providing this funding. Australia's total contribution to the United Nations Environment Project is just $600,000 for 2000-03. This inadequate funding is characteristic of the government's inadequate approach to the environment.
Despite its success and international reputation, the orang-outang program at Perth Zoo is receiving no Commonwealth funding. If we are to be serious about saving this magnificent creature, government funding will play a vital role in our efforts. In addition, the government should be using its influence with our Asian neighbours to persuade them to implement change that will end some of the practices that threaten the survival of the orang-outang in the wild. The funding from the United Kingdom will largely go towards projects in Africa, which is not surprising given its strong historical relationships with many countries on that continent. In South-East Asia, where the orang-outang is most at risk and where Australia has similarly strong ties, we should be taking on the same sort of leadership role as the United Kingdom has done in Africa. We should be using our diplomatic influence to work for change and we should be backing this up with financial support for projects such as GRASP to show that Australia is still serious about the environment. It is this sort of commitment that is necessary to save these endangered great apes and one that the parliament should support.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2002-08-19,"—I am very pleased to be able to support my colleague the member for Wannon and I congratulate him for bringing this motion forward in the House today. I support most of the comments of my colleague the member for Swan. It seems to be our day for looking after the species in Western Australia, with the patagonian toothfish similarly being debated—but for slightly different reasons—earlier today.
Scott Palley of CBS 60 Minutes reported that `the woman who discovered how the great apes live must now watch helplessly as the apes, who seem so human, lose their last place on earth'. He was reporting on the orang-outangs, who were formerly found in China and throughout the world and today are confined to two islands in Indonesia—Borneo and Sumatra. His comments highlight the serious issues that are the subject of this motion today. That 60 Minutes program, which highlighted the work of Dr Birute Galdikas—work which has spanned 30 years—posed a question to the public: `Should world governments do more to help save the habitat of the orang-outangs?' Ninety-eight per cent of the respondents answered positively: `Yes, governments should do more to help preserve the habitat of the orang-outangs.'
There is deep public concern; we see it all over the world. Individuals such as Dr Selby King—whom the member for Wannon mentioned—and many people in my electorate are concerned about what is happening to these creatures. So it is ironic that our modern consumer oriented world is mostly responsible for some of the serious problems facing these animals. Who would have thought that our favourite way of communicating, mobile phones, is a big contributor to the problem? According to an article in the East African Wild Life Society magazine, the mining of coltan, a key component in the manufacture of capacitors and other essential components used in cell phones, computer Playstations and video games, is a significant contributor to the destruction of the habitats of the orang-outangs, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to the article, as the demand for mobile phones has grown, the value of coltan has increased twentyfold and has produced a gold rush style boom in mining which is causing immense problems for wildlife in the world heritage listed Parc National in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
War, habitat destruction due to illegal mining, illegal logging and, of course, illegal poaching have pushed the great apes to the very brink of extinction, according to the UN environmental officials. The UN announced a major international initiative to save the great apes, which has been referred to earlier in this debate. The UK government was one of the governments quick to back the initiative and has been taking active steps to assist. This has raised awareness of the threat to the continuation of this species—the great apes. I congratulate the member for Wannon and I acknowledge Dr Selby King, who has raised the awareness of many members of parliament on this issue. Finally, I would like to quote from Klaus Toepfer, the UNEP Executive Director. He said:
Rescuing the great apes is not just about saving these important and special creatures. It is a blue print for sustainable development. In conserving and guaranteeing a future for the great apes we must also tackle the poverty and the environmental degradation which is blighting the lives of the people in Africa, Sumatra and Borneo where the great apes live.
And he made the point:
The clock is standing at one minute to midnight for the great apes.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Environment: Great Apes</title>,Private Members' Business,16,1,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—It is appalling to think of the possibility of the next generation of Australians not having the opportunity to share our planet with the great apes. Imagine no chimpanzees, no bonobos, no gorillas, no orang-outangs. Then, the only opportunity to see these creatures would be as exhibits in museums or on film and in photographic records. Some listening will say that this is quite fanciful. Let us stop equivocating and accept that this will happen unless governments such as ours intervene and increase their moral and financial support for the UN environment program to help save the great apes. It is ironic that today, as we near the 66th anniversary of the last Tasmanian tiger dying in captivity and as we debate this topic, the Tasmanian Mercury newspaper highlights the sale of a rug made from the skins of eight thylacines. 
The Great Apes Survival Project, or GRASP, is an integral part of the effort to save these creatures. The great apes, as we have heard, are not distant or irrelevant. Orang-outangs inhabit some of the areas of our closest neighbours—the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Helping the great apes not only is of benefit to these creatures but also will save other plant and animal species. As one campaigner put it:
The great apes are the gardeners of the African and South East Asian Forests.
Local impoverished communities that live in the vicinity of the great apes will also benefit from the Great Apes Survival Project, as it will deal with issues of poverty and environmental degradation affecting villagers in the areas the great apes inhabit.
The benefit these creatures have provided mankind by way of medical research should not be forgotten, and has already been mentioned by previous speakers. Like most things, education is an important factor in the survival of the great apes. Local people need to be made aware of the benefits these creatures provide living in their natural habitat—benefits with respect to the environment, eco-tourism and community development. The great apes are a protected species but the enforcement ability of authorities in the countries that they inhabit is limited. Great Apes Survival Project's funding would include equipping rangers, linking fragmented patches of habitat and educating villagers in the area about just how important apes are to their communities.
Education, enforcement and environment protection are projects needed for the survival of the great apes, but unfortunately these involve considerable cost and someone has to pick up the tab. As previous speakers have mentioned, and I would like to reiterate, the federal government needs to follow the lead of the United Kingdom government. This government, the first to formally support the Great Apes Survival Project, is committed to providing expertise and financial support to the project. Ian Redmond of the Ape Alliance said:
UNEP's leadership offers a chance for governments, NGOs and individuals to act together now, to reverse this decline—not only for the apes' sake but for the sake of their human neighbours who benefit from their presence.
Australia does contribute, primarily through zoos and the Humane Society International, to the conservation of apes. However, it is time for Australia to answer the call to play a larger part and help fund the United Nations' program. The Great Apes Survival Project has formed alliances amongst various charities and wildlife groups, such as the Ape Alliance, Born Free Foundation, Fauna and Flora International, and the World Wildlife Fund. Governments from across the globe should follow the United Kingdom's lead in joining a UN-led campaign to conserve the great apes. The federal government needs to increase its support to the program, which is striving to bring worldwide attention to the ape crisis, raise funds for conservation and develop a global conservation strategy for all great ape populations.
The importance of contributing to saving an endangered species cannot be overstated. Man has caused the rapid decline in the numbers; it is time to support the UN program and help the Great Apes Survival Project save these creatures. As stated on the United Nations environment program web site:
Every local extinction is a loss to humanity, a loss to the local community and a hole torn in the ecology of the planet.
I am an optimist, but as Carol Bristow of Dynnyrne said in today's Mercury:
Asia is covered by a noxious brown gas. Europe is flooded. Many of the Pacific islands are facing extinction. Will the Australian government continue to turn its back on the problem of global warming? If the Kyoto protocol is not good enough for Dr Kemp, then stand up for something stronger.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2002-08-19,"—I wish to speak on the great apes motion. These creatures are magnificent animals, and are described so in many documentaries throughout the world. We all remember that movie with Sigourney Weaver in it, where she sat down with the apes and talked to them. Their value to our environment, to the structure and to nature needs to be observed by all in this country and by this federal parliament. One of the saddest points when watching the news on Saturday night was seeing a dead ape from a zoo in Europe being washed down through the floods. These are, as I said, magnificent animals. These creatures have a high level of intelligence and, indeed, social integrity in the way that they address the family unit.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—I want to take the opportunity today to talk about the closure of one of the manufacturing companies in my electorate, John Valves. I want to take the opportunity to put on record my anger at the behaviour of the American owned company Lunkenheimer and its owner, Dr Da Silva, and the unprofessional actions of his representative in Australia, a Mr Roy Pack. These two individuals alone are not responsible for John Valves being placed into the hands of administrators but they are responsible for denying 150 workers the opportunity of being offered ongoing employment. I also want to put on record my concerns about the administration process and the way in which the administrators, Carson and and McLellan, handled their responsibilities.
About 18 months ago alarm bells started ringing in regard to John Valves when the AMWU claimed that the company was unable to guarantee that funds were available for redundancy payouts that had been offered. The company directors agreed that they would provide the AMWU with ongoing information as to the profitability of the company and any future plans. The company seemed to be turning the corner and as early as 2001 John Valves had won a major contract. It caused some surprise then that in December 2001 the directors announced the company was to be put into voluntary administration and that Carson's had been appointed.
I met with Ian Carson on the day of the announcement and was told that on initial information provided the company seemed to be in a reasonable trading position and that funds had been set aside for workers' entitlements should the worst case scenario of the company having to fold occur. The initial decision that Carson's made not to liquidate the company was welcomed by the workers. Advertisements for prospective buyers were placed and information packages sent out.
By February to March things started to go astray. I started receiving calls from workers who were concerned that the administrators had no evidence to confirm that their preferred bidder for the company had the capital he was claiming. It was claimed that the administrators had started to turn customers away, including longstanding customers who had large contracts with John Valves. I was also receiving calls from the administrators' preferred bidder asking for contacts at state government level to put the capital together. Referrals were made but the preferred bidder cancelled one appointment set up and only in the final week of his bid being withdrawn took the opportunity to talk to state departmental officials about purchasing the company.
During this period I am told that the administrators consistently gave assurances to the AMWU that they were certain that their preferred bidder had the $12 million he was offering to purchase the company. John Valves was at this stage losing $50,000 to $60,000 per week—add to this the administration charges and the fact that no new contracts were being entered into and claims that new business was being turned away.
After several weeks of delay and continued requests from Mr Cooper to extend the sale deadline, the administrators, at the request of the AMWU, asked Mr Cooper to put half a million dollars on the table to be drawn on on a daily basis to keep the company operating while he finalised his capital. Mr Cooper provided a letter, which I am told he claimed to be from a lawyer, confirming that Mr Cooper had half a million dollars in the bank. This letter has since proven not to be from a lawyer; rather it was from a stockbroker who is now unable to be contacted. Carson's accepted the letter on face value and again assured the AMWU that they were confident that their chosen bidder was genuine and had the capital to purchase the company. I understand that a dispute then arose between the administrators and Mr Cooper that resulted in Mr Cooper finally withdrawing his bid.
I think it is clear that, despite his intentions, Mr Cooper did not have the capital to purchase John Valves and was not in a position to raise the capital. I think there was clear evidence of this within the first week of Mr Cooper having made this offer. Why the administrators continued to give assurances that Mr Cooper did have the capital is unclear. Why they continued for over six weeks to pursue an offer that would never come to fruition, why they appear to have failed to investigate the financial viability of their preferred bidder, why they failed to confirm the validity of Mr Cooper's letter claiming to be from a lawyer and why they did not attempt to pursue other bids is extremely concerning.
Following the withdrawal of Mr Cooper's bid, the administrators appeared from the outside to have determined to liquidate the company. This is despite a bid from Norvil Foundry still being on the table. Although not able to guarantee all workers' jobs, it was the only bid left on the table which would guarantee that some jobs were saved. The AMWU staged a rally outside the administrators' office and put pressure on the administrators to continue to try to keep the company viable.
I want to turn now to the role of Lunkenheimer and Mr Roy Pack in the eventual closure of John Valves. Lunkenheimer is a US company that patented a slurry valve which they had issued John Valves a licence to manufacture some 40 years ago. John Valves have been manufacturing this valve for all of this time and have made significant changes to the original design. According to Lunkenheimer, the licence agreement that it had with John Valves was cancelled when John Valves was placed in the hands of the administrators. Lunkenheimer was apparently angered by the fact that the administrators had included information about Lunkenheimer in the information pack they sent out. It would appear that the administrators were of the opinion that the licence contract between John Valves and Lunkenheimer was not cancelled on the advent of voluntary administration and that inclusion of Lunkenheimer's name in the information packs was legitimate. 
There are some questions as to why the administrators did not at this stage seek an injunction against Lunkenheimer cancelling the licence. The administrators, on advice from a patents lawyer, a patents engineer and their own lawyers, determined that they would sell John Valves as a going concern to Norvil, the only remaining bidder for the company. They notified Lunkenheimer of their intention to sell, and right up to the last minute Mr Roy Pack was assuring Ballarat community leaders that he had the best interests of John Valves' workers at heart. At the same time, Lunkenheimer commenced legal proceedings against the administrators, seeking an injunction to stop the sale.
An injunction was eventually granted on the basis that a case would need to be brought to determine the status of the Lunkenheimer-John Valves licence agreement and the intellectual property rights of Lunkenheimer. Lunkenheimer were asked to put forward a surety to the court as to their intentions to proceed with this case. I understand that to date this surety has not been received and that the court action to determine the status of the slurry valve licence is in limbo.
The actions of Lunkenheimer and their representative in Australia, Mr Roy Pack, have been quite unbelievable. They took every action possible to prevent the sale of John Valves. I can understand their wanting to protect what they saw as their legitimate intellectual property, but what I cannot understand is Mr Pack claiming that Lunkenheimer intended to save John Valves and the workers' jobs by buying the company, claiming to be approaching merchant banks with the capital to purchase John Valves alongside other operations they were currently working on. Needless to say, no bid for the company ever eventuated from Lunkenheimer. There were claims that other bidders for the company had been offered inducements of over half a million dollars from the federal government, when no such offer had ever been made; there were allegations that the administrators—and I quote from emails to me—were their enemy and not their ally, and had committed a criminal act in attempting to sell John Valves. I cannot understand engaging the original bidder, Mr Cooper, and then referring to him in emails to me as a fraudster who never had the capital; failing to acknowledge that there were contrary legal opinions in relation to the licence; the failure of Mr Roy Pack to attend meetings he had set up; and threats of legal action to any party that questioned the validity of Mr Pack's statements. 
You have only to read some of the emails that came from Dr da Silva and Mr Roy Pack during May—and that continue to come—to see the level of misinformation and libel spread by this pair. They managed to stall the sale of John Valves as a going concern to the point where administrators took the decision to fold the company, terminate the employment of the work force and commence liquidating all assets.
After all of this, no funds were left for workers' entitlements, and many of the workers who have been employed by John Valves all of their working lives have lost thousands of dollars. It is unclear what the ultimate aim of Mr Pack and Dr da Silva actually was. I can only assume that their ultimate aim was to ensure that the Lunkenheimer slurry valve was manufactured by anyone other than John Valves and that they were pursuing the opportunity to resell the licence at a higher price, potentially to an offshore manufacturer.
In the end, no-one has won. Lunkenheimer's claim to be able to on-sell the licence agreement is tied up in court; John Valves has ceased operations; workers have lost their entitlements; and creditors have received some, but not all, of what they are owed. The one light in this has been that the second bidder has now bought the John Valves name and the assets, and is, hopefully, going to be able to employ some of the workers who have lost their jobs.
I want to commend the work of Victor Jose from the AMWU and Ben Davis from the Australian Workers Union in their extensive efforts to keep the company open. I also want to commend the efforts of the Ballarat manufacturing community, which has offered many of the workers employment. The way in which our current laws relating to administration operate means that there is no incentive for administrators to try and save jobs, expedite the administration process and limit the amount of fees that they draw from the administration. 
Despite his answer to me in question time in my first weeks in this House, the Prime Minister has not introduced legislation to put employees' entitlements before those of secured creditors when companies fold. He promised this in the election campaign, and in February he promised to look into this issue. The workers are now reliant on GEERS to fund the minimum of their entitlements. I call on the government to make sure that they apply this scheme in the broadest sense. There are certainly limitations with the scheme. I am particularly concerned that the family of a worker who died during the period of administration will not be able to access his entitlements. There are also 12 other workers who terminated their own employment due to the uncertainty of the conditions they were experiencing during this period.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>John Valves: Closure</title>,Grievance Debate,17,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—This is a unique experience for me. I am continuing my remarks on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, having commenced my speech at 3.39 a.m. on 28 June and finished at 3.45 a.m. on 28 June. It has been some considerable time since I put my mind to this legislation but the issues are still the same. This legislation will, as I said on 28 June, generally benefit the higher education sector, but we do have some concerns on this side of the House. I rise to support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
Unfortunately, this government's philosophy and 1950s thinking are very damaging to Australia and Australians, leading to inequity. This occurs because education is about opportunity. A good education creates opportunity. People with a good education are the ones who get the good jobs and earn the high incomes. Where you have a two-tiered system of education, you end up with a two-tiered society, with people who have the education getting the jobs and earning the higher incomes.
This government has moved more and more along the line to where education becomes a privilege, not a right, and that has enormous ramifications for us as a society. People who are educationally disadvantaged are disadvantaged in life. They are socially disadvantaged and they cannot enjoy a higher standard of living—the high standard of living that people with an education have. All of us want our children to succeed. It is not right that my children should have more of an advantage than the children of a person who is in receipt of, say, the disability support pension, of somebody who has been injured at work or of a single parent. They have to battle just to put food on the table and are not in a position to pay large amounts of money for their children to obtain a higher education.
As I have been saying, education is the key to success; success not only for individual Australians but for Australia as a whole. We are now part of a global economy, and to succeed in that global economy Australia must have people who are highly skilled, people who have knowledge and people who have a high quality education. That education, as I have said, should not be for just a few people, not just for the chosen ones within our society. Rather, it should be something that all people in our society have: work skills and an education that lead to meaningful employment. Education, knowledge and innovation are the keys to the success and prosperity of any country. As within our own society in Australia, where it is the people with education who can succeed, within the global economy it is those countries that have the highly skilled, highly educated work forces that succeed and prosper. Countries that have that knowledge and innovation enjoy the higher standards of living.
Unfortunately for Australia and Australian students, the Howard government has pursued a policy of neglect—a policy that has seen $3 billion slashed from the cumulative operating budgets of universities since 1996. This is a government that has pursued a vendetta against universities, and this can be seen from figures released by the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee that reveal the dramatic rise in the student to staff ratio. This has a detrimental effect on young people's education. It means overcrowded lecture theatres, lack of student-teacher contact, compromises to learning and teaching, and overstretched staff. These have all become increasingly common features of our universities.  In New South Wales in 1996, the student to staff ratio was 16.2; in 2001, it was 19.6. In Victoria in 1996, it was 17; in 2001, 20. In Queensland in 1996, it was 16.9; in 2001, 22.1. In Western Australia in 1996, it was 15.3; in 2001, 19.1. Every state that you go through shows a similar increase in the student to staff ratio, which impacts and impinges on the quality of education our young people are receiving.
It is understandable that when Australia is compared to other OECD countries we cannot measure up. When you have such a decline in and erosion of the quality of our education, it is going to take its toll. The comparison with other OECD countries shows that the inequity created by this government is really coming home to roost. The government's policy of defunding our universities, its pursuit of policies designed to attract fee paying students and its changes to HECS are acting as barriers for young people not only from disadvantaged backgrounds but also from ordinary Australian families. This government is attacking our universities and pursuing policies that are making it very difficult for all students attending university. It is only those who come from very wealthy backgrounds—very privileged backgrounds—who are able to access higher education in the same way that I was able to.
The government's higher education policy is one that promotes inequity and leads to exclusion. Education is not a privilege; it is a right. Whether or not a person undertakes higher education should be based on their ability, not their bank balance—something this government has sought to change. Fee paying students who do not achieve a TER or university entrance score that is high enough to give them access to university—they are not bright enough to get there on their ability—are now able to buy a place. And the government wants to progress this even further so it becomes a situation where it is the students from families that have the money to pay for the education of their children who will get the places in universities, the knowledge and the good jobs. As a result of that, Australia will suffer.
The government has planned a voucher system, and this can be seen from some of the answers from the government in question time. On 20 June, the Prime Minister signalled that there were measures in place to increase charges students are forced to pay for university courses and that the government backed that agenda. That has enormous ramifications for all those young people attending high school at the moment who feel that they want to go on and achieve a higher education and want to go to universities. Some of the measures that are being considered—and that will be embraced by members on the other side of the House—are things such as the deregulation of fees, real interest rates for student debts, vouchers for postsecondary education, a loans scheme to replace HECS and new processes for agreeing to the number of government funded places.
That can end up in a situation where, say, a student studying veterinary science—that was a degree that was being talked about at the time—would be paying up to $113,000 a year to be able to undertake that study. It really is setting up a situation where it is not your ability but the size of your bank balance that determines whether or not you can access the education that you need to secure a future in which you know that you will receive an income and security throughout your life.
The other issue that concerns me greatly is the proposal to create elite universities. Once again, this is a government that is pursuing its 1950s philosophy that the best people—or should I say those with money—deserve to go to the best universities. It would be fair to assume that the elite universities would charge elite—or should I say exorbitant—fees and at the end of the day entry to these universities would only be available to those who attended the elite category 1 private schools on which this government is lavishing funds. 
What would this policy mean to other universities—the so-called equity universities, which has become a catchphrase for the minister? It would mean that they would become second-class universities. In the region I come from, the Newcastle University has a campus both in Newcastle and on the Central Coast at Ourimbah. Both those campuses undertake cutting edge research, have high quality courses and attract people from all around the country. The medical degree at Newcastle University is a highly sought after degree and one that is very difficult to obtain entry to. It has been recognised for its innovative nature.
Student access to these courses and to university is going to be severely curtailed with fees and loans. What it is going to mean is that when they are coming to the stage of starting a family and having mortgages they are going to have to think twice about it. It may come to the situation where they have to choose between an education and immediate security and looking a little bit further down the track and saying, `By undertaking this study and investing now in the future I may be able to enjoy a higher standard of living.' And young people are not always in the position to make that decision.
The government should be about developing all our universities and ensuring that all students have access to a higher education. The Howard government should be pursuing a policy that ensures regional universities like Newcastle thrive and that the Central Coast campus of the university eventually becomes a university in its own right.
Unless the Howard government recognises the importance of higher education to Australia's future, unless it recognises that it is important for all Australians to be educated and have a higher level of skills and knowledge, Australia is facing a grim future. I implore the government to abandon its elitist approach to education and join with other OECD countries and pursue a policy based on equity, not exclusion; a policy that will ensure a higher standard of living for all Australians.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—I begin my speech on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and a related bill by stating that we recognise in our region that a big part of our future is higher education, and at the centre of that in the Gippsland region is Monash University's Gippsland campus. There has been a lot of change at Monash University's campus in Gippsland over the last two or three years in particular but really it has been a period of substantial change over the last eight or nine years. On balance, these changes have meant that we have a much better level of university education on offer to the people of Gippsland than we had before. The changes have not been easy and I know that there has been criticism from some people as the institution has made the transition from being the old Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education to being Monash University's Gippsland campus.
We have seen in the last two and a half years, I think, the employment of Professor Brian Mackenzie as the Pro Vice Chancellor of the Gippsland campus. He has been a tough leader at the university at Gippsland and he has been a leader who has been able to secure more resources for our campus of the university. He has been an inspiration to many of the staff there and many of the community leaders who look to the university for leadership in a whole lot of different ways.
It is all well and good for people to talk about education but the test in public life is how much you are prepared to commit in terms of resources. The Howard government have, sadly, not seen fit to properly fund and resource the university sector in Australia, and in particular it has been those regional universities and regional campuses of universities which have suffered most as a result of the cutbacks which the Howard government have put in place. We understand very clearly in Gippsland and in the Latrobe Valley in particular that we have no future, we have no way of getting ourselves out of some of the circumstances that we confront, if we do not have the resources which we need to improve people's access to university education and to encourage people to participate fully in all of the opportunities that university education can provide.
I am conscious of the time and conscious of the fact that there are only a few minutes remaining in this debate until the dinner break. At the resumption of the debate at eight o'clock I look forward to continuing my remarks, Deputy Speaker Scott, and I will allow you to stop looking at the clock and to close the debate for the purposes of letting people get on with their dinner this evening.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—I am glad to be given the opportunity to continue to address this important topic. It is good to see you in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams. As a country member of parliament, I think you will be able to understand the things that I will address in my remarks tonight. 
I was saying how important Monash University is to the Gippsland region. We have in Gippsland a fine campus of Monash University, and it is based in my electorate in the Latrobe Valley. Last year, Simon Crean and the entire shadow cabinet came, and it is the first time in our history that a cabinet or a shadow cabinet meeting has been held in Gippsland. It was a big deal for us, and, to underscore the importance of the university and how important we think the university is to the future of our region, that shadow cabinet meeting was held at Monash University's Gippsland campus in Churchill. It was an important occasion and an important opportunity for people from the university to talk directly to people in the shadow cabinet about some of their aspirations for the university campus into the future.
As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we have been fortunate at Monash University Gippsland to have strong leadership through Professor Brian Mackenzie. He has been a tough leader who has been prepared to fight within Monash University structures for resources to come our way; that is, for resources to not be lost from Monash University Gippsland's campus to other campuses based around capital cities. It has allowed us to not only keep what we have but also look at opportunities within Monash University structures to expand the range of courses and programs which we offer and to better engage with the community and to use the university as an important lever for economic development.
Often people talk about universities in some sort of esoteric context. The importance of moving retention rates to year 12 and the importance of getting people into universities, for example, are often talked about as statistics to be achieved. In our context in the Latrobe Valley, it is all about moving us from the old economy to the new economy in relation to some of those jobs which have been for so long a part of our community. I am talking particularly about jobs in the power industry, pulp and paper manufacturing and textile, clothing and footwear—some of those industries which have very often been characterised, unfairly, as smokestack industries. Those industries are unquestionably in decline, and that has meant an enormous loss of jobs in the Latrobe Valley and in other industrial communities just like it. 
We need to find our way into some of the new jobs which are being created in Australia; some of the new jobs associated with growing industries, with the services sector and with the growth in higher education. The university is our bridge to that opportunity; it is our bridge to those new jobs. Importantly, Monash University Gippsland is also a part of the social and cultural renewal of the Latrobe Valley. We get many new staff from Melbourne, from other parts of Australia and from overseas. People come to our region with new ideas, new initiatives and different ways of doing things than what we have done in the past. As a community going through transition, we need that. We need people to come to us with new ideas and initiative; we need people to come and to look at opportunities to participate within our community. 
Historically, the Latrobe Valley has been its best when it has been associated with change. It has been its best when we have gone through transitions. It has been its best when we have embraced new people. I talk particularly of the massive changes which took place in the Latrobe Valley in the course of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, when we had literally tens of thousands of new migrants arriving in the Latrobe Valley to assist in the development of the enormous SECV infrastructure that is based in the Latrobe Valley. Many power stations and roads were built, and many railway lines were put in place, developed and expanded. New housing was put up. There was an enormous need for new labour, new skills and new ideas. That was a really exciting time in the Latrobe Valley's history, and we were in many ways the premier point of new settlement for migrants in Victoria—in much the same way as Footscray probably is today. In the Victorian context, the Latrobe Valley was thought of in that way in the 1950s and 1960s but less so in the 1970s and 1980s. 
Those were exciting times, and we think that Monash University Gippsland can be a part of taking advantage, in the same way that we did then, of some of the new ideas which are out there—and not just ideas within our own population. Sure, the university will play a part in harnessing those ideas, making sure that we get the best out of them, and using our own resources. The people involved in developing those ideas will, I am sure, be encouraged by the university to participate through the programs that they offer. More particularly, new people coming in will be part of the Monash University academic staff, the administration, the economic development component or the leadership group within Monash University Gippsland's structure. These are people you come across regularly in a Gippsland context working with community groups and with various agencies in our district to ensure best practice and best integration between what the university is trying to achieve in our region and what agencies, local government and other groups within our community are trying to achieve as well. The university is playing an enormous part in our economic and cultural renewal in the Latrobe Valley. Similarly, the state government is making an enormous contribution in the Latrobe Valley, and Gippsland more generally, to the economic and cultural renewal of our region. 
Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would know better than most people in the parliament that this region has gone through tough times. As I drive around my electorate I really enjoy seeing, at the front of schools, state government signs announcing massive increases in funding and new school buildings being erected—a new commitment being made by the state government for additional resources and for new facilities at our local schools. There are a lot schools in my district, as there should be, because we are a region of substantial educational need and disadvantage, a region that has been substantially neglected in the past, most notably by the Kennett government.
It is great to see the state government investing in the Trafalgar High School, a fantastic school in my region that runs an outstanding accelerated learning program, which now has some 120 students participating in it. It is a magnificent program which offers a real alternative for families who have gifted children and do not want to feel pressured to send their kids to a private school. They are very comfortable with and fully support the outstanding accelerated learning program offered at Trafalgar High School. It is a real tribute to the school; a real tribute to the coordinator, Ms Aniko Kariko; and a real tribute to all the parents who showed faith and confidence in the establishment of that program in a community like the Latrobe Valley and made it such a fantastic success. Similarly, it has been great to see the commitment the state government has made to Warrigal Regional College and Pakenham Secondary College.
The state government is also committed to another important and exciting project in the Latrobe Valley: the education precinct. Simon Crean and the shadow cabinet were briefed about the education precinct project by Monash University at a shadow cabinet meeting on the university grounds in Churchill. It is not an entirely new concept. I am sure that many members of the House will be familiar with the idea. We have a number of secondary colleges in the Latrobe Valley, and the idea is to have a consolidated senior secondary campus of year 11 and year 12 students based at the university, so the link between the university and the year 11 and year 12 students would be obvious. There would also be an opportunity to share resources and to develop the connection between the aspirations of those year 11 and year 12 students and the higher education system.
This is a project that the state government has not just talked about; there has been a lot of planning involved. The Gippsland Department of Education and Training, which is based at Moe, have done a lot of very hard work on this project. I commend all those involved for their patience and diligence in the development of this concept as it moved from an idea to something that will be up and running in the course of the next few years. Similarly, I think a lot of courage has been shown by local families, who understand the importance of making this change. The great majority of people have been prepared to put aside a lot of the parochialism involved in considering education matters based on towns rather than educational outcomes. The state government are not just talking; they are putting $11 million towards this project. And so they should. This is an important project for an area which, unfortunately, still has one of the lowest year 12 retention rates in the state, if not the country. That is improving and it has improved every year for the last three years, which is a real tribute to the efforts of Steve Bracks and his team.
These are important outcomes and not just statistics for us in the Latrobe Valley. We are talking about people's lives, about opportunity, about people feeling that they should go on and that, if they do go on, they will be able to achieve, participate and get a job. We have weathered the bitter storm of restructure in the Latrobe Valley for so long that a lot of people lost confidence. Through a number of initiatives associated with the Latrobe Valley Ministerial Task Force, established by the state government—some $104 million worth of projects—people have had that confidence restored. That is exactly the type of combination communities like the Latrobe Valley need to encourage people to participate more in higher education—not just for an abstract reason, but so they can take advantage of some of the new jobs being created in their local community.
We have a resilient community in the Latrobe Valley, made up of people who have been through tough times. Though these tough times, people have maintained their commitment to education. They want a better life and more opportunities than they had themselves. There has been a lot of talk in this place—probably too much talk—about people's aspirations. Terms like `aspirational voters' have suddenly become very popular around the place. We have always had people with aspirations in the Latrobe Valley—aspirations for a better way of life and better opportunities not only for themselves but also for their children. That is borne out by the high rates of participation in those educational opportunities offered to workers in the Latrobe Valley. People have been prepared to undertake more education as mature age students—to go to an adult literacy class and participate in the ongoing development of their skill or trade.
We talk a lot about the concept of lifelong learning. We in the Latrobe Valley feel proud of our neighbourhood learning centres, our TAFE institutes, our university and, of course, our teachers and schools, which have promoted and encouraged a culture of learning in the Latrobe Valley through difficult times. I often hear people talk about the needs of regional Australia and about its future. They talk about different things that work in different areas. From my viewpoint—and, I think, from the viewpoint of the majority of people in the Gippsland region—the university is not just one part of our future; it is the greatest part of our future. Higher education, as it involves both TAFEs in Gippsland—Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE and Gippsland Group Training—is a big part of having a high-wage, high-skill future for our region.
We in the Gippsland region are not interested in being second-class citizens. We are not interested in mowing the lawns of rich city people, as the Treasurer suggested not that long ago. What we want is an opportunity to participate in the jobs associated with the new economy. We want our opportunity to be able to share in the growth and development of those new and exciting sectors, to be able to be in industries that are growing not declining. The university, the TAFEs and group training are all ways in which we can do that. These are all important ways in which we can take our share, get our bit, of the opportunities associated with that new and fast growing part of the economy.
We recognise as well the importance of these institutions in strengthening our existing industries. A lot of people have the wrong view about manufacturing and do not understand that the fellows at the PaperlinX plant at Maryvale are some of the most skilled plant operators anywhere in the country, if not the world. They use computers to drive that machinery; they are not just turning valves like they used to maybe 20 or 30 years ago. There has been a lot of change, and workers in our district have been prepared to change as the needs of industry have changed. This is exactly the approach that government needs to promote and encourage.
We need to see communities like the Latrobe Valley, which are working hard to find their own way and get their own future, not having to rely on other people to find a future for them. The Latrobe Valley has been gutsy in difficult times. Education and training in the Latrobe Valley is going to be a big part of our future and will make an enormous difference to us being able to access the opportunities associated with new jobs and new industries in the future.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—In speaking tonight on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 I want to commend to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, and to the House the shadow minister for education Jenny Macklin's amendments which you may have seen some time ago. I particularly want to focus on parts (a) and (b) of the amendment that she proposed: firstly, that the House condemns the government for its shameful neglect of public universities in Australia and its inadequate indexation of increases in universities; and, secondly, the increasing financial burden it is placing on students and their families. 
I see a lot of university students in my electorate. In my electorate I have Sydney University, the University of Technology, a number of TAFE colleges, the College of Fine Arts and a number of university campuses. I have living in my electorate a lot of students, a lot of academics and a lot of people who are affected by the cuts to higher education that this government has made every day. Since 1996 this government has ripped $3 billion out of Commonwealth funding in cumulative terms from the tertiary education sector, and student contributions have increased by 60 per cent. They are quite stark figures when we consider that it has always been our mission to increase access to university education, not decrease it by pulling the funding out of it and making it more and more once again the preserve of the wealthy.
Fees and charges in 1989 represented 5.9 per cent of university operating revenue and now represent over 16 per cent—again, very stark figures. The reliance on student contributions has continued to increase in that time. At the same time, Commonwealth funding has gone from 65.7 per cent to 50.8 per cent of the revenue for universities. Some of that, of course, is not just increased student fees; some of it is the sorts of sponsorship arrangements that we have seen with business. Some of those arrangements are very productive. Some of them are very useful for universities. Some of them, quite frankly, are not, and have a number of associated issues relating to who owns the intellectual property in the research arrangements that people enter into. 
This government's reduction in spending on higher education may seem like a saving to government, but it is a very short-term saving. It is like using the credit card to pay off the mortgage. There is a reduction in the impost on today's budget, but in years to come we will see the results of these cuts. Just this week, at the beginning of Science Week, we have heard scientists talking about the fact that the cuts to science funding will not be noticed this year or next year; the cuts that are being made now will be noticed in 10 years time. The stark contrast of course is with funding to private schools, which has increased quite dramatically under this government, not on any basis of need and not to the schools that really need help—and there are some non-government schools that are very poor and in need of help. We have seen the greatest funding increases go to the schools that need the least help. 
Increased fees is one of the ways that universities are coping with the cuts to their operating grants. The fee system has been deregulated in a number of ways that have allowed universities to increase the number of full-fee-paying students and increase the charges to those students. The results of that have been interesting to monitor. I have certainly had in my office—as I am sure you have had in your office, Mr Deputy Speaker—distraught students saying, `I don't know what to do; I've missed out in getting into vet science by two marks, and they've said I can get in if I can find $30,000 a year.' A particular case I am thinking of is that of a daughter of a single mother on a disability pension. That family probably would not have seen $30,000 in their whole lives, let alone be able to find $30,000 a year for the next five years.
I am happy to report that, in that particular case, the girl eventually did get into a non-fee place, but there was a substantial amount of discussion with the university about the particular merits of the student before they found a place for her. Yet if she had had that $30,000 a year, she could have had 10 or 20 marks less in the HSC and it would not have made any difference; she would have got the full fee paying place. It is a dreadful shame that once again we are returning to a situation where, if you are wealthy, you can probably find a place for yourself in university—a situation where it does not matter so much what your results are like at high school; if your parents have got $30,000 a year to cough up for your university degree then you will get one.
We know that there is substantial pressure on universities not to fail students who are paying full fees, and we saw the problems that Wollongong University had with one academic saying that he came under pressure not to fail full fee paying students. The resultant decline in academic standards is not difficult to imagine. If there is pressure on academics to pass students because they are paying big money and they are not going to be happy about having to repeat a year, then the sorts of results that the doctors, the vets, the scientists and the lawyers of tomorrow are getting do not inspire one with a lot of confidence.
Today, however, there was something very interesting in the newspapers about the University of New South Wales actually deciding to abolish up-front university fees. I certainly welcome this move. The University of New South Wales's governing body last night voted to abolish up-front fees because of the system's inequity and the fact that it had caused ill feeling amongst many students and was lowering academic standards. It is not just me who is suggesting that these full fees are lowering academic standards and causing resentment among students; the University of New South Wales's governing body has decided that for itself. The decision followed reports earlier this year that up-front fee payers were able to buy a place at the University of New South Wales with entrance scores nearly 20 points lower than other Australian students. It is a very significant gap that you can avoid if you have got the cash. It would be terrific if we saw other universities follow this lead. The University of New South Wales always has had a very good reputation as a good university and I think that its efforts in this respect to protect its reputation, the reputation of the university, will certainly be met with applause in education circles.
The cuts that I have mentioned have displayed themselves in a number of ways. University students and academics tell tales of squeezed resources, and the way they are making do really is quite alarming. At the beginning of every academic year recently there have been stories about overflowing lecture theatres, lectures that are so oversubscribed with students that, for health and safety issues, students are blocked from going into the lecture theatre. They are told that, eventually, in several weeks or months time perhaps enough students will drop out so that the lecture theatre will be able to contain the number of students doing the course. This is not a timetabling anomaly that happens every now and again; we see this year after year. It has become standard for many universities to oversubscribe courses in the hope or the expectation that students will drop out and that the lecture theatres will eventually be able to cope with the number of students doing the course. These sorts of occupational health and safety issues would not be tolerated in any workplace in the country. They do not let you sit in the aisle or stand up the back at the picture theatre. If a fire breaks out in a place like that that is packed to the rafters, you have got significant safety issues.
The physical environment of universities has declined. You can see that by just going for a walk in most universities these days. They do not have the sort of money that they had for upkeep. Libraries at universities are complaining that they can afford about half the subscriptions to overseas journals that they used to be able to afford. In part that is due to funding cuts, of course; in part it is due to the fall in the Australian dollar. But it is being made up for by some libraries being much stricter with the charging and collection of late fees. Students are noticing that they are paying many more late fees than they used to at much higher rates for each day that a book is late.
Perhaps the area that is most affected though is face to face teaching. Most students will tell you that their face to face load has dropped dramatically. I know of one course where the standard full-time load is 33 hours. In that course they have 11 hours of what they euphemistically call `student centred learning'. `Student centred learning', of course, is students sitting around having a discussion, doing a study group. Fine, there is nothing wrong with that method of study but the idea that students should be paying HECS fees for 11 hours of discussions amongst themselves each week is wrong. And even worse in some universities, tutorials have gone from a class of 12 to maybe 20 at the outside to now regularly 40 to 50 people. Tutorials are becoming what lectures used to be.
Lectures are often taped and are available electronically because students cannot fit into lecture theatres, as I was saying before. The opportunity for students to actually ask questions of lecturers is almost nonexistent when you are dealing with that sort of learning environment, and it is having a substantial effect on the quality of learning for most students. In many cases students are not complaining about the drop in face to face hours because they have to work full time to afford to go to university anyway. If they had more hours of face to face teaching, they would have problems with their attendance record because most students you talk to now are working a lot more than 20 hours a week to afford to go to university. They need to supplement the $145 a week from Austudy, particularly in an area like mine where it is pretty hard to find a room to rent in a share house for less than $150. You are frowning, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams. We do not have the fine access to good quality, affordable accommodation that you have in some parts of Tasmania. I challenge anyone to find for less than $100 a week a room in the most basic type of accommodation within half an hour of their university by public transport. When you consider that Austudy is universal, the costs of living in a city like Sydney certainly show how inadequate that $145 a week can be.
The other sorts of ongoing costs that are associated with a university education have gone through the roof as well. University students, of course, did not benefit from any tax cut that was supposedly associated with the introduction of the GST, but they have had GST put on everything that they use and consume. On top of that, the extra hidden costs that were limited even when I went to university—and that is not so long ago—such as the photocopied course reading material that used to cost $20 or $30 can cost up to hundreds of dollars now. University departments are using those mandatory course materials to fund extra staff positions,
because they do not have the staff, under their decreased funding, to teach the students. They are getting their hands on funding in a whole lot of quite unorthodox ways because their funding is being so tightly controlled. 
One of the enormous effects of the cut to education funding and student assistance is reflected in sub-paragraph (b) of the member for Jagajaga's amendments: the increase in financial burden it is placing on students and their families. I have spoken a little about that. I wanted to say that if this government is serious about student poverty—and I should say there is very little indication up to now that that is so—I would very much like to see the report that was released by Melbourne University Centre for the Study of Higher Education on student poverty. I wonder whether it reflects the sorts of stories we are hearing anecdotally. 
I am sure that the minister at the table is sighing because he knows I am about to refer to a Cosmopolitan article claiming that 10 per cent of all sex workers in New South Wales were university students. According to the magazine, ads by sex industry operators appear on the backs of toilet doors and at university colleges. I know that several university newspapers' editorial committees have had debates about whether it is appropriate to allow this sort of advertising in their newspapers. By and large, the student editors allow them because they recognise that sex work is something a significant proportion—we do not know what proportion—of university students are turning to to fund their university education. I know that a number of government ministers have said that this is all about choice and, if people choose to do that sort of work, that is completely up to them. Of course, that is true. People make all sorts of choices in life, good and bad. 
As I said earlier, the expense of living in a city like Sydney on Austudy's $145 a week is pretty substantial. If students are given the choice of working 40 hours a week in a banqueting section of a big hotel like I did to pay my way through university and working fewer hours a week and having more time to study, then it is not surprising that a number of them are making those sorts of choices. Surely the issue is providing access to higher education in a way that does not encourage people to have to work 40 hours a week to fund full-time study. 
When I was at university, it was the beginning of the time when student poverty was becoming an issue. We organised a soup kitchen, but when we did it it was a stunt to draw attention to the issue of funding at universities. University organisations and unions are telling me now that it is not a stunt. They are providing food for students and students are coming to rely on subsidised food and, in some cases, free food because the financial strain of paying for their education at the same time as paying for the cost of living is really pushing them to the edge. 
When students graduate, the sort of HECS debts that they are facing at a minimum are now probably $11,000 for a pass level arts degree. Very quickly you go up to $30,000. You start to pay that back at $21,000 a year—much lower than the average wage—at a time, of course, when people are just starting to try and save for mortgages or perhaps thinking about children. Of course, there is no reflection of ability to pay and the effect, undoubtedly, is more severe for women who take more time out of the work force. In fact, NUS figures show that, by the age of 34, 62 per cent of men have repaid their HECS debts compared with 20 per cent of women. So women, because they take longer periods out of the work force when they are not repaying their HECS debts, take longer to pay off their debt. They usually incur a higher debt because they are repaying interest over all of that period. If you include that with the fact that they are less likely to be in high-paid work in the first place, you see that the repayment of HECS falls unequally on different people. I would certainly urge the government to consider some of these issues in its higher education legislation.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—In speaking to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, I endorse the comments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and support her proposed amendment. I note the initiative in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, which will see the introduction of a new HECS style loan scheme become available to assist overseas trained professionals to cover the cost of bridging study required to gain the formal recognition of their qualifications for their profession in Australia. Australia attracts a large number of people who have been trained overseas, who wish to contribute to the community and work in this country and whose qualifications either do not meet the requirements of their relevant professional organisation or do not meet the minimum regulated employment practice requirements. It is currently the case that many people who are trained overseas are unable to enrol in bridging courses either because of the restrictions on government funded places in such courses or the restrictive costs of many courses.
With Australia urgently needing to address existing skills shortages and aspiring to become a knowledge based economy, this legislation in this aspect represents a step in the right direction, albeit a small one. I am extremely concerned, however, by the government's overall policy direction in this fundamentally important area of higher education and in particular the failure of this government to adequately address the issue of equity of access to higher education for all Australians. Whilst the purpose of the bills is to update the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Australian Research Council Act 2001 in a number of areas, with which I have no difficulty, the legislation also proposes an extension to the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, or PELS, to four private higher education providers. My concern with this extension goes to the different obligations of our Commonwealth funded institutions in contrast to some private higher education providers when it comes to access and equity issues. Publicly funded universities are required to adhere to policies of non-discrimination and to pursue active equity policies designed to enhance the participation of students from disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups. Private universities do not have the same legislative responsibilities in this area. I believe that any funding extension to private universities should encompass these responsibilities.
I suggest that everyone reads the background and statistics provided to the current higher education review consultation process. The background paper reports that the number of students participating in higher education over the past decade has increased by 30 per cent. The increase in the rate of student participation is attributed in large part to an increase in the number of overseas students and an increase in the number of postgraduate fee-paying students. Further, the report states:
The increase in overseas students was undoubtedly driven by the fact that universities could charge these students full fees.
Universities were quick to take up the opportunity to generate income and the number of overseas students enrolled in Australian universities increased by 75,000. The same paper also provides information on the participation rate of people from Australia's rural areas, isolated areas and suburbs classed as having low socioeconomic status over the decade. Surprise, surprise: these figures, in stark contrast, have fallen or remain the same.
We know from figures released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that the number of students per teaching staff member has also dramatically increased. All universities in Western Australia have been affected by this increase with an increase of up to 35 per cent in student numbers per class. These figures appear to demonstrate that, using the minister's own message to the review, there will not be many empires of the future being built in poor, rural or isolated areas under this government. The government have yet to address the critical issues faced by the higher education system, namely, the ever-increasing unmet demand from Australian students for both university and TAFE positions, the spiralling cost of that education to students and their families and the unsustainable funding pressure being placed on Australian universities and TAFEs.
Even the minister's recent higher education review, Higher education at the crossroads: A review of higher education in Australia, paints a gloomy picture for the future. The strong message coming out of the report is that there will not be any future substantial real increase in funding for higher education from this government and that, further, students may well have to make up the shortfall.
The review proposes a number of measures that, in my view, will only add to the ever-increasing burden on students and their families. The measures of concern to me, as the member for Hasluck, are the increasing HECS fees for undergraduate students, reducing the number of student places, transferring funding from public universities to private universities and possible deregulation of fees. With less and less funding being made available for university places, the review focuses on students and their families bearing the burden of tertiary education. It reflects the lack of understanding that I think this minister has for the severe financial pressure that students and their families already undergo in order to get a tertiary education.
Given that students and families are going to be the most affected by legislation or budgetary measures arising from the review, it is extremely odd that the recent reference group set up by the minister to discuss the higher education sector specifically excludes representation from students. Labor believes that access to education should not be based on income. Entry to university and TAFE must be on the basis of merit. It is with concern that I also note the recent comment by the Prime Minister:
... we are going to seriously address, as part of a reform process, what the vice-chancellors have put forward.
The Prime Minister was clearly referring to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee recommendation to deregulate university student fees—another backflip from his public commitment given in October 1999 when he clearly rejected the deregulation of university fees. I am sad to say that deregulation of university fees is definitely back on the agenda. If the government are allowed to pursue this agenda of deregulation and allow universities to charge fees for Australian undergraduates, they will create an unfair bias in favour of students from wealthy families, which will only lead to a two-tiered system of entry into university. Entry scores for university places will become lower for fee-paying places—we have already heard examples from the member for Sydney—than those required for the government subsidised places. As I say, that has already been shown to be the case in some universities where options to put up-front fees are available.
It seems to me that deregulation is a cunning measure or means by which the government can shift its rightful responsibility to adequately fund the higher education system onto universities, who are already struggling to make ends meet and who in turn will pass the cost on to students. If the New Zealand experience is anything to go by, figures provided by the National Union of Students show that post deregulation, fees increased by 15 per cent per annum. For already struggling students, this looms as an ominous prospect. On top of this inequity lie the inherent problems that are created when students are drawn from such a narrow social base. Australia needs students from a broad cross-section of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds contributing to the knowledge of the nation.
The government's continued lack of vision and failure to invest in education and training were revealed to all in the current budget. The government has failed to deliver the required funding in education and training to ensure that all Australians get the best education possible. Only $12 million was allocated in so-called new measures for the entire education, science and training portfolio. By my figures, that equates to a mere 0.1 per cent adjustment on the total budget for education and training. It is just not good enough. With over five million students in schools, TAFE colleges and universities across the country, these new measures provided a paltry extra $2.50 to each student. What sort of investment in our future is that?
I was also interested to read the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee's vision for 2020, stating that we should aim to have an expanding university sector comparable to any in the world. A defining feature of the university sector is seen to be that all Australians will access postschool educational training, with more than 60 per cent completing higher education—at least 10 per cent at the postgraduate level with choice across a diverse range of quality universities. That sounds great, but I have to wonder which 60 per cent of Australians we are talking about.
Looking at the most recent ABS figures for participation rates in higher education across the Perth metropolitan area, including my own seat of Hasluck, does not fill me with great optimism that participation will be available to all Australians equally. In the inner city western suburbs—in Western Australia, it is our western suburbs that are the leafy suburbs, as opposed to our eastern metropolitan suburbs—the federal electorate of Curtin in WA, with only a slightly higher population than my seat of Hasluck, has nearly four times as many people participating in higher education. My own experience in attending university has given me a greater awareness of the difficulty for students in state schools in outer suburbs in accessing higher education. Believe me, in the eastern suburbs of Perth in my electorate of Hasluck, we know what it is like to be marginalised from the Australian higher education system. Hasluck, as I have said, is located in the eastern metropolitan region of Perth. Despite almost one-third of Perth's university students having eastern suburb postcodes attached to their permanent home addresses, we have just one higher education place for every 5,000 residents. The city's leafy western suburbs enjoy the benefit of one place for every 20 residents.
There are only three universities, with one of the 11 campuses in Perth operating east of the suburb of Victoria Park, an inner city suburb. There is no doubt that this is a contributing factor in explaining the far lower participation of people in higher education in the eastern suburbs. Between 1986 and 1996, the percentage of the population in Perth's western suburbs attending university rose from five per cent to almost 10 per cent. It also doubled in a corresponding group of eastern suburbs, but it moved from a base of just 1.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent. Given that one-third of Perth's population lives in the suburbs east of Victoria Park, these figures are important. If I can put those figures perhaps another way: Perth benefits from around $1 billion in direct higher education learning expenditure annually, and this investment is working to the almost exclusive benefit of communities in Perth's richer, western suburbs. The combined effects of increasing HECS fees for undergraduate students, reducing the number of student places and deregulating fees, as well as the disproportionate location of higher education places, will be devastating for poorer urban communities. There must be equal access to higher education for all Western Australians, and this huge imbalance, particularly in the metropolitan area, must be addressed.
I fully support the community push in my electorate of Hasluck for the development of a university campus or higher education facility in the eastern suburbs—in particular, the proposal by the group Friends of Midland University, who are seeking the establishment of a campus in the historic Midland railway workshops. I should note that the Midland railway workshops always had a significant role in education and training in the state of Western Australia until its closure by the former state coalition government. Establishing a campus in Midland would not only provide greater physical accessibility for those students living in the eastern suburbs, saving on relocation and transport costs, but would also greatly benefit the local community. A development such as this would be a good step towards addressing the inequity that obviously exists with regard to the accessibility of higher education across the Perth metropolitan area. 
However, as this government has proven since 1996, it has no real commitment to education funding in Western Australia. The Department of Education, Science and Training figures clearly show that since 1996 Commonwealth government grants to higher education in Western Australia have dropped substantially. When the coalition entered government in 1996, Commonwealth grants made up 52.1 per cent of the total operating revenue for the combined operating revenues of all Western Australian universities. In 1997, this percentage dropped to 47.6 per cent; in 1998, it dropped to 44.5 per cent; in 1999, to 41.6 per cent; and in 2000, to as low as 32.4 per cent.
The total number of students at WA universities actually went down in the year 2000 for the first time in 13 years. This trend demonstrates the lack of foresight on the government's part. Other disturbing trends revealed in recent Department of Education, Science and Training figures show that the rate of students representing equity groups has slowed and in many cases dropped in the same period, between 1996 and 2000. The number of students entering higher education from a low socioeconomic status has slowed since the coalition won government in 1996, while the number of students who are from non-English-speaking backgrounds has dropped dramatically, with recent drops also identified for women students in non-traditional areas and for Indigenous Australians.
Combine these numbers and trends with figures recently released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that show that 53,925 qualified Australians missed out on a university place in 2002—which is a 33 per cent increase in unmet demand for university places since 2001—and I think the story is a rather damning one for the government. The coalition has robbed these people of a university education. It is impossible to know how much this decision has cost the individuals involved or the Australian community.
The list of damning statistics arising from the Howard government's policies in this area grows bigger every year, but the figure that has had the most impact on me is that more than 35,000 Australian teenagers missed out on a university place in 2002 despite attaining qualifying year 12 scores. I am at a loss to understand how that can be deemed an acceptable outcome by the Australian community at large.
I agree with the honourable member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin, that the latest higher education review will do nothing to assist these young people to gain an education. The Howard government's first report was a blueprint for higher fees and fewer places. That is why I encourage my fellow Australians and people in my electorate to campaign long and hard against the Howard government agenda in higher education, perhaps more appropriately called—given the changes and the trends—the Howard government's lower education agenda.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—I take this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the two bills before this House, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and a related bill. Jenny Macklin, the member for Jagajaga, has outlined in detail the opposition's response to matters of a technical nature and to some new emerging policy issues, particularly the extension of the PELS scheme and the basis on which that is being undertaken in this current legislation.
I want to take the opportunity tonight to talk in general about the crisis that I and many others in the community perceive is rampant in our tertiary university system and to also make some observations about where the government's trend to further place the financial burden on families and students will lead in the long run and the kind of impact that is likely to have on students, such as the majority of those in my electorate, who come from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds.
It seems amazing to me, and I think rightly to the nation, that at a time when there is a global recognition of the need to invest in a nation's skills and knowledge this government has consistently bucked that international trend and that outlook by cutting government investment in tertiary education. The university sector throughout Australia is struggling with the cumulative effects of the $3 billion cut in Commonwealth grants since the Howard government was elected. There is a growing policy position out there in the community and a growing consensus that the directions we now see in higher education are totally unsustainable. And yet that growing consensus appears not to have reached into the minds of the minister and many on the government benches. I think anyone with knowledge of the sector knows that access and quality are in decline at the same time as everyone rightly understands that Australia's economic future is very reliant on this nation becoming a high skill and high income economy. To do that, we need to invest more in education, training and research. We need to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the increasing importance of knowledge as a driver of economic and social change.
What amazes me is that these bills can come before this House at a time when there is widespread recognition among industry leaders, business leaders and the general public about the importance of higher education to Australia's fortunes in an increasingly competitive global environment. And it is not just the opposition that is saying this. Recent comments by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, attested to this, as did comments by Rupert Murdoch and by John Schubert, the president of the Business Council of Australia—let alone the oft repeated demands of the National Tertiary Education Union and, very hearteningly, the recent comments by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, which has recently rejected the funding models proposed by the minister in his discussion paper. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee earlier this year said this:
What the sector desperately needs is a policy strategy that works from the presumption that the national goal is supporting all universities to achieve distinctive missions in a pluralistic system.
But importantly they said this:
Lifting the funding base, starting with a more realistic indexation of the system, will benefit all universities—and every Australian university is under strain and needing support to sustain quality and efficiency.
Those are the words of the president of the AVCC, a highly esteemed and recognised body of authority in this sector. 
The National Tertiary Education Union, covering academic and ancillary staff at universities, in their federal budget submission to the minister had this to say:
Cuts to public investment and Government failure to compensate universities for increases in cost structures are at the core of growing concern about the quality of Australia's university sector. The reduction in public resources available to universities is the primary cause in the decline in access and quality.
Here in Canberra, a Senate inquiry into higher education which reported last year had this to say:
Many of the problems and pressures that universities are experiencing are symptoms of the Government's inadequate funding and the perilous state of many universities' finances. 
The crude funding cuts to universities ... have continued to the point where they are now causing long term damage to the fabric of the higher education sector.
Put simply, the Australian university sector is starved of its lifeblood, and that is public funding. Back in January this year, when first elevated to his new portfolio, the minister, Dr Nelson, had this to say. I quote from an ABC radio interview on 16 January in which he conceded: 
... most of the people who understand the higher education sector feel that they cannot continue the way they are ... many people in the higher education sector are arguing, for reasons that we would understand, for more resources.
The minister certainly acknowledged the problem in January this year, but he has responsibility for the outcomes in the budget, and we see in the budget that there is nothing by way of additional real funding commitments to the higher education sector. There is nothing in this recent budget that addresses the crisis or indicates an understanding that resources are stretched to the point where the overall quality of education and research capability are under threat. Nor do the budget initiatives recognise that 25 per cent of universities are recording operating losses; that is, they are running at a deficit. As my colleague the member for Jagajaga mentioned in her contribution, over 50,000 qualified students who met entry requirements could not get a university place. In areas like the electorate of Throsby, I think it is appalling to understand that many young students who wanted to undertake tertiary study in areas like nursing and teaching could not find places. These are much needed areas of the economy where we are crying out for additional qualified staff, yet young students cannot find a place in the sector.
Dr Nelson is certainly the expert at undertaking a constant system of reviews. I am not sure when the last booklet was released; there are probably about six in the series. We do not need these endless reviews. They have become a smokescreen to hide the real core of the problem, which it seems that everyone in the community other than the minister himself understands, and that is that the system is starved of the public investment and public funding that it so desperately needs.
One of his earlier documents, Higher education at the crossroads, was nothing more, in my opinion, than a blueprint for increasing fees for students and reducing the number of places. The strong message one continues to gain from this government is that there will be no extra public provision or public investment and that, if there are to be additional resources, they will have to be squeezed from students and their families. This is quite an intolerable situation. Students and families are already overcommitted and are struggling under the weight of the HECS system. 
To illustrate my point, I will make some comments about the shifts in funding of the tertiary sector. My point is that the system is already extracting too much from students and their families. In just one decade, we have seen enormous changes in the funding of our universities. Back in 1990, the government contribution to funding was just under 70 per cent of the total contribution; in 1990, 70 per cent of the funds that went to universities came from government. By the year 2000, the government contribution was less than 50 per cent, with students now making up 30 per cent of the overall funding contribution in the university sector. 
A recent study of OECD nations highlights the fact that today Australia is ranked fourth among the nations most reliant on private funding, primarily through student fees. This is already placing enormous pressures on students and their families. In my own electorate I have a very small proportion of young people going on to tertiary institutions—about five per cent of the population aged 15 or over. At the moment in the electorate of Throsby, 2,897 students are enrolled in universities; over 2,000 of them are currently carrying a HECS debt as they study, and 2,620 are left with the legacy of the debt. You have to understand that, in an electorate like mine which ranks fairly high on the relative index of socioeconomic disadvantage, for many students the cost of university education is becoming prohibitive. It is already placing enormous strains on many working-class families that want to do the right thing by their children. That is the situation as it is now; imagine the outcome if there is, as the minister wants, a further deregulation of fees in the tertiary sector.
A report recently released by the Australian Catholic University concluded that many students today are living in unprecedented poverty and that their mental and physical health are suffering as a result. Why is this so and why are we turning a blind eye to the impact of HECS on these people? When we first introduced HECS back in 1989, the repayment began only when a person had reached a level of financial security that was comparable to Australian average weekly earnings on an annualised basis. But by 2001, the repayment threshold for HECS was $22,346, when the average weekly earnings on an annualised basis were $34,735.80. In other words, the gap between the two had grown to $12,389.80. Over this past decade, we have seen the average earnings of Australians continue to rise while the threshold for repaying HECS debts has remained relatively unchanged.
We are now at a point where the gap between average earnings and the HECS repayment threshold is wider than it has ever been and, at the same time, the percentage repayment rate has risen. The notion was that HECS would be repaid at a time when there was a fair measure of financial security and stability, around average weekly earnings. But now, of course, the HECS repayment at a higher rate cuts in at a much lower financial rate in comparison with average weekly earnings.
The conclusion to all of this is that none of us should be surprised when we read reports that the HECS debt carried by Australia's tertiary educated is expected to top $11 billion by 2005. You would have to be foolish if you did not believe that this was having profound social and economic implications. There has been a lot of talk recently about the decline in fertility rates. If young people are carrying debts like this, it is no wonder that many are putting off the decision to have children, which in some part is reflected in the decline in Australia's fertility rate.
Recent modelling by the University of Canberra suggests that the average age at which the HECS debt will be repaid by graduates will be 33 years and eight months for men and 39 years and three months for women. Legislators need to bear in mind the consequential impacts that the HECS system is having currently on working class families and their children—those with the least ability and capacity to pay—and the further negative consequences that must surely come with any proposition to further deregulate the fee system in tertiary education.
The government's push to deregulate fees can only intensify the burden on poorer families and lead to a tertiary education system in this country based on capacity to pay. What a turnaround it would be from the seventies, when we opened up access to tertiary education, to have a situation where we are seriously contemplating policy approaches that would make university education available only to the wealthy, at the expense of the notion of equality of access for all. As I said earlier, despite having a university in the Illawarra region, only five per cent of the people in my electorate currently attend a tertiary institution.
As a nation, we should never tolerate a situation where access to higher education is based on wealth and not merit. This surely would lead to an elite and discriminatory university system. The Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Professor Chubb, correctly stated that `poorer students would miss out on university education if fees were deregulated'. You need only look at the current up-front costs of some of the areas of study: a combined law degree at Sydney University or Melbourne University, $85,000; a vet science degree at Sydney University, $113,000. That is the trend that the minister will exacerbate if he continues down the route of the proposed deregulation of fees for the tertiary sector.
I was somewhat concerned that the AVCC's initial response seemed a little equivocal, but I am a little more heartened by their statement in a recent media release. There they made it clear that they were rejecting all of the government's proposed funding models, and in so doing stated:
Australian universities need an increase in funding—that point is fundamental. Total deregulation is not the answer.
It is high time that the minister and the government took stock of the parlous financial situation that confronts the terrific university sector in this country. It is a sector that is key to ensuring that Australians continue to build on the knowledge and skills that will be required as this nation participates in an increasingly global environment. We cannot be turning the clock back to the bad old days when wealth and privilege guaranteed access to tertiary education and when people who had merit, capacity and ability were locked out because of its high cost. Regrettably, that is the situation we would end up with if Dr Nelson's proposals for deregulation of the fee structures in the system eventuated. 
I urge the minister to take heed of the calls from university staff, students, the vice-chancellors and the Australian community; they understand there is an urgent need to increase our public investment in our universities. It is not too late for the minister to understand that his proposals do not have the support of the sector or the community. We want to see a vibrant and dynamic tertiary system, one that is truly open to all, regardless of parental means—one that is truly open and genuinely encompassing of people from all socioeconomic backgrounds.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2002-08-19,"—We are considering two bills tonight. The first is the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002, which amends the Higher Education Funding Act to permit students at a number of higher education institutions to access the postgraduate loans scheme, to vary funding levels to permit access to ARC grants by the Australian National University's Institute of Advanced Studies and to provide funding adjustments for cost increases and the establishment of a new Graduate Diploma in Environment and Planning at the University of Tasmania.
They are all very worthwhile endeavours except the selective list of non-public higher education institutions to gain access to PELS is, to say the least, puzzling. The Bills Digest states that if the intent of the legislation is to treat all non-government higher education providers equally then it does not make much sense as it appears to confine this extension of PELS to Bond University, the Christian Heritage College, Melbourne College of Divinity and the Tabor College in South Australia. Perhaps the minister could answer in summing up this debate why these institutions have been singled out when the application of the extension right across the board would have no budget impact because the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme is regarded as an asset.
The Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002, which is being debated along with the funding bill, adjusts grants for inflation to reflect revised estimates and to make a number of technical and other minor changes. Again in his summing up, I would like the minister to explain why there is an apparent reduction in operating grants over the three years 2001-03 amounting to $35 million or thereabouts. Is this offset by HECS receipts or is it part of moneys transferred from HEFA to ARCA and is available through competitive grants? The research grants figures I have seen in the material provided by the Parliamentary Library show only a modest increase over the next two years, and I would like to know where that operating grant money previously allocated has gone. 
In speaking in a general sense on government funding of universities, I want to concentrate on a current situation at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst which highlights the funding dilemma facing regional universities. While the budget papers say total spending on higher education is set to increase by about 6.4 per cent from 2002-03 to 2005-06, why has the share of funding for Charles Sturt University declined from 60 per cent government in 1996 to 39 per cent now? Why has the share of federal funding for regional universities declined at a time when the estimated operating expenditure per resident population in the city is more than double the per capita spending in regional areas? These figures come from the Information and Research Services of this parliament, which I am assured are still current, although they were put out a year or so ago. According to that paper, student places per resident population in the city is 32.6 Australia wide, compared with 16.3 in the regions. According to this research, additional expenditure of over $2 billion each year would be required to bring per capita expenditure in regional Australia up to the metropolitan level. In terms of places, there would need to be a doubling at regional universities to put them on par with their capital city cousins or, indeed, `masters' might be a better term.
How do regional universities reach parity? Not, I would suggest, with corporate support or with foreign or full-fee-paying students—the coast and cities take the cream of that. Charles Sturt University is making great headway in offering offshore courses, which has increased its revenue by about $8 million to almost $15 million in the past few years. These are places for overseas students; they are not places for home-grown rural students or for those who want to study a course like CSU's on-campus journalism degree. Charles Sturt University's communications course has been widely recognised for more than 20 years. Indeed, back in the 1970s when it was devised at the then Mitchell College it quickly developed the reputation as the best in the business. It has turned out many of Australia's finest journalists and communicators across the disciplines of radio, print, television journalism, public relations, advertising and, more recently, online production.
I am far from convinced that the overall quality of graduate is as excellent as it once was, but I have not had a regular chance to assess the students' work since departing Channel 8 Orange in 1996. However, I have been in contact with this course for well over 20 years. The problem now is that with the contraction in teaching staff—more and more the trend—the lecturers fly or drive in from Sydney for their lectures, and face to face tutoring is left to technical staff. Continuing professional practice is highly important no doubt for university academics, but for regional universities it leads to a physical separation of teacher and student. In some areas I think that has had a dramatic impact on the quality of the teaching process. Despite this the Charles Sturt journalism graduate remains the best work-ready, deadline savvy recruit in the business. But this reality and this hard-won reputation is under threat unless there is a greater ability for lecturers to commit to the university and their students on a greater face to face basis while at the same time assuring there is no wastage of resources.
Continuing industry experience is vital for lecturers in communications but there must also be as much face to face communication between teacher and student. I understand the vast majority of journalists at Sydney's Channel 9 newsroom are CSU graduates. I was privileged to have many CSU graduates over the years at Channel 8 Orange when I was news director.
At 31 December 1997, total government funding accounted for 53.3 per cent of CSU revenue. At 31 December last year, it stood at 38.6 per cent. This has placed enormous pressure on courses such as the communications and media studies and now the School of Communications is facing significant rationalisation with a loss of some technical support staff. The students assure me they are absolutely essential to complete their degrees with the professional edge that puts CSU Bathurst communication students at the forefront of the industry. The argument over this issue has resulted at times in a quite bitter and protracted protest on the campus and the loss of confidence by many students in the running and priorities of the university when perhaps the common problem for both students and executive officers lies not on campus but in those funding grants I detailed earlier.
Now there is no doubt a review of the communications course at the university may be warranted with its content examined to ensure its industry relevance. I have had a relatively close association with the course over many years, at one time as a course adviser, and I urge the university to reconsider re-establishing such a committee. But that is almost peripheral to the problem of insufficient resources for what is indeed a very hands-on and relatively expensive course to run. Trimming the technical backup, which has been forced on the university, I believe is counterproductive and is threatening the course that has been responsible for such outstanding graduates over many years.
In a meeting with concerned students over the proposed cutbacks, the vice-chancellor said that government funding cuts had forced the university to take a range of actions across a number of faculties to reduce costs and budget deficits. I am told by the university the broad reality is that such reductions necessitate the review of teaching practices—such as those technical support staff being in studios at 5 a.m. to help a live radio service get to air—and that such reductions in funding have forced this review and these proposed cutbacks. Those proposed cuts might not be great in quantity at this stage, but the trend—lower government support and a reliance on full-fee-paying students and scarce corporate help for regional universities—points to less quality and less opportunity for regional students.
The minister was enthusiastic about the initial response from the vice-chancellors to the Crossroads overview paper, which has recommended some limited deregulation of fees. Once the dust settled, however, there were many within the university system who wonder whether deregulation would lead to income stimulation rather than intellectual stimulation being the main game, and whether we are heading to a two-tier system for sandstone universities that can attract corporate funds and well-heeled students and those that cannot. Subsequent papers from the minister continue this private-resourcing theme.
It strikes me, if we head down this path, that we are talking about full user-pays education—or heading in that direction—and education, in the main, for the elite. The vice-chancellors want greater freedom to set enrolment numbers and more fee-paying choices and removal of restrictions on their ability to raise private income. That may be okay for those unis who can attract such funding, but the vice-chancellors appear somewhat schizophrenic in also wanting a bigger slice of public funding and saying the higher education system should remain a public one. I do not quite know how they hope to achieve this on regional campuses—or any campus for that matter—when they want fees on top of HECS and the capacity to set HECS themselves.
The vice-chancellors say students should be able to borrow the cost of a course and pay it back when they begin earning a wage—this on top of HECS, it seems. I can see no better way to daunt students from poorer backgrounds contemplating taking up university studies than this proposal. I have had no problem with the HECS system as it stands at the moment; it is as far as this impost on graduates, though, should go.
There is no market based solution for education. Where has the `learning for learning's sake' ideal gone? Does it mean one day our kids will only study Greek architecture or classics if the subject is sponsored by Olympic Airways? I welcome the minister's discussion papers and review of the higher education sector, but I am afraid his first Crossroads paper looks more like an ultimatum. Show me how user pays can work in this sector. The initial Crossroads discussion paper was riddled with code words for delivering a product—education—like some consumer item, rather than what it should be: learning.
Outcomes based approaches seem to me to mean `tick and flick'. We have already heard allegations of soft marking, such are the commercial pressures for outcomes—and in one famous case, donation for undeserved qualifications rendered. Does learning to be `individually paced', as the report said, mean more external modules, a class-free zone and Internet delivery? As a former teacher, I applaud the emphasis in the second discussion paper on teaching qualifications, but a good teacher is a good communicator, and we need to have face to face classes and tutorials with manageable staff-student ratios to attain that.
Different providers at different times is also mentioned. If improved quality of attainment is one of our goals, how do we retain quality control and consistency under this suggestion? How do universities increase their output and reduce costs? This sounds like a furniture factory. How do we measure the output of an anthropology or a fine arts course? It seems we are talking here about graduates in quantity in preference to quality. Does `industry support' mean we deliver only those courses for which industry funding is available? These are the sorts of questions many Australian parents, academics and students are asking, and they are questions that underline the concerns now being expressed by students and staff at Charles Sturt University.
As I wind up, I just want to put on record the response by Charles Sturt University to that report on diversity, specialisation and regional engagement. The university's response said:
CSU is highly critical of the report ... for its abject failure to defend seriously, or even to place centrally on the reform agenda for the higher education sector, the necessity to respond to, and to meet, the needs of regional Australia. There is serious confusion in the paper about what constitutes “regional Australia”; there is a continual focus on spurious arguments about the necessity to have an inclusive concept of the regional university that embraces those universities headquartered in capital cities and large metropolitan conurbations which have a branch campus or office in a rural location; and, there is a conflation of regional engagement with community obligations in the higher education sector.
However, the paper errs most significantly with the misleading statement that “the Commonwealth's approach” is to not give specificity to defining regional Australia but rather “to allow communities to define their own region”. In this way, suggests the paper, “... `regions'[can then] refer to both non-metropolitan and metropolitan regions.” 
It goes on:
Interestingly, this confusion and obfuscation about “regional Australia” is not apparent elsewhere in Commonwealth departmental reports nor in the recent Commonwealth Government Initiative in Regional Australia.
To deny the uniqueness and the specific role of the true regional universities, as this paper seems to do, is to completely miss the point about the crucial equity and access provided by regional universities. The review process stands charged with taking a metrocentric approach. As for the bills themselves, apart from the questions I raised earlier relating to changes in grants and their apportioning, I have no reason to question them except to emphasise my concerns about the continuing squeeze on regional universities and a clear sign in the minister's review papers that a two-tier system—teaching and research institutions separately—will seriously affect the viability and credibility of regional universities like Charles Sturt. ",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—In addressing the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 this evening, I propose to make some specific comments about the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and some more general comments about the importance of higher education to not only Australia as a nation but, more specifically, to our regional communities. I stress at the outset that whilst I regard university education as being important, I regard TAFE education as being just as important. I say that because I am alarmed at some recent reports which suggest that, despite claims by the current government that there has been an increase in the number of apprenticeships, we are experiencing considerable difficulties in the more traditional trades and major skill shortages in regional communities. 
One of my original concerns on taking up responsibility as shadow minister for employment and training in 1996 was that whilst the changes in the apprenticeship structure the government brought in would create new opportunities in areas such as hospitality, cleaning and security they should also see no lessening of the importance of training in the traditional trades. The reports in today's media, for example, are correct about the failure of changes in the apprenticeship system to keep up with our skill needs in not only metropolitan but also regional Australia, our traditional trade area. The government should have a serious look at what has occurred over the last 6½ years with respect to apprenticeship training in Australia. The last thing we need is skill shortages, because that holds back investment, undermines job opportunities and holds back regional development.
I would also like to make some comments this evening about the importance of higher education. In my mind, education in general is exceptionally important, because it goes to whether or not we as a community are a decent society. I also believe that higher education, side by side with support for TAFE, is exceptionally important to Australia as a nation because it is part and parcel of our struggle to further grow the economic cake, in the context of Australia achieving higher levels of economic growth and becoming more of an international leader in the knowledge economy. That is exceptionally important not only to me but also to the community at large, because Australia is a trading nation in a global economy. It is critical that Australia is ahead of the game in meeting the very complex challenges ahead of us on this front. I therefore am supportive of the second reading amendment standing in the name of our deputy leader and shadow minister for education, the member for Jagajaga. The amendment says at the outset that the opposition:
(1)	condemns the Government for:
(a)	its shameful neglect of public universities of Australia, its undermining of the future development of regional universities and the increasing financial burden it is placing on students and their families;
As I think you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the context of the proposed second reading amendment, this legislation seeks to, among other things, extend access to the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to four private providers: Bond University in Queensland, the Melbourne College of Divinity in Victoria, the Christian Heritage College in Queensland, and Tabor College in South Australia. 
It is interesting to note that these bills have already been considered by a Senate committee. One of the most important issues that the committee processes clearly established beyond any doubt is that the legislation, with respect to the extension of the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to the four additional institutions, does not explicitly include accountability and reporting provisions in the relevant section of the legislation. It would seem that the minister has complete discretion in this area. 
I therefore believe that it is appropriate that we as a legislative body, in considering where we go with this legislation, debate whether or not there should be a requirement for the minister to be satisfied that the institution offers courses that meet quality criteria consistent with the national protocols for higher education approvals processes on the advice of an independent expert panel or a sponsoring university. Those accountability and reporting arrangements would include a number of consistent criteria including evidence that the course requirements and learning outcomes are comparable to those of other institutions; questions of financial status and operation; staff and student data; and equity plans and outcomes for students and staff—just to name a few out of a range of matters that could be included. It is the lack of accountability provisions that gives rise to my concerns about that section of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002. 
I also have the view that the bill has the potential to open up a raft of similar proposals from other non-funded institutions. It may establish a precedent for as many as 90 other non-university providers of higher education—and that number, as we all understand, is growing rapidly. It may lead to the extension of the Higher Education Contributions Scheme to undergraduates at these universities.
As is the custom of this government, this bill also contains critical indexation funding for universities. The nature of the bill reminds me of the fact that this is another example of the government parcelling up their nasty little election promises with vital and valuable funding allocations that return only a fraction of what was taken away from higher education in 1996. We all appreciate—especially those in regional communities—that the university sector has been devastated by massive funding cuts under this government. I have no wish to inhibit the supply of extra support for those regional communities. It is for that reason that, whilst the Labor Party has some concerns and has moved a second reading amendment, obviously we do not want to stand in the way of or inhibit much needed funds for the operation of those universities.
Having said that, I want to raise some more general issues this evening about the importance of universities and their role in regional communities. Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, you would know, representing a regional seat, that universities, research facilities and other higher learning institutions are critical for the future, and more so in regional communities. They provide not only the opportunity for Australians to compete in the global economy but also the leadership, the teaching, the support, the ideas, the knowledge and, most importantly, the partnerships that will enable the communities and regions to compete in the global environment. Obviously, in major capital cities such as Sydney or Melbourne, universities are important. But in regional communities they are more visible and very much part and parcel of the day-to-day operation of those local, regional communities.
The opposition believes that these higher institutions have the potential to engage the local communities and regions and provide opportunities for significant, sustainable development into the future. It is about better utilising the capacity and leadership in these institutions in the future, so as to take those regions forward, create jobs and overcome some of the barriers that are holding some of them back at this point. That goes to what I believe is a most important concept: partnerships at a local, regional level. A regular visitor to these regions would clearly gain a first-hand appreciation of the partnerships that can be developed with learning institutions at a local level. With that leadership and capacity, development in those regions can be sustainable. Partnerships with learning institutions have the capacity to provide opportunities for all communities and regions, especially—and importantly—the regions that have fallen behind the neo-Liberal policies of this government.
I raise these issues this evening because it is about time we had a serious debate about how to create a model that establishes sustainable support at a local, regional level for the regions doing it tough at this point. In doing so, I suggest that it is wrong to continue down the path of coalition pork-barrelling with respect to trying to buy off regions on a short-term basis in the lead-up to an election rather than putting in place well-thought-out regional initiatives that enable regions to take hold of their future, by building into those regions' capacities and using the expertise and leadership that exist in some of our all-important regional higher education institutions.
Partnerships with learning institutions have the potential to provide opportunities to all regions, not just those that are electorally valuable to the Howard government. Obviously—and the record shows this beyond doubt—the Howard government, through its project delivery, provides funds to mates, dishing out unfocused largesse on the pretence of supporting `problem' regions or communities. This creates busy but unfocused local action, walks away from the need to build capacity at a local level, removes local control and stifles enterprising initiative. The question this evening is: when will the Howard government finally learn that it is its responsibility to support the process of being enterprising in regions and not merely to reinforce a culture of dependency on government handouts? Regional communities are not interested in short-term political initiatives in the form of handouts in the lead-up to elections. They want the capacity to take hold of their particular local problems and put in place long-term, sustainable outcomes which mean that they can no longer be expected to be bought off by short-term gains when an election is called.
If we are to go down that more sustainable path, government would be required to provide infrastructure to all in remote locations within Australia. In essence, a legitimate role for government is to provide infrastructure. Local infrastructure supports the process of being enterprising. It enables businesses and communities to take the initiative to develop their own solutions. It enables communities to generate and implement new ideas. Obviously, increased community capacity will encourage effective local leadership that can galvanise the enterprising strength of the local community from within. It has the capacity to bring the community together and would make it worth while for members of the community to provide their own social capital. It would also achieve what is exceptionally important to the future of these communities: trust at a local level and, in so doing, would boost cooperative action and innovative outcomes.
Increased community capacity will also assist in building vital networks and partnerships in and between regional communities. Bringing people together will enhance cooperation and the building of strong informal and formal networks and partnerships—something regional universities can play an important role in. Unfortunately, rather than pursuing that approach, this government has continued its longstanding tradition of politically motivated handouts to a few—thereby seeking to pick winners in terms of electoral prospects—the end result being that communities are divided and partnerships and regional strength is not built. The government continues to create division with communities, all for short-term electoral gain and all against genuine regional development initiatives. All this does is reinforce a culture of dependency on government handouts—something I, as the shadow minister, do not identify with.
When the government invariably fails to achieve the stated objectives, what do we get again? A mistrust of government. Without trust, communities will not enter into the true partnerships that are required to sustain regional development. Government does have a role to play in regional development, in partnership with communities and regions. The current government's policies have effectively undermined confidence in government. Regional communities now recognise that the current government's quick fix solutions do very little in making the region sustainable, either now or in the future.
The global economy, as we all appreciate, is becoming more and more a knowledge economy. To participate in it, people need knowledge and skills. They also need a sense of community and a sense of place. I therefore argue this evening that it is the responsibility of government to enable people in the regions to gain these attributes and successfully use them to maximise their development opportunities not only from the point of view of their local communities but also from the point of view of their family. For regions to participate in the knowledge economy, they are required to develop social skills that enable them to develop strong, local independent leadership. If we are to succeed, these leaders must be from the community, for the community and part of the local community. They must be able to work productively in the community at a local level. Importantly, local leadership will need to have or develop the skills and networks with people and organisations from outside the community—a role in which regional universities can assist.
People in communities and regions must also be able to work more closely together. Regional communities, with the assistance of regional universities, must develop a strong trust in each other. Through trust and subsequent cooperation will emerge strong formal and informal networks, partnerships and clusters. People from regions must be able to harness the strength from local leaders, local networks and partnerships and local desire to interact and compete with the rest of the world—that is, they must have a strong, local, social capital base. At the end of the day, this requires local innovation and entrepreneurship. If given the chance, business will rise from the communities. These businesses will harness local people, skills and knowledge to create economic employment opportunities and grow the local economic cake. They will also be skilled in identifying and building strategic partnerships, with such available infrastructures as universities, local health services, interested private sector organisations and so on.
In conclusion, this debate raises yet again not only the importance of regional universities but also the fact that there is a role for government in assisting to create a vision which provides the support to enable local entrepreneurship. Governments must work closely with local communities to assist them in developing the necessary long-term strategies aimed at achieving these outcomes. In doing this, one must find the ways that are most successful and fit the individual circumstances of each local community and give these communities time and strategic resources to achieve the outcomes that best fit locally. It does not work to fit a local community with a local political crony to be the local leader. We need regional universities to become more involved in establishing the capacity and leadership which ends up in trust being built and networks and partnerships forming, which in turn gives regions the capacity to go on and to no longer be treated with the contempt of this government which every now and then hands out a few dollars here and there on the basis that people might vote a particular way at the federal level.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—It is a pleasure to follow the member for Batman, who is always focused on regional universities and the needs of regions, because that will form a large part of my speech tonight. I rise to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. In doing so, I also register my support for the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
These bills provide indexation funding and adjust Commonwealth grants for the effects of increased salary costs and inflation, and therefore will be supported. But they also raise some particular and important policy issues regarding funding to higher education. Many of these issues have already been covered by my colleagues on this side of the House. As I am speaking at the end of this lengthy debate, I will focus my comments on the impact this legislation will have on the University of Newcastle, which is in my electorate.
In this debate many speakers have expressed their concern for the funding crisis that our universities have experienced over the three terms of the present government—three terms in which we have seen students contributing 40 per cent of all funds to universities; three terms that have failed to adequately assist universities to cope with the higher level of demand for university places. The failure to respond to this increased demand—a demand largely led by the restructure of labour markets that now demand highly skilled workers—is demonstrated by the following statistics. Since 1970 the number of enrolments in universities has trebled. In 1970, 2.1 per cent of the Commonwealth budget was spent on higher education; in 2000 it was 2.4 per cent. At Newcastle University, in spite of increasing student demand, the funding levels have not increased significantly since 1995, generating a $1.7 billion deficit in actual expenditure.
The current model of university funding—the model supported by this legislation—is largely a generic one, yet all universities are different. In Newcastle, fortunately, our university is responsive to our regional needs. It draws from a wide area—from the Hunter Valley, the North Coast and the Central Coast. Many students are living away from home for the first time. In addition, we are not a region where post-school tertiary training is an entrenched pattern over many generations. In fact, retention rates and levels of post-school training in our region are lower than in the Illawarra and metropolitan Sydney regions. Because of these factors and its willingness to respond locally Newcastle University runs exemplary programs offering support and mentoring for first year students. It also collaborates with the New South Wales Department of Education and Training and the Hunter Institute of TAFE to offer joint programs with a training focus, responding to our high unemployment rate in the region. In this way it has a genuine commitment to assisting our region to build its skills base, to increase access to knowledge and to complement our employment opportunities.
Another example of our university's community responsiveness is its enrolment of Indigenous students. Currently there are 290 Indigenous students enrolled at Newcastle University. This is an excellent achievement by our university—as are their outcomes—that has been built up over a long period. But the programs run by Wollutuka—the centre for Indigenous education at our university—can only be effective if they include a component of mentoring and cultural support. Strong links to the local Aboriginal community are part of the way Wollutuka operates, and part of its success, but they also certainly place high demand on resources. So I agree with the call for funding levels for regional universities that support the university engagement with our communities and reflect our local needs.
At the other end of the scale, Newcastle University also operates the highest level of research. Of the internationally recognised top 10 researchers in the world, two are on the staff of Newcastle University. Our work in engineering and the promotion of science has always been a particular strength that has complemented our knowledge based manufacturing industry so vital to our regional prosperity. It is that expertise that will also support the CSIRO national energy centre, which is currently under construction in Newcastle. It will support it in a way that will help it become a leader, we hope, in generating new energy technologies and new clean energy industry. The work of TUNRA, our university research association, provides strong entrepreneurial partnerships with business and industry. It is an outstanding example of the way universities assist regions with their economic development and it is also an effective way for universities to promote themselves and their activities in an entrepreneurial fashion.
Newcastle University is also well known for its unique and highly successful medical degree. This degree has a special focus on clinical training for general practice. It has strong support from our local GPs, who willingly support training that is relevant and based on patient interaction and experience. It is interesting but regrettable to note that medical and nursing students at our university could soon be left without vital insurance cover and be forced to withdraw from practical course experience. The university needs professional indemnity insurance, as I am sure many other universities do, and it needs it urgently for medical, midwifery and medical radiation students. But finding cover is not easy given the present crisis in the insurance industry. Newcastle University has been forced to self-cover so that these courses can continue, but this has the potential to place a considerable cost burden on the university that any university, particularly Newcastle University, cannot afford. We certainly need a national scheme that provides medical indemnity insurance and allows our universities to continue functioning in the way that they need to.
Building on that medical expertise, the Hunter Medical Research Institute—a cluster approach to medical research, which has strong links to academic research and clinical practice—collaborates with Newcastle University and the Hunter Area Health Service to achieve outstanding research results. The adult stem cell research to tackle heart damage that you read about is coming from Newcastle University. It reflects the value adding culture that is indeed exemplary. It is a culture that gives back more than it certainly receives. But the national priorities for growth in higher education and research development need to be decided through consultation that gives our universities and our communities a say in this process.
We also have a legal faculty at Newcastle University that has clinical based training, that sees its students integrated into the community, into placements with practising members of the legal fraternity. These are models that work very well in regional Australia because of the collaborative and cooperative approach that you find in regional communities. But these models do put particular pressures on funding and do put particular pressures on staff, so they certainly need to be recognised for what they generate in a community.
There are many other courses and activities that are worthy of mention that Newcastle University operates. Many of them are focused on training our nurses and teachers, for example, but all programs require adequate funding and recognition of the economic and social gains our university generates for the region and the Hunter community. Therefore, we need genuine structural and funding reform in higher education that provides access and equity for all Australians in a way that further grows the knowledge base of this country and supports its continued contribution to our economic success in this globalised and competitive world.
Question put:
That the words proposed to be omitted (Ms Macklin's amendment) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2002-08-19,"—I thank all honourable members who spoke to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 for their important contributions. Naturally, the government did not agree with quite a few of the contributions made on the other side of the House. The main measures in these bills are to extend the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to four institutions. They update the funding amounts, including providing additional funding for the Graduate Diploma in Environment and Planning at the University of Tasmania. They adjust funding levels in the Higher Education Funding Act and the Australian Research Council Act to allow the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU to access the competitive funding schemes of the ARC and the National Health and Medical Research Council. They reduce the compliance burden on universities in relation to the accountability of Commonwealth funding and streamline the administration of Australian Research Council grants and the provision of expert advice to the ARC board. They further enable the minister to approve research funding grants for a period of four years rather than two. They will reduce paperwork and provide greater certainty to grant holders and variations to funding amounts and reflect revised higher education contribution schemes and superannuation estimates. There are, of course, other technical and drafting amendments.
The government's overall position in relation to Australian higher education is that universities are in quite a sound financial position. However, it is important that, as Australians, we consider not so much and not only the role of Australian universities in the year 2002-03 but what sort of role they will play and the contribution they will make to Australia's economic and social development over the next 20 to 30 years. In that regard, in particular, the government is in the midst of a major review of Australian higher education and I released today the seventh and final discussion paper to inform the public debate of higher education. That will allow organisations and individuals to make a contribution to that debate up to and including 13 September.
These particular bills, as I said, focus on a number of things. I will address a number of the issues raised by speakers throughout the debate. The first is the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme. It is quite obvious to this government that a well-educated and skilled work force that embraces lifelong learning is critical for Australia's economic growth. As part of its commitment to lifelong learning, this government announced the PEL scheme, as it is known, in 2001 as part of Backing Australia's Ability. It encourages extended participation in education and enables students to undertake a postgraduate education with a taxpayer loan being provided for every last dollar of the course that the student undertakes. Early indicators suggest that it has been extremely successful. We have seen a 20 per cent increase in participation, for example, already this year. I noticed that there has been a 60 per cent increase in participation at Central Queensland University and a 30 per cent increase at the University of Queensland and at James Cook University.
The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 provides for the extension of PELS to four additional institutions—to Bond University, Melbourne College of Divinity, Tabor College and Christian Heritage College. The measure fulfils an election commitment made by the government and announced in the budget. It will give students at those institutions access to postgraduate study loans on the same basis as other students, and that means around 2,200 students will benefit, being lent approximately $18.7 million over a four-year period.
The rationale for those four institutions is that the amendment goes some way to addressing existing anomalies in the higher education system, at the same time increasing choices for students. Melbourne College of Divinity and Bond University are self-accrediting institutions and compete with universities for fee paying postgraduate students. This amendment will place all self-accrediting higher education institutions on an equivalent footing when competing for fee paying postgraduate students. Christian Heritage College and Tabor College in South Australia are the primary providers of Christian teacher training, and they are committed to a sector that has no other provider. One would think that all sensible people would support anything to see more teachers coming into the teaching profession. This amendment will provide concrete assistance and a more level playing field for those in the community who have established these alternative institutions to meet their needs.
Some members raised the question of cost. The government has been completely open about the expected cash cost of this measure. As I have said, over the next four years, somewhere between 2,000 and 2,200 students are likely to take up these loans totalling $18.7 million. The member for Jagajaga appeared to be a little confused about some of the objectives behind PELS. The policy could not be clearer: if you are doing a Diploma of Education in a Commonwealth-funded place, you are only required to make a contribution to the cost, otherwise you pay the fee set by the institution. In either case, the student can access an income-contingent loan.
The question of accountability was raised. Under the amendment, the minister requires institutions to provide information about the probity of the institution's governance arrangements and/or the institution's financial position. The amendment also allows the minister to remove an institution from the table if he or she is not satisfied with the institution's governance arrangements and/or financial position, and/or if the institution does not comply with Commonwealth and state laws, including antidiscrimination laws. The minister can also remove the institution from the table if it has breached any of the requirements in chapter 4A of the Higher Education Funding Act.
A lot of honourable members made comments about the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. I must say not all of them were founded in fact, particularly those from the other side. It is worth putting on the record that 1,115,317 Australians currently owe $8.2 billion to the Australian taxpayer—to the Commonwealth government—for higher education contribution schemes. Ninety-one per cent of the students owe less than $16,000; 80 per cent of the students owe less than $12,000. The average HECS debt carried is $7,800. In total, there are 69 students in this country who owe more than $40,000. Australian taxpayers, everyday working men and women struggling to feed their children and pay their car loans and mortgages, fund about three-quarters of the cost of a student's higher education. That is not the level exaggerated by some of the contributors on the other side. I thank all the honourable members for their contribution to the debate and also for the opportunity to sum up.
Question agreed to.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-08-19,"—Tonight I wish to draw to the attention of the House the decline, under the Howard government, of a commonly held notion that for many Australians represents what is best about our nation. For generations of Australians, the fair go has meant that all people, no matter what their origins, have been accorded an opportunity to build a life, sharing equally with others the resources that our country has to offer. The fair go has meant that a decent education has been provided to all children regardless of the ability of their parents to pay. The fair go has meant that taxation has been levied according to an individual's ability to pay. The fair go has meant that in old age people have been provided with a respectable level of support and care. The fair go has also meant that access to health services will not be controlled only by an individual's ability to pay for timely treatment. And the fair go has meant that conditions of work will not unfairly put an employee at risk of damaged health or financial hardship. In these areas and many others this government has let the people of Australia down badly.
Are the most vulnerable members of the community awaiting a bed in a public hospital for elective surgery receiving a fair go? Of course not. Are the frail and the elderly awaiting a nursing home bed receiving a fair go? Of course not. The indolence of the Howard government and its parade of failed ministers for health has seen doctors' bulk-billing levels in Australia plummet, placing an impossible burden on the public hospital system.
Not satisfied that health care has become a luxury enjoyed by the privileged few, the former minister for education would have us believe—and has in fact stated in this place—that the quality of education in Australia's universities has never been better, and we have heard that again in this chamber just a few moments ago from the current minister. Where is the fair go in this government's punitive HECS burden, which has closed the doors of higher education to so many Australian students? Many young people in my electorate of Lowe, faced with a daunting HECS burden, rightly regard members of the government who received free university education as hypocrites more concerned with taxing average incomes than providing for the education of future generations.
I would like to draw the House's attention to a report entitled Future directions in Australian social policy published in February 2002 by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. That report expresses great concern that many young people in the age bracket 25 to 34—the so-called generation X—are at risk of entrenched disadvantage. Edited by a team of researchers from the University of Melbourne, including a former social security minister the Hon. Brian Howe, the report says: 
... a substantial group of young adults are finding it difficult to gain a foothold in adequately paid work, with serious consequences for their economic wellbeing over their lifetime. The ability to accumulate income from full-time work to finance households formation or support children has fallen significantly for many young people.
Such uncertainty is in stark contrast to the stable life course of previous generations, which was characterised by relatively smooth transitions from school to work, work to family making and home ownership. Once again Australians are failed by a government uninterested and unwilling to confront the harsh realities that face many Australians—particularly young Australians—on a daily basis.
A government that insulates itself from the real concerns about jobs, education, housing and a decent standard of living while it secures re-election behind a dishonest smokescreen of fear and suspicion is surely terminal. The world has changed in the past 20 years. Isn't it about time Australia had a government it could be proud of, one that governs for all Australians, not just the privileged few?",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Government Policy: The Fair Go</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-08-19," asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 February 2002:
(1)	Did his present Principal Private Secretary authorise in February 1996 a Liberal Party brochure for distribution to the electors of Lowe entitled “No new areas in Lowe will be affected by aircraft noise”.
(2)	Did the brochure contain a quote from his press statement dated 8 February 1996 saying that (a) those who had not been affected by disruptive aircraft noise in the past in the seat of Lowe would not be affected in the future, (b) the Coalition's policy would result in a dramatic reduction in flights over the electorate of Lowe and (c) Lowe would experience a very substantial reduction in aircraft noise.
(3)	Did the brochure also (a) say that Paul Zammit and the Liberals had the answer and would halve the number of planes over Lowe, (b) depict the Labor Party's assessment of the flight paths over the electorate of Lowe which would come into operation under his Government after March 1996 and (c) contain the words (i) `This is not Liberal Policy' superimposed on that part of the brochure depicting the foreshadowed flight paths which would come into operation in the electorate of Lowe from Drummoyne in the East to Homebush West if he was elected to Government in March 1996 and (ii) `You can't trust Labor' below the words `This is not Liberal Policy'.
(4)	Is it a fact that the Long Term Operating Plan for Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA) forecasts 17% air traffic movements to and from the north.

(1)	to (7) I am advised by my department that the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) for Sydney Airport has a target of 17 per cent of movements to the north of the Airport. Factors that influence the extent to which the LTOP noise sharing targets can be achieved include weather conditions, traffic levels, traffic mix, traffic distribution and disposition, the level of delay being experienced by aircraft, and pilot requirements.
The report referred to in the question indicates that air traffic movements to and from the north of Sydney Airport amounted to 22.8 per cent of all movements for the month of August 2001.
