"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1998-03-10,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone representing the Attorney-General. Minister, are you aware that, as this government insists on careering down the path of outsourcing core Commonwealth services, the appeal, review and access to information rights of every Australian are being radically diminished? Do you agree that those Australians who receive Commonwealth services through a private contractor will no longer have a right to access their own private information held by a contractor through freedom of information laws? Do you also agree that, because clients are not party to contracts between the Commonwealth agency and the service provider, any access or review provisions in the contract are worthless because clients will have no standing to take legal action if their rights are breached?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Commonwealth Services: Outsourcing</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1998-03-10,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, do you agree with the Administrative Review Council view that contracting out of services raises the potential for a loss of accountability in relation to both the services provided to individual recipients and the broader questions of public interest, such as the evaluation of the performance of contractors? Or is this loss of accountability seen by this cynical government as  an advantage of outsourcing?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Commonwealth Services: Outsourcing</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-03-10,"—I thank Senator Jacinta Collins for that question. Senator Collins, you ask generally about the principles of contracting out and how that relates to privacy and then you ask some specific questions. The situation is this: the government does recognise the importance of protecting individual privacy and providing access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act. Any steps to contract out government functions will take into account the importance of protecting privacy and providing access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act. Senator, you were not here at the time but, regrettably, when we were in opposition Senator Patterson and some other senators had to pursue your government time after time when it failed to protect the privacy of social security recipients, for example. I think it was Senator Patterson, if I recall correctly, who pursued your government in relation to social security recipients' information in the gutters of some 
 suburb  of Melbourne. And you have the cheek to come in here and ask this question! You have no corporate memory. It may be, Senator Collins, that you have no memory at all. In any event, plenty of Australians do.
The government has decided that the Privacy Act will be extended to all contractors who hold personal information on behalf of the government. In order to give practical effect to that decision, the government has decided that the Freedom of Information Act will be extended to apply to requests by individuals for access to and correction of personal information about themselves held by contractors on behalf of the government.
It is worth adding, speaking generally, that in a range of contracts entered into by the government there is a clause which allows the government to opt out of the contract. As I recall, that is certainly the case in relation to the employment services contracts. The contract can be terminated. That was one of the complaints that the then Australian Democrat, now the earth moves Labor Party member, raised with us. You raise, perhaps inadvertently, one of the very positive aspects of those contracts—there was planned to be the opportunity to opt out. If someone does not adequately protect privacy that would no doubt be an option that would be taken.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Commonwealth Services: Outsourcing</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-03-10,"—Senator Collins, I do not know whether you woke up and had a bucket of nails for breakfast. You cannot resist trying to put the barb in there somewhere. It does seem, Senator, as though you can see no good in this government. The fact that this government was elected by a vast majority of Australians ought to indicate to you that if you can see no good in this 
 government you are at odds with the majority of the Australian community.
It is not for me to agree or disagree with the report. I will refer that matter to the Attorney and if he cares to add to the answer I have given you, he will. But I think the answer was pretty clear. You may have wanted a different one but the answer is clear: this government will protect the privacy of people in contracting out through the contracts. That has been made very clear, Senator.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-03-10,"—I have an answer to a question that Senator Bishop asked me last week in relation to an FOI request of my department, which I will seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
THE AUSTRALIAN FOI REQUEST
Talking Points
In relation to questions asked in the Senate last week about the FOI request from the Australian newspaper, about Natural Heritage Trust projects I table information that has been provided by my Department. As Honourable Senators would be aware, the FOI request from Mr Lunn of `The Australian' was made to my Department and it was my Department which processed the request. I had no involvement in responding to the request.
As noted in the Departmental advice, not all projects in Western Australia were included in the announcement lists. The Yallobup project mentioned during Question Time last week was one of approximately 70 projects to be discussed with the applicants and was therefore not included in the electorate list for O'Connor. The project applicants had sought $109,260 but had been approved at a reduced level of $85,500
On the basis of experience with the Western Australian announcement, where some confusion was created, this approach was not followed in relation to announcements in other States where all successful projects, even those modified, were announced.
As also set out in the Departmental advice, the Cairns City Council incentives project, also mentioned during Question Time last week, was not included in the electorate list for Leichhardt due to an error in the data fields relating to the electorate. 
 This project was not included in any electorate list, nor the list of regional and Statewide projects and was therefore not in the copies provided to Mr Lunn under FOI. This was simply a Departmental error contained in the documents.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Natural Heritage Trust</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-10,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2], allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
—I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings. I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]
Upon election, amending the Native Title Act 1993 to make it workable was one of the government's top priorities. After a period of consultation the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 was introduced into the Parliament in June 1996. Before the amendments were debated, the Wik  decision was handed down by the High Court on 23 December 1996.
The decision held that native title was capable of coexisting on pastoral leases, reversing a widely held presumption when the Act was passed in 1993. The Wik  decision has led to intense public debate and uncertainty in rural areas about what activities pastoralists can currently perform on their leases. There are real difficulties with proceeding with pastoral business in some jurisdictions and consequent pressures on the government to provide certainty for government granted interests on all forms of tenure where native title coexistence is possible.
A replacement Bill incorporating the Government's response to the Wik  decision was introduced on 4 September 1997 and passed by the House of Representatives in late October. After consideration by the Senate, the House laid the Bill aside on 6 December 1997 after indicating that some Senate amendments were not acceptable.
The Treasury and resources and farming/pastoral industry associations have indicated that there is a need for a response as soon as possible to the issues raised by the Wik  decision. If not, uncertainty may reduce and delay investment in mining, petroleum and rural industries and, consequently, slow the rate of economic growth.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-03-10,"—The failure of this government to take effective action to ensure that the contracting out of taxpayer funded services does not result in this diminution is representative of this government's attitude to the services it provides. We are talking about a government that does not acknowledge or accept that there is a genuine role for government services in Australian society. Through the activities of this government, we know that not only are they committed to reducing the role of government in everybody's lives but their agenda is also an ideological one of trying to outsource everything that is conceivably possible, regardless of the impact on the citizens of Australia.
The issue with respect to this matter of public importance is that the current program of the federal Liberal government to outsource government services is being handled in the most appalling way in three respects. Firstly, it does not acknowledge the rights of Australian citizens to be able to access an adequate and quality service on behalf of the government. Secondly, the government's proposal absolutely flouts and ignores the principles of sound administration when it comes to administering the process of the contractual outsourcing of such services. Thirdly, on the issue of public accountability relating to savings and government expenditure of taxpayers' money, this government has shown a continued departure from the evidence and facts that are available to it about their ability or otherwise to actually deliver those services and those savings.
 One of the best examples of this government's failure to address the issue of outsourcing services in the interests of Australians is the IT outsourcing, and we have already heard today how flippant, glib and shallow this government's defence of that policy is. Their continued references to Labor's previous policies in this regard show 
 that they are not prepared to even acknowledge the issue at hand. The issue at hand is the way that this government is administering that process and their failings in that regard.
We see blunder after blunder from the Minister for Finance and Administration in the way that he is managing the IT outsourcing program in particular. The first was the way that the minister managed to extend an existing contract to the Department of Finance and Administration through a piggyback after an unsolicited approach was received from IBM. This deal pre-empted the minister's own IT outsourcing strategy and shattered any credibility he may have had with industry, particularly seeing that there is no record of any other approach to the Department of Finance other than what has come to light through the estimates process—which was through a phone call. That contract scuttled the competitive tendering process outlined in the Department of Finance's own guidelines.
We have now seen the Office of Government Information Technology—the agency that is charged with progressing this whole strategy—take up this habit with a vengeance. This time, evidence from estimates shows that more appointments of contractors were made without going through a competitive tendering process. In fact, officers of the government and of the department actually made approaches to potential contractors, totally departing from what is certainly sound, common practice of the competitive tendering and contracting procedure.
It is worth noting at this point the Industry Commission report on competitive tendering and contracting out that was prepared to address such matters of probity and of process. The reason that report is called Competitive tendering and contracting out is quite specific. It is called that because the Industry Commission made it quite clear that if a government department contemplates contracting out a given service then they must assess the economic return, the savings and the public interest issues against providing that service in-house. Failure to provide for at least a comparison of the efficiencies and savings and public interest matters between an 
 in-house service and a contracted-out service is a clear indicator of an ideological agenda on behalf of this government. With respect to the outsourcing of information technology services, the minister has specifically excluded the option of an in-house bid.
Turning to those specific appointments, it turns out that Shaw Pittman Potts and Trowbridge and the Flexible Resources contract were given away by Mr Andy McDonald, the former chief executive of the Office of Government Information Technology, without that competitive process. It was also apparent, according to the evidence that came through the estimates process, that Mr McDonald appointed these contracts on the advice of colleagues in South Australia. Therefore, it comes as no surprise to me when we find out that Flexible Resources is in fact a one-person consultancy, with that work being performed by Yasmin King. Yasmin King apparently played a highly prominent role with respect to the whole of government IT outsourcing process in South Australia as a senior economic adviser to the former Premier of South Australia, Mr Dean Brown. Her contract, worth $320,000, is now with the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology. It has also become apparent that it was Shaw Pittman Potts and Trowbridge that provided the consultancy to the South Australian government with respect to their whole of government IT outsourcing project.
Continuing this never-ending saga of total contempt of public processes, the political pressure and industry concerns about conflict of interest eventually led to the appointment of a probity auditor to monitor the processes of the contracting out embarked upon by the Office of Government Information Technology. Fahey's efforts to address a political backlash from Australian IT companies have led to the waste of millions upon millions of dollars for the appointment of consultants to the Office of Government Information Technology specifically for the purposes of advising on industry development. However, in typical maladministration by Minister Fahey, it turns out that in fact it was the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism that ultimately drafted the clause relating specifically 
 to industry development that was inserted in the Cluster 3 contract. So how can the minister justify this massive expenditure on consultants that were appointed without a competitive process to advise on the industry development matters?
Further to this issue—and this goes to the very heart of what we are talking about when we make the legitimate claim that there is a lack of public accountability and a denial of due process and parliamentary scrutiny—is that the government has said that not only will the details of these contracts not be available for scrutiny, so that we cannot have the opportunity to assess whether taxpayers' money is being expended effectively, but the business case that is required to justify the outsourcing program in the first instance is also not to be made public. The point is this: we have a situation where a finance minister of Australia has had the responsibility of overseeing what would seem to be a relatively straightforward process, but systematically over the last two years we have seen blunder after blunder, to the point where the Cluster 3 contract, which was announced nearly one year ago, has just been let—3½ months out from the close of the fiscal year.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Contracting Out of Taxpayer Funded Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-03-10,"—We have had an absolutely amazing waste of time in the Senate this afternoon. I think this would go down as a record in Senate history, certainly a record in my time here, of wasting the time of the Senate.
—To protect Bolkus!
—You are quite right, Senator, in that it is in part to protect Senator Bolkus that they have entered into this delay and time wasting process.
—I was here in 1993 and your side weren't too special on filibustering.
—If you have a look at what has happened today I am sure you would have to agree, Senator Margetts, that they have obviously got something terrible to hide if they are wasting so much time through notices of motion on this issue, wasting half of question time on this matter of IT outsourcing and taking note of answers, and 
 now bringing forward this MPI. They have been trawling through this half the afternoon and they spent several days trawling through it last week. Compared to the Labor government, this government is showing up as a shining star in terms of the way in which it is handling things such as outsourcing. They bring up an occasional example here and there, and the main thing that Senator Lundy has been on about this afternoon—and she has been rabbiting on about it, as I recall, since three or four months ago—has gone absolutely nowhere.
What this government is doing in the IT area is precisely the correct policy. We had one of the opposition senators claiming this afternoon that we were downgrading public services with this. What we are doing, of course, is reorientating the market to a more private approach which, in terms of IT, is far more appropriate. Even the socialists opposite recognise the need for this. In the early 1990s, your Prime Minister Paul Keating put forward a major approach which was leading to outsourcing of government sources. It is your policy and, as I will point out later, in terms of protection of privacy and protection of accountability—the sorts of things that Senator Lundy claims to be on about—this government has done far better than your government.
It is important for us to move to a more private sector approach to this because IT is the way of the future, and it is absolutely essential that we develop local industries in this area. Have a look at what is happening in Malaysia, for example, with their multi-media super corridor where they are creating a new city called Cyberjaya, which is an information technology city. They are saying to world IT companies, `Come on down to Malaysia. We'll give you a five-year tax holiday. We'll allow 100 per cent foreign ownership.' They are setting up a system where they want to be a magnet for IT.
We have to set up competing strategies in this country and we must encourage and develop the IT industry, and that is exactly what we are doing with this. The government outsourcing process, and particularly the way it is being managed at the moment, is a very 
 successful kick-start to this. Let us have a look at some of the companies that benefit from this. As reported in the Australian today, about 24 per cent of the work will be carried out by local small and medium-sized businesses, such as IPEC, Call Express, Randata, Jtech, Execp, Century Software, Macro 4, CCA, SDA, CSS, Ubiquity and Tech Communications. These are small- to medium-sized Australian businesses that are going to benefit enormously from this, and they have expressed great satisfaction with the process.
The local IT industry is delighted with the way in which this has developed. It is not just great news for industry in general but, if I can refer back to a notice of motion by Senator Quirk, it is also great news for regional Australia. Two of the great beneficiaries of this process are Canberra and the Hunter Valley. It is of some irony that the first speaker on this is Senator Lundy, followed by me, because the two great beneficiaries are Canberra and the Hunter Valley. We welcome it, we are delighted, and I wonder why Senator Lundy is putting up something against the interests of Canberra. I thought she was actually the senator representing Canberra.
There has been a great benefit to regional Australia starting from this process and it will continue in the future because IT is one thing that will work extremely well out in regional centres, and in the Hunter, and I am sure in Canberra, people are totally delighted even though Senator Lundy may not be.
The ALP—getting back to their rather spurious claims—claimed that this was not an open process. An article in last Friday's Australian Financial Review by Ian Davis puts the lie to this. He shows how open the government outsourcing program is. The article says:
Australia's local information technology industry has expressed delight
Senator Lundy, I hope you are listening to this-
and surprise at the high levels of local industry participation in the Federal Government's first whole of government IT outsourcing process.
Senator Lundy, why are you making this an MPI? We know you are trying to protect Senator Bolkus, but we are absolutely delight 
 ed that you are enabling us to highlight the success of this government's outsourcing policy.
Not only are there benefits to regional Australia, but also there are great benefits to costs in government. If we look at the savings that stem from this contract, agencies will save around 30 per cent over five years on their projected IT costs while improving services. Why on earth is the opposition complaining about that? It is a great outcome. The news gets even better. We should have Senator Parer here—the minister for good news—because here is more good news, and it is not in mineral exports; this is in IT exports. Out of this process that Senator Lundy is complaining about, the commitment to export is $55 million and, as I say, that is just the start. The Labor Party seems to be critical of all of these benefits.
Since 1991, Labor's own policy on outsourcing of government IT, interestingly enough, given the remarks of Senator Lundy, had actually no protection in the privacy area. This is an area which the government is committed to. The ALP points to accountability as a problem with outsourcing. Yet, Senator Lundy, if you have a look at the Industry Commission report of 1996 on competitive tendering and contracting by Public Service agencies, it found that `when done well competitive tendering and contracting can lead to significant improvements in accountability. There is no doubt that the government is doing it well when it comes to outsourcing.
—The government is not doing it well!
—You are asserting that, Senator. Of course, your whole strategy through these last two weeks has nothing to do with reality or truth. You get up in the Senate and you make an assertion: `This is not working. This is hopeless,' and you are wrong. It is working, and I have given evidence today of how it is working very well. It improves efficiency, it creates jobs and it saves Australian taxpayers money. If you had been listening a little earlier, instead of talking up the back, you would have seen how that was happening.
We have heard in the chamber today from Senator Hill and Senator Kemp that outsourcing is a `triumph' for this government because it allows services to be better provided in a less costly and much more efficient way. In addition, this government has made it clear that the public sector cannot outsource accountability. Agencies remain accountable to government, to the parliament and, through the ministers, to their clients. The very nature of competitive tendering and contracting out will improve accountability and transparency because it requires clear specification of tasks. Senator Lundy has already been told today that it is ridiculous for her to criticise the coalition outsourcing policy when Labor had an outsourcing policy in 1991. I repeat Senator Hill's claim that this is a triumph for the government. That is precisely what it is. We are pleased that you have raised this matter today. It gives us the chance to highlight the government's great success in this area, and that will continue into the future.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Contracting Out of Taxpayer Funded Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-03-10,"—The Democrats are genuinely pleased that this matter has been raised today. On behalf of the Democrats, we support this matter of public importance and we will put on record our concerns in relation to the contracting out of taxpayer funded services and the diminution of accountability or services as a consequence.
This government's stubborn insistence on the outsourcing of services demonstrates that it is quite willing to gamble with what we consider quite a flawed ideology. Sadly, the losers from this kind of policy are often the most disadvantaged—those who find themselves disenfranchised. All too often, the winners are big business and the government itself.
I refer in particular to the recent privatisation of employment services. This scheme has been shown to be flawed both in conception and now in operation. From the outset, the Democrats have had deep concerns regarding the accountability of service providers under the scheme to their clients. Despite the minister's repeated assertions, we see little in the verbal assurances to counter these fears. 
 This morning the minister claimed, on the AM program, that:
Drake have said if they come to us we'd consider taking them for that job along with everyone else who was the best person for the job.
This is clearly no assurance whatsoever, but rather further evidence of the commitment to profits ahead of people. What of the thousands of unemployed people who will not be so easy to place? Drake and other commercial providers, including Employment National, are bound to maximise profits and will therefore not necessarily have a commitment to placing persons, who often include the long-term unemployed. We heard yesterday that those numbers have increased since this government came to power. We are talking about the disadvantaged, those with disabilities, people from traditionally disadvantaged groups, be they indigenous Australians, migrants or ex-offenders—those people who are not deemed by them to be the best person for the job.
There are no incentives or supervision of private providers to ensure that they provide services to those with disabilities or those who may be difficult to place. These organisations will be paid according to results, and the incentive is there for them to maximise their profits and prioritise those who are easiest to place.
Contrary to government claims today and at other times, services have been cut, access has been narrowed, choice has been decimated under this new scheme and significant delays in commencement are expected. In particular, the number of service providers of employment services to the disadvantaged has fallen by 61 per cent to 125. Figures released today from the Bureau of Statistics reveal that the effective number of unemployed persons is actually two million—almost 19 per cent, and double the official rate. Given the likelihood that many of these will re-enter the job market, how does the government expect the new system to cope?
Of even greater concern are the widespread fears in the industry that the tendering process has operated to give Employment National the employment market on a plate. This is perhaps—and what we fear most—a move to 
 fatten up Employment National in readiness for a future sell-off. So we could have future privatisation. We have seen organisations with proven experience lose out to organisations with little or no capacity to deliver the services for which they were contracted. Employment National has been awarded a disproportionate amount of the most lucrative work at the expense of the smaller providers.
We believe that the government has callously disregarded the needs and interests of some of the most needy people in our community by once again placing profits before people and not only gambling away $1.7 billion of funding on a system which was unravelling even before it started but condemning hundreds of thousands of Australians to uncertainty.
The Democrats welcome the Labor Party's return to recognising the importance of accountability and the role of administrative law as a central element of government accountability. However, their actions over the years have not necessarily matched this new found vigour, and I speak specifically in relation to privacy legislation.
Over the last year, privacy has travelled a rocky road, and we heard some indication of this from Senator Chapman during taking note. On 12 September 1996, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) released a discussion paper which set out a scheme based on the existing information privacy principles in the Privacy Act 1988 and adds to this codes of practice and a range of additional provisions which address the particular concerns of the private sector in relation to privacy. Then, on 21 March last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced that the Privacy Act 1988 would not be extended to the private sector. The Prime Minister ended Australia's chance at an international best practice privacy scheme which had cross-party support in parliament. The reasons for this decision are still unclear, but it was another broken election promise.
—Privacy implications.
—Senator McGauran, you can have your go. I have heard you on privacy. I have yet to hear a clear reason from the other side as to why 
 they breached that election promise. Nevertheless, on 28 August 1997, I moved a motion referring the privacy debate to the legal and constitutional committee. This motion was rejected by the Senate—spectacularly, I admit—on 23 September, 41 votes to 10. The coalition and the Labor Party combined to vote against this motion; however, the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine did support the motion. The reasons for the Labor Party backflip following their keen support in earlier debates is uncertain.
Since then, the spokesperson for the Labor Party on this issue, Senator Bolkus, has indicated that the private sector must be subject to the Privacy Act. There is merit in that conclusion, except that they had a rather different line before the Prime Minister altered his conclusion. The Democrats have always advocated that the private sector should be covered by a legislated privacy scheme. This is particularly urgent in light of the contracting out of government services.
There is clear evidence, we believe, that there has been a diminution in the nature and quality of services provided and in accountability in relation to those services as a result of the contracting out of taxpayer funded services. Perhaps the irony of this debate in relation to privacy is that the Labor Party and the coalition have both ignored some good ideas from the Democrats which would have resolved some of our present concerns. If the Labor Party had supported former Senator Janine Haines's amendments in 1988 there would be no debate about this issue in 1998 and we might have actually had laws that protected not only taxpayer funded services but also the interests of all Australians.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Contracting Out of Taxpayer Funded Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-10,"—The Greens (WA) stand for on four basic principles: peace and disarmament, environmental sustainability, social justice and non-violence. It is not surprising therefore that we were concerned in 1995 about the competition policy which basically said that the profit motive will provide public services. We have been asked to talk about two main aspects today: accountability and redress.
Accountability is about whether there is any comeback on what governments provide. The 
 1997 report from the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee on information technology and the contracting out of government services says:
. . . the chain of responsibility for the conduct of those services goes from the hands-on operators through their superiors to senior officials and ultimately through the minister to Parliament.
. . .              . . .             . . .
When you impose a contract in the chain, service provision is placed in the hands of persons not under the day-to-day control of the government department or agency.
Indeed, the Attorney-General's department said:
. . . the contractor is an independent contractor which is responsible for its own actions in the course of the performance of the services. It is a principle under the general law that an employer is . . . liable for its employees (over whom it exercises direct control), but a principal is not held responsible for the actions of an independent contractor (over whom it does not have exercise direct control).
It is all very well to say that when the contracts are renegotiated a contractor will get its comeuppance but it is not a great help to those people who require a remedy.
That leads me to the right to redress. We have a situation where it is very difficult to access remedies via the Ombudsman, judicial review and freedom of information legislation because of the very nature of contracts and private contracts. I will give you an example from an administrative law forum of a case study involving a pensioner who was unsatisfied with his negotiations with an Australia Post contractor for compensation for damage caused by the contractor to his letterbox. The pensioner approached Australia Post about compensation but they refused payment. 	To cut a long story short, the contractor offered one-third of the money. Australia Post advised that the issue of compensation was a matter between the pensioner and the contractor on the basis that the contractor was not an employee of Australia Post and the mail delivery contract excluded Australia Post being liable.
Australia Post said that it could not:
compel the contractor to meet the cost of the damage;  

compel the contractor to reach an agreed settlement with the complainant; and
and itself, admit vicarious responsibility.
The outcome was that the office raised with Australia Post the issue of changes. This was in 1995.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Contracting Out of Taxpayer Funded Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-03-10,"—This is a government that came into office with a deep suspicion of the public service. It ignored the fact that within its bureaucracy there was a large number of highly skilled professional officers with significant experience in a range of key areas.
One of the areas I want to touch on in respect of the government's reaction to those facts that it commenced its office with is the maritime and waterfront area where just such expertise and experience existed. The former transport minister Mr Sharp, along with his ministerial staff, were key offenders in this regard. Following his appointment, Mr Sharp engaged consultants ACIL Economics to develop a waterfront strategy. But this was not a strategy designed to build on the gains made in this sector under the Labor government; it was a strategy designed first and foremost to achieve a political end—a plan to get the ACTU through the Maritime Union of Australia.
The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) became an active player in the development of that plan and in the end he took complete control. His control is now such that we have the illogical administrative arrangement with the Maritime Transport Division being shifted out of the Department of Transport and Regional Development along with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and ANL into the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business. This plan was built by former staffers of the Liberal Party and the National Farmers Federation. It was a plan that cost the taxpayers over $1½ million, with no accountability at all for the expenditure of those funds.
The ACIL Economics contract was let on 15 May 1996. The value of that contract was $60,000 but it blew out to $80,000. The report was completed in August and was considered by a number of ministers, includ 
 ing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. It was on Mr Reith's recommendation that the report was shelved until the new industrial relations laws came into play.
Last night on Four Corners, Mr Reith said that he could vaguely remember reading the report, in which there was a reference to the use of Army personnel. He said he recalled:
There was some reference in an ACIL report to that effect, that's true.
He said that the government was opposed to the use of military personnel on the waterfront.
Mr Reith's vagueness about the detail of the ACIL report is extremely hard to believe. After all, he was a member of the cabinet subcommittee on maritime reform. The other members were the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) and Mr Sharp before he was forced to resign. Mr Reith was the minister who recommended to that subcommittee that the recommendations of the ACIL report be held over. He was the minister who had on his desk on 27 February last year a waterfront reform strategy developed by his department in consultation with the Department of Transport and Regional Development that was built around the disposal of the entire work force and its replacement with non-union labour. That was the ACIL plan.
The government does not have to use military personnel. Its lieutenants, the National Farmers Federation, are in the process of doing just that at the government's behest. Patrick, the stevedoring company, was commissioned to do the task but it failed and the job was given to the National Farmers Federation. A number of the Dubai mercenaries trained for Patrick are now on the job at Webb Dock.
I turn again to the consultancies let by this government in relation to its waterfront strategy. These consultancies have been used to refine the ACIL plan embraced by Mr Reith at the end of 1996. On 20 June last year another ACIL contract was signed, and that contract was valued at up to $600,000. It was done without any tender process at the direction of the minister, Mr Sharp. Some 10 days 
 later Mr Reith got into the act again. He organised for a consultancy to be let to a former Liberal staffer, Dr Stephen Webster, again on waterfront reform, but he did not pay. He organised for Mr Sharp's department to pay. It was his consultancy, but it was not on the books of his department.
A senior officer in the maritime transport division told the Senate estimates committee that Mr Sharp directed him to engage Dr Webster. Dr Feeney, the Assistant Secretary of the Maritime Division, told the committee:
The then minister, Mr Sharp, instructed us to engage Dr Webster on the basis of the discussion that he had had with some of his cabinet colleagues.
Dr Feeney said that there had been a subcommittee of cabinet established to look at maritime reform issues. He said that Mr Sharp consulted with those ministers and instructed him to engage Dr Webster. Dr Webster was given his head to hire anyone he liked. He employed a former colleague Dr John Davies. Dr Webster received $95,000 and Dr Davies was paid approximately $96,000. Dr Webster also engaged Corrs Chamber Westgarth, David Webb, BGC Media and the National Institute of Labour Studies.
Not to be outdone, Mr Sharp engaged Minter Ellison at a cost of nearly $160,000, and ACIL then engaged Liberal pollster Mark Textor's company, Australasian Research Strategies, at a cost of $42,000 to do the political research for the government's plan to destroy the MUA. Liberal strategist Jonathan Gaul was also employed to build a political communications strategy around the Textor research. All these consultancies which the government has refused to provide to the Senate were not related to micro-economic reform; they were part of a political and industrial campaign designed to get the ACTU and the MUA and to advance the industrial agenda of the Howard government and the National Farmers Federation.
Why are we speaking about this in relation to this particular motion? Because the government denies the Senate—even though the Senate has ordered the minister to produce the results of those consultancies—the reports arising from those consultancies on the basis 
 that they are allegedly commercial in confidence or cabinet in confidence. At the same time we now have evidence that those same consultancies that were commercial and cabinet in confidence have been revealed at meetings involving officers other than members of parliament and members of the Public Service. We believe—in fact, we are certain—that those other people were officers of the National Farmers Federation. So much for commercial in confidence and cabinet in confidence.
What has the government done in relation to the situation where Mr Hoolihan, one of the ACIL consultancy consultants, is now on the board of P&C Stevedoring, yet he was part of the development of the first ACIL consultancy reports? What has the government done in relation to ensuring that there is not a conflict of interest? I can tell you because we dealt with this in estimates: absolutely nothing. There is no strategy to do anything because no-one allegedly who is in a position to do anything or wants to do anything has seen these reports. They are not in a position to do anything. So much for government accountability and the government pursuing the interests of the public in terms of enforcing contracts that it let without a tendering process for its political ends and not in the interests of the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Contracting Out of Taxpayer Funded Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1,speech
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1998-03-10,"—That was a very interesting discourse on accountability. I think what Senator O'Brien strangely neglected to talk about was the attempts to make the Australian waterfront accountable to those people who use it, as well as the rest of Australia. Senator Lundy's motion today purports to be concerned with government accountability. She gave some examples of it here this afternoon, and Senator Stott Despoja also talked about accountability in relation to aspects of privacy. It is useful to repeat what Senator Lundy talked about in her motion. She wants to ensure that the contracting out of taxpayer funded services does not result in a diminution of the level of government accountability. I could not agree more, but let us have a look at the benchmark of accountability in this place: the Labor Party's record of accountability in 
 government; a very appropriate benchmark of accountability.
It seems to me that Labor are the last people—and I am sorry that Senator Lundy is not here and, for that matter, Senator Stott Despoja either—who should be delivering lectures in this place on accountability of contracting out of taxpayer funded services. This is the Labor Party that under the now deposed emperor gave us the Ros Kelly school of accountability—the great big white board that was as big as a tennis court. This is the same party that is responsible for the Graham Richardson revelation in the current issue of the Bulletin where he confessed that without the white board he managed to disburse I think he used the words `tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money' to Labor electorates and Labor's mates, but he got away with it.
This is the level of accountability that we are talking about in this place. There is no accountability from the Labor Party. This is a shameful motion. The Labor Party's accountability is zip, and the best example of this is the accountability of Labor's Working Nation. Let us have a look at what Working Nation actually promised in terms of accountability, what they promised the unemployed of this country they would be accountable for. Former Senator Gareth Evans got it right on this occasion when he said unemployment is without—
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Senator Conroy was not a beneficiary of Working Nation. After his training program he fortunately found a job. He is one of few. If he had been on Working Nation I would not like his chances. Senator Gareth Evans said the following:
Unemployment is without question the greatest problem we face. Unemployment saps the confidence and self-esteem of our fellow Australians—which in turn saps the nation's. It damages the social fabric.

Well, it certainly does. Those people who took part in Working Nation found that, at the end of it—after the countless training courses and programs that they were put on—they were sacked, and sacked, and sacked; but they certainly were not employed.
What did Labor do in promising to fix this problem and be accountable for the millions, in fact billions of dollars that it sank into the Working Nation program? Mr Beazley's now deputy, former Senator Gareth Evans, made this promise when he tabled Labor's Working Nation plan in this place:
If you have been a long time out of work, we will offer you employment and training.
He quoted the Prime Minister's words from election night in 1993, and he said:
. . . we will not leave the unemployed behind.
Where was the accountability in this? He boasted that the Working Nation program was tailored to meet the needs of the unemployed in a modern Australian economy, and it `will serve Australia for many years'. What an ill-fitting, totally unaccountable, old fashioned, outmoded garment it turned out to be. It was rejected by all those who tried it on—absolutely, without question, totally unaccountable.
What Working Nation actually delivered, in terms of accountability, turned out to be a $12 billion disgrace—a disgrace. In fact, during the half decade between 1 July 1990 and May 1996, only 16,000 full-time jobs were created under Labor; and between July 1990 and February 1933, 339,800 full-time jobs were lost.
I notice that former Prime Minister Hawke is now sorry about the economic circumstances that brought this about. He is, eight years later, suddenly accountable. That is an interesting timelag in terms of accountability. I hope that we will not have to wait that long for Senator Faulkner to apologise to the Baillieu family.
Labor's legacy of unemployment peaked at 11.2 per cent in December 1992. That is an act of disgraceful accountability—absolutely disgraceful accountability. It is a benchmark that should have the opposition in this place hanging its head in shame. Labor's One Nation programs saw three out of five people still unemployed at the end of the programs—and we are in here to answer questions about our accountability! What about the accountability to the thousands of Australians who believed in those empty and meaningless 
 promises, as they optimistically got up off the couch, got up out of their beds and went to yet another training program?
Senator Stott Despoja touched on aspects of privacy, particularly in relation to the new arrangements for employment services contracts. Privacy issues are covered by the Commonwealth contract with Job Network members which specifically prohibits them from breaching information privacy principles. The contract was developed in very close consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, and it does ensure that appropriate safeguards to those under the Privacy Act will be applied. It has exactly the same provisions as have contracts with labour market program providers which are in place now and, in fact, were in place when Labor was in government.
But let us never forget that the Howard government's record of accountability has begun already; it began soon after it took office in March 1996. In fact, since that date, 223,700 new jobs have been created. How is that for accountability, Senator Conroy? A good deal better than the labour market program under `Not Working Nation' that you put up—
—Unemployment is going up!
—and a good deal better on accountability than you will be judged to be at the next election.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Contracting Out of Taxpayer Funded Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-03-10,"—On this matter of public importance on outsourcing, I just want to say that the part of the motion which says:
. . . the failure of the government . . . to ensure that the contracting out of taxpayer funded services does not result in a diminution of the level of government accountability . . . 
probably would have been more appropriately worded as `that has resulted in the loss of government accountability'—because that is exactly what has happened. As the chair of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee which has been conducting an inquiry into some aspects of outsourcing, I have found it very interesting to note some of the evidence that has been submitted. But what is more interesting is the approach that the government has taken—and that is the 
 `honest John Howard Prime Minister government'. He said that he was going to bring to the parliament a new sense of integrity, a new sense of honesty, and a new sense of everything else. It obviously was not a core commitment, because he has brought to the parliament none of those things.
What we have seen though, with regard to the outsourcing of government taxpayer funded services, is a number of documents that have been developed over time to provide advice to public servants about what they should do. I think I started to lose count of how many documents there were. But one of particular note is this agreement, which I have read from before: the Commonwealth procurement guidelines. Of course, there is a glowing letter in here about the guidelines. In terms of the processes that we are supposed to go through, firstly, I suppose, the most important part is open and effective competition—something on which this government prided itself that it would deliver; it would deliver open and effective competition.
Has it? Certainly not with regard to all of the IT outsourcing—not one little bit. Millions of dollars worth of contracts have been let—and not one has been advertised. But what does it say about open and effective competition? It says `open and effective competition is the central operating principle for all Commonwealth procurement'. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) could not have read it.
The Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) could not have read it. He obviously did not read it because, when he piggybacked the Department of Finance outsourcing onto the Department of Veterans' Affairs, was there an advertisement, was there a public notice? No. Was there any competition? No.
Of course, it goes on and makes a few other points. But I suppose another important part is ethics—ethics and fair dealing. What does it say in these Commonwealth procurement guidelines? It says:
In procurement, as in all aspects of business and public administration, if all parties involved adhere to ethical standards they can:
. deal with each other on a basis of mutual trust and respect . . . 

You have really won the mutual trust and respect of the Australian IT industry, haven't you? You have done real well. How much business have they secured as a result of this stupid, unfair and unethical process that you as a government have been going through? Talk about jobs for the boys and mates rates. It all applies here. The book should have been renamed `Jobs for the Boys' and `Mates Rates: how to go about it'. It says further:
Commonwealth staff associated with procurement, particularly those dealing directly with suppliers, should ensure that they:
. recognise and deal with conflicts of interest . . . 
That is interesting. I notice that it says `staff'; it does not say `members of parliament'. It also says `deal with suppliers even-handedly'. That is an interesting little statement. What have you done with regard to advertising? You cannot have competitive and effective competition unless you place adverts and call for tenders. That is the process that ought to have been in place.
I go to accountability and reporting, which the government made much ado about. In fact, only when it was in opposition did it talk about accountability. Now you do not want to talk about it. You do not want to do it, but you provide a document to public servants which says:
Accountability involves making individuals and organisations answerable for their plans and actions and for the outcomes of these.
Why is it that when we questioned in the estimates process about the names of those people who tendered for the EPI and PEPIs—just the names of them; we did not seek any significant information—they could not be provided? Why not? It was because of commercial in confidence. What a ridiculous statement. It really demonstrates how far this government has gone backwards from its position in opposition.
I can remember government senators when they were in opposition talking on many committees about accountability and so on. But where are they now? It will be interesting to see what Senator Chapman has to say about that, as he was one of those who used 
 to pursue it with some vigour when in opposition.
That is not the only matter on which this government has done a major backflip from when it was in opposition. The other issue is privacy. What have you done about privacy, about protecting people's private and personal information? You have done not one thing. I think it was the minister who said recently that there are contracts that say that it would be illegal—I do not know how you can actually bring about some judgment on that—to process personal information offshore. But you have not enacted any legislation to stop that. You never will because you do not care.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1998-03-10,"—This matter of public importance debate this afternoon, raised by the Labor opposition, only shows how bereft of ideas and policies this Labor Party is. This is a pathetic excuse for an opposition. They cannot find any real issues on which to attack the government, so they try to manufacture one in the form of information technology outsourcing.
All it has served to show is their utter hypocrisy because it was the Labor Party in government that initiated this very policy. Let me remind the Senate again that it was in 1991 that Prime Minister Hawke issued his industry statement `Building a Competitive Australia', which established the contracting out of government information technology services as Labor government policy. What short memories you have over there.
What about the policy statement in 1995 by then finance minister Kim Beazley—your $10 billion black hole Leader of the Opposition? The outsourcing of government infrastructure was made Labor Party policy by that finance minister's circular in 1995, when he said, amongst other things, that agencies must test the market for the outsourcing of both new and existing information technology services as an alternative to the maintenance of in-house capabilities. That document was Framework and strategies for information technology in the Commonwealth of Australia, launched by then finance minister Kim Beazley. The statement of Bob Hawke was 
 followed by the Department of Veterans' Affairs' outsourcing of its information technology requirements in 1991. It was the first department to do so.
Conveniently, all of these facts are now forgotten by the Labor opposition in their attempt to discredit the present government's approach to this issue. What really gripes the Labor opposition is the fact that, where they completely and utterly failed with regard to information technology outsourcing, the present government is succeeding. Although Labor introduced the policy in 1991, they lacked the intestinal fortitude to carry it through to proper implementation. Also, they did not have control over their departments, or the departments thumbed their noses at the Labor government and their directions on outsourcing. The then government ignored the policy and continued to develop their own individual information technology system.
The Labor government failed dismally in the implementation of its policy. It failed to achieve maximum outsourcing. It failed to achieve any additional value for money, and it failed to achieve agency efficiencies, as was stated in the policy memorandum. As I said, only one department in Labor's last five years in government outsourced its information technology—that is, the contract entered into by the Department of Veterans' Affairs with Ferntree for outsourcing.
Contrast the litany of failure of the previous Labor government with the success that this government has been achieving in its two years in office. That element of criticism simply does not stand up to scrutiny. Then Senator Lundy in this debate raised the issue of privacy, as she did by wasting our time and taking note of answers earlier in this chamber today. It was the Labor government during those five years—when, as I have already indicated, quite limited outsourcing was achieved—that completely ignored the issue of privacy, Senator Conroy.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—It did nothing to amend the Privacy Act to take account of outsourcing. Again, we see this utter hypocrisy where they get up in this chamber and criticise this government on privacy con 
 cerns—something they were completely uninterested in when they were in government.
There was but one breach of privacy during the period that Labor was involved in its outsourcing. Senator Faulkner admitted that the Department of Veterans' Affairs was told by the Labor government to provide lists of names for Jim Soorley, their Brisbane Labor mate, the mayor of Brisbane, so that he could send out Christmas cards—a leak for political purposes instigated by the previous government. There was no other problem with privacy whatsoever during the period of outsourcing, either under the previous government or under this government. At least this government is doing something about the privacy issue. We do have amendments to the Privacy Act currently in the House of Representatives to deal with this issue. So there will be an improved protection of  privacy as far as outsourcing is concerned.
The government has also indicated that it will extend the Freedom of Information Act to cover documents held by a private sector provider where the contracting agency itself has right of access to documents. If an agency sees the need for the Australian National Audit Office to have right of access to a contractor's premises, a clause to that effect can be included in the contract.
Labor senators have also argued that contractors cannot be held accountable. Competitive tendering and contracting is a performance improvement tool that can be used to ensure that in-house provision of services is competitive with the private sector and vice versa. Competitive tendering and contracting, by virtue of providing a clear specification of tasks and standards, can improve accountability and transparency—quite in contrast to what we have heard this afternoon from the opposition.
The government services charter initiative requires that any agency offering services to clients develop a charter in consultation with their clients. Clients can clearly stipulate the standards that clients expect and stipulate who should be the target of their complaints if the service is not  delivered to that standard. The agency must publicly report on their perform 
 ance against the undertakings made in the charter on an annual basis.
There have also been complaints about the alleged lack of competitive process in the appointment of contracts with regard to outsourcing. The fact is that this government is approaching outsourcing case by case and contract by contract. While being opposed to a blanket extension of the administrative law to the private sector through competitive tendering and contracting arrangements, they do advise that agencies should think about their contractual arrangements. So, again, administrative law features quite strongly there.

Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President—
—Nothing to say.
—I have plenty to say, Senator Cook. In relation to government business notice of motion No. 1, we finally get to this matter at about six or seven minutes past six. It is abundantly clear from what is going on that Labor is scared of this debate. They are absolutely petrified of this debate because they wasted an hour and a half on Thursday last week and they have wasted time today with a record number of notices of motion in order to simply postpone the inevitable—having to face up to what this chamber thinks of Senator Bolkus's behaviour. I think there were 45 notice of motions today. The most I heard of previously were 35 notice of motions moved on 18 December 1991—a 
 record number moved today to just postpone the inevitable.
Why, you might ask yourselves, is Labor scared of this debate coming on? Why would they want to waste all that time?  They are scared of it coming on because they know that Senator Bolkus went out and leaked a confidential Federal Court document; they know that that document must have been illegally or improperly obtained; they therefore know that Senator Bolkus has breached appropriate standards in this place; and they know he should be censured. So they will do anything to avoid bringing this matter on.
This debate today is not about the normal rough and tumble of politics. We all go through that. I have been here 12 or 13 years and have seen plenty of it, I am sure Senator Stott Despoja has seen plenty of it and I am sure Senator Ray has seen more of it than anybody in this place. But it is not about the normal rough and tumble of politics. This is not about Senator Bolkus's false claims to the Australian community that the Labor Party would simply reinstitute proceedings to bring Mr Skase back from Spain. It is not about those false claims. He knew those were false. The former Labor Attorney-General indicated as much, that they were false. The former Labor Attorney-General was honest with the Australian people when he said that the opportunities to extradite Skase from Spain had concluded and it did not matter if Mr Skase subsequently looked healthy; the game was over in Spain.
Despite knowing that, Senator Bolkus went out and misled the Australian community, making a big Joe of himself, making a false claim that Labor would bring Skase back, that they would introduce extradition proceedings. But this motion is not about that, and it is not about the invented figures that Senator Bolkus raises to give himself a bit of a run in the media.
It is not about the $50 million he talks of in Skase assets. Mr Acting Deputy Chairman you might have heard the offer being made to him the other day: if you know where $50 million worth of assets are, Senator Bolkus, why don't you let Mr Donnelly know? Tell him in what countries the companies are; who 
 the directors are; where the trusts are, who are the trustees and what are the assets. If the shadow Attorney-General, the alternative first law officer of the Commonwealth, purports to know where $50 million of Skase's assets are, you would think it would be in Australia's interests that he would own up and tell somebody where they are. Where are these assets? In what countries are they held? What are the company names? Who are the company directors? Where are the trusts and who are the trustees? There has been silence from Senator Bolkus, but that is the rough and tumble of politics. We all know he wanted to get himself a headline, so he just drummed up $50 million out of anywhere and attached it to Skase's name.
But this motion is not about that, and it is not about the false claims he makes that the government, and myself in particular, have improperly somehow held up the Skase chase; some sort of waffle about some documents that were not signed. I notice he has not come forward with any suggestion of what those documents were, and the reason he has not come forward is that there were no such documents. Not only was there no delay, there were no such documents. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice do not have to sign documents to allow service in proceedings to which the Attorney or the Minister for Justice is not a party.
What kind of dreamland is this that the alternative first law officer will come up with? It is not about those false claims, because that is the rough and tumble of politics. You do not expect any more from the likes of Senator Bolkus. This motion is about standards; standards that we are prepared to ensure are kept and upheld in this place. It is about the standards that are suitable for every senator and the standards that the alternative first law officer ought to uphold himself. It is about the standards that he has not upheld.
Senator Bolkus surely knew that he was, shall I say, Skasing on thin ice, when he told the world that I had delayed the service of some documents by failing to sign them. He was Skasing on thin ice because not only was there no delay, there were not any such documents. Equally, Senator Bolkus cannot 
 hide behind poor sources and say, `Oh, look, I did not really mean that. I did not mean to be misleading with the Australian community. That is what I heard from the media.' The affidavit that Senator Bolkus quoted from clearly indicated why service had in fact been delayed. Mr Donnelly was trying to keep the proceedings secret so that service could be made on all parties at roughly the same time.
Senator Bolkus most surely was skating on thin ice at that time. And he was certainly skating on thin ice when he falsely suggested that the Labor Party would reopen extradition proceedings of Skase from Spain when he knew that that was not a possibility because his own Attorney had said so. And he was skating on thin ice and Skasing on thin ice when he invented figures of $50 million assets of Mr Skase's and failed to identify to Mr Donnelly the countries, the companies, the directors and the trusts.
This is not about any of those matters. But when Senator Bolkus went further, when he leaked a confidential Federal Court document both on and off the record, the ice cracked and he fell through. This censure motion is not about the rough and tumble in politics, it is not about those other matters that I raised—this is all about leaking a confidential Federal Court document, doing so both on and off the record. That is when the ice cracked, and Senator Bolkus, who has not got the gumption to be in here at this time and face this accusation and listen to what the Senate has to say, fell right through that ice. Senator Bolkus is drowning in his own failure to maintain appropriate standards in this place.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you know and other senators know that in this place we have the greatest opportunity for freedom of speech; a greater opportunity than most other citizens unless those citizens are speaking in parliament. People who are speaking in parliament or to parliamentary committees quite properly get the protection of parliamentary privilege. Why do we get that protection? We get that protection, and people who give evidence to committees get that protection, so that parliament can know the truth. That is why we have an added protection for 
 people speaking in parliament on what they raise so that parliament can know the truth.
Even with that much greater freedom that we have that the general members of the public, unless they are giving evidence here, do not have, even with that enormous opportunity we have, we nonetheless in this place accept some rules and some limitations on that. We accept, for example, the sub judice rule. That simply means not that you cannot mention any case that is ever mentioned in a court; people make that claim freely. What the sub judice rule does mean and is well understood to mean is that, if matters are before the courts and what is said in this place could in some way impact on those proceedings, the remarks are best not made.
That has been followed here plenty of times, and Senator Bolkus knows about it. On 28 November 1990 he said:
The matter being before the courts . . . In respect of that, further discussion may be sub judice.
In 1995 he said:
The doctrine of sub judice dictates that it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on the correctness of the decision or the interpretation of it.
These are just a couple of examples that show that Senator Bolkus knows what the sub judice rule means. It means that if there is a matter before the courts, if you want to uphold the appropriate standards in this place, you think very carefully about what you say. With all the protection and all the privilege that we are given to speak freely in this place, we accept that limitation because, while parliament might be the highest court in the land, parliamentarians are not meant to interfere in the processes of the courts.
Against all that, we had Senator Bolkus both on and off the record revealing the contents of a highly confidential Federal Court affidavit, an affidavit that must have been illegally or improperly obtained. We know—there have been papers tabled in this place to show—that Mr Donnelly, Mr Skase's trustee in bankruptcy, did not authorise the release of that affidavit. It did not come from Mr Donnelly or anyone authorised by him to release it. We know that no-one sought a court order even to have a look at it as a 
 document in the Federal Court. So it must have been illegally or improperly obtained.
The very contents of the affidavit revealed the need for secrecy. That was abundantly clear. In fact, it was the very need for secrecy that Senator Bolkus chose, in his stupidity, to quote from. What he quoted from was Mr Donnelly's affidavit. I believe he used this portion—that he was concerned that `unless the ownership structure was preserved by injunctions pending the hearing of proceedings, steps will be taken by Mr Skase to dissipate the assets.' In other words, it was abundantly clear that these were proceedings to which there was an element of secrecy. So not only did he use a document that was not his but one that was not properly obtained. I do not say that he illegally or improperly obtained it from its proper place, but somebody did; and the shadow first law officer should know that he did not have permission from Mr Donnelly to use it, and he damn well did not have permission from the Federal Court.
Despite all of that, he went ahead anyway and revealed what had not been revealed before. He revealed that hearings had already been held. He revealed where the hearings had been held which, in itself, gave opportunity for Mr Skase to understand what assets were being sought and which people might in fact be a party to those proceedings. He further revealed that Mr Donnelly was ready for service. To any party involved in this matter, that says, `Get ready, the service deliverer is going to be knocking on your door. Don't be home at 7 in the morning. Shut your door; have a look out your door before you answer your door.' Service in this matter was difficult.
Nonetheless, we have a situation where the would be if could be alternative first law officer did not check with Mr Donnelly. He did not even think of saying, `This is a matter in the national interest. Mr Donnelly is Skase's trustee in bankruptcy; I will first check with him privately.' He did not have to come to the government. He did not have to involve politics. He could have gone to the trustee in bankruptcy, who was not appointed by this government and who has been the 
 trustee in bankruptcy for some time now. He could have gone to him privately and said, `Is there any damage that I might do if I release the contents of this affidavit?'
Senator Bolkus did not do that. He certainly did not check with the Federal Court as to whether this document was available for public inspection. He did not care about the need for secrecy. He clearly did not care that this was a document that was not his; he was happy to use it in any event. He put into the public arena something that, even in this place, with all the freedom we have, presumably we could not do because the sub judice rule would stop us.
Senator Stott Despoja, what would you do if a senator on the other side stood up now and said, `I've got another affidavit in the Skase proceedings and I think I'd like to read it out'? Surely, would you not ask if you could see it first? Would you not ask if Mr Donnelly had—
—I don't want to see any affidavit.
—Senator Stott Despoja does not even want to see the affidavit. She is in my boat; I did not want to see the affidavit either. I have not had possession of the affidavit. My office might now have it, but we certainly did not have it at the time that this was leaked. Senator Stott Despoja takes the right attitude: these are proceedings that are best left to the people involved with running them and parliamentarians have no business sticking their beaks into them.
But I am putting the proposition to you, Senator Stott Despoja: if someone stood up in this place and said, `I am now going to read from an affidavit in some newly instituted Skase proceedings,' would you simply sit there and say, `Oh, that's okay. Put it all on the public record; we'd like to hear the details'? Of course you would not. You would want to see the document. You would want to know if Mr Donnelly had given approval. You would want to know if there was any chance of prejudicing the proceedings. You would not simply sit there like a stunned rabbit and let somebody in this place get up and reveal the contents of a confidential affidavit. 
Senator Bolkus argues that he did not reveal anything that was not in the media or on the public record and I would like to deal with some of those matters. He said that the asset location was revealed by the media. But we know that the Daily Telegraph said, `The location of Skase's hidden fortune, which has been identified, has not been revealed.' That does not look very much like they revealed the location of the assets. He said that the location of legal proceedings had been revealed by the media. The Telegraph said that international legal proceedings were under way. Pick a country or city anywhere around the globe; it could be there. That does not tell anybody anything. On the other hand, Senator Bolkus said the legal action was occurring in Spain, in London, in the Cayman Islands and in our own Federal Court. In other words, he went ahead and detailed exactly where the proceedings were to be.
Senator Bolkus revealed that court orders were ready to be served. The Daily Telegraph made no mention of these orders. Senator Bolkus continues to say, and I notice senators on the other side continue to say, that the government leaked this story. I invite them to read the Daily Telegraph editorial of the Tuesday or Wednesday of that week which quite overtly says—and I think it is most unusual; I cannot recall having seen a newspaper editorial saying this—that it is a nonsensical claim that the government, in that sense meaning the minister or her office, gave the paper this story, and it outlined the attempts we had made to stop the initial story going to press. That is a most unusual step for a paper to take, and why did they take it? Presumably because they were revolted and repulsed at Senator Bolkus being such an opportunist and suggesting something that he must have known was not the truth.
He says that he has revealed nothing that was not on the public record. It is so public that you have to get a court order to look at the document! That is how public it is. Nobody can just march into the Federal Court and look at this. Senator Bolkus knew that, and you can tell that he knew it because at the end of his press conference, after he said `Thanks very much' and he thought the 
 cameras had been turned off, behind everybody's back he said words to the effect of: `I've got some documents here. I can't give them to you but I can read them to you off the record.' Why couldn't he give out the two pages of the affidavit that he quoted from? He had already quoted from it; why couldn't he give it out? He could not give it out because he knew he was doing the wrong thing. That is why he waited until it would be off the record. He knew he was doing the wrong thing.
In any event, Senator Bolkus's defence that everything revealed was on the public record simply will not work. It is not true; it is a failed defence. But even if everything were on the public record, that is no defence to recklessly reading from a confidential Federal Court affidavit. That is no defence; but in any event it does not work for him.
The situation is that the release of this document had not been authorised. He had absolutely no right to possess it, and he had no right to reveal the contents. It is unacceptable for anyone in this place to ignore the sub judice rule in this place and to just launch into proceedings that are under way, and it is even more unacceptable for the shadow Attorney-General to do so. It is not acceptable at all.
We have tabled documents that prove all of this and they are on the public record: Mr Donnelly's denial that he had been held up in any way, Mr Donnelly's confirmation that he did not release it and the Federal Court's confirmation that they did not release the document. The record shows that the shadow Attorney-General—the alternative first law officer of Australia—is prepared to peddle illegally or improperly obtained Federal Court documents and to make them public, recklessly and without any care for the consequences.
That is unacceptable for any senator in this place, and it is unacceptable for the shadow Attorney-General. On that basis, he should be censured, and if he is censured in this place, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, should sack him. Mr Beazley can get away with being weak in the other place and saying the government has got the numbers. This is the chamber where the government does not 
 have the numbers, so let us see what the verdict of this chamber is. If it is that he should be censured, Mr Beazley should sack him.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-10,"—On that basis, other Howard government ministers who have been censured in this chamber also ought to offer their resignations, shouldn't they, Senator Herron?
Mr Acting Deputy President, let me commence my contribution by saying this is a time-wasting stunt from Senator Vanstone. It is a real confidence builder for Senator Vanstone, who has had such a shocking time for two years as a former cabinet minister who quite properly was removed—sacked—from the federal cabinet by Mr Howard. We on this side of the chamber disagree with a lot of decisions that Mr Howard made, but I have to say that sacking you, Senator Vanstone, was one that he got absolutely right. Let me say, in response to this confidence builder for Senator Vanstone, that we on this side of this chamber have absolute confidence in and respect for Senator Bolkus.
Let me go to the substance of the motion before the chamber. First of all, Senator Bolkus never denied that he held a press conference on 5 January this year in relation to the Skase matter. Nor has he denied that he referred to the affidavit at that press conference. Nor is it denied that, prior to its disclosure by a person or persons unknown, Senator Vanstone, the affidavit was subject to a confidentiality order. Now, of course, the government claims that, at the time of Senator Bolkus's press conference, the document retained its status as a confidential document. It is worth looking at that because, whilst it is true that neither the court, or Mr Donnelly of course, authorised the release of the document, there is no explanation as to how the document came to be in the hands of the media and, therefore, how it came to be in the public domain.
There can be no doubt that once a document is publicly released it ceases to effectively retain its status as a confidential document. Given that the document had already been released—by people unknown to us but 
 probably well known to Senator Vanstone—to a range of perhaps unknown journalists and was being used by them, Senator Bolkus was obviously entitled at a press conference to refer to the document. It is in that context that Senator Bolkus referred to the document.
Government senators interjecting—
—He did so because he wanted to highlight—and we believe it was his duty as the shadow Attorney-General to highlight—that the disclosure of the proceedings against Mr Skase, as revealed in News Ltd papers on 5 January 1998, through the public release of the affidavit by a source or sources unknown, had already compromised the pursuit of Mr Skase's assets.
In saying that Senator Bolkus referred to the affidavit during his press conference the government has been deliberately deceptive as to way in which that occurred. The government has, conveniently, chosen not to tell the parliament and the Australian people that it was referred to for only one purpose. Let me remind the Senate what that purpose was. As written by Mr Donnelly:
If this matter comes to the attention of the respondents, and in particular the attention of Mr Skase before the interlocutory orders can be obtained in all jurisdictions, I have serious concerns that steps will be taken to prejudice the substantive proceedings.
In other words, Senator Bolkus was quite properly referring to only that portion of the affidavit which demonstrated the damage caused by the leak of the information. Of course, it was an absolutely appropriate matter for Senator Bolkus to refer to during his press conference.
—It is on the record.
—It is on and off the record.
—You have tried to denigrate Senator Bolkus's motives. You have referred to those parts of the affidavit `off the record'. You have used those words—and we have all heard them—many, many times. Let me quote the words you have used:
I can't give this document out, but maybe if I just read it off the record. This is the proceedings in court.  

That is the quote that you have used time and time again. But, as Senator Bolkus has readily explained to the many who have asked, the journalist who provided him with a copy of the affidavit specifically asked him not to release the substantive contents of that affidavit because he or she wanted to retain an exclusive. That is a perfectly normal request from a journalist. It was not only appropriate for Senator Bolkus but it was Senator Bolkus's duty to keep such an undertaking to a journalist.
The issue of the boxing of two pages of the affidavit in the parliamentary press gallery on 5 January has been raised time and time again. I asked Senator Bolkus about this. You probably have not asked him. He assures me that he was in Adelaide. His staff, by the way, were in Adelaide or Western Australia at that time. It is worth making that point to the Senate. You have consistently smeared Senator Bolkus with the allegation that it was he who made known to the media parts of the affidavit that were not and would not have been put into the public domain but for his actions. That is the smear: that it was his disclosure of those details which obstructed the chase for Mr Skase's assets. Senator Bolkus has consistently denied that he provided any information to News Ltd prior to the story that appeared in the papers on 5 January. Just go and ask Mr David Luff, the author of those stories, as the government has and he will readily confirm that fact.
All week you have tried to smear Senator Bolkus by implying that he was subject to some form of criminal investigation in relation to this matter and that he was not assisting the authorities. What did the Attorney-General say in question time in the House of Representatives on Wednesday of last week? This is what he said:
In the circumstances there seems to be no doubt that Senator Bolkus would be able to assist the Federal Police with their inquiries.
It goes on:
What should happen is this: the Leader of the Opposition should instruct Senator Bolkus to stand down and cooperate with the Federal Police.
If the Attorney-General, for a change, had been doing his job he would have known that 
 Senator Bolkus had assisted the Federal Police with their inquiries on not one but on two occasions, the last being on 30 January this year. And he would have known that Senator Bolkus had fully cooperated with the Australian Federal Police. He would also have known that the Australian Federal Police were not investigating Senator Bolkus but that the inquiries of the Federal Police were continuing.
We have here an attempt to use the existence of an AFP investigation to smear Senator Bolkus's name when both Senator Vanstone and the Attorney-General knew that Senator Bolkus had been cleared. We on this side of the chamber say that that is very grubby, very low life politics from you and the coalition government.
—That is not true.
—The truth is that the real damage in this case occurred before Senator Bolkus conducted his press conference. The News Ltd piece was written independently and without provision of any assistance by Senator Bolkus or any member of his staff. The affidavit, of course, was already in very wide circulation amongst journalists who had no hesitation in using it.
The government has claimed that Mr Donnelly has said that the release of the information contained in the affidavit may have been more damaging than the original News Ltd story. That might be true but Senator Bolkus is not and was not responsible for distributing any damaging parts of that affidavit.
—That is not true.
—That is the truth of the matter. This all raises the question: where did the original leak in this case come from? In the case of the News Ltd stories, that particular article specifically mentions `government sources'. It specifically says that government sources provided at least some of the information.
I make this comment—and I say this categorically—the entire piece is written to the benefit of the Minister for Justice. That is the truth.
—That is rubbish and you know it!
—You have never denied, Senator Vanstone, on the public record that this information was provided by your office. We await such a denial that any of this information came from any member of Senator Vanstone's staff.
What is the only conclusion that you can draw? What we have is a classic case of trying to shoot the messenger. That is what we have in this particular censure motion. It was clearly inappropriate that the initial leak—which provided the story on 5 January 1998—or the leak in the affidavit in the public domain occurred. We know that, and that is what Senator Bolkus has been saying. At the time Senator Bolkus conducted his press conference all of that information, as you know and as everyone knows, was already in the public domain. We on this side of the chamber say that Senator Bolkus has a responsibility to point out how the government has failed, yet again, to properly pursue Skase in a proficient manner.
Rather than pursue the original source of these leaks, Senator Vanstone, Mr Williams and the government have engaged in this absurd but grubby political exercise designed to smear Senator Bolkus. We on this side of the chamber ask why you are doing that, Senator Vanstone. Why are you doing it? Because what you are about is revenge for the fact that Senator Bolkus was doing the job that Mr Williams should have been doing in reminding Justice Callinan of information which ultimately led to his withdrawal from the Hindmarsh Island case. It was revenge for Senator Bolkus's pursuit of Mr Williams over Mr Williams's initial failure to continue the chase for Mr Skase's assets. It was revenge from you, Senator Vanstone, for Senator Bolkus's revelations that you and the Australian Federal Police had been so inept in the 60 Minutes arrest of Mr Dolly Dunn in Honduras.
Senator Bolkus has been a very effective shadow Attorney-General and we understand the bitterness and disappointment that you must feel, Senator Vanstone, when you compare his success as a shadow minister to 
 your failure and sacking as a former cabinet minister in the Howard government. In the course of seeking to take out their revenge on Senator Bolkus, in our view Senator Vanstone and the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, have acted in an inappropriate and hypocritical manner by divulging information related to an ongoing police investigation in relation to the source of these leaks.
Senator Vanstone in the chamber regularly parades her mock indignation by insisting that it is inappropriate for her to comment on operational AFP matters—a principle that never seemed to worry her too much when she was in opposition.
—And as shadow Attorney-General.
—That is right, even as shadow Attorney-General and even when the relevant aspects of those operations had concluded. However, it seems that that rule applies only when it suits Senator Vanstone not to comment when she is trying to cover up yet another part of what could only be described as a cavalcade of ministerial incompetence from Senator Vanstone—which I was grateful for the opportunity to be able to outline in a motion on precedence recently.
Of course Senator Bolkus is innocent of the allegations that have been made against him. The Australian Federal Police have cleared Senator Bolkus of any wrongdoing. I believe that the guilty parties here are those opposite who have abused their positions of trust by falsely blaming Senator Bolkus on this matter, by seeking to cover up their own incompetence for allowing these leaks to occur in the first place, by deliberately misleading the parliament as to what Senator Bolkus did or did not discuss at his 5 January press conference, and by deliberately and maliciously misleading the Senate through their claims that Senator Bolkus was under AFP investigation and that he was not assisting with the AFP's inquiries.
This is a most tawdry exercise in blame shifting from Senator Vanstone, Mr Williams and the government. If she had a conscience no doubt she would be ashamed of what she has done in this regard. I have to say that, if anybody should be apologising to anybody, it 
 is you for the absolutely improper, despicable and contemptible way you have smeared Senator Bolkus's name. It is you, Senator Vanstone, and it is the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, who should apologise to the Australian public for your total incompetence in relation to the handling of the chase for Skase.
I have to say that you might, Senator Vanstone, answer questions such as why you did not ask the Australian Federal Police to investigate the leak to Mr Luff—because we asked that question. We wonder why you did not ask that, Senator Vanstone. We think we probably know the answer. We think it is probably very close to home over there in the executive wing of Parliament House. But we also ask, Senator Vanstone, why you and Mr Williams failed to disclose that Senator Bolkus had been cleared of wrongdoing in this matter by the Australian Federal Police.
We say that Senator Bolkus is innocent. We say on this matter that the government has no case. This is a time wasting stunt from the government. It is unworthy of the government; it is unworthy of the Senate. I can assure you that the opposition will be treating this motion with the absolute contempt it deserves.",SENATE,<title>SENATOR BOLKUS</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Miscellaneous,8,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-03-10,"—The evidence against Senator Bolkus is irrefutable. Let us not deal with all the hyperbole that we have heard from the opposition.
Senator Carr interjecting—
—Order! Senator Carr.
—Let us deal with the actual words of the motion. The first allegation against Senator Bolkus is that:
. . . during and after a press conference on 5 January 1998—
he—
revealed certain contents of a confidential Federal Court affidavit . . . 
That first point of the motion has been admitted to by Senator Bolkus. Indeed, from Senator Faulkner's own mouth today, we have heard that Senator Bolkus has admitted to undertaking that. So the first point of the motion has been accepted by Senator Bolkus 
 as being the fact: irrefutable. Let us move to the second point:
. . . that this affidavit formed part of legal proceedings undertaken by Mr Max Donnelly, trustee of the bankrupt estate of Mr Christopher Skase, to recover assets allegedly concealed by Mr Skase . . . 
Not a single person would dispute that assertion—fact No. 2: proven. With all these points—the five points—we do not have to prove it beyond reasonable doubt; we can prove it beyond any doubt whatsoever. The first point is acknowledged—Senator Bolkus has fessed up. The second one everybody agrees.The third point states:
. . . that Federal Court affidavits may only be obtained by leave of the court or a judge . . . 
That also is a fact. It is in the Federal Court Rules. There is no dispute about that.
—So why did you leak it?
—`Why did Senator Bolkus leak it?' is the question on every Australian's mind. Then there is the fourth point of the motion:
. . . that in relation to the affidavit revealed by Senator Bolkus no such leave had been obtained . . . 
What is the evidence for that? It is that the Federal Court District Registrar, John Matheson, on 5 March 1998, wrote to us telling us exactly that. Are you going to say that the district registrar lied to somehow do something to Senator Bolkus? No. That fact is admitted and on the record in this place.
Then there is the fifth fact that we assert against Senator Bolkus:
. . . that Mr Donnelly had not authorised the release of the affidavit by either his firm or solicitors acting for him . . .
Similarly, we have a letter from Ferrier Hodgson saying exactly that.
So it is very, very disingenuous for Senator Faulkner to come into this place and assert that Senator Bolkus is innocent and that all the allegations against him have not been proven. The fact is that each of those five points on which we base our censure of Senator Bolkus has been proven, either out of Senator Bolkus's mind—mouth—
—You are a mind-reader now.
—If we want to know what was in Senator Bolkus's mind, when I read the transcript of the 7.30 Report , I have to say to you that I—having dealt in the area of criminal law—had never read such an amazing confession by a person who is fessing up. Senator Faulkner asserts to us that nothing new was placed on the public record by Senator Bolkus. But what does Senator Bolkus tell us in the 7.30 Report ? `If you look at what I announced on that day and compare it with the article, there is very little different information,' and then there is a gap. `Very little extra'—he admits to divulging extra information.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I would like to make a brief contribution to the debate on this important report. I draw the attention of senators particularly to pages 16 and 17 of the report and recommendation 10, which deals with the issue of associated entities. This is a matter that I have been canvassing for some time because of the deliberate exploitation by the Liberal party of a loophole in the Commonwealth Electoral Act by using the Greenfields Foundation to provide a massive loan to the Liberal Party. The Australian Electoral Commission at paragraph 4.18 of its report says:
Some organisations have questioned whether they fall within the definition of associated entity and have supplied legal advice supporting their view.
The issue here is whether the Greenfields Foundation is an associated entity. If it is, it means that it would be required to disclose where it received donations from. The same paragraph goes on to say:
These opinions, along with advice obtained by the AEC, demonstrate that there are some areas of dispute in the wording of the Act's definition which should not be allowed to become sources of confusion or loopholes.
That is a very valuable contribution in this report. Paragraph 4.19 says:
In some cases, though, the AEC is unable to determine whether an organisation should disclose as an associated entity because of the unavailability of the necessary documentation to make such a decision . . .
there is nothing to prevent them from simply claiming that they do not meet the definition of an associated entity and refusing to supply any justification for their stance. Such a situation could give the appearance of disclosure only by consent and has the potential to undermine public confidence in the disclosure system.
It is hard to argue with that. Paragraph 4.20 says:
In the public interest, disclosure should not be able to be avoided through a simple refusal to cooperate.
Then, on that page, a recommendation encapsulates those views. I agree with the Australian Electoral Commission on this particular matter. Despite the commitments of the Prime Minister to honesty, transparency and accountability in government, he and his government continue to sanction his party's blatant exploitation of what is an apparent loophole in the Electoral Act.
We have exposed already the links between the Liberal Party's former laundering vehicle—the Free Enterprise Foundation—and its new benefactor, the Greenfields Foundation. Those links are inextricable. It is incredible that a political party can receive a loan from an organisation which shares trustees, postal addresses, telephone contacts and who knows what else—as well as a purpose to launder funds from undisclosed donors—with an associated entity of the Liberal Party and somehow get away with it without disclosing where that money originally came from.
If the loan is above board, as Senator Minchin is feebly trying to argue, then why don't the Liberal Party come clean? Why don't they provide the details of this loan and prove that it is on a commercial basis? Why 
 are they afraid of revealing more information about the Greenfields Foundation?
Why is the Greenfields Foundation so secretive? The AEC wrote to Greenfields and asked them to provide information to ascertain their status as an associated entity. Of course, the response of Greenfields and the Liberals was blunt: they did not think they were required to provide any further information. We think they ought to be required to provide further information. We think the Australian public are entitled to that information. We want to know where the Liberal Party is getting its money from and how much—whether it comes from overseas or from Australian donors. The Australian public are entitled to know. I commend this report to the Senate. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Electoral Commission</title>,Documents,9,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-10,"—Those who have been coming to this chamber for some time would realise that when the first disclosure laws were put to this parliament the Liberal Party strenuously opposed them. They opposed them when arguing their case on the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform and, when the legislation came in, they opposed the disclosure of political donations. Ever since then, they have objected to tightening in this particular area.
We now have the circumstance where the good old boys up at Robert Menzies House have found a new lurk, a new way of avoiding disclosure. That is, a foundation gives them a loan for $4.6 million and they do not have to disclose where that loan came from, other than that it came from the Greenfields Foundation.
It is interesting that two of the trustees of the Greenfields Foundation are also trustees of the Free Enterprise Foundation, which is the long-term funder of the Liberal Party. When the Free Enterprise Foundation was set up, the Liberal Party did not have to disclose their donors. It was only when later legislation was introduced in the nineties that you could go beyond the Free Enterprise Foundation and find out who donated to it because the foundation was an associated entity.
So the Liberal Party—noting that there is $100,000 going out to Greenfields in the Liberal Party accounts—has set up the 
 Greenfields Foundation with two out of the three same trustees of the Free Enterprise Foundation. Lo and behold! A $4.6 million loan is given to the Liberal Party. We do not know whether it is charged at a commercial interest rate and we do not know whether at some stage the loan is going to be forgiven. But we do know that the Electoral Commission at estimates committees the other night used the excuse that they have too much else to do at this stage to go back and specifically audit the Liberal Party to check these particular details.
As Senator Faulkner said, two of the three trustees are the same people; the postal address of the trustees of the Free Enterprise Foundation is the same post office box for the Greenfields Foundation; and they have the same accountants and the same telephone numbers. So it begs the question as to whether the Liberal Party have induced people to donate to the Greenfields Foundation, which in turn has made a loan to the Liberal Party, thereby avoiding disclosure of those particular donations. If they have done so, what do they have to hide?
Where did the donations come from? Did they come from overseas? Did they come from people who are not willing to show their links with a government because of any government favours those particular donors are given by way of their patronage of the Liberal Party? These are the questions that need to be answered, and they can be answered fairly quickly. As well as the Electoral Commission doing regular audits of the political parties, which they should do, they have the power to do spot audits if they so desire.
I was very surprised to see Minister Minchin on Meet the Press on Channel 10 on Sunday when he said that the Electoral Commission made clear in their evidence that they saw nothing improper about this loan. Actually, they did not quite say that. They just said that they were not in a position to judge and that the actual legislation does not yet give them the right, until they examine the Liberal Party accounts, to declare the Greenfields Foundation an associated entity, in which case all donations to that particular 
 body would have to be revealed. But this is just another sneaky method by one of the leading political parties in this country to avoid the law, to actually flout the law in these particular circumstances.
So we do not know where Greenfields got its money. When put under a bit of pressure, the trustees came out and said, `We're actually a charitable foundation.' I did not know the Liberal Party qualified as a charity. But I thought the best comment of all was from Sir John Atwill—a trustee of Greenfields—in the Financial Review. When he was asked about it he said that he had never heard of Greenfields, that he did not know what it was about and did not even know he was a trustee. This is a former federal president of the Liberal Party.
It is an absolute device to avoid disclosure. But I have to say this: if in the end Greenfields is not going to be pursued in terms of its donors, and if it is not a commercial rate of loan, we will be arguing that Greenfields made an anonymous donation and under the Electoral Act the Liberal Party will have to forfeit that anonymous donation and the taxpayers will benefit to the value of $4.6 million.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Electoral Commission</title>,Documents,9,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-03-10,"—I wish to comment tonight on the government's work for the dole program. As honourable senators would know, the program has recently got off the ground. Perhaps, predictably, if sadly, the initiative has been subjected to both unwarranted and ill-informed attack by Labor and others that has gone on since Christmas. The regrettable feature of this sort of attack is that it really fails to grasp the enormity of the problem of youth unemployment. It fails to recognise the value of an initiative that will have a number of good outcomes, including providing a pathway to job readiness.
The criticisms suggest that Labor has simply forgotten that during 13 years in the job they failed to provide employment for almost one million Australians. In December 1992, at the height of the recession we had to have, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to an historical high of 11.2 per cent. In trend terms, long-term unemployment reached an historical and unacceptable peak of 349,000 in July 1993.
Labor's record on youth unemployment was such that the number of young people with full-time jobs halved during its time in office. Full-time youth unemployment fell by approximately 240,000 from 465,000 in June 1989 to 227,600 in March 1994. Despite all this, the Labor Party took the opportunity during the summer recess to launch a scathing criticism of the government's work for the dole project. Such selective memories, I say.
Whilst it can be a dubious tactic to counter statistics with yet other statistics, it is imperative that some sense be made of the participation rates in the work for the dole scheme so that the doomsayers do not gain any credence in these sorts of attacks. Earlier this year it is true that the government was called upon to defend the scheme which at the time involved 869 volunteers and 574 conscripted participants in 62 pilot projects across the nation. Before enthusiasts go rushing for their calcu 
 lators, the ratio of voluntary versus conscripted participants was 60 to 40. Surely even Labor would contend that only six weeks after the scheme was officially launched, participation in terms of size and composition could be considered an adequate or reliable indication or measure of the scheme's relative success or failure.
Still in its embryonic and formative stages, only one-third of the pilot projects had commenced—62 out of 178—involving 1,443 participants out of a total of 10,400 participants. Yet despite attacks on the scheme, the evidence is now coming through that it is actually working. One project—the historic Walka Waterworks near Newcastle—has already seen four young people find full-time employment, which is very good news indeed. This project only began in mid-January, so we have the situation of four young people already finding  jobs only weeks into the project simply because they put their hands up and said they wanted to be in it.
The enthusiasm on this project shows how wrong Labor is. The project coordinator has reported that the young people are so keen that they are turning up to work on days they are not rostered to be there. Such motivation and keenness shows employers that these young people, despite often having been unemployed for long periods, are willing to work, want to work and certainly will work hard. One young man on the project—Paul Chamberlain—said that working on the project had boosted his confidence. He said, `You feel better about yourself. You're motivated to get up and go to work. You have something to do.' And all this from a scheme that the doomsayers say cannot work.
It is important when looking at the scheme to examine participation rates in their true light. The participation rate of each project does not actually reflect the fact that many are staggering their intake over 12 months. For example, a much quoted project in Bankstown has 47 participants out of a total of 96 places. I am using these examples from New South Wales, which of course is my home state. This figure can be interpreted in two ways. First, it could indicate that only half of the projects' positions have been filled, which in 
 turn could lead to the assumption that there is little interest in the project, and used to sustain the myth that the work for the dole scheme is flawed. Or, second, and accurately as it turns out in this case, the project will offer a total of 96 positions throughout the year consisting of two, six-monthly intakes of 48 participants. Contrary to the gloom and doom interpretation, the project is operating at full capacity.
Past projects have shown that many participants are keen to contribute more than the hours required. Lisa Clausen, a journalist for the South Pacific, recalls how when funding from a project to build a skatebowl and basketball court in Sanctuary Point south of Sydney ran out, the 10 unemployed volunteers returned to the work site to finish the job in their own time. Eight of the 10 had found jobs within two months of completing the project.
The pilot programs are under way now and at present there are, as I said, 10,400 participants involved. When the scheme gets under way in full force, 25,000 places will be available, which the government has calculated as being sufficient to provide unemployed youth with work experience. It must be said that, on balance, not all projects will be successful—I think we have to say that—and projects will vary in their capacity to deliver outcomes.
Participation rates will depend upon a range of factors, including the nature of the project, the type of work involved, key personalities and project administration. Teething problems in a preliminary stage, however, cannot and do not reflect the scheme's outcomes. Some of the more intangible outcomes of the scheme, such as increased confidence and self-esteem, self-worth, networking opportunities and skills development, are not going to happen overnight. Indeed, a Labor funded community research project in 1995-96 concluded that 12 months was simply insufficient time for many projects to clearly define their roles, identify and engage target groups, and develop to full capacity.
In those circumstances, the opposition's call for an independent review of the scheme is wildly premature, and ACOSS's description 
 of it as fundamentally flawed is defeatist. They complain that the scheme does not offer structured training. The answer to this critique is blindingly obvious. If a person has been unemployed since leaving school, he or she will not have any work experience and have few employment skills other than those they got at school. The scheme is designed to address that. It gives participants skills and experience that can be translated into their search for full-time employment. It does not offer structured training; nor does it pretend to. On the contrary, the scheme aims to have young unemployed people made ready for full-time employment as soon as possible. It is not providing a safety cocoon that discourages full-time employment. It is simply a starting block in the race for jobs.
If the labour market training programs of the former Labor government were so successful, one might ask rhetorically: how is it they produced record levels of youth unemployment? When the government took office in 1996 it was confronted with a situation that simply could not be allowed to continue and was created by years of neglect that saw the teenage full-time unemployment trend rate at 29 per cent. In some regional areas youth unemployment was as high as 30 per cent.
The government decided, rightly in my view, that this was an unacceptable situation for both the unemployed and the nation. But, unlike those who have for so long not provided any solutions, we did not push the issue into the too-hard basket and, having acted decisively, we are now reaping some benefits. The government's intention is to pilot new methods of solving youth unemployment. There is a glaring need to find new and innovative ways to break benefit dependency and to get our young people into employment.
The government has now committed $340 million over four years for its work for the dole, or mutual obligation, strategy. The background to the scheme is simply based on the premise that unemployed job seekers financially supported by the community should actively seek work. Some of the early results show that not only are they seeking to participate but they are getting jobs from that work experience.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Work for the Dole</title>,Adjournment,10,1,speech
