"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent:
(1)	the Leader of the Opposition from presenting forthwith a Bill to require government advertising to meet minimum standards with respect to objectivity, fairness and accountability, and to prohibit the expenditure of taxpayers' money on advertising which promotes party political interests, the Government (Advertising Objectivity, Fairness and Accountability) Bill; and
(2)	the Bill being debated and passed through all stages without delay.
This government is trying to pay for its re-election with taxpayers' money. This government is using and abusing the taxpayer to confuse the taxpayer into believing that they ought to vote for them again—

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—The Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001, which we are debating here today, is an admission of policy failure by this minister and by the Howard government. If this legislation passes the parliament, over $1.9 billion will have been committed by the milk consumers of this nation to support dairy farmers in the aftermath of the deregulation of their industry. Yet the Howard government has not committed one red cent to support the dairy farmers of Australia through one of the most important periods in the history of their industry. Indeed, when the dust settles on the total package of assistance to the dairy industry, one indisputable fact stands for every dairy farming family to see: one of the big winners from deregulation of the dairy industry has been the Howard government, because it has been able to claw back hundreds of millions of dollars in tax from dairy farmer package payouts. 
It is of little comfort to dairy farmers, as they endure the financial and personal pain of deregulation, to observe the Howard government, which has put nothing into their industry, indulging itself in an orgy of advertising promotion to save the political skin of the minister and his colleagues in the Howard government. That advertising dollar meter is ticking over at $660,000-odd dollars a day, or $20 million a month, as the Howard government feverishly attempts to save its political skin. 
As dairy farmers battle with low prices, reduced farm values, unsympathetic banks and the personal heartaches that have followed deregulation, this government is lining the pockets of advertising industry executives in Sydney and Melbourne without putting one cent—not one red cent—of federal money into one of Australia's most important industries. Some $1.9 billion later—and after one of the largest packages of industry assistance in Australia's history, financed not through general revenue but through a milk tax on consumers—this government has yet to articulate a coherent plan for the long-term future of the dairy industry. This hapless and discredited government passed up a unique opportunity in the history of this great rural industry to set out a coherent plan for its future. It took the lazy option, and now dairy farming families in New South Wales and Queensland are paying a heavy price indeed for its incompetence. 
This legislation authorises the raising of an extra $140 million in a supplementary package of assistance, with $100 million allocated to dairy farmers whose production of market milk is over 35 per cent of their production, $20 million to iron out anomalies and $20 million in extra DRAP funding. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst supportive of Australia's dairy industry and whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for: 
(1)	failing to deliver a long term plan to secure the future of the dairy industry;
(2)	failing to prepare the industry to meet the substantial environmental challenges it faces in many communities in moving to a more sustainable production base;
(3)	failing to adequately plan to provide for rationalisation within the dairy processing sector;
(4)	failing to address the long term skilling needs of the industry;
(5)	failing to stimulate further research and development in the dairy industry;
(6)	failing to plan and promote further market access for dairy products;
(7)	using Dairy Regional Assistance Program funds to pork-barrel for its own political survival; and
(8)	failing to ensure that its latest assistance package is fair and equitable.
Each element of the supplementary package is an admission by this minister and the government that it has failed the dairy industry. The $100 million of extra assistance is squarely aimed at dairy farmers in New South Wales and Queensland, whose livelihoods have been decimated in the aftermath of deregulation. Yet, even before the ink was dry on the minister's announcement, many dairy farmers were ringing my office complaining about the inequities in the criteria used to allocate the funds. Many dairy farmers in New South Wales and Queensland heeded the advice they received years prior to deregulation—that it would actually happen. They borrowed heavily to expand their farm acreages and update their milking plants. They undertook pasture improvements and increased their herd size to reduce their dependence on quota market milk. Some of these farmers are now excluded from receiving additional assistance available under this supplementary package. No wonder they are angry. 
I received representations from industry representatives last week which mooted a lowering of the 35 per cent threshold to 25 per cent with minimal net cost to the package. The advice that I have received within the industry is that it is possible to bring a significant number of deserving dairy farmers in New South Wales and Queensland into the ambit of the supplementary package at little or no extra cost to consumers. I mention consumers, as it is they, not the Howard government, who are funding this $1.9 billion package. The minister has at his disposal the resources to evaluate this proposal and I would urge him to give it serious consideration. I am attracted to it because it would most certainly introduce greater equity into those supplementary arrangements and reduce the deep divisions in the ranks of dairy farmers in many of these communities. The minister ought to swallow his pride and do the right thing in the interests of greater equity. His Prime Minister is well practised in that ancient political art of the backflip, so he need not be bashful himself if he does one. We on this side promise that we will not even look while he does the backflip.
With regard to the allocation to anomalies, this is simply an overt admission that the original legislation was grossly defective in not enabling the rather unique position of many dairy farmers to be accommodated in the original package. For example, I mention the group of Tasmanian milk producers—and this will be taken up by the member for Braddon, I am sure, in this debate—who supplied 100 per cent of their product into market milk but, because of the pooling arrangements in Tasmania, were deemed to have supplied only eight to 10 per cent to that market.
The third element of this package—the $20 million of extra funds for DRAP—is, once again, an admission by the government that it grossly underestimated the original impacts of deregulation on regional communities. For the benefit of dairy farmers, it would be instructive for me to outline the history of DRAP funding, for it tells us much about the incompetence of the government, the lack of policy planning, and the panic that motivates the actions of this government. There was no regional development package in the original one. It was only continual agitation by the opposition and dairy communities, such as those in the Bega Valley, that forced the government to allocate $45 million to this purpose. We had to put the political bull ring in the minister's nose and drag him around the political stage to respond to community concerns in this regard. An hour before the original bill and the package were passed by this House, the minister, in a flat panic, amended his own legislation to allocate $45 million to regional development in dairy communities affected by deregulation.
Of course we on this side of the House were pleased that the government had finally caved in on this point, but we were absolutely horrified when the minister started making allocations from the fund—and those allocations included over $200,000 to a polocrosse field and $50,000 to a wine appreciation course—even before dairy farmers had received any money from the original package. Due to our political pressure, the government had to focus that expenditure more, but we are nevertheless concerned about what this minister will do with an extra $20 million in the pork barrel. We know that about half of the Queensland DRAP allocations have gone to the minister's own electorate. We do not deny there are communities in hardship there—we do not deny there are dairy farmers who have gone through extreme hardship—but we will be watching with a close eye the allocations that are made under the extra money in this program. 
There are several points to be made about this supplementary package of $140 million. I believe it is reasonable for dairy farmers to ask why it has taken the government so long to respond to the crisis facing many dairy farmers in Queensland and New South Wales. It was clear to dairy farmers within a few months of 1 July 2000 that deregulation had caused a catastrophic drop in their incomes. The ABARE report in January 2001 found that there was an estimated decline in farm gate prices in New South Wales alone of 29 per cent, in Queensland of 24 per cent and in Western Australia of 30 per cent, leading to declines in income of 54 per cent in New South Wales, 40 per cent in Queensland and 56 per cent in Western Australia. That report only reflected what farmers in those regions already knew—that deregulation had devastated their incomes, devalued their farms and made it difficult for them to obtain credit from financial institutions.
Kim Beazley's dairy task force, which I chaired, visited affected regions and we publicised, where we were able, the cases of extreme hardship in order to get this minister to act. It is now a matter of public record that this minister from Queensland only became interested in the plight of dairy farmers after the Queensland state election results when his National Party was virtually wiped out at the polls. It took the government until last week to produce a draft set of guidelines for this legislation for the allocation of the extra $20 million for anomalies. The Shane Stone memo described this government as mean, tricky, out of touch and dysfunctional. We all know that to be true. Dairy farmers now know it to be true. But we need to add contemptuous, arrogant and incompetent, as evidenced by their failure to provide this parliament with the full details of how their extra funds are going to be allocated.
I note the comments of the minister yesterday in this House about Labor policy relating to agriculture, and his failure to mention Labor's announcements on salinity, the single desk for rice and wheat, and national competition policy. We know this minister is tricky, like the Prime Minister. Up there in Wide Bay they call him `tricky Truss'. He has indulged in heavy bouts of trickery before. For example, he has claimed this compensation package as his own, even though it is financed by consumers and there is no federal money in it at all. He has criticised state Labor governments which have put money into their dairy industries, when he has put none in himself, and he has attempted to hide Costello's tax take of hundreds of millions of dollars from this package. 
The minister mentioned the report of Kim Beazley's dairy task force, due in April. I can assure the minister that that report has been completed, but we had no intention of releasing that report before the minister made his announcement in May on the supplementary package and brought his legislation into this House. We on this side of the House know the government's capacity to poach policy. They are good at looting the public purse for their cheap advertising campaigns and poaching Labor policy in a whole range of areas—from BAS to petrol to salinity to the knowledge nation agenda. 
I would like to take some time in this debate to outline some of the concerns of dairy farmers about their industry in the wake of deregulation. These views came to us in the meetings that we held in every dairying region across Australia. Dairy farmers told us of the great uncertainty in their lives as a result of the government's poor handling of and incompetence in this area of deregulation. They expressed concerns about the ageing of their industry and the exodus of young families from the industry in the wake of deregulation and their concern about its long-term future. They expressed frustration at the cooperatives, which they felt had betrayed them in the marketplace; at supermarkets, whose margins on their product had widened; at the national competition policy, which they felt had caused their situation; and at the ACCC, which prevents them from collectively bargaining on the price they receive for their produce.  
They told us of the horrendous personal impacts on their family life and their communities. They told us of massively reduced farm gate prices and incomes, of problems and stress in dealing with the banks, of significant slumps in local land prices and of a virtual drying-up of the market for dairy farmers, of difficult dealings with local councils and of huge hikes in input costs, in the costs of grain feeds, fertilisers and petrol in particular. They told us of the exodus of many young share farmers from the industry, the difficulty of recruiting farm labour, the problems that were encountered between lessors and lessees and the lack of investment in non-farm infrastructure that threatens the long-term productivity of their farms and their industry production. 
But above all, they expressed their anger at an incompetent government that promised them payments from the package in October 2000 which they had not received by February and March 2001. They expressed their anger at a government that steadfastly refused to do anything about the anomalies that its policy had created until it was forced by the opposition and the industry to address those needs. They expressed their anger at a government that in its deceit claimed a package of assistance as its own, a government that burdened farm businesses with the GST and, above all, a government that had failed to plan for this momentous change to their industry. 
That lack of planning and vision for the industry goes back many, many years with this government. It goes back to the previous National Party minister and the hands-off approach to rural industry, a policy which was endorsed and continued by this minister. Indeed, the government made great play of the fact that in the wheat and wool industries its policy was to extract the government from the industries. When the government was encouraged to take a hands-on approach to the dairy industry in the face of the two momentous changes that were confronting it on 1 July, namely the introduction of the GST and the deregulation of the industry, this government did nothing. It articulated no vision for the industry. It did not seek to develop any coherent plan for its long-term future. It left the response to deregulation up to the industry. It was the industry's responsibility, apparently, to get agreement between all the state farming organisations and all state governments on this issue and then bring the package on a plate to a lazy and incompetent government to endorse and then claim as its own. 
Those are the facts of the matter, and the dairy farmers in northern New South Wales in the electorates of Richmond and Page and in Queensland know that was the case as far as their industry is concerned. They know that no vision was articulated. They know that no plan was developed. They know that there is not one cent of Howard government money in this package, in the original package or the supplementary package. They know that this minister has attempted to blame everybody else for the situation that this lazy and incompetent government created. The plan for this industry could have included a clear statement of where the government intended to take this industry over the next 10 years—a very important signal to the financial sector about how the federal government of this nation regarded this most important rural industry. Yet this government, in its slothful policy laziness, refused to put one cent into this industry and sent a signal to financial institutions that it was prepared to cut it adrift in the face of the most momentous changes in its history.
The government articulated no plan that included addressing the important skilling needs of farmers in the bottom 30 per cent of the income chain or the farm labourers that are in short supply in the dairy industry, nor the skilling of process workers to lift productivity in the value adding chain. It articulated no vision to engineer the expansion of the research and development program that would bring extra cents per litre at the farm gate to hard-pressed dairy farmers. It articulated no vision that took into account the momentous changes that would occur in the processing sector as a result of the decisions that it had forced on the industry. It did not articulate any coherent plan for the regional development of communities that were hard-affected by this action and it articulated no plan for the environmental future of the industry in the face of the enormous pressures that have come upon it in many communities. 
This is an important supplementary package for the industry. But let it be known that it was forced upon this government in the wake of the Queensland state election result that absolutely decimated the National Party. Let it be known at this point in time, in the debates in this great House on this great industry, that this minister and this government have yet to articulate a plan for the future of one of Australia's great rural industries.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—The clear difference between the Labor Party and the coalition in this, as in so many other things, is that the Labor Party is full of hot air and rhetoric while the coalition actually acts. The Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 is an example of that. It provides for additional assistance to be made available to Australian dairy farmers and dairy communities, as announced by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, on 20 May this year.
This extra $140 million comes on top of the federal government's largest ever assistance package for rural Australia, that being the $1.78 billion Commonwealth dairy industry adjustment package that was announced last year to compensate for the removal of market milk pricing regulations by the Australian states last June. The original $1.78 billion package provides quarterly Dairy Structural Adjustment Program payments for eight years. It also provides a lump sum payment of up to $45,000 tax free to those dairy farmers wishing to leave agriculture and provides $45 million over three years under the Dairy Regional Assistance Program to assist dairy dependent communities affected by deregulation—the original package that I referred to.
The implementation of this package is well advanced. Virtually all people with an interest in a dairy farm on 28 September 1999 have applied to the Dairy Adjustment Authority for payments under DSAP, 99 per cent have been notified of their entitlements and 95 per cent are now receiving payments. The remaining applicants are essentially only those whose entitlement is under appeal or who are involved in legal action of one kind or another. Farmers in the Bega Valley and Eurobodalla in Eden-Monaro have used their payments for a variety of purposes, including to improve farm productivity and profitability in the new market environment. Some have reduced their farm debt, while others have invested in new farm capacity and other means of improving farm productivity. Some have chosen to leave the industry and are using their payments to re-establish.
Bega Valley dairy farmers have also benefited from the Dairy RAP, most notably through the $660,645 provided to the Bega Cheese Co-op to purchase, install and commission a new shredded cheese processing line. The South East Area Consultative Committee endorsed the project as a beneficial employment generating project for the local community, with the federal assistance helping Bega Cheese to maintain direct responsibility for the production of shredded cheese products. With the sales of shredded cheese currently very popular in export markets, and with significant growth of the market expected in the next few years, this means jobs in the Bega Valley. In fact, it was estimated that the shredded cheese line would generate 11 immediate full-time positions with a further 12 full-time positions after 12 months. Also, with the line being installed by local contractors, further employment opportunities were available to local businesses.
There is also a possibility of further help for the Bega Valley under Dairy RAP as the Bega Cheese Co-op is to undergo a massive expansion due to a restructuring of the business alliance between Bega Cheese, Bonlac Foods Ltd and the New Zealand Dairy Board. The restructuring, which received unanimous support from the Bega Cheese shareholders, will see a major injection of business from Bonlac and the New Zealand Dairy Board into Bega's cutting, packing and processing plant, as well as an injection of $35 million cash. Of that money, approximately $16 million will be invested in new plant and equipment and there will also be a special cash and share distribution to members, to the dairy farmers, of approximately $16 million. 
The deal includes the national licensing of the Bega Cheese brand to a consumer company to be jointly owned by Bonlac and NZDB. NZDB will buy a 25 per cent share in Bonlac and bring together businesses in Australia worth more than $1 billion. Overall it gives Bega shareholders certainty and greater security for the future, with a real deal worth millions to Bega Cheese through royalties from national sales, the $35 million cash injection and greatly expanded output at the company's plant. Bonlac will close its Melbourne based cheese cutting and processing plant and transfer that production to Bega, thereby nearly trebling Bega's production. It will take 12 to 18 months to build up the production level. However, the new alliance will also mean around 200 new jobs, not just for Bega but for the whole Bega Valley Shire. This is the kind of project that fits perfectly within the intentions of Dairy RAP, those being to generate employment and encourage growth through support for new business investment and establishment of community infrastructure, and so I am working closely with the co-op and the minister for further funding to help with the expansion.
Overall, things have been looking pretty good for Bega Cheese lately. Only late last year the Minister for Trade announced that the export volume of Australian cheese had almost doubled over the last five years, with 222,000 tonnes exported in the last financial year. Figures compiled by the Australian Dairy Corporation revealed that our cheese exports in 1994-95 stood at just over 111,000 tonnes and since then they have also expanded in value from $355 million in 1994-95 to $752 million in 1999-2000. With Bega Cheese exporting around 60 per cent of production and leading the way in exporting to many new countries, they are now in a position to continue that lead at a higher level.
Despite the successful take-up of the $1.78 billion Commonwealth dairy industry adjustment package, the federal government is aware that many producers are still experiencing very difficult circumstances as farm gate price reductions following deregulation have been greater than many farmers expected. The Bega Valley dairy farmers could have been helped even further, but it is most disappointing that the New South Wales state Labor government failed to provide any compensation following dairy deregulation. And it is disappointing to note that the only state government to provide any compensation has been the former Liberal government in Western Australia. I actually find it amazing that the New South Wales state government made worthless the state based quota system that many farmers had depended on, and provided absolutely no compensation. While Bob Carr and his New South Wales Labor government have a clear responsibility to provide compensation for the lost value of quotas, it is becoming increasingly obvious that dairy farmers are just not on their agenda.
Because of our concern, the federal government in November 2000 asked the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to investigate the impacts of deregulation to get to the facts of the adjustment situation facing dairy farmers and their communities. The ABARE report, released in January, confirmed that market milk price declines had been greater than the industry anticipated, particularly in the former quota states of New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. The report clearly indicated the magnitude of the challenge facing the dairy industry, particularly those operating in the former quota states where the proportion of market milk to manufacturing milk in the total production of the dairy enterprise was significantly greater. 
So, as the state governments do not really seem to believe that they should take any responsibility for their actions, the federal government has again stepped in to provide practical assistance. The additional package includes $100 million in supplementary market milk payments to dairy farmers who were most heavily dependent on market milk production; $20 million for eligible farmers who, because of extraordinary circumstances, were excluded, or their entitlements were significantly lower than normal under the government's DSAP; and a $20 million expansion of Dairy RAP. This additional assistance was praised by the executive committee of the New South Wales Dairy Farmers Association and by local dairy farmers.
In contrast to the federal government's massive assistance package, let us ponder on the actions of the Australian Labor Party which have actually involved a lot of pondering and very little doing, if any at all. Labor's dairy statement, released in February this year, provided no substance or practical assistance. There was no policy at all. If Beazley were serious about helping Australian dairy farmers, he would have approached his Labor colleagues in Queensland and New South Wales and insisted that they compensate farmers for the loss of value of their milk quotas. Let me make it clear: the states introduced milk quotas, the states administered the milk quotas and the states abolished the milk quotas. Farmers who had previously bought state milk quotas in order to sell milk now have a worthless asset, and the Labor states, instead of giving them any compensation, simply turned their backs on them.
Labor wants to take $20 million out of Dairy RAP to finance so-called training programs, but the government is already providing assistance for training and reskilling. It is done under FarmBis, and so far around 6,000 dairy farmers have been helped under this program. Due to the success of FarmBis, in last year's budget the government committed a further $167.5 million to continue it for another four years. The question that begs to be answered is: is Labor going to abolish FarmBis, or is it going to deny dairy farmers access to it? Labor's plan for Dairy RAP has no logic and farmers would actually be worse off as they would have fewer funds for new job creating prospects, such as the additional assistance that I am working on for the Bega Cheese expansion—as I said before, an expansion that looks like creating over 200 jobs.
Labor's other plan is to give extra resources to the Dairy Adjustment Authority—an exercise which would be wasteful and bureaucratic. The DAA was given extra resources last year and will begin downsizing when its task nears completion. And, finally, Labor's proposed changes to the dairy structural adjustment payments were rejected by the industry itself when the scheme was designed. The aforementioned ideas are the only ones that Labor have come up with through all their talkfests. All they plan to do is set up committees and fiddle at the edges of the existing program.
It is also pretty obvious that those in the know—the dairy farmers themselves—have very little faith in Labor. At a typical Labor talkfest in the Bega Valley in late April this year, a grand total of nine people showed up—that is, in the Bega Valley nine people showed up for this great talkfest to solve all the problems. If that is any indication of what happened elsewhere, what we heard from the member for Corio earlier was nonsense and had absolutely no substance, because it means that they have listened to probably about 0.5 per cent of dairy farmers, if lucky, and have assumed that that refers to 100 per cent. From a dairying community of the size and stature of the Bega Valley, with around 150 dairy farms and with big names like Bega, Tilba, Bodalla and Kameruka, and including also the Eurobodalla, Labor could only pull an audience of nine. The most hypocritical thing about their Bega Valley talkfest was the timing. Dairy deregulation occurred in June 2000, and there were eight years of talking about deregulation before it actually happened, and yet it took until the end of April 2001 for Labor to show any concern. During the deregulation debate, it was very easy for the Labor candidate to fire press releases out of his Canberra base, but to tackle the situation face to face required far too much work. 
In light of requests from the industry and after the ABARE report revelations, the federal government has moved promptly to address the concerns of vulnerable dairy farmers and their communities by providing this additional $140 million of assistance. Payments under the Supplementary Dairy Assistance Scheme will be largely based on DSAP entitlements and information already largely available to the DAA. Notification of the additional market milk entitlements will be made shortly after passage of this bill, and payments can be made promptly on completion of acceptance processes. It is therefore vital that the Labor Party does not delay the passage of this bill. Its support of the passage of this legislation is necessary to ensure that payments can be made to those most vulnerable dairy farmers and dairy dependent communities as soon as possible. I urge all members to support this bill.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—It is interesting to come in here and listen to absolute hypocrisy from the government benches. The government loves to come in here, as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry did yesterday in response to a dorothy dixer, and tell the House and Australia how well rural industries are doing. But he did not mention the `D' word—he did not mention the dairy industry. If we want to note the effect of dairy deregulation on the dairy industry, we only have to look at the ABARE prediction that was put out yesterday. The headline said `Milk prices should increase'. That is a very positive headline, but when I read into it I could not help but notice that it also warned:
... industry deregulation has cut sharply into the number of farmers producing milk, with total milk production rising marginally after years of strong increases.
It goes on to say:
Dairy exports are tipped to fall almost one per cent to $3.2 billion, after climbing $1 billion between 1998-1999 and the current financial year.
Skim milk powder production is expected to fall ...
It also says:
Total market milk production, which was hit hardest by dairy industry deregulation last July, has actually fallen in the past 11 months.
That is the effect of dairy deregulation on an industry that has been the mainstay of the economy of many areas on the North Coast of New South Wales. Dungog and Gloucester are towns in the electorate I represent. Dungog is the most adversely affected community in the whole of Australia and Gloucester the third most. It has been calculated that the dairy industry was worth $16 million a year to the community of Dungog before deregulation.
If we want to measure the compassion, the understanding, of this government for communities like that, let me tell the House that last December I took the mayor of Dungog and the mayor of Gloucester and their general managers to meet the minister and explain how adversely dairy deregulation was going to affect those communities. I think he understood. What did those communities get? Dungog has received $84,000 to do a study that will be printed in 12 months time, and they will immediately have to do another one because the dynamics will have changed so much it will no longer be relevant. And the week before last they got $110,000 for a family organisation to construct a concrete batching plant. I have got nothing against concrete—we need it in our buildings—but the whole point is that that is the total money that community has got for an industry that was worth $16 million a year. And this government has the audacity to come in here and tell us it represents rural and regional Australia. It does not even understand the needs in those communities. The minister has never been there, despite meeting with the mayor and the general manager.
I want to talk about some other anomalies. This is a government that prides itself on being a low taxing government. The Treasurer tells us every question time it is the lowest taxing government in Australia's history. We just heard the member for Eden-Monaro say that this is a federal government program—$1.7 billion worth. If that is not hypocritical, because he knows— 
—It is from taxpayers.
—as well as the member for Page knows, this is fully funded by consumers, and will be for the next nine years, with 11c on every litre of milk that is consumed in Australia. Talk to the dairy farmers—obviously members opposite do not—and they will tell you that they pay that 11c a litre many times over because of the drop in farm gate price. This government continues to identify it as a federal program. It is not; it never has been. And what does this latest attempt to try and put your finger in the hole in the dyke before it collapses achieve? It extends it for another year: more consumers money, not one cent out of the federal government's pockets. It is all right for the Treasurer to come in here and talk about surpluses, but this whole program continues to be funded by the consumers.
There are other issues I would like to raise. We have heard repeatedly from the government: what did the states do about it? 
—Nothing.
—We have heard that this was a state responsibility, that the states should have compensated for quota. The member for Page in particular, as a former minister in the Greiner government, knows only too well that quota was never issued by a state government. No licence fee was ever paid for quota. If he cares to have a look at the New South Wales Dairy Corporation handbook, Individual quota policy 1998-99, he would see that it says:
A quota is a quantity of milk that has been determined by the Corporation.
It goes on and says:
Briefly stated, the Corporation does not see a quota allocated under the Act as a negotiable or a transferable asset with a value as property.
Yet members come in here repeatedly stating that it was the responsibility of the states to compensate for that. Why? The handbook of the industry said it was not an asset, it was not saleable and should not be regarded as property.
We should ask the question: does this compensate all? The answer is no. I would like to read a letter I received yesterday from the daughter of a dairy farmer. It says
My two sisters and I inherited a dairy farm in Gloucester after our father's death in 1997. The farm had a quota attached which was valued for probate purposes at $122,060. At that time the farm was leased to—
a family, and I will not name them—
who paid a monthly rental tied to the price of quota or market milk.
In the lead up to deregulation all correspondence and any rights to vote were given to the tenant as the registered supplier of the milk. As the farm and the quota owners we received no correspondence and were not allowed to vote, even though we were in attendance at the meeting to do so.
After deregulation the tenants have walked off the property, taking their substantial Dairy Adjustment Package payment to commence operations somewhere else. This has left our property in a much less viable state as a dairy farm.
Attached is a copy of our appeal to the Dairy Adjustment Authority which we subsequently lost.
We now hear that the Federal Government is providing $140m in additional assistance. We urgently request that you ensure that any entitlement under this additional scheme be paid in full to the original farm and quota owners or the lessors rather than any of it being paid to the lessees. In our case these lessees have walked off the farm in April with their substantial package, and have left our property run down from over stocking and with rental payments in arrears. These tenants have no further interest in the property yet they will continue to be compensated for loss of eamings from the property for the next eight years under the original adjustment package. It appears quite ludicrous that they could possibly be considered for any further payments.
We vehemently request that the Federal Government consider very carefully how they allocate the further assistance, particularly with respect to lessors/lessees.
It raises this point: how thoroughly did the minister and his department look into the justice of their original package? Here we have a family that had to pay probate on the value of a quota and yet, when it came time for compensation only a short while later— 
—I thought it didn't have any value.
—this minister and his department said, `You have no interest in it. The tax office says you pay the probate on it, but you are not entitled to have an interest in it and get any compensation from this very fair package that we are putting forward.' It is a disgrace, and the member for Page knows it is because he has spoken with many dairy farmers in his electorate.
The other point I would like to make is that this package in no way addresses modern farming practices or farmers who knew that deregulation was on its way and were prepared to go out there and invest. I appreciate the nod of agreement by the member for Page, because those are the people that are missing out. These are the people that are capable of producing high volumes of milk at low cost. They are the people that really entered into deregulation before it occurred. They ran their farms without more than 35 per cent of quota milk and, because of that, because they had a low volume of quota, they miss out entirely. They are very aggrieved by it because this is really a bit of a payout to the people who said, `We got nothing for our quota. We believe we should have.' So they are going to get a maximum of $60,000 and an average of about $30,000. This government is really not encouraging modern practice at all and it is not rewarding the people that should be rewarded, and for that reason I certainly support the amendment.
The debate over the deregulation of the dairy industry will go on for many years because it is going to see the destruction of communities that have relied on dairying for well over a century, and I represent a number of those communities. What this government should have been doing for at least 12 months before dairy deregulation was workshopping those communities, advising them of the devastation that deregulation was going to bring them and that they should have been looking for alternative industries or processing.
I agree with ABARE and their statistics that show that Australia has the potential to be one of the greatest exporters of dairy products in the world. But what do we find? I attended a morning tea with some senior citizens the other day, and they said to me, `Why has the price of butter escalated suddenly?' I said, `I don't know. I don't eat butter. I eat the alternative product, but I will find out.' I found out that butter production has dropped because there is a shortage of milk. The old butter factories that we used to have all the way up the North Coast of New South Wales are no longer there; New South Wales is importing its butter. The dried milk factory that used to be in Gloucester and had 36 jobs closed earlier this year; we are now importing dried milk from New Zealand. These are the sorts of things that deregulation of the dairy industry has brought about. These are the sorts of things that are destroying the country towns that the National Party of Australia will tell you are their lifeblood—and they wonder why dairy farmers are angry! I know why they are angry, the member for Page knows why they are angry, and this legislation in no way gives them the answers that they are looking for. I support the amendment.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2001-06-20,"—I suppose it was a forlorn hope but I did come in here for the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 to listen to the members of the Labor Party giving some suggestions as to what might overcome the problems that are in the dairy industry at the present time, but all we have heard has been empty rhetoric and some politicisation of the whole situation. I have to say that the member for Corio continually misrepresents the truth of this issue in this House, because there is no doubt that he is trying to use this particular situation to the advantage of his own political leanings and is not looking at all at what are the problems in the dairy industry.
Let me go back to the start of this, because I remember the start of this very clearly. This all started in the early eighties, and it had nothing to do with competition policy. It was all to do with the Victorian dairy industry, which wanted to come across the border into New South Wales and sell milk in the Sydney whole-milk market. That is what it was all about: the green-eyed monster from down south. I have heard nothing from the member for Corio about that particular issue. The member for Corio, of course, was aiding and abetting the Victorian industry at that time. He was not out there saying, `This is going to be a terrible thing for the dairy industry.' He, as a Victorian member, was out there supporting the Victorian dairy industry. That is where the whole issue started: in Victoria. 
We talk about the Kerin plan and we talk about the Crean plan that was put in place to try to overcome these particular problems. Minister Crean put a sunset clause on the dairy marketing scheme, which ran out in 2000; the Victorians were never going to sign that again. They wanted to break down the marketing arrangements in Australia, and it had nothing to do with competition policy. In fact, if the members opposite want to tell the truth about this issue, all the states under the terms of competition policy had inquiries to see whether it was in the interests of the consumers to deregulate the dairy market. All except one state found that it was not in the interests of consumers, and that one state was Victoria. That is where this whole process started. Anyone who has been around this debate for any length of time knows that I did not support deregulation of the milk market in New South Wales and I still do not, because I do not believe that it was necessary in the first place. 
This government has attempted, at the request of the dairy industry, to do something to alleviate the pain that was obviously inherent in the deregulation of the dairy industry. The members opposite, the members of the Labor Party, continually say that the government as such has never put a dollar into this scheme. It seems to me that they must be away on a holiday or something. The member for Paterson, I understand, was a schoolteacher at one time; he obviously was not a maths teacher. If you have a look at this, it is fairly clear. The Labor Party earlier this year was screaming and crying about the government having an excise on fuel and saying that we should remove part of that excise on fuel. Tell me, Mr Deputy Speaker: what is the difference between an excise on fuel and the levy on milk consumption which pays for this particular package? It is a tax. Governments do not have any money; they get the money that they distribute from tax. And yet the Labor Party has the gall to stand up there and say that the government does not have this money, when the reality is fairly obvious. I could go back to the dairy community and say, `The Labor Party is in favour of removing the 11c levy.' I wonder what it would do to the price of milk in the marketplace if there were no such thing as government money being involved in this package.
I would like to take up the issue that the member for Paterson raised on quota. The state governments have continually refused to do anything about compensation for quotas, particularly New South Wales and Queensland. To stand up here and say that in 1989 the New South Wales Dairy Corporation put out a statement saying `Don't consider that quotas are of any value' is absolutely ludicrous. Talk about putting out a statement after the horse has bolted. I have dairy farmers in my electorate whose quotas were considered by the banks to be an asset; it was part of their collateral. One particular dairy farmer had $180,000 worth of quota, and the bank considered that it was collateral. Do not tell me that the state government can suddenly slide out from underneath that and say, `Now we don't believe that it is, because we might be up for some compensation.' They stole billions of dollars from the dairy farmers in New South Wales. That is what this package is trying to do: to compensate for some of that, to help these people adjust to the new marketplace. The state government of New South Wales have done nothing to try to help the dairy industry, but it is a state industry. We had the member for Corio and the member for Paterson standing up here as if it were a federal industry; it is not. They do not understand the Constitution, apparently. It is a state industry, and it has been a state regulated industry. The only reason the federal government became involved in this is that the federal government is the only government in Australia that can set an excise, and the only way that this package was going to be repaid was through an excise. That is the only reason that the dairy industry came to the federal government at all. 
The member for Corio mentioned the fact that we had a little stunt from the Leader of the Opposition where he had a dairy industry task force tripping around Australia, seeing what could be done about the milk industry. I have a rather interesting story about this. Up on the North Coast of New South Wales, the Labor candidate for Page was using the electorate office of Harry Woods, the member for Clarence, as his campaign office. The candidate rang up all the dairy farmers in the area of the North Coast to come and talk to the dairy industry task force about their problems. Four people turned up, out of all the dairy farmers on the North Coast of New South Wales. So, if the member for Corio then quotes some of the issues that he heard in those areas, he is not quoting from the great bulk of dairy farmers. I have been to meetings where there have been 200 dairy farmers, obviously putting mixed views across about this deregulation package. 
It is true to say that there have been some anomalies, such as the anomaly quoted by the member for Paterson just now. However, if he had bothered to look at this particular package before the parliament, he would have seen that that is what part of the package is designed to do: to address some of those anomalies, to address the exact thing that the member for Paterson raised. If he does his job as a local member, he will make sure that that is brought to the attention of the minister, because in this package there is the ability to address those anomalies. I have three or four anomalies in my electorate that I have taken to the minister. There is an obvious problem, and no matter what you do in a government, no matter what government puts forward a package, there will always be some anomalies at the edges that you have to deal with. That is exactly what this package is trying to do.
The industry is recovering. There is no doubt that the early days of deregulation in Queensland and New South Wales were horrific. There was a sudden reduction in price to the producers. Some of that, of course, had to do with contracts with the supermarkets. There is no doubt in my mind that some of the practices of the big supermarkets need to be looked at, and I have been pushing that issue for quite some time. There should be a close look at some of the processors as well, because there is no doubt that the supermarkets and the processors took the opportunity in this deregulation period to take a greater slice for themselves. I know that the ACCC have looked at this and they have not found at this stage that that was the case. I have gone back to the minister and said that I am not happy about that issue. There needs to be another look at the take that has been taken by the supermarkets and the processors in this issue.
The real issue that the member for Paterson was talking about—and what dairy farmers claim that they are paying for the package—is not the fact that the package is being paid for by the levy but that the bottom line has dropped for the dairy farmers. Where has the money gone? Blind Freddy would know that it has gone to the supermarkets. That is where it has gone. The dairy farmers are suffering from that issue. The minister is well aware of that, and I know the Prime Minister is well aware of it, and I am sure that we will hear more about that in the future.
I commend the government and the minister for this package. As I said, no doubt it is aimed at those who were worst hit in the white milk market, the ones who had quotas, those who were worst affected. In the instance that the member for Paterson raised about someone who had exited the industry, they will not be getting part of this package, they have gone; it will go to the people who are still in the industry and who have been affected severely by the loss of quota—the loss of quota that has not been addressed by the state governments in New South Wales and Queensland and which only this government has had the ability to address.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—It is very interesting that the member for Page used terms like `the dairy industry is a state industry'. That is a ridiculous thing to say, and having been a minister in the New South Wales government I would have thought that he would have known about free trade between the states in Australia, that the dairy industry was regulated on a state basis and it was only by agreement that people did not trade across borders. This government was a part of deregulation, and to hear the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry come in here from time to time and say, `It had nothing to do with us, we were just here to help out at the edge,' is really a dishonest position for a federal minister to take and for people like the member for Page to reinforce.
The Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 provides further assistance to dairy farmers in regions and some dairy farm lessors, who have been certainly impacted by dairy deregulation, particularly focused on providing additional assistance to dairy farmers producing liquid milk in the liquid milk market in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. Those dairy farmers have been hit extremely hard. Dairy farmers in dairying regions in those states were identified in a recent ABARE report as having been particularly disadvantaged by the deregulation of this industry. The new package is in addition to the $1.78 billion already provided and comprises $100 million for increases in adjustment payments for producers who are still in the industry and who put at least 35 per cent of their production into market milk—that is, milk into the drinking milk market.
There is $20 million in the package to expand the Dairy Regional Assistance Program and $20 million for discretionary payments to producers and some lessors who may have fallen outside the scope of the original package due to some unforseen circumstances. The existing dairy adjustment levy will be extended by around 12 months. Therefore, another $140 million will be raised by this levy, the consumer paying for this further into the future. It seems amazing that, after all the assurances that were given to the industry by the minister that the original levy would solve all of the problems in the dairy industry deregulation, we have had to now find another $140 million to sort out more problems. Of course, it has been found because it is an election year. The pressure about deregulation is really starting to bite for this government, starting to bite in some of the seats, and of course to sort it out they have tried to bring more money in and start throwing more money at the problem.
There is a number of problems, probably not as many in the last two payouts as there were in the first package. We all remember the Beaudesert polocrosse field that people were talking about that was built out of readjustment money—just bad policy, administered by a minister who had not thought it through, who had not worked through a policy and who had not looked in any way at the real problems that were going to occur. The other one of course—and the big one—in this latest package, in this bill, is that eligibility will be determined by the minister's office and by the minister, not by the Dairy Adjustment Authority. This is not going to be arms-length. Decisions will be made by the minister in an election year. This is a scandal. It is disgraceful that a minister is going to have this sort of control over this sort of money in an adjustment package. It should be the Dairy Adjustment Authority which has that control and makes those decisions, not the minister.
It certainly does not appear that farmers in my state of Tasmania are going to be able to access these funds. It is thought that almost no farm lessors—those who leased out their dairy farms and got virtually nothing from the adjustment package—will get any money from the supplementary package. I know there were 10 farmers from my electorate who talked to the Labor Party task force and explained to them how they had missed out on adjustment money, and we took issues up with the minister. But of course, unless you derive 50 per cent or more of your total income from a dairy enterprise, you missed out. In Tasmania we had mixed farms and people's full income was not always from the dairy side of their farm. The package discriminated greatly against lessors—those who had leased out their farm. The lessees picked up the package and then moved on. Of course, there were people who had actually retired and whose income was coming in from their lease on the farm who have now been forced back into dairying, forced back to the farm. This is real smart restructuring of an industry—to force people to go back into farming when they have basically retired. 
It just shows the failure of this minister to think through and look at this policy before it was implemented—to think about the adjustment issues and how it was going to affect individuals and the regions where it was going to impact. It would have been quite easy to look at where it was going to impact on regions and at what those effects would be, and to try and put money into those regional packages to assist in going down a different avenue. We try to deal with some of those issues in our second reading amendment to this bill in seeking to address the long-term skilling needs in the industry, to stimulate further research and development for the industry and to plan and promote further market access for dairy products—that is, looking into the long-term future of the dairy industry, which has certainly not been done. The other thing about this package—and this money for a restructuring of the dairy industry is being raised from the consumer—is that the federal government, one of the big winners out of the package, is taking its share of the tax. So we have, I suppose, a third of the money that is being raised for the restructuring going to the federal government in tax. The federal government is gaining greatly from it.
I can certainly imagine where the dairy industry will go in the future and about some of the future reports by ABARE—`A decline in export' and `Where will export be?' It is very interesting to see that the New Zealanders, who are already in our dairy industry, have recently amalgamated their dairy industry, making it the fourth biggest dairy entity in the world. I have visited and spoken to New Zealanders in that industry on several occasions, and I see now that they have come to a single-desk selling position, which they are very good at. They are selling to the world from a single desk, because they have reached the conclusion that that is the best way for them to go. But I despair a bit about where we are going to sell things in the world. Only yesterday I was talking to DFAT about the WTO, and I think it is going to be some years before we make any great breakthroughs in that area which will increase exports of Australian products.
So we have a deregulated dairy industry, the most efficient dairy industry in the world, and we do not know where in the world we can get the markets, we do not know the future of the industry, we have caused all sorts of grief to dairy farmers and their families, we have put all sorts of pressures on certain regions where this has impacted and we have got a government that has not thought about what sort of impact this was going to have in those regions or what sort of impact this was going to have on those families and the people within this industry. It was very bad policy—badly thought out and badly implemented—and now we are back to pork-barrelling by the minister, who has control of forking out $140 million on his own say. That is a disgrace. It is a very bad position for those dairy farmers to be in. I do not believe that this government has learnt anything from this. This is $140 million to try and patch up the original issues and the original bad policy in the first place.

"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—Members opposite really have not got much to talk about when they are criticising the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for making decisions. I applaud the minister for the decisions he has made in relation to this package, and also the earlier package, which I must remind members is the largest one that we have seen in Australia to assist a rural industry—$1.78 billion being injected into the dairy industry for the very large restructuring that is going on within that industry. 
Let us begin at the beginning. This has not been a very easy issue for members, no matter where they are from. This has been a very difficult issue to deal with, because the moment those Victorian dairy farmers decided that they wanted to be able to sell their product across state borders, as they are entitled to do under the Australian Constitution, there was nothing under the Constitution that could stop them from doing that. Of course, the ramifications of their decision went far and wide. I think it is all to the credit of the minister—and this government—that, when representatives of the industry appeared here in Canberra and said, `This is going to have a serious impact on our industry, and this is the package that we believe you should be looking at in order to respond to it,' he responded effectively by having meetings of people representing dairying areas and going through the package with a fine-tooth comb. I must admit there were bits of the package that I would have preferred to have perhaps gone a different way, but of course it was the package that the industry itself was proposing. As a result of that, we were able to introduce an effective package that provided $1.78 billion into an industry that really was hurting very badly. 
The opposition spokesman represents a Victorian electorate. It is strange that in this debate on the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 we should be lectured by someone from Victoria about what is going on in the dairy industry, because it was the Victorians that made the decision in the first place that they wanted to sell across state borders, and the ramifications that flowed from that were quite serious. I think it was the member for Corio, or perhaps one of his colleagues who spoke after him, who said that a recent ABARE report, in fact released this week, said that milk prices should rise. But, instead of welcoming that, what did he do? He went into an absolute rage about some other part of the report that contained a negative comment. This is what we get all the time from members opposite. You can be in a very difficult corner and you can be working as hard as you can to find a solution to a problem and members opposite can be counted upon to carp their way through it, to criticise and to be negative about anything. We had $1.78 billion injected in the first place, and now we have got a further $140 million. This $140 million is a direct response to this report from ABARE, The Australian dairy industry: impact of an open market in fluid milk supply. I want to speak to a couple of the points that are raised within this report. It states on page 23:
Outside Victoria the regional economies that are relatively heavily dependent on dairy farming include:
·	Eacham, Monto, Rosalie and Warwick North in Queensland ... 
As a representative of the Rosalie area, I am glad to be able to speak on this bill. There are of course other areas within my electorate that are heavily affected. I would pick Kilcoy and Nenango as being very heavily affected by the whole issue of the changes within the dairy industry, but of course the report has identified those places. It goes on to state on page 19: 
... the largest reductions in dairy farm incomes are expected in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, followed by South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria.
It also says:
For the majority of dairy farmers in Victoria and Tasmania, the sum of farm cash income and their DSAP payments in 2000-01 is likely to exceed their average farm cash income in 1999-2000.
Isn't that interesting? Victoria and Tasmania overall, according to ABARE, are going to have more money under the deregulated system than they had previously; they will be the beneficiaries of deregulation. Isn't it interesting that from the opposition side we have had spokesmen from Victoria and Tasmania carping, whingeing and carrying on about a program that, according to ABARE, has actually benefited their local industry? The people who are actually directly affected are the constituents that I and the member for Fairfax represent.
—Listen to what they are saying. 
 (Mr Nehl)—Member for Braddon, the chair is not interested in listening to you at the moment.
—We are taking a positive outlook to this. We are looking at the problem and endeavouring to address it. When you look at what ABARE actually found, you realise the response of the minister in coming forward with this further package of $140 million is very timely indeed. It is not the perfect outcome. Instead of having the minister producing this $140 million, we should have the state governments injecting money into this industry. Premier Beattie in Queensland, who now presides over a budget in deficit, as of last night, and has a total spend on agriculture in Queensland of only four per cent, has delivered not one zack to supporting dairy industry at this difficult time—nothing of any real impact—and yet, for example, to quote the ABARE report:
Individual milk quotas were transferable assets.
So these transferable assets, which in effect through their impact on the tax system at the state level have been generating income for the state government in Queensland for many, many years, have been part of the thing that supports the state government and keeps it running. Now that it has fallen into disarray, what are the Queensland government doing? Nothing. Yet they are the ones who are admirably positioned to be able to support that industry in its time of need. One of the things that happens under this package that we are debating now is that the $140 million is allocated, according to the ABARE report, to focus on states such as Queensland and New South Wales where there is a higher reliance on market milk, not manufactured milk.
That means that those struggling producers in my state and in my area who produce a large proportion of manufactured milk are not going to be supported by this package. Of course, ABARE makes the point that the majority of support in effect should be going to those people more reliant on market milk because they are the ones whose incomes are most affected. Yet we have a state government which is positioned to be able to fill the gap, to be able to do something about those guys—those manufacturing milk producers—doing absolutely nothing. 
I find it particularly galling to read in the South Burnett Times—a newspaper that covers the South Burnett area where a lot of milk is produced—that the local former One Nation member, now an Independent, is telling everybody that this $140 million allocation is unfair to milk consumers as well as producers. I would swear she was working for the Labor Party, I would swear that she was a mouthpiece for those members opposite, because that is the kind of negative rhetoric that we get from people over there. If there is a shortcoming in this package, then let the state governments and state members like her actually do something about it instead of just spouting forth with hot air and doing nothing to support this very important industry that is so vital to local communities.
One of the things that has been made a lot of by members opposite is the so-called polocrosse field. It just shows you how ignorant of the whole regime and the idea of the Dairy Regional Assistance Program that is tied in with this overall package are members opposite. Under that package we have seen $88,000 going to a pipeline to support the expansion of the pork industry in my electorate, to provide jobs and to provide economic activity to make up for the losses that have naturally occurred because of what has happened in Victoria with the dairy industry. In effect, we have seen an enterprise cooperative being formed, supported by Dairy RAP, with $26,400 in Kilcoy to grow turf. They have subsequently been able to get an $88,000 grant to expand their turf growing activities and to take up some of the slack that is caused by the impact of changes in the dairy industry. We have had $73,000 going to a very good company that is building fire tenders and rural fire brigade equipment. There are many other grants that have gone into these affected areas and they have had a very good and positive impact.
We are seeing changes that have been difficult but we are now seeing people more and more finding a way through it. I applaud their activities, I applaud their commitment and, above all, I applaud them for their forbearance under these difficult circumstances. I am sure that we will see the dairy industry fighting back, and it certainly is apparent in many of the places within my area.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—The reason that we are here debating the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 is because the federal government have blown it when it comes to the dairy industry. They have blown it for the second time. They had a great opportunity, with a $1.9 billion package, to set up this nationally significant industry for the future. Instead, they blew it and they blew it completely. That is why they have scurried back into the parliament today with this $140 million package to try and save their political skins. That is all this package is about. It is not about helping the people most in need, it is not about helping people going through difficult circumstances and it is not about helping people in the dairy communities that have been negatively affected as a result of dairy deregulation. This is all about creating a pork barrel fund to save some National Party ministers' seats, because the dairy farmers and the dairy communities in those areas understand that the pain that they are experiencing right now can be attributed only to the Liberal Party and National Party elected representatives that they have right now. They are sick of the duplicity of these people who run back to their electorates and say, `You know, I'm really on your side. I understand exactly what you're going through. Geez, it must be tough. I was a stockbroker in Sydney; I know a fair bit about the dairy industry.' That is what these National Party people are doing. People in those districts have got smart to this—they have got smart to the fact that these people are saying one thing in their constituencies and doing another thing altogether here in the federal parliament. That is why we have this $140 million today.
Unfortunately this $140 million will be another wasted opportunity to be tacked onto the $1.9 billion wasted opportunity which we saw with dairy deregulation via the package which we were discussing in this parliament some months ago. What could we have done with that $1.9 billion? We could have done quite a lot to set this industry up in a way which would have ensured that it had not only a future where it limped along but a future where it grew and prospered and where we could see the manufacturing opportunities in the deregulated dairy industry come to fruition. We could have seen new jobs—high skill jobs, high value added jobs—being created here in our country and we could have set ourselves up as the nation internationally that produced products in the dairy industry which had a high value associated with them and which made sure that Australia could consolidate its natural advantage in the dairy sector. But we have not done that. Instead, when it comes to the dairy industry this government has tried to put in place a strategy where it could maximise only its opportunities for re-election rather than maximising its opportunities to realise the potential of the dairy industry in this country. This is a great shame.
We had a lecture before from the member for Blair about what the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program was all about. He was giving us a lecture—this from a member of parliament who is part of a government whose original legislation in relation to the dairy deregulation had no component at all for structural adjustment for dairy dependent communities. Yet he is giving the likes of the member for Braddon and me a lecture about what Dairy RAP is all about and what its objectives are all about. We on this side of the House all understand, and I think the Australian people understand, that the only reason that we got the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program—$45 million; $15 million a year over three years—is because of the pressure applied by members on this side of the House, including the member for Braddon, the member for Bass, the member for Lyons and the member for Corio, the shadow minister for agriculture. That is the only reason we ended up with the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program in the first place. We know what its objectives are; we know what it should be doing. We certainly do not need any lectures from members opposite about what that program should be doing—we understand that pretty clearly. 
It is good to see that there has been some increase in relation to that program. We are concerned about where that money goes. We do not want to see that money go to building wine appreciation rooms in grammar schools, we do not want to see that money go to building polocrosse fields. This is disgraceful conduct on behalf of the government—an absolute insult to all the farmers who have gone through difficulty and hard times and to the communities that are dairy dependent which have gone through difficulties as well and which have gone through the awful circumstances often surrounding dairy deregulation in those communities. Those people's hardships and sacrifice should not be going into creating a fund for people who have already got a quid, who are already doing pretty well. There are not too many battlers that you see on a polocrosse field. Regarding the people who would be going across to the wine appreciation room in the grammar school, I do not think that there would be too many battlers there either. The way they have conducted themselves and the way they have divvied up the money to do with the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program is a real insult.
In my own electoral district, we understand what deregulation means at the coalface. We have had a plant closure in my electoral district, in the town of Drouin. The town of Drouin has about 4,500 or 5,000 people in it. The Bonlac Cooperative closed its plant there about 12 months ago. The plant there employed 150 people. To have 150 people losing their jobs in a town which has a population of 4,500 is a big deal. It is so big a deal that, in Eden, in New South Wales, when that community lost its cannery, which employed about 180 people in a town of about 5,000 people, this federal government saw fit to give them an adjustment package to the value of $3½ million. But we in Drouin, the people of Drouin who know all about sacrifice and hurt, who have experienced the difficulties associated with the loss of that important employer in their town, did not get $3½ from this federal government. They did not get a cracker in terms of an adjustment package from this federal government. 
It really is outrageous that we have this type of behaviour, this complete debauching and debasing of the regional development programs which have been established by this federal government. We have a situation where one community gets it—$3½ million—but another community, in this case Drouin in my electorate, does not get any structural adjustment money at all despite very similar circumstances and almost equal loss of jobs in a town of exactly the same population as Eden in New South Wales.
What we did was identify the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program as a way of getting some support for our town so that we might be able to create a few new jobs and help offset the difficulties experienced in the town as a result of the loss of those jobs associated with the Bonlac factory there. I should say that the Baw Baw Shire Council really has done a first-rate job in helping to coordinate that effort. We organised a meeting as soon as Bonlac announced that it intended to close the plant. We called together local councillors. I was there. The neighbouring state member of parliament, Ian Maxfield, was there. Representatives from the workers were there and involved. And there were representatives from the Committee for Drouin and from the Drouin Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
We put in place a plan for the Baw Baw Shire Council to develop a number of projects or to work on developing a proposal. It would submit to the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program a number of projects which would help create jobs in Baw Baw shire and which would help offset the loss of those 150 or 160 jobs associated with the Bonlac plant at Drouin. The officers at Baw Baw Shire Council, including Gary Gaffney and also John Dyer, the CEO, really have done a first-class job and put together a very professional submission to the federal government in relation to this. They did this in consultation with the people associated with the Gippsland Area Consultative Committee, who gave the project the tick, who gave people support and encouragement. And up the line it went.  
They did not ask for a lot of money—certainly by comparison with the $3½ million which Eden in New South Wales received from the federal government. They asked for $400,000—$100,000 for each of four specific projects which they had developed, which would benefit the Baw Baw shire and which would create about 50 or 60 jobs. These proposals consisted of supporting a number of the successful industries which we have in Baw Baw shire, including the Tarago River Cheese Company, the Rowse Flowers just outside of Ellinbank, Aus Plants, which is just outside Warragul, and Flavorite tomatoes, which is also just outside Warragul. These are all outstanding companies and very successful companies, a number of which I and some of my shadow ministerial colleagues and colleagues on this side of the House have visited as part of our work. These are exactly the types of industries which you would want to support in a place like Baw Baw shire. They represent the success and the growth which can be achieved in some of these vibrant and important industries. After a lot of work, after a lot of effort, after a lot of going through the motions, the decision came back from the federal government: `No, we won't be funding the $400,000. No, we will not be funding the creation of 50 jobs in Baw Baw shire to help offset the loss of those 150 or 160 jobs at the Drouin Bonlac plant.'
This is really disgraceful. A lot of people have gone through a lot of difficulty in Drouin—and West Gippsland more generally—as a result of this closure. The federal government should support these projects. They should get behind those existing industries which we have, help us develop our expertise and our natural skills in a number of key areas, including speciality cheese manufacture, and help us to develop the tourism potential of West Gippsland. It really is an indictment of the federal government that they have not seen fit to support these projects, especially when they have supported such ridiculous projects as the building of a polocrosse field and a wine appreciation room at a grammar school somewhere else in the country.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—There is a misconception about the problems with the deregulation of the dairy industry, and that is that it is a consequence of competition policy. I hear that everywhere I go in my own electorate. I hear it being said by people in the industry and by people in the Labor Party. Unfortunately, a misconception is also held by some members of the National Party and the Liberal Party. Recently I was at the state convention of the Liberal Party. One of the vice-presidents, in speaking about the post-mortem on the state election in Queensland, clearly stated that one of the factors involved in the result of the state election was the effects of federal dairy deregulation. Therefore, I was very disappointed that this misconception is even held by persons in my own party. Let me make it very clear. There were no federal dairy regulations. Dairy regulation was a province of each state. When the Victorian dairy industry made up their mind to deregulate, it was inevitable that there would be a massive effect on every other state. 
—What was the ultimatum given to them?
 (Mr Hollis)—We do not want to know the ultimatum. Do not answer that. Any comments will come through the chair.
—Victoria produces 80 per cent of all of Australia's dairy products. Therefore, deregulation was going to have a massive impact on every other state. Of course the dairy industry came to us, as a federal government, and said, `Help us.' Had Victoria deregulated without some adjustment scheme being put in place, it would have been devastating for the dairy industry in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. I mention these states because these are the quota states. In Queensland, dairy quotas are a tradeable commodity. They were the equity farmers had in their farm. It was the same in New South Wales. 
When the state government went to deregulate the dairy industry in Queensland as a part of the package of the Commonwealth's $1.7 billion package it was consequent upon deregulation in every state. Had the Beattie government in Queensland not wanted dairy deregulation, all they had to do was not deregulate and then the package could not have come into place. The danger there was that the flow of products from Victoria, where they can produce more cheaply and more efficiently all year round, would have devastated the industry, but it would have been something that happened immediately and caused problems overnight.
At the request of the industry—and we had many meetings here with Pat Rowley from Queensland—the Commonwealth put together a package based on a consumer levy of 11c a litre. It is a $1.7 billion package to help the industry readjust. That was put in place. The states all legislated to deregulate their industry, but there was absolutely no assistance from the Queensland government to those people who held quota. As I said before, quota is a tradeable commodity. It was the farmers' equity in their farms. Queensland had a moral, if not a legal, obligation to compensate people for their quota.
I mentioned that the dairy industry was not a part of competition policy but, as a consequence of competition policy, Queensland and the other states will attract national competition policy payments from the Commonwealth as a consequence of dairy deregulation. The Beattie government, and, I suppose, the Carr government in New South Wales, had a moral obligation to buy out those quotas—to pay the dairy farmers for the quota. They received revenue taxes, stamp duty, from the trading activity of those quotas. Therefore, they had a moral obligation to compensate every farmer for their loss of quota. Every farmer was entitled to that compensation and they did not receive it. Overnight they lost their equity. When a dairy farmer went to a bank, that quota was part of his equity and the basis upon which he would receive a loan for carry-on finance or whatever. That went overnight. The farmers were devastated. Mr Beattie had an obligation to compensate those farmers. I keep repeating this because there is a conception in the community that dairy deregulation was a Commonwealth issue. And it was not; it was purely a state issue. There was an obligation on the Beattie government to pay out these farmers for their quota.
As the member for Blair said earlier, the Queensland budget came down last night. Of course, in the great tradition of Labor governments, they are in the red. Only four per cent of the Queensland budget was spent on matters relating to agriculture. With the industry devastated as it is because of deregulation, the Queensland government should have compensated these people—I say it again—for the loss of this quota. This is why we are considering the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001. Had the Queensland government, the New South Wales government and other state governments compensated dairy farmers for the loss of this quota, we would not be here discussing this bill. As I said, state governments had a moral obligation to compensate for quota, if not a legal obligation. But the Commonwealth was not prepared to sit back and see these dairy farmers suffer any longer.
The ABARE report was brought down some six months after the deregulation of the dairy industry and it showed that further assistance was required. What this bill does is put in place an additional package over and above the $1.7 billion package. This amount is $140 million, and it is broken up on the basis of $100 million in supplementary market milk payments to dairy farmers who are most heavily dependent on market milk production, $20 million for eligible people who because of extraordinary circumstances were excluded or their entitlements were significantly lower than normal under the government's Dairy Structural Adjustment Program, and the $20 million expansion of the Dairy Regional Assistance Program.
On 29 May the Prime Minister visited Gympie in my electorate and announced that a $1.6 million grant would be given to a Gympie company, Nolan meats, as part of the Dairy RAP, as a grant to create jobs in that town which is heavily dependent on the dairy industry in the Mary Valley. That will translate into 150 jobs over the next four years. The Dairy RAP is not meant to create jobs in the dairy industry; it is meant to create jobs in towns and regional centres that are affected by the downturn in that industry. 
Additional milk payments will be made to people with interest in farms that were dependent on market milk returns for more than 35 per cent of the milk they delivered in 1998-99. Payments will be made to people who were granted an entitlement under the DSAP and who can demonstrate that they are still actively involved in dairy enterprise. 
I met with a group of dairy farmers in my electorate last Friday who are at the top end of the dairy industry; they milk between 400 and 500 cows per day. They made it very clear to me that they, as efficient farmers, are not helped particularly by this package. This package is aimed at people who are most affected by the downturn. But the farmers at the top end, the efficient ones who want to keep farming, want a floor price scheme, some sort of a price where they can continue to produce in the efficient manner in which they have produced in the past. Initially it was anticipated that the price in Queensland would be the Victorian price plus the cost of freight, which is around the 45c per litre mark. As it turns out, these farmers are now receiving 36c a litre and they cannot exist on that amount of money. I commend this bill to the House and I commend the compassionate attitude the government has taken to the dairy industry.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—The fact that we are here again debating this government's response to the issue of dairy deregulation proves to me one thing—and that is that from the outset the government got it wrong. Its answer to deregulation of the dairy industry was the kind of response you get when you really do not have a response. From the start, this government had no plan, and still has no plan, for dairy farmers and dairying communities who were nervously awaiting deregulation of their industry. The coalition had no blueprint for the future of the dairy industry and still does not. Instead, what we have seen from day one is policy making on the run. 
Yet again this government has run into trouble. What we are seeing now is another case of policy breakdown. The Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 is an attempt to fix it. This amendment is yet another admission of government policy failure, the failure to properly recognise what dairy farmers in many farming communities across Australia would be in for post-deregulation, a failure that this side of the House tried to bring to the attention of the government some time ago. 
We were all told about the inevitability of dairy deregulation. What was this government's response? Nothing. There was no response. It sat on its hands and did nothing. It was left to the industry itself to come up with a compensation package it hoped would soften the impact of deregulation. Hence the Dairy Industry Adjustment Bill 2000. That bill made provision for a $1.78 billion package funded by an 11c a litre levy on milk consumers—a tax. These arrangements, known as the dairy industry adjustment package, comprised three programs: the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program, the Dairy Exit Program and the Dairy Regional Assistance Program. I particularly remember the last of those programs being rushed into this House late one evening, when members were given virtually no time to debate the program. It was an eleventh hour measure, hastily incorporated into legislation after the government belatedly acknowledged—due in no small part to the effort of members on this side of the House, and I certainly acknowledge the effort of the members for Corio, McMillan, Paterson, Lyons and Bass—that there was very little or no provision for the impact of deregulation on dairy communities at that stage. This, I am pleased to say, led to a $45 million program for regional areas. 
I supported the original bill, which was debated in this House over 12 months ago, and I support this new legislation—albeit with a number of reservations, as outlined in the amendments tabled by my colleague who is at the table, the member for Corio. The aim is to provide further help to those suffering hardship because of deregulation, in the form of the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001. In effect, it will provide an additional $140 million. The $140 million will be raised, again, through an extension of the milk levy—that is, from milk consumers, not the government.  
Of course, there are always going to be `anomalous circumstances' because of this government's inept handling of dairy deregulation. I support further assistance because it is clear that many dairy farmers slipped through the net following the original dairy adjustment package. I am very pleased also to see that at last there is acknowledgment of dairy farm lessors. There are a significant number of lessors in my electorate who have been adversely affected by deregulation of their industry, and I would like to come back to this later. 
The big disappointment in the whole dairy deregulation saga is that this government has once again been too slow to act. Indeed, it is a report by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, ABARE, which highlighted the continuing hardships caused by deregulation that has forced the government to further act. The truth is that from the start the government did not want to know about dairy deregulation. It was the industry that did the bidding for the initial compensation package to help farmers adjust to the challenges that lay ahead, and now ABARE has also shamed the government into action. 
As I have mentioned earlier, it must also be remembered that not one cent of the package is federal government money. The entire package is being funded by the milk levy on consumers—a milk tax. However, not only are consumers taxed but their tax is further taxed. The government pays nothing but collects two taxes, and therefore is pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars from a hidden tax on the money raised to help farmers adjust to dairy deregulation. Recent estimates put the tax take from the milk levy at over $400 million. Again, this money is being raised through an 11c a litre levy on consumers. At least 3c or 4c a litre from that is going straight into Treasury's coffers. 
I note that the supplementary assistance provided for in the bill is primarily focused on providing additional aid to dairy farmers producing for the liquid milk markets in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. At this stage it appears Tasmania will not get much of a look-in—and I will get to that shortly, if I can. However, we are still waiting on the full detail. That is a worry in itself because, as we know with this government, the devil is quite often in the detail. The important thing is that farmers and dairying communities who need assistance get it. To get it, they need the guidelines, and we are still waiting for the guidelines on this particular issue. This is disappointing to me and to the many farming communities spread across my electorate: the north-west coast of Tasmania boasts some of the finest dairying country in the world. Our dairy industry, which is predominantly centred in my magnificent electorate of Braddon on the north-west coast of Tasmania, employs around 2,000 people at farm level and a further 1,600 in factories and in distribution.
I have heard first-hand from many dairy farmers and their representatives in the Dairy Task Force—much derided by the other side, but a very positive initiative by this side and which will form the heart of our policy initiatives on this. Let me say that there was no token representation at the Dairy Task Force, certainly in my electorate, and there was very wide representation from that. Problems that particularly surfaced in my electorate were those facing lessors, and these were high on the list of priorities raised in the visit. The frustration of dairy farm lessors was expressed this way by Ms Lynett Griffiths, a committee member of the Dairy Farm Owners Action Group, who last week gave evidence to the Senate committee looking into the effects of dairy deregulation. Ms Griffiths said: 
Lessors were the first farmers to feel the effects of deregulation and were virtually excluded from receiving any packages under the dairy structural assistance plan because of the wrongly held belief that we were investors and would suffer no loss of income because of our lease. This wrongly held belief appears to be the reason for our exclusion and, even though we have made numbers of attempts to convince the minister for agriculture and fisheries ...
Well, he has taken some convincing, but at last the minister has accepted another of the shortcomings of the government's response to dairy deregulation. The Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill includes limited provisions to make discretionary payments to lessors who earned at least 50 per cent of their gross income from the lease in 1998-99 and who have suffered a 20 per cent fall in lease income during 2000-01. However, there are concerns that there may be only a handful of dairy lessors who will benefit, because most did not earn 50 per cent of their gross income from the lease.
I mentioned earlier that I want to highlight concerns that some of Tasmania's market milk producers may miss out on a share of the additional assistance. This bill is particularly focused, as I mentioned, on providing more aid to dairy farmers producing for the liquid milk market in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. Dairy farmers and dairying communities in these states were identified in the ABARE report as being particularly disadvantaged by dairy deregulation. The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association is worried that a number of Tasmanian dairy farmers who supply 100 per cent of their output into market milk will not be eligible for a share of the $100 million for market milk producers.
As I understand it, because of the pooling arrangements in Tasmania, a group of close to 20 suppliers whose total production goes into market milk will get nothing, due to the criteria likely to be applied—another anomaly looming, I fear. The Chairman of the TFGA's Dairy Council, Mr Brendan Thompson, put it this way in a recent media report. Mr Thompson was quoted in an article in the Tasmanian Country newspaper of 25 May, as follows:
We're very disappointed by the way the package has been set up. We would have thought the money would have been made available for market milk producers in all states.
Mr Thompson went on to say:
It won't go unnoticed that there is some political expedience involved here.
Surely not political expedience! Is there an election in the air? What is that whiff that we pick up in rural and regional Australia? Surely funds raised to help cushion the impact of deregulation on farmers and dairying communities will not be used as a political pork barrel by the government!
In conclusion, the response from most dairy farmer organisations to the new package has at best been lukewarm. It does, however, attempt to deal with some of the anomalies thrown up by the original package. However, anomalies still remain. It is very important that the minister listen when we make application on behalf of those that have been affected by some of these anomalies. I refer again to issues related to lessors. Even today I heard of one example of a lessor who is still not going to make the criteria, on the surface of it, and will not benefit in any way from the dairy deregulation package. It is very important that these problems be looked at and that farmers, farming communities and the families involved are dealt with accordingly.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I am always pleased to yield to my friend the member for Braddon, who is a passionate advocate of the dairy farmers in his electorate. As you have so unkindly pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, I no longer have any dairy farmers in my electorate. But that does not mean that I am not interested in the plight of dairy farmers. I notice the arrogance of the government in handling the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001. We do not have the minister here and we do not even have the courtesy of advisers in the advisers box. 
I want to agree at the start with only one point that coalition members have made, and that is that this process was started by Victorian coalition or Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett, when he agreed to undertake a referendum of farmers in that state. Indeed, the referendum was undertaken under the subsequent government of Premier Bracks. That is the genesis of the change that we are debating here today. 
This package is about a new tax. It is a tax on every litre of milk drunk by every child in Australia. When the mums and dads of Australia buy a litre of milk, there is a new tax of 11c. It was going to be on for eight years, but now that is being extended to eight years and nine months. If this bill was about cheaper milk for consumers, I might find it attractive. But let me quote Mr Ian Langdon, the Chairman of Dairy Farmers, who said in the Financial Review:
Deregulation was never going to lead to cheaper milk for the consumers.
So this is not about cheaper milk for consumers. I know what it is about; I know whose pockets are being lined. It is not the dairy farmers and it is not the mums and dads in my electorate; it is the producers and the supermarkets. These are the people that coalition members champion. Coalition member after coalition member made many points about why the states are not kicking in. Maybe that is a fair point, but let me first ask the question: why aren't you kicking in? Why does it have to be the kids and the mums and dads of Australia that have to fund it? Why won't you stand up, Parliamentary Secretary, and kick in? Why won't you get the senior minister that you work for to kick in? You are not putting $1 in. It is the mums and dads of Australia in electorates like mine that are funding this.
I support the principle that all Australians should help industries that are in transition. I am particularly attracted to helping battling dairy farmers. But who are the big winners out of this? The first big winner is Peter Costello and his parliamentary secretary. They are putting $500 million in the back pocket. This is a tax on a tax: 11c a litre for every litre, plus clawing back in addition to that another $500 million. What a disgrace you are!
What power do the states have to put on levies? You know full well that the High Court has ruled that out. Why should the states dig into their revenue for police, for education and for hospitals when you will not put $1 in. What utter hypocrisy! Again, I want to make the point that I can live with the proposition that we should assist dairy farmers. Take my state of New South Wales: I asked Mr Truss over there, the minister who has just walked into the House—and I thank him for that—how much money is going to be raised in New South Wales with this tax. The answer is: $521.6 million is going to be raised in New South Wales, but that is only after eight years—I apologise; I do not have the figure for eight years and nine months. But how much of this is actually going to New South Wales dairy farmers? About $337 million. If you take out the Commonwealth's $500 million in the back pocket, it gets down to about $255 million net. So, for every child who drinks a litre of milk in New South Wales, that 11c goes not to New South Wales dairy farmers—although some of it does—but $184 million slips out. Who is the big winner of this dairy deregulation? It is the most efficient industry—that is, Victoria. It gets $739 million. It is the most efficient dairy sector—and congratulations to it; I do not deprecate that. It is very export oriented—I do not deprecate that; I applaud that. But it is the biggest winner here.
It is not as though we are setting out to develop a proposal that really meets the needs of dairy farmers on the basis of actual need. We have already heard the member for McMillan talking about what is happening with one grant—building a polocrosse field, for goodness sake! The mums and dads and kids in Mount Druitt are paying a levy that will build a polocrosse field. This is not going to dairy farmers based on need. Indeed, some of the wealthiest dairy farmers are getting the most money out of this. What is fair about that? I have never before seen a scheme that abandons principles of equity, of trying to give measured assistance where assistance is really needed. I am going to use a quote that I have used before and it is from John Ralston Saul: 
Unregulated competition is a naive metaphor for anarchy.
I happen to agree with that. We are seeing that in the civil aviation industry—that is, if you actually want competition, often you have to put in regulations. What has happened as a result of this dairy deregulation in my state of New South Wales? Are mums and dads actually getting cheaper milk? No, not really. The comparison used to justify the cheaper milk used the price when the farm gate price was deregulated, not the pre-existing price—a little bit of fiddling the figures there. But what has actually happened, Minister? The producers have tendered literally uneconomic prices to the supermarkets, and then they have squeezed the dairy farmers. So they have actually made this deregulation even worse. Of course now the producers are trying to get back money from corner shops. In fact there is a 5c differential.
The supermarkets do not actually care what the price of milk is because they have the market power to put their margin on top of it. Minister, tell me why in your portfolio your main mission is to prop up supermarkets. Why are you the champion of supermarkets? Shouldn't you have a regard for dairy farmers? Shouldn't you have a regard for consumers? I will quote Minister Amery in a notorious letter to the National Competition Council Chairman, Mr Graeme Samuel:
Our experience of deregulation in the ... milk market has demonstrated that none of the theoretical benefits of deregulation have occurred.
What a damning statement. I regret that time is running out—
—If I am being offered an extension, I am happy to go on. I will quote a National Party member, the member for Cowper:
I believe that while we must have competition—there is no doubt about that—it has to be leavened with a degree of sanity.
There is no sanity in this, Minister. Listen to your own backbencher. I hope we can all learn from this abortive scheme. The idea that we can just blame the states for not picking up the mess, the trail, that the minister has left is outrageous. We have got the shadow minister here at the table. He led a task force; he went out there and talked to dairy farmers.
—We are still waiting for the report.
—I hope it will be released shortly. I am sure it will be more constructive than this mess that the minister has presented to the parliament. Make no mistake: what we are debating here today is a tax on kids of 11c, on the mums and dads of Australia. If you think it is going to help the dairy farmers, the biggest winners are John Howard and Peter Costello to the tune of $500 million. It is not targeted to help those dairy farmers most in need. Why have you turned your back on them, Minister? You are a disgrace. You should resign.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,2001-06-20,"— I am frankly appalled by the comments of the previous speaker and, indeed, of many of those opposite, who demonstrated once again Labor's clear lack of regard for the dairy farmers of Australia. Labor has been prepared to do absolutely nothing to assist dairy farmers around Australia. State Labor governments which deregulated their dairy industry have done absolutely nothing—not a cent from Queensland, not a cent from New South Wales, not a cent from Victoria, not a cent from Tasmania. The only government at the state level to provide any assistance was Western Australia, and that was a coalition government that provided some support to the dairy industry in that state. Labor did nothing. Labor has no policy for the dairy industry and Labor has no plan to help the dairy industry. It has been quite clear from the comments of the opposition speakers today that they are acutely embarrassed about Labor's failure to do anything at the state level to assist dairy farmers and by the enormous contrast with what this government has done to intervene and assist in a problem created largely by Labor state governments. We have intervened to assist while Labor has done absolutely nothing. 
Look at what Labor's response has been. The shadow minister put out a press statement on the issue several months ago—while the opposition leader was driving around in the boondoggle bus—in which he outlined a plan of action. The plan of action was that they would have a task force under the shadow minister himself. This task force has trotted around to one or two places around the countryside. I am told the biggest crowd they got anywhere was about eight; there was simply no interest in what they were doing. I understand that hardly any of the task force members themselves actually turned up to most of these meetings, just a token representation, and not even the shadow minister sometimes. The reality was that this task force was to have one key function, and that was to prepare a report by the end of April. Well, here we are: May, June, now the end of June, critical legislation on the dairy industry before the parliament, and still no report. So this jolly group of opposition members trotted around the countryside to talk about the dairy industry and has absolutely nothing to contribute, in a major debate, as to where Labor would go in relation to the future of the dairy industry. Even their own amendment fails to address any kind of policy issue.
It was quite clear from the public statements of the honourable member for Werriwa that Labor is opposed to any assistance whatsoever to dairy farmers, and the honourable member for Chifley sailed very close to the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa. He cannot see why milk users should make any kind of contribution towards ensuring the welfare of the dairy industry around Australia. The honourable member for Werriwa made it completely clear in his media statements that he is opposed to any assistance whatsoever to dairy farmers; and the honourable member for Chifley sailed very close to that theme. What is abundantly obvious from the record of Labor in government—and, after all, there are quite a lot of them in state governments around Australia—is that they will do absolutely nothing.
A number of other totally erroneous comments were made by speakers opposite. The honourable member for Chifley and the shadow minister continue to run the quite ridiculous line that somehow or other the federal government are major tax beneficiaries out of this package. I have heard various numbers for what we will collect: $300 million, $500 million—he makes them up as he goes along. The reality is that this is an issue that has been addressed by agriculture ministers around Australia. An independent report was commissioned from Arthur Andersen and Co. on the tax implications of this package for the federal government. The shadow minister knows, because he has been told many times—and Mr Amery knows, Mr Palaszczuk knows and Mr Hamilton knows, and I am sure they have all told him as well—that the report came back and said that there were no windfall tax gains for the Commonwealth out of this package, that it was revenue neutral. That is an independent report from Arthur Andersen and Co. So don't keep peddling information that you know to be false; it is completely inaccurate.
The other point we get peddled frequently by members opposite is that somehow or other this money, this near to $2 billion that has been provided to the dairy industry, has miraculously appeared and that the Commonwealth has no responsibility for the provision of those funds. The reality is that this money is being paid for by Commonwealth taxpayers in the same way that all other Commonwealth programs are paid for by taxpayers. The clear bottom line is that governments do not have money of their own—not governments on this side. We balance our budgets. Labor governments spend on the never-never: they run up bills, they run up the Bankcard bill and they do not care about who is ever going to pay. They ran up $90 billion worth of debt. On this side we pay our bills, and the only way that we can pay our bills—the only way any government can pay its bills—is if we collect taxation revenue from the people of Australia. In this particular case the tax is a special tax: it is being imposed on milk, just as we impose taxes on petrol, we impose taxes on goods and services and just as Labor, when they were in government, imposed a whole stack of taxes on all sorts of products, on goods and services. Labor imposed those sorts of taxes. This particular benefit to dairy farmers is being paid by way of a levy on milk consumers, and of course that is the way all programs have to be funded. 
The reality is that dairy deregulation was driven, as I think all honourable members know, by the desire of the industry to move towards a new environment, and when the opposition moved in their second reading amendment complaints that the government have no long-term plan for the dairy industry they demonstrate again their total lack of understanding. A task force has been rushing around the countryside, and they still have not come across anything of the dairy industry's plan for its future. Our vision for the industry is for it to develop into a highly competitive export oriented industry, and there is already plenty of evidence of the success of the dairy industry's capabilities to export around the world. Indeed, this year most dairy farmers in Australia, despite what we have heard from members opposite, will actually have increased incomes on those they had last year, and it is a result of the outstanding performance of our dairy exporters. It is due in part of course to the improving world prices of dairy products and the capacity of our industry to meet the market opportunities that exist, and that is indeed very much a part of the future of the dairy industry in Australia.
The honourable member for Chifley complained about the `unfairness' of the package, implying that somehow or other this money was going to the wealthy. That is also a nonsense. The reality is that, under this package, five times as much money per litre goes to dairy farmers who are supplying the market milk sector compared with those who are supplying the manufacturing sector. Farmers in that market milk sector have the biggest adjustment pressure. They were the ones in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia who had bought quotas and from whom the state governments had actually collected taxes in many instances in relation to the trading of these quotas, so they had significant debts and significant costs in capital investment in their properties. This is where the biggest adjustment has occurred, and the package recognised that by providing five times as much assistance per litre for those who were involved in the marketing sector as those who were in the manufacturing sector.
When it was proposed that we have a secondary package, a state Labor minister, Henry Palaszczuk, actually put up a proposal to ARMCANZ. I might add that all of the other state ministers, including his Labor colleagues, dumped on him heavily because his proposal would have provided the unfair assistance that the honourable member for Chifley was complaining about. He wanted supplementary support, much of which would have gone to Victoria. This new package, the subject of the bill that is before the House, is carefully targeted to those who have to make the greatest adjustment assistance. It is heavily directed towards farmers in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. In fact, only a handful of farmers in the other states will qualify. The reason for that is we recognise that some farmers have had to make a much greater adjustment contribution than others, and this package is carefully targeted in that direction. 
The opposition spokesman has suggested that the threshold should have been lowered for eligibility to this second package. To do so would have meant that more money would have gone to those who had a smaller adjustment task. So we have targeted the assistance in this package very much to those who got the biggest adjustment. In reality, the majority of them will be in states such as New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.
—In your electorate.
—If I may respond to the honourable shadow minister who has entered the chamber and who knows absolutely nothing about dairying, the reality is that the farmers in my electorate will actually get a smaller payout than dairy farmers in other parts of Queensland. The reality is that it is based on the level of adjustment that will be required in relation to the new market arrangements which exist into the future. A point made by a couple of members, including one who is still in the chamber—the only one of the contributors still in the chamber, apart from the shadow minister—was in relation to a handful of Tasmanian farmers. 
Opposition members interjecting—
—I thought the honourable member may have liked a response to the comments that he made. He raised a number of concerns in relation to farmers in Tasmania, who he claimed were suppliers to the market milk sector but will not receive assistance under this package, and indeed there are some suppliers in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia who may also meet these criteria. Those producers do not qualify because of the arrangements under the old DMS scheme—the scheme lauded, I might add, by the shadow minister as having been put in place by Labor when they were in office. The reality is that the Tasmanian state government and the Tasmanian industry chose a pooling system in that state which meant that the farmers that the honourable member was talking about were beneficiaries under the old DMS scheme. Under the adjustment arrangements, naturally they would be double-dipping if they were to receive the adjustment payments as well as the old DMS payments. Those rules are consistent with this package, as applied to the previous one.
This legislation provides an additional $140 million of federal assistance for dairy farmers in those communities that have been most affected by deregulation. We have had to provide this additional money because we have given up hope that the Labor state governments will ever meet their obligations to the dairy farmers in those states. The dairy farmers have just about given up any hope that Labor will provide the compensation for quotas that they were asked for and which was very much part of the package that was put to the federal government when we agreed to provide adjustment assistance. Labor have failed to meet their obligations. A range of state budgets have come down over recent days, once again failing to meet their obligations. This additional package, therefore, is targeted to those most in need—as I mentioned earlier, particularly in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland.
Of this new assistance, $100 million will go in payments to dairy farmers who are most heavily dependent upon the market milk sector; $20 million will go to people because of extraordinary circumstances, because they were excluded from the previous package, because of anomalous circumstances or because the rules were particularly tight and may have affected their unusual situation; and $20 million will go towards expanding the Dairy Regional Assistance Program, which is doing such excellent work in revitalising many of those communities that have been seriously affected by dairy deregulation. These measures will provide further assistance to farmers. They have been warmly welcomed by the dairy industry. 
Whilst nothing can be done to restore the dairy industry to its bygone era—I know there are many who do not wish it to go backwards but want it to go forward and be an outward-looking and progressive industry into the future—this package will help some of those who have been most grievously affected by the states' decision to deregulate their industry. The Commonwealth has helped very significantly. This is the biggest package of assistance ever put in place by a federal government for a primary industry. It has been a monumental effort for the industry and a major initiative—something Labor never did at the state level when they should have, something Labor would never do in the future and something to which many members in the opposition have made clear that they are philosophically opposed. The reality is that we as a government recognise that sometimes assistance has to be provided for industries. We have acted where Labor state governments have failed. Once again, we have demonstrated our compassion and concern for farmers in need. 
Amendment negatived.
Original question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time. 
Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—My time on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2001 is limited due to agreements between the government and the opposition, so I will begin by moving my second reading amendment. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:
(1)   notes with concern that the Government has failed to provide appropriate support for vocational education and training by cutting $240 million from TAFE, and contributing no growth funding for five years, thereby restricting training opportunities and damaging the quality of training; and
(2)   condemns the Government for allowing the Australian National Training Authority Agreement to lapse by:
	(a)	failing to make a realistic offer of funding; and
	(b)	finally offering an amount of funding which is even lower than the amount of previous funding cuts and which fails to adequately address the needs of Australian vocational education and training”.
Many people have heard about the Labor Party's plan to make Australia a knowledge nation. It is our view that, if Australia is to fully take advantage of the opportunities that will open up for us in the coming decade, Australia has to invest more in education, training and research. Only by becoming a knowledge nation will we be able to ensure that as many Australians as possible have the opportunity for new careers and for a more secure job and to ensure that all children have the chance to study at excellent schools. Many people do not understand that a key part of Australia becoming a knowledge nation is about not only ensuring that we have excellent universities which are carrying out world-class research but developing better schools, ensuring that we have wider access to quality early childhood education and, most importantly, ensuring that as many Australians as possible have access to quality vocational education and training.
I have remarked in this House before that when people of our age left school they did think they could have a job for life. Students who are at school today know that when they leave school they are going to have many different careers. The pace of change in the workplace is such that people have to have the ability to learn different skills to ensure that they are in employment throughout their working life. To have the most satisfying life they will also need the ability to obtain new knowledge and develop new skills at various times during their life, both before and after working employment. If we are to ensure that people do have the most secure job possible, if they are to have the widest possible career choices, then we need to ensure that more Australians have access to quality training.
This is not just about ensuring that as many people as possible have the opportunity to study for an apprenticeship but also about ensuring that people have the ability to upgrade their skills. We need to make more training available so that more workers can upgrade the skills that they have. We need to make sure that the welder in the Illawarra has the chance to do extra training to become a welding inspector. We need to make sure that the storeman in Geelong has the chance to do extra IT training so that they can operate the computers in the warehouse where they work. There is no artificial split between new economy and old economy. We have got to make sure that the Ford workers in the car manufacturing plants have the IT skills so that they can program the pieces of equipment in their factory. It is about making sure that as many Australians as possible have got access to quality training, and it is for that reason that the funding from the Commonwealth government to the Australian National Training Authority is a very crucial part of the role of the national government. 
You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the week before last the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs finally reached agreement with the state and territory training ministers for a new funding agreement for ANTA. The minister for education described this as a `major milestone'. It certainly is, but not in the way the minister tried to imply. It is a milestone because it represents the capitulation by the Howard government in a desperate re-election attempt following five years of pressure from the states and territories for a fair funding agreement for training. The federal government has finally come up with some badly needed funding for vocational education and training, after five years of keeping the VET sector on a starvation diet. This started with the cuts in 1996, further funding cuts in 1997 by the Howard government and a failure to provide growth funding, despite the fact that there was enormous demand, enormous need for many Australians for access to quality vocational education and training.
The effects of the Howard government's policy are outlined in a report to state governments by Dr Vince FitzGerald called Skills in the knowledge economy: Australia's national investment in education and training. Dr FitzGerald's report says that Commonwealth funding for VET has been cut back while the states have maintained steady growth in their resourcing. It also says that despite the increase in state funds the effect of the Commonwealth's cutbacks has meant that the total resourcing for VET has ceased to grow from 1998 onwards. Dr FitzGerald also found that there had been a downward trend evident in funding per student from the mid-1990s, which has accelerated over the last few years. Dr FitzGerald said that the VET resourcing had been so squeezed that quality has been at stake. The damage done by this government and this minister for education and training to VET cannot be repaired simply by now putting back even less money than the government has taken out since it was elected. Cuts to VET since 1996-97 totalled $240 million. This offer, dragged out of the minister, does not even put back the funds that they have cut since they have been elected.
You would remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when the minister first started negotiating this ANTA agreement his initial offer was for absolutely no growth when it was put on the table. Then, after pressure from the states, last December he was forced to increase that offer to a three-year offer of an extra $20 million in the first year, $25 million in the second and $30 million in the third. It says something about the weakness of the South Australian Liberal government that they signed up for that offer. We have a conservative state government that was prepared to sign up for only an extra $75 million over the three years of the ANTA agreement, a decision which only they could explain to the people of South Australia. As a result of the new pressure placed on the federal government by the states other than South Australia, we had the government having to significantly increase that offer to a total of $230 million over three years, which left the South Australian government looking completely stark naked, given the agreement they made earlier in the year.
There is no doubt at all that VET needs to play a fundamental part in developing the country. But the Prime Minister's 2001 offer does not represent some road to Damascus conversion to a belief in the value of education, training and research; it simply represents a desire by the Prime Minister to be re-elected. There is no commitment here to provide better quality training; it is a commitment to try to get himself elected later this year. But what this government and this Prime Minister cannot escape is the actions that they have taken over the last five years. We do not forget the massive cuts to education in the 1996 budget, including a reduction in vocational education and training grants to the states and territories of $66 million; a reduction in ANTA's operating expenses of $13 million; the abolition of the five per cent real growth on the base recurrent TAFE funding, a cut of $91 million; and in the 1997-98 budget a further cut which subtracted a further $72 million from the funding had been provided to the states. This totals $240 million that could have been invested over those lost five years in expanding access to quality training. 
The problems of TAFE were compounded by conservative governments in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and, to a lesser extent, Western Australia. We all know that by the end of 1998, thanks to Jeff Kennett, two of Victoria's largest TAFE colleges were facing insolvency. There have been a number of reviews in each of the states that have sought to reveal the true position of the inadequate funding for TAFE as a result of the policies of conservative federal and state governments.
It is also important to look at the impact that the policies of these governments have had on the quality of training being provided. Many members would be aware of the report carried out by Kaye Schofield in Queensland which found that around 20 per cent of trainees were receiving no training at all under the user choice system so favoured by the coalition at the federal and state levels, which usually involves full on-the-job delivery of training. The report went on to say that this threat to the quality of traineeships, if not remedied, was a threat to the VET system as a whole.
As far as user choice is concerned, federal Labor recognise the importance which employers place on the ability to choose a provider in order to ensure maximum flexibility in meeting their training needs, but we also recognise the rights and needs of trainees to receive quality training. We recognise that the choice is not necessarily just about different providers; it can also be about the range of courses available. We believe that there are some areas of Australia where user choice is not practicable because the population base cannot support both a TAFE campus offering everything which the community expects of it and a range of private providers catering, as private businesses naturally do, to the more profitable end of the market. Labor believe that the needs of employers can be met without putting our TAFE system at risk, while also ensuring that trainees have access to quality training.
There are a number of issues that also need to be dealt with in considering this legislation. It is important that those institutes of TAFE around the country that are providing quality vocational education and training experiences receive the support and resources that they need to provide that quality training. I recently had the privilege of visiting the Box Hill Institute of TAFE, which, under its director, John Maddoch and with the help of the Victorian Labor government, is expanding to provide additional facilities and additional opportunities for training in business and IT. Certainly they are doing some very impressive work down at Box Hill.
The great revolution in funding for VET took place of course under the prime ministership of Paul Keating. It was the Keating government which committed to provide an additional $450 million for just over five years in funding for ANTA and VET. It is in stark contrast to this massive increase in funding for VET that we see the Howard government simply seeking to put back—$230 million, having taken out $240 million. Compare the current government that is not even putting back the total amount that it has cut from VET with the Keating government that put in almost half a billion dollars in ramping up access to quality training for the country. This is important for future opportunities for existing workers as well as young Australians. 
I know there are some TAFE colleges that are working closely with schools to ensure that students who are studying through the VET in schools program or school leavers who are considering taking up apprenticeships are being offered a wide range of experiences in allowing them to choose the right trade for them to take up. Whether it is young people who are looking at careers in the building industry or people who are looking at a career in the automotive trade, it is important that we work at developing new ways to offer quality training experiences to young people both at school and after they leave the school system.
It is also important that in seeking to meet the needs of the country we make sure that we are providing quality training in those industries where it is essential—in areas like IT, for example, where we hear many people talking about the severe shortage of Australians with IT skills. Some of the people skills that are required will require IT graduates. But there are many people with IT skills at the paraprofessional level, people with practical skills in IT, that do not need full university graduate status but require skills that are more relevant and more practical for IT employers. Providing quality training experiences through the national training system is the best way to ensure that those needs of the nation are fully met.
Given that there is an agreement between the government and the opposition to limit our contributions to 15 minutes, I will finish there. I commend my second reading amendment to the House, because it does place on record our concerns about the government failing to offer a level of funding which adequately addresses the training needs of the Australian nation.
 (Mr Hollis)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—I am certain that no-one on this side of the chamber will be supporting the amendment moved by the member for Dobell, seconded by the member for Dickson and written and authorised by the Australian Education Union to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2001. Of course, it is always interesting in these debates to hear contributions from those opposite, because they generally seem to have their heart and soul very much buried in whatever the particular union in question has to say.
In fact, the Australian Education Union came to see me the other week about their national TAFE campaign. I was quite pleased to speak to a representative from one of the local TAFE colleges in my electorate. I am a great believer in the TAFE system and a great believer in the whole concept of further training and the technical and educative advances that people seek for themselves. Some opt in and some do it as a result of an apprenticeship but, either way, there is no doubt that the concept of training and schooling people up to give them skills in the old and new economy is vital. That is why this government has in fact funded this sector at record levels. This is the first time ever that the budget allocation from the Commonwealth to this sector has been over $1 billion. This just goes to show that this government is getting on with the job of providing real opportunities for even more Australians to gain the skills so that they can advance themselves and indeed find a job in the area of professional interest that they may happen to have.
It is always sad in the extreme to hear contributions from those opposite which completely miss the point of what is occurring in the real world and completely satisfy some within the TAFE system, generally those who are active within the union behind the TAFE lecturers, but, of course, miss completely the concept of freedom for employers and indeed employees—those who use the service—to make a choice. It completely misses the fact that there are some superb private and indeed community based providers that are offering real training, giving those who participate in training at those places the sorts of skills that are needed to reach the levels of qualifications that are required. TAFE is facing this competitive regime. 
In my area I have a great deal of faith in the way that TAFE is rising to the occasion. While it is just outside the electorate of Moreton, the namesake TAFE, Moreton Institute of TAFE, has a joint agreement with PARTEC, an education and training institute established by the plastics and rubber technology industry. This particular organisation has gone into Moreton TAFE and said, `Look, we are not satisfied with what you have been churning out. As far as people for our industry are concerned, we want to get the real-life examples to you. We want to provide machinery to you. We will help finance the sort of operation we think you should be undertaking and we will let the professional teaching staff adapt what they were offering to train people suitable for our industry.' There is a perfect example of industry meeting some of the challenges that are always upon organisations like TAFE to keep up-to-date and to keep moving forward.
The Australian Education Union's response to Schofield was reported in the Australian TAFE Teacher in August 2000. They were concerned that the historical TAFE monopoly on apprenticeship training had been broken and that recognised training was now being offered by multiple training providers of variable capability and multiple sites of variable quality. The great problem with that particular point is that, in order to get a certificate, you have to reach a `quality', you actually have to reach a standard. Anybody who is walking around with accreditation in a particular area—whether or not they have been trained at TAFE—all have to meet the same standard. If those opposite want to represent the view that what was and what always used to be must always be in the future, it really is, as I said in my opening remarks, brought about by the organised labour representatives of this whole argument, and that is the Australian Education Union. 
This government, I believe, has a tremendous commitment because of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs himself. David Kemp recently visited my electorate to speak with high school students in particular. I remember very much the fishbowl roundtable—quite an amazing experience—at Clairvaux McKillop College at Upper Mount Gravatt, where the 180-strong senior body surrounded the minister, school principal and me. There were eight representatives of the student body who directly asked questions of, and made statements in a vignette sort of way to, the minister, providing examples of how they were planning their future from a school based apprenticeship basis and sharing their aspirations. We found students who are doing—which they can do in Queensland, thankfully—their senior two years over three years, which allows them the opportunity to go and get work experience. We found a student who had a school based apprenticeship; in other words, they were doing TAFE lessons one day of the week, school lessons in another part of the week and practical work in another part of the week. They were, of course, growing as young people into the profession of their choice. They were learning about life and gaining the skills that they needed.
That is the sort of flexibility that this government has encouraged in the training system. Let's face it, the parlous circumstance of apprenticeships that we found when we came to office had to be addressed—and it has been addressed, in great numbers, by this government in the five and a bit years that we have been in office. We in fact now have 300,000 Australians in new apprenticeships. National Centre for Vocational Educational Research data showed that there was an estimated 303,390 new apprentices in training as at 31 March 2001. That is a record number and more than twice the number of apprenticeships in 1995. That figure alone absolutely underscores the hypocrisy of the opposition—that is the most polite way I can put it after observing the comments made earlier by the member for Dobell—because a record number, more than twice what the Australian Labor Party achieved when they were last in office, shows that there are many more young Australians gaining the opportunity to become the welder at Port Kembla, the process worker somewhere else or the production line worker at the Ford factory at Geelong. For all those examples that the member for Dobell gave, there are in fact twice as many people actively involved in gaining those opportunities. Let's face it, I come across too many examples where, in what I think were pretty standard areas in years past such as toolmaking, there is a recognised shortage of qualified toolmakers in this country. My father was a toolmaker and did his apprenticeship a few years ago now but he was very well qualified. It is frustrating to know that the sorts of things that my father learned when he was in his teens and into his early 20s and the apprenticeship that he had all those years ago have not been afforded to as many Australians as they should have been. Under this government, more and more are gaining that. 
—I am a fitter-welder.
—The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources at the table is a fitter-welder. It is obvious always on this side of the chamber that the workers, the people who have actually gone and done things—have actually been on the factory floor or involved in productive activities—are always on this side of the chamber. We find the academics and the union professionals all too often opposite—all too often. It is that kind of influence from this side of politics in government decision making that is ensuring that the tradition of the apprentice and the fact that more young Australians are given opportunities—in fact, that is part and parcel of what this government is doing—will continue in the overall area of education and training.
The minister was finally able to get agreement with the states just last week, having suggested to the states that there was a cut-off point if they did not reach agreement—they were in fact going to lose some of the opportunity for growth funds. Yes, it was a real carrot and stick approach, and it worked. It is tremendous to see that for 2001 the total sum going into my state of Queensland is $162.65 million, which is a lot of money. The Queensland government have been forced to match the $9.34 million growth. I am pleased that they have been, because the Queensland government are an equal partner in any of the TAFE activities—in fact, they are more responsible because they set so many of the programs that are made available to students through the various TAFE colleges in my area.
There are so many good people who work in the TAFE colleges at Yeronga and Moreton who understand clearly the sorts of things that they would like to be able to do but are greatly frustrated by the lethargic nature of the people at head office who run training and further education in Queensland—the lethargic nature of keeping the curriculum up to date. They are not at all surprised by the fact that private training providers are kicking in and providing what industry wants at a quicker rate than can be the case through the state based system.
The Australian Education Union are apparently circulating flyers around TAFE colleges at the moment. What is particularly sad about their decision to circulate a flyer with only half the story on it—targeting the Commonwealth's contribution to TAFE—is that they are letting the various state governments off scot-free. It is the same as what they did with regard to general education funding. This government has put record amounts of money into assisting state school operations, as well as providing a far better system with a greater sense of justice for the parents who contribute to meeting the cost of sending their kids to poor Catholic system schools in my own electorate—St Brendan's at Moorooka, St Bernard's at Upper Mount Gravatt or St Elizabeth's at Ekibin. The cost of the choice that they make is being better supported by this government. Moreover, parents of students at state schools—my own children go to state schools—now know that they have a Commonwealth government that is in fact meeting the cost of education in those Queensland government schools to a greater level than has ever been the case before.
Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, you are also from Queensland. You understand the hypocrisy that is practised by those members opposite; you understand the hypocrisy that is practised by the Australian Education Union as they use young children to get propaganda to condemn this fine federal government and its efforts with regard to education. I am sure that you would join with me in expressing concern that the TAFE system is now being subjected to exactly the same kind of misleading nonsense by exactly the same union whose sole purpose is to have the member for Dobell as the education minister in a Labor government. It is a would-be Labor government that cannot qualify for one moment where the money is coming from to meet the cost of the obligations that they are making often behind closed doors and behind cupped hands all around this country. The magic pudding economics of those opposite got us into trouble before. When you hear the member for Dobell in here complaining about cuts in the first couple of budgets of this government, every one of those cuts— 
—It is true.
—The member for Dickson says it is true. Member for Dickson, you were in the other place and you—as the then Leader of the Democrats before you swam away to join the Labor ship—had the opportunity to assist this country in a far greater way than you ever did in preventing the sort of debt level that the previous government generated. In fact, every time you hear the word `cuts' of any form to any allocation, the blame for cutbacks is always sheeted home to the Australian Labor Party, because they clocked up a $96 billion debt in the household that is the Commonwealth of Australia. They clocked up this massive debt and left young Australians—people as young as my own children, people who are apprentices today—with the circumstance of debt around their neck. Unless this government had shown the sort of responsible economic management that it had to show to get rid of that debt, and fast, this country would be in a very parlous state indeed. When those members opposite come in here and complain about cuts to government expenditure in the early years of this government, we must remind everybody that the cuts were brought about because of the poor standard of understanding of how the economy works which is in fact evidenced every day by the sorts of questions that are asked of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister by those members opposite.
The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2001 is very important. This bill is about providing record amounts of funding to a very important area, an area that was left languishing under the previous Labor Party, an area that this government has improved tremendously, providing opportunities to well over 300,000 Australians—double what they had in 1995. Despite their massive debt, they never directed into this sector the sort of funds that this government is. Therefore, I am happy to support the legislation and, in doing so, praise the ongoing personal effort and commitment of the minister, Dr David Kemp.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Kernot, Cheryl, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—At the outset, let me say that I have not had a single word of information from the AEU, nor have I spoken to the AEU about any of the comments I intend to make on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2001. I do not need to; I am quite capable of forming my own opinions by wide reading and by looking around with my own eyes at the places I visit as shadow minister. 
When it comes to believing the words of those opposite, I am reminded that the minister we are talking about, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, is the minister who told us earlier that youth unemployment had halved under the coalition government. When this statement was made, youth unemployment had in fact fallen by 0.5 per cent—7,300 people—over five years. If we had taken the minister's assertions at face value, it would have taken another 29 years at the same rate of reduction for his statement to be true. We do see an awful lot of fiddling around and demonising by those members opposite. You never hear them talk about the NFF, ACCI or the Master Builders.  
—Wonderful organisations.
—They never lobby, do they? They never have an opinion! They never put out flyers! It only happens with the old AEU! Let us have a look at the coalition government's record on training. It was Labor that introduced the ANTA agreement back in 1992, because we have a commitment to national frameworks and because we believed that, to get some agreement to move this country forward, it was very important to have some transferable, mobile skills. The first thing the coalition did when they got into government was to slash funding for ANTA. The member for Moreton does not like us to talk about cuts. Of course, it was Labor's fault that the Howard government made the choices that it did in the 1996 budget. In the 1996 and 1997 budgets, $240 million was taken out. Much of this was through the notorious growth through efficiencies dividend, another little piece of coalition ideology. The 1998 ANTA agreement locked in these funding cuts, as it was established at a lower base level of funding. After five years of funding being below what it would have otherwise been, the government have come back with an offer that is $10 million less than what they took out. That is the government's true record on training.
Let us go back and look at this ideology of growth through efficiencies. What was the government's rationale for this? I recall them saying at the time that somehow, magically, by reducing the amount of money they put into training, they could force a more efficient use of resources and create more places at the same time—and that you could do this infinitely, so that is where you could make all these savings. While some commentators and some TAFE administrators have said that some of the disciplines of growth through efficiencies were good for them, it is very flawed to conclude that this kind of underfunding can go on infinitely. What in fact happened was that there was a significant decline in the quality of training—and that is what matters. This was starkly identified in the Schofield reports. If you want to take the coalition's usual lowest common denominator level of measurement of anything, and that is the dollar rate, the hourly expenditure on training declined significantly. In 1996 it was $11.24 per course hour and today it is $9.82 per course hour. That might not be a bad thing if, for this lower price, you were getting a better product or at least an equal product. Unfortunately, as I think the evidence now shows, this has also corresponded to a decline in quality. 
We often hear about household budgets in here; we always look for different ways of doing things. If we can improve ways of doing things, okay, let us do them. But there is a bottom line. You simply cannot keep taking lots of money out and at the same time expect there to be more places and no decline in the quality provided. This government—the evidence is in now—has presided over a policy for dumbing down the quality of education, both vocational and ordinary education, in this country. It has presided over what I call el cheapo training. I see a lot of this in my employment portfolio. Some Job Network providers either fail to offer the kind of training I am talking about or put up only a very minimal version of it as an alternative to quality training. I am pleased to say that Dr Kemp has abandoned his growth through efficiencies policy. Maybe he understands that you cannot get infinite efficiencies. You just cannot—and you cannot get infinite productivity either. He has had to be forced every step of the way to provide any growth money at all to this vital sector. Last year there was not one extra dollar for training provided through ANTA, despite significantly rising demand. This is what I think is the important point. It should not be about playing politics. In March of this year, to stop VET from collapsing, Dr Kemp came to the states—
—What's this?
—We are talking about a national framework, the need for cooperation and the need for sufficient funding for rising training needs in this country. When Dr Kemp came back with his new funding offer, everyone was stunned by its miserliness. His offer would have provided an extra $13 per student per year in the first year and then only an additional $3 per student per year after that. What can you buy with that that is meaningful? 
With an election looming and the states unable to sign up for an agreement that would see TAFE continuing to turn away thousands of students every year, Dr Kemp came back with another offer. This was for an average of $77 million per year over the next three years. People on the other side say that this has been a most generous government. If you look at the value of this offer, it will not go very far to give places to the 45,000 Australians who are turned away from TAFE colleges every year. That is 45,000 Australians who could have had training but probably do not as a result of this. It does not go very far. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, who is at the table, said that ACCI is a wonderful body. It is. And it has called for $130 million a year extra for vocational education and training, just for industry training, to cope with increased demand. It does not go very far compared to ANTA, which has calculated that it needs $150 million a year to keep up with demand. It is not responsible not to keep up with demand and to ignore demand. 
To add insult to injury, the funding was made conditional on states matching the funding. At the beginning we are told: `Oh, it's Labor's fault. We had to make all these cuts. We didn't have any priorities of our own; we just cut everything.' And now it's the states' fault because they have that wonderful bottomless pit of a GST! So the Commonwealth does not have to show the national leadership that is so required if we are to have in place a truly national framework of training. States are now asked to sign up and cough up the money that should have been there in the first place. What I think we can object to most of all is the re-dressing and the rebadging that says, `Aren't we wonderful for giving you back less than the money that we took out in the first place.'
Then there is the matter of user choice. There is so much euphemistic misinformation used by members opposite about choice. Whether it is about public versus independent schools or public provision and private provision of training, there are some fundamentals. There is always a role for public provision because private providers will not go where there is no money to be made—
—Parents have a right to choose.
—and there is a responsibility of governments to make sure not only that that public sector is available but also that it is adequately and appropriately funded. Despite the interjection that it is about people's right to choose, not everybody actually has economic choice. That is why it is the role of government to make sure that there is a strong and appropriately funded public sector, to make sure that that choice is there for those who do not have the same economic choice as those people whom those opposite champion usually seem to. We have seen, in the use of the enrolment benchmark adjustment in education, funding leaving the public sector and finding its way into the private sector. I was very interested to hear the member for Moreton say he thought the TAFE in his electorate was fantastic. That is what you find from those opposite: their one local TAFE is always fantastic but the national system and the funding for that national system is of course not required and not a major priority.
Training is not just about this one-off debate here about this particular amount of money. I think we really need to talk more about a different kind of approach to training—a more seamless approach, a continuum of training—and we need to do a better job of integrating the Job Network.
—That's what Jobs Pathway is about—a seamless approach.
—That only works in one little area. And that was our idea too. I am glad to say that in the budget some steps were taken to address the lack of training in Work for the Dole and the lack of quality accredited training being provided by Job Network providers. The money does not come on stream for at least 16 months, and $800 is only a start. Nevertheless, it does address a major defect that has been out there in the whole training continuum in this country. On top of that, I think the funding model that has been set up means that there is a disincentive for one organisation to refer an individual to another part of the continuum in case it means a lower payment from the government to them. We need to address that. 
Most of all, we really do need to have a nationally recognised training system. This should be the top priority for any government. We are a nation of only 19 million people. We are an innovative, entrepreneurial lot and we should be doing a much better job of ensuring that people can move freely between the states in search of employment or in search of training opportunities without having to go through the most enormous rigmarole of paperwork to have their qualifications recognised.
I want to finish by pointing to the skill shortages in this country. Labor's Workforce 2010 research found that 60 per cent of all new jobs in Australia would require a post-school qualification. This figure is made very stark by the fact that only 40 per cent of the current adult population have a post-school qualification. No wonder there is rising demand. There is huge need—huge, huge need. It is ironic that at a time of rising unemployment there are still so many occupations that cannot fill their positions. It is not because people are job snobs. It is because the vacancies are skilled vacancies that require qualifications to perform. You cannot just turn up and be a chef simply because you have had a bit of practice cooking breakfast. You actually have to have some training as a chef. Australia currently has skilled vacancies in, amongst other things, child care and nursing and for pharmacists, motor mechanics, chefs, hairdressers and nurses, according to the department of employment's latest skilled vacancy survey. That is what our imperative has to be: a training system that responds, and responds as quickly as possible, to these ongoing skill shortages. If we do not, we count the cost in other ways—in higher unemployment.
Labor will pass this bill. We do not want to see TAFE teachers' salaries put in jeopardy or students' schedules disrupted. But at the next election this government will have to stand on its record with regard to training, and I think there will be a lot to be said. The Australian public are very well aware of the longer term consequences of massive cuts to public infrastructure and the consequences that has for delivery of service. We have seen tens of thousands of students miss out on courses. The Australian public will not be fooled by a government that comes back five years later and lauds its own generosity for giving back less money than it took out of the system. Dr Kemp's offer does not make up for five years of neglect. More importantly, it does not meet the growth in demand that the vocational sector is experiencing. It does nothing to integrate Australia's training system into one coherent organisation that is responsive to the needs of the jobs of tomorrow.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2001 will give effect to the proposed new Australian National Training Authority agreement for 2001 to 2003. It will also appropriate funds for vocational education and training for the year 2002 and provide growth funding in 2001 and 2002 to the states and territories who have endorsed the ANTA agreement. In the 2001-02 budget it was announced that the Commonwealth would make available to the states and territories, over and above the base funding, $230 million of growth funding for 2001 to 2003. This was contingent on the acceptance of the ANTA agreement by the states and territories. As of 8 June all the states and territories have sensibly recognised the value of this agreement and have agreed to it in principle. It is quite disgraceful to think that the Labor states previously refused to sign up to the previous Commonwealth offers of funding. While they may have been scoring very cheap political points, they were actually placing at risk the skill level that the previous speaker, the member for Dickson, said that she was so concerned about. By choosing to play party politics, they actually showed that they had little interest in or regard for the people that they were claiming to represent, jeopardising—and in some cases denying—education and training opportunities to those most in need. Frequently, these are young people from areas like the one I represent in regional and rural Australia. 
If the Labor states had rejected the Commonwealth's offer and refused to share in the responsibility for funding growth, they would have forgone over $206 million in Commonwealth growth funding, money for the funding of extra training places. The government has strong support from industry and the business community, which recognise the necessity and advantages of having a well-funded national training system. Contrary to the assertions that the member for Dickson was making in this chamber—and I was paying very close attention to what she said—the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry stated that they have:
... urged the Federal Government to provide leadership in this important area and they have delivered.
ACCI is not a body that makes comments like that lightly, so I certainly urge those opposite, and in particular the member for Dickson, to pay regard to the accurate statements of ACCI. 
The new ANTA agreement will help create more than 100,000 new training places, including 20,000 new apprenticeships over the next three years. There will be uniform arrangements for registering and auditing training organisations—again one of the points that the member for Dickson was raising in her speech. This is actually being achieved. Young people can be assured that they will have the highest quality training programs available to them.
Another report, released by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research, entitled Australian apprenticeships: facts, fiction and future, found that 90 per cent of new apprentices are employed three months after completion and the participation of teenagers in new apprenticeships increased from 5.7 per cent in 1995 to 7.5 per cent in the year 2000. The national vocational education and training strategy document A bridge to the future: Australia's national strategy for vocational education and training 1998-2003, which was developed by ANTA, states that to improve international competitiveness, to foster economic growth and to increase productivity Australia must build its national stock of skills. Importantly, vocational education and training deals with the training needs of young people making the transition from school to work. VET courses set out with the primary aim of developing the skills, knowledge and attitudes that employers want. One of the primary concerns of the VET field has become how to fit working people to the demands of employers. Importantly, participants in VET courses will develop abilities that employers want and are willing to pay for.
Not everyone has the desire to attend university for higher education, but it must be remembered that those with lower levels of education are more likely to experience unemployment and be discouraged from seeking to undertake further learning and education. Research has shown that up to 15,000 16- to 17-year-olds alone are at risk of dropping out of study or training for life, and that is estimated to cost Australia around $1.1 billion a year. While it is important to quantify that in economic terms, what is far more difficult is actually realising the damage and the devastation that that wreaks on the lives of young people which cannot be measured. That is why vocational education and training programs have been so vital in rural electorates such as mine. As Kilpatrick and Bell noted in their study of vocational education and training in rural areas, establishing VET in rural schools provides an opportunity to assist with the creation and enhancement of links between people living in rural communities. There is enormous potential for developing mutually beneficial partnerships between schools, local businesses and regional and rural industries. There are a number of innovative programs in Australia which have been jointly established by schools, local business and community leaders and which have led to the reinvigoration of local economic activities and the re-engagement of local young people in meaningful work. 
In my own electorate, to just give one very quick example, students from Mansfield Secondary College participated in a vocational education and training project and, of the 16 students taking part, 15 signed training agreements after the successful completion of their training. It is also vital that schools cater for the education and training needs of all of their students—including the 70 per cent who do not go straight on to university—and provide a variety of pathways into the work force. The Commonwealth government is committed to helping provide genuine alternative pathways from school to further education, training and employment for all young people. Schools have traditionally focused on pathways to universities, but the expansion of vocational education and training in schools is an important way of better meeting the employment and career aspirations of many, many students, including those who do not plan to go on to university.
Participation in VET in schools programs and skills based new apprenticeships has gained momentum right across Australia over the last few years with the injection of Commonwealth funding. The number of students undertaking VET in schools programs rose to a projected level of 167,000 in the year 2000, up from around 60,000 students in 1996. That one statistic alone puts paid to many of the negative comments that members of the opposition have contributed in this debate, especially the previous speaker, the member for Dickson. She painted this picture of doom and gloom, when in actual fact the numbers have increased and are increasing and the runs are on the board. It is not important just for a government to be able to get up and brag about how successful the programs have been; it is so important for individual young people and the effect that has on their lives within their own communities.
It cannot be stressed often enough that young people must be given every opportunity to develop the skills and knowledge that will allow them to gain employment and embark on career paths that are both productive and satisfying to the needs of young people. In 2001 there are currently over 1.65 million people undertaking vocational education and training in Australia. This is an increase of over 400,000 since the government took office in March 1996. Again, that is a statistic that cannot be denied and it cannot be overlooked. In terms of individual achievement for young people, it is immeasurable. 
Recent figures released by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research estimate that the number of new apprentices in training on 31 March 2001 was 303,390, which represents an 11.2 per cent increase over the previous year. Wouldn't it have been good if members of the opposition had simply come into this chamber, put their political differences aside and said, `We want to give credit where it is due; we want to acknowledge the fantastic effort that has been made for the benefit of so many hundreds of thousands of young Australians'? I guess that is just too much to hope for. But I must say that that is what the people I represent want to hear, and it would be so refreshing if only it could happen.
To give you some figures from my own electorate, there have been 2,485 New Apprenticeships positions since 1997—and I am very, very proud of that. I am proud to stand here as a member of a government that has placed such emphasis on training and opening up opportunities for the young people in particular that I represent. This figure is just so much better than when the opposition were last in government. As the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has pointed out, apprenticeships were nearly dead when this government took office in 1996, and look at the story today.
This government has now more than doubled this figure and continues with its own commitment to build on the work that has already been done. Recent findings show that almost half of all teenagers in the full-time work force are in an apprenticeship. We could not say that before 1996. Data from the national contracts of training database shows that between 1996 and 1999 there were more than 30 additional occupations in which apprenticeships and traineeships were undertaken—in other words, this is matching what is happening out in the work force with the apprenticeships. It is matching a very fast changing workplace. 
Many of the businesses providing apprenticeship and new employment opportunities are small businesses. The ABS in 1998 found that in 1996-97 small enterprises contributed 508,000 positions, or 53 per cent of total job generation. In 1998, 88 per cent of all apprentice and trainee commencements were attributable to small enterprises. NCVER conducted research that showed small enterprises, and their group training surrogates, are important employers of apprentices and trainees. Further work completed in the United States and Europe has shown that small enterprises continue to develop the majority of employment opportunities, and the Australian data supports these findings. Australia now rates fourth in the world, just behind Switzerland, Germany and Austria, in coverage of the work force by the apprenticeship system. Australia ranks well ahead of countries like Finland, Norway, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. The recent budget announced funding of over $2 billion for New Apprenticeships and incentives, including an additional $1.5 billion in incentives for employers to take on new apprentices and extra incentives for those in rural and regional areas.
I realise that I am about out of time and I will conclude on just one note. The previous speaker, the member for Dickson, talked about the importance of having a seamless approach. Either she has not heard or the opposition is simply wanting to downplay the importance of the Jobs Pathway Program, which specifically targets students at that year 9, year 10 level, which is the most dangerous time for students to fall through the net, leaving school when opportunities are not opened up to them. Vocational education was not promoted in the past. This government, I am proud to say, has changed all of that. It is a very successful story right across, I am pleased to say, my electorate in particular but the nation as a whole. I have no hesitation in supporting the measures contained in this bill.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—I would like to thank those who have contributed to this important debate today. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2001 before the House will amend the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 to give effect to the new ANTA agreement. It will also amend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 to reflect the Commonwealth's commitment of extra funding. This bill is great legislation and, despite what the opposition have had to say, it is all good news. On 8 June all the state and territory ministers with responsibility for vocational education and training met and agreed in principle to the new ANTA agreement, which provides substantial additional funding to the VET sector. In fact, I have been told by more than one source that, at the end of this meeting, there was an outbreak of applause from the ministers present.
—But they weren't applauding David, though. 
—They were; they were very grateful and they were very pleased with the outcome of the meeting—and so they should be. For the first time ever, funding will, under the ANTA agreement, in 2001 exceed $1 billion a year. This staggering amount represents an all-time high for the vocational education and training sector. This bill is about increased funding for vocational education and training and I am delighted to see that that is the case.
However, it seems that, whenever the opposition talks about education, it just talks about the level of funding and not about outcomes and how to achieve the best results. However, this government is also concerned about attention to detail and places great emphasis on outcomes. The opposition has no credibility when it comes to figures. Its reputation in this area has been completely shattered. Last week the Leader of the Opposition—and I do hope the shadow minister did not provide him with the figures—set out to talk down Australia's skills, talents and inventiveness. He used out-of-date and selective data to—and I quote—`paint a picture of a country in deep decline', as Glenn Milne put it in Monday's Australian. As Glenn Milne rightly pointed out, that is not the view of the OECD nor is it the view of other independent bodies. Whenever the opposition talks about funding, it never talks about where the money will come from. It is a bit like the cargo cult or Field of dreams economics mentality of `build it and they'll just come' that Alan Wood wrote about in the Australian yesterday. Instead of dreaming up figures, I suggest opposition members check the report Australian apprenticeships: facts, fiction and future by the National Centre for Vocational Education and Research, which is an independent national vocational education and training research centre and, I would argue, more credible than the Chifley Research Centre. 
The shadow minister and the opposition have talked about quality. There is a story that the opposition should know. DETYA published a report on outcomes for completed traineeships in December last year. The report was titled Completed traineeships: a longitudinal survey of outcomes. The report presented an analysis of the outcomes of 2,000 successful trainees. Of the 2,000 trainees who completed their traineeship in the March quarter of 1997, prior to New Apprenticeships, and who were surveyed for the report, more than 80 per cent were employed one year after completing their traineeship. Almost three-quarters were employed throughout the entire year following completion, and half were still employed by their traineeship employer one year after completion. Most of the completing trainees were overwhelmingly positive about their placement, with nearly all—about 90 per cent in fact—agreeing that the traineeship and the skills provided were valuable. This also diminishes those claims made by the member for Dickson.
The ANTA agreement was a major milestone for vocational education and training in Australia and should be celebrated by all of us here today. Under the agreement, all states and territories will share responsibility for increasing training opportunities. It is about the Commonwealth working with the states and territories in partnership. The economy needs highly skilled people to enable it to be innovative and competitive in a global economy, and individuals need worthwhile, skill-rich career paths. The new agreement will deliver both. Unlike Labor, our concern is for the consumers and clients—not just the providers.
In this year alone the Commonwealth will provide an additional $21.33 million to meet its commitment to maintain base funding in real terms. It will also provide up to $50 million in additional growth funding for those states and territories that have endorsed the new agreement and satisfy its provisions.
The appropriation for 2002 includes up to $75 million in growth funding under the agreement. Indexation for 2002 will be appropriated next year. It also includes some $3.412 million as part of the Australians Working Together—Helping People Move Forward package. In total, the recent federal budget provided more than $72 million extra funding over four years for vocational education and training places for people with a disability and those affected by changes to the income support arrangements under the working together package. This is a very clear signal that the Commonwealth is prepared to play its part in helping disadvantaged people to succeed in the labour market.
As well as helping to increase vocational education and training participation for people with a disability, the funding is intended to provide additional opportunities to help parents return to work and to improve the job prospects of mature aged people. To complement the funding through ANTA for additional places, the budget also provided new funding to the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs for a disability coordination officer program to assist in meeting needs identified in Bridging pathways, the national strategy and blueprint for people with a disability in vocational education and training. Additional to the funding provided under ANTA arrangements is the new training credit scheme that will be funded through the Commonwealth employment portfolio. This is intended to assist unemployed people to meet the up-front costs of participating in mainstream education and training, and remove financial disincentives to participation for this group through the various TAFE fee relief schemes. It is about giving people with limited means a fair chance to take up the training places that are on offer. People who need skills to obtain and remain in jobs are already a priority for the vocational education and training system. In 1999, around one in six people completing a TAFE course was unemployed when they began their training. It is pleasing to note that after their course 88 per cent of the surveyed TAFE graduates were either employed or undertaking further study. 
Vocational education and training is by no means only about helping the disadvantaged. A key element of the new ANTA agreement is innovation. Australia has made considerable advances in competing in the international economy, but it cannot continue to do so unless we foster inventiveness and creativity. Under the new agreement, states and territories will prepare annual innovation strategies. These will include, for example, the states assessment of industry requirements and show the shifts in training effort to support emerging industries, uptake of training packages in information technology and other new technologies, and the development of new links between vocational education and training and industry in cutting edge industry areas. This is an important investment in Australia's future.
Another key element of the agreement is, of course, continued growth in new apprenticeships. Over 300,000 people are now new apprentices. The latest estimate by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research is that there were 303,390 new apprentices in training as at 31 March this year. This is a record number and more than twice as many as there were in 1995. It is estimated that nearly 45 per cent of all teenagers who are employed full time are now employed as new apprentices, providing them with confidence and opportunities for the future. According to the National Centre for Vocational Education, Australia's New Apprenticeships system now represents a bigger share of the labour market than any country except Switzerland, Germany and Austria. We are now well ahead of any other English speaking nation and set to become world leaders as a result of the decisions of this government—not that one would see such an optimistic view if one listened in to what the opposition had to say in these areas. New apprenticeships in rural and regional areas have increased at a phenomenal rate, growing from over 50,600 in December 1995 to over 99,000 in training in December 2000. This is a real boost to the skills development within communities that is fundamental to regional and local development. It is vital that this momentum is not lost. The focus on new apprentices under the new ANTA agreement will ensure that it is not. To back up the continued expansion of this highly successful initiative, the budget provided funding of almost $2 billion over the next four years for New Apprenticeships, including $1.5 billion for incentives for employers and assistance to new apprentices and $318 million for New Apprenticeships centres. It also included $81.9 million for the New Apprenticeships Access program, which helps people to bring their skills up to the standard they need to tackle a new apprenticeship.
New apprenticeships are not the only sector of vocational education and training that has been expanded. There are so many very good stories that one could tell, but I understand that there is a level of cooperation being exhibited in a bipartisan way to ensure that this and other legislation passes through the chamber today, so I just reiterate that this is all good news. It is great for not only the young people of Australia but those who wish to upgrade their skills, those who wish to get ahead in a changing world. Approaches are now being taken to ensure that there is a more national approach—that the states and territories will agree that there will be some common standards so that when people cross borders to work, or for businesses that have businesses in various states, the qualifications will be the same. I commend this bill to the House.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I understand there is an agreement between the government and the opposition that my contribution will be limited to 15 minutes, which I will attempt to stick to. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2001 does a number of things: it seeks to provide base funding for universities for 2003, it implements a number of budget measures, it varies maximum funding levels for a number of years to reflect higher HECS receipts and the Commonwealth superannuation liability, and it amends the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to provide base funding until 2003. It is not hard to understand why the government would not want a proper debate on higher education. First, they tried to debate this bill cognately with the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, and then they bumped it until after two other pieces of legislation. They have no speaker of their own on the bill, other than the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. This bill is going to make a number of changes—
—Are there other speakers on your side?
—If you would like a few more, we can arrange it. The minister does not seem to understand that there was an agreement between the government and the opposition that there would be only one speaker. If the minister is seeking to upset the arrangements, I will speak for my full 30 minutes and then I will ask as many of my colleagues as possible to contribute to this debate. If that is what the minister wants to do, we are happy to meet the minister's intention to have as long a debate as possible on higher education irrespective of the polite requests from the Chief Government Whip, who is a much easier person to deal with than the minister at the table. Here is the Chief Government Whip seeking to come in and rescue the minister. He has administered some caution to the minister at the table, and it is good to see that we are going to stick to that 15-minute time agreement. 
The point we want to make is that there are important issues about the future direction of higher education in Australia, and this bill does not address the crisis that faces higher education in Australia today. Why is it in crisis? This government has cut $3 billion from university funding. That is why the OECD figures show that Australia's university enrolment rate increased at only six per cent from 1995 to 1999, the third lowest and well below the average growth of 23 per cent. It is also the reason why the OECD figures show that Australia was one of only five countries to actually cut public investment in universities and that a reduction of five per cent was the second worst performance in the OECD. So $3 billion has been cut from higher education funding by decisions that have been made by this government. That $3 billion could have funded many extra places in higher education at universities around the country. 
As the government has implemented its 1996 budget decisions to virtually double the HECS fees for Australian undergraduate students, we have seen the Commonwealth's own direct investment in higher education fall quite dramatically. If the Howard government had simply maintained its own direct investment in university funding at 1996 levels, there would have been an extra 21,000 undergraduate places in 1997, an extra 39,000 places in 1998, an extra 45,000 in 1999, an extra 52,000 in 2000 and an extra 54,000 places this year. Imagine how many of the member for Grayndler's constituents could have had the opportunity to study at university if the Howard government had maintained its direct investment in higher education. The people of Caboolture would have had a QUT campus up and running if this government had maintained funding for its own direct investment in higher education at the 1996 levels. It just goes to show what a joke it was for the government to allocate 21,000 extra places over five years in the innovation statement and a little more than 5,000 places in the budget. Those figures are really quite pathetic when compared to the impact of the cuts the government has made to its investment in higher education.
One thing we have learned in all of these debates on education is that you just cannot believe anything that this minister for education says. He is the master blaster for distorting figures. He is the person who is expert at twisting figures to seek to say the exact opposite of their real meaning. There is a good example of that in the newspapers today. There has been a debate about what the staff-student ratios are in Australian universities. They have been worsening quite rapidly, especially in the last five years. We all know that, if you increase the number of students compared with the number of staff, it is that much harder for students to get the quality learning experience they are entitled to at an Australian university. If the number of students in tutorials doubles or if there is massive overcrowding in the lecture halls, it affects the ability of those students to get the education which they deserve. 
The latest DETYA figures show that the staff-student ratios are now around 18 to one; there are 18 students for each staff member. Yet the minister for education has been so misleading that in the last couple of days he has issued a press release claiming that the actual figure is that contained in an incorrect OECD report which claims that it is only 11.8 in Australia. His own press release contains this misleading figure. It must be quite humiliating for the minister to have John Mullarvey, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, write to the editor of the Australian and say, as was published today:
In 2000 there were 552,689 equivalent full-time students in 38 universities being taught by 29,332 full-time staff. Dividing the student number by the staff one results in a figure of 18.84 students for every teacher. These figures are compiled from data collected by DETYA and available to the public.
The minister put out a press release this week claiming that the student-staff ratio is 11.8 to one when his own department's figures prove that it is more than 18 to one. Is it any wonder that no-one believes the claims made by this minister? In fact, the secret cabinet submission in October 1999 had the minister himself stating, `Higher student-staff ratios were fuelling a perception of declining quality.' What the minister refuses to admit in public he confirms in private in the leaked secret cabinet submission—there is an impact because of the increasing numbers of students for each of the staff in our universities.
The problem is that this government is simply not addressing the funding crisis it has created in universities. The reason the minister has not addressed it in this budget or in the last couple of years since that leaked cabinet submission is that this man has a plan in his bottom drawer. This minister still has that leaked cabinet submission in his bottom drawer, and that seeks to deregulate undergraduate university fees for Australian students, introduce a voucher system of funding to study at universities, and replace HECS with a real interest rate loan. The minister at the table laughs and thinks that this is a past adventure that he went on and for which he was slapped down by the Prime Minister after there was such a massive reaction that he was forced to back off. The truth is that—and I am sure every person in the public gallery here today knows this—if the coalition is re-elected in December, even if there is a Labor member in the electorate of Cowper, this minister will be seeking to ensure that that plan in the bottom drawer is back out on the table. This is a minister who has set out on a strategy for five years to starve Australian universities of funding, and then he wants us to believe that the only way to solve the funding crisis is to have universities tax students by massively increasing the fees they would be required to pay.  
This is the minister who has also presided over a reduction of 800 research training places, especially at our newer regional and smaller campuses. That has been a significant reduction in research training places at regional universities. That is why the Labor Party has committed to cut back government advertising to fund an expansion in research training places at regional universities. We will be cutting back wasteful government advertising to create an extra 400 research training places that will be targeted at regional universities and regional campuses of other universities. Our national government is currently wasting $20 million a month on government advertising. The national government has become Australia's largest advertiser. The Prime Minister, John Howard, advertises more than Toyota, Coca-Cola, McDonald's or Kentucky Fried Chicken. Is it any wonder that we can come up with better ways to spend that money? Rather than giving Kerry Packer, Kerry Stokes and the Ten Network $20 million a month in TV advertising, we believe that the government can spend that money in a much better way by investing in the future of Australians by providing more research training places in our regional universities and in the regional campuses of other universities. We also believe that, by providing extra funding to those universities, such as the Southern Cross University, we can ensure that they have better access to communications links at a similar cost to those available to their metropolitan counterparts.
Another issue that is not addressed by this bill is the impact that the GST has had on HECS debts for a million students. There are one million past and present university students throughout Australia whose HECS debts were increased by the CPI on 1 June. Those students will have to repay an extra amount of up to $400 per student because the GST spike is included in the CPI calculation this year. There is an extra two per cent increase in the HECS debt of every past and present university student because of that GST spike. It means that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Prime Minister are reaching into the pockets of those one million students and taking out an extra $120 million over the time that they repay their HECS debts. That is in complete breach of the undertakings that the government gave before the last election that education would be GST free. How can you argue that education is GST free when the minister at the table is taking up to $400 from each student, or in total up to $120 million from those one million students?
The alternatives that we have outlined not only address the need to have extra research training places in regional universities and extra assistance to meet the higher communication costs of regional universities but also to ensure that Australian universities are ready for the future. That is why we are proposing to establish the University of Australia Online. We have two aims with the UAO: to make Australia the world leader in the provision of online education and to have 100,000 Australian undergraduate students studying through the UAO by 2010. There are some academics who say that online learning will never be as good as on-campus study. I say this to them: if you accept that distance education students are getting a quality learning experience when they receive a videotape or a book and every now and again send back an essay, how could you not be getting a better quality learning experience through an online undergraduate or postgraduate degree where you can have regular exchanges of information with the colleagues in your class through online chat rooms and where you can email your tutor or lecturer? That is certainly much more interactive and much more likely to lead to the development of critical thinking. 
By establishing the University of Australia Online, we intend to ensure that more Australians will have access to the opportunity to study at a university. The minister dismisses this with a wave of his hand and says, `Oh well, we've got flexible learning taking place at Australian universities today.' The University of Australia Online is all about offering extra resources to encourage Australia's 38 public universities to keep pace with other competitor countries, or fall behind, and all about Australia being at the leading edge and showing the way, making sure that Australian universities are providing some of the world's best quality online learning experiences. That is what we intend to deliver through the University of Australia Online. For these reasons, I move the following second reading amendment:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:
(1)	reducing government expenditure on universities by $3 billion and shifting the burden onto students and graduates;
(2)	cutting 3,500 research training places, including 800 at regional universities; and
(3)	continuing to work towards total university fee deregulation.”
 (Mr Nehl)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—To facilitate the business of the House, I will not take undue time with these comments on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2001. The government will not be accepting the second reading amendment. We have just heard from the member for Dobell another flow of fantasy about higher education. He is completely out of touch with what is happening in the education system at the present time, and you simply cannot believe a single word that he says about the current state of the higher education system.
The government's policies have led to a considerable strengthening of the higher education system. Its revenues are now at an all-time high, estimated to be $9.5 billion in 2001, which is about $1.25 billion more than they were when this government came to office. So listeners to this debate can readily evaluate the truth or otherwise of the member for Dobell's claims that this government has cut $3 billion out of universities. Its total revenues are $1.25 billion higher than when we came to office, and there has been absolutely no reduction in the level of public support for higher education. Indeed, the level of support for fully funded places has actually increased under this government.
Australia is a leading nation in the knowledge economy. It is a pioneer in putting into place the requirements on which to base an economy—the ideas, the research and the knowledge of its people. Perhaps the best evidence for that is that students are flocking to Australia from all around the world to take advantage of the quality of our higher education system. Indeed, we are the third largest exporter of higher education in the world after the United States and the United Kingdom. So Australia's performance is quite remarkable.
Total Commonwealth expenditure on education has increased some 17 per cent in real terms—that is, in constant dollars—during the time of the Howard government. We are ahead of the OECD average of government investment in university education, in combined government and private investment in university education and in total investment in university research and development. In all of those areas, Australian universities and the Australian government are performing well ahead of the OECD averages. In other words, we are amongst the Western world's leading countries in moving Australia into the knowledge economy. Indeed, since the OECD statistics were released, the government has announced the innovation statement. That has doubled ARC grants, increased infrastructure spending on laboratories and libraries in universities by some $583 million and provided $151 million for 2,000 extra university places a year. In all areas of school—primary and secondary—post-secondary, non-tertiary and vocational education and training institutions, Australia's investment is well ahead of the average levels of investment in the OECD. 
The Leader of the Opposition last week was in the humiliating position of having made a statement about his so-called knowledge nation which was quickly exposed for relying on out-of-date statistics and for failing to find any funding to support the empty rhetoric it contains. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has a plan for Australia—this plan is about the size of a postage stamp. This government has an outstanding record in moving Australia forward. I support the bill and regard this as my summing up to the debate.
Amendment negatived.
Original question resolved in the affirmative.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—Every day with this government we see examples of how they are out of touch. Every day with this government we see examples of wrong priorities. Every day with this government we hear them say one thing, but another thing happens. And literally every day we see examples of policy backflips, with the motivation of either saving the government's political skin or admitting guilt about the mistakes they have previously made. They are out of touch, they have wrong priorities, they say one thing but another thing happens and they have policy backflips. There are plenty of examples, but today, as on most occasions, the ABC is perhaps one of the best examples.
Let us look at those four criteria so far as the government's treatment of the ABC is concerned. Just look at how this government is so out of touch with community concerns about its treatment of the ABC. Today at question time we heard the Prime Minister again essentially refusing to even acknowledge community concerns about the government's treatment of the ABC, refusing to acknowledge community concern about a sustained political and financial attack by this government on the ABC for the past five years. We have also seen this consistently from the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, who refuses to acknowledge community concerns—refusing to such an extent that he now parades those people who publicly articulate those concerns—
 (Mr Nehl)—Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The member for Swan will remove that sign. He has been warned. 
—Literally every day we see Senator Alston, the minister for communications, refuse to acknowledge community concerns about the government's treatment of the ABC. We now even see Senator Alston taking that one step further, essentially articulating that those people who publicly articulate community concern about the ABC are the real enemies of the ABC. So far as wrong priorities are concerned, these were no better articulated than by the Leader of the Opposition in his question to the Prime Minister today: how could a government spend more money on government advertising per month—which was designed to save its political skin and get itself re-elected—than it could allocate by way of additional funding to the ABC per year in the last budget? This government spent $20 million a month on paid government advertising designed to save the government's political skin but gave only $17.78 million per year extra funding in the budget for the ABC. Even that allocation had only one motivation, and that was to save the government's political skin against the rising tide, particularly from rural and regional Australia.
This government's third criterion is saying one thing and having another thing happen. What did we hear the minister for communications, Senator Alston, say in the tally room when the government were elected in 1996? He said, `We will maintain ABC funding.' That was the commitment. And in the coalition's election documents in the run-up to the 1996 election there was an indication of their support for the notion or the principle of independence of the ABC. But what did we see within months of the government being elected? We saw the government, in 1995-96, rip $66 million out of the ABC's recurrent funding, and it was not replaced. With regard to the coalition's theoretical commitment to the principle of the independence of the ABC, we have seen that trampled on on a regular basis over the last five years.
As to the fourth criterion, policy backflips, what did we see today? Today we saw the Prime Minister at the dispatch box at question time. Firstly, he refused to acknowledge community concerns about the government's treatment of the ABC. Secondly, he was mantra chanting and mouthing something that he does not believe in—the independence of the ABC. Thirdly, there was another policy backflip: he made a virtue out of the fact that the government has belatedly awarded the tender for Australia Television to the ABC. Some people interested in the ABC will actually remember that, as a consequence of the government ripping $66 million out of the ABC in 1995-96, we saw a debacle so far as Radio Australia and Australia Television was concerned and a debacle so far as this nation's overseas national public broadcasting was concerned. And we have seen today the government finally acknowledge its guilt in that public policy crime—seeking to redo a good public policy measure when, for the last five years, we have had enormous public policy damage done to our credentials internationally. Every day, in the government's treatment of the ABC, we see these recurring themes continuing. The government is out of touch, it has wrong priorities, it says one thing but another thing happens and it has a policy backflip every day. 
In the last week or so, we have seen Senator Alston engaged in three memorable activities so far as his responsibilities as the minister for the ABC are concerned. Firstly, we saw him try to close down Senate estimates when Labor senators sought to hold ABC management responsible and accountable to the parliament in the normal course of events. For the first occasion in a number of years, we saw the minister responsible for the ABC seeking to close down Senate estimates so that the normal accountability processes could not be embarked upon. Then on Saturday, in the Age, to anticipate the Friends of the ABC rally in Melbourne on Sunday, we saw an article by the minister for communications, Senator Alston, entitled `Exposed: the real enemies of your ABC'. In that article at the weekend in the Saturday Age Senator Alston says: 
The fact is that any threats to the ABC come from a misinformation campaign by the Friends of the ABC.
So these days, if you actually have the audacity to articulate community concern about the ABC and the government's treatment of it, you are described by the minister for communications as a real enemy of the ABC.
Finally we saw a memorable performance, a memorable appearance by the minister for communications on the Channel 9 Sunday program where he was interviewed by Laurie Oakes. Mr Oakes asked him a question about the government's intended reappointment of the chairman of the ABC, Mr McDonald, and Senator Alston had an answer along these lines: it is okay for the chairman of the ABC to engage in inappropriate political activity in the 1998 election campaign but it is terrible and shocking for people interested in the ABC to publicly indicate their concern about the ABC and to exercise their democratic political rights at a public, peaceful demonstration.
—You are verballing him. Use the transcript.
—The minister interjects. I am happy to quote the transcript—I will get to that in due course. So here we see the minister responsible for the ABC seeking to close down Senate estimates to avoid and eliminate accountability and scrutiny of the ABC so far as the parliament is concerned and then bagging those people in the community who might have the temerity to stand up and say that there is community concern about the ABC. What can a government of the day do, so far as the ABC is concerned? There are, if you like, three pillars of responsibility so far as a government of the day is concerned. Firstly, there is the policy approach or the philosophical, intellectual or emotional approach which says that the government of the day has a commitment to the principle of the independence of the ABC. Secondly, there is the commitment of a government of the day to ensure that the independent national public broadcaster is adequately resourced. Thirdly, there is the notion of respecting the independence of the ABC. So, firstly there is the need for a philosophical attachment—
—Order! The honourable member for Perth will resume his seat. I remind the minister that Mr Speaker has issued a general warning. If you wish to remain here to be the second speaker in this discussion, you will be silent now. The member for Perth has the call.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Firstly, you have that philosophical attachment to the notion of the existence of the independent national public broadcaster; then you have the responsibility to adequately resource it; and, thirdly, there is the respecting of the independence of the ABC. How has the government scrubbed up as far as these three pillars of responsibility are concerned over the past five years? When have we seen the government of today out there proselytising about the merits and the virtues of the ABC? When have we seen the government of today out there saying that the ABC is an important institution and an important part of our national cultural values? We do not see that. What we see on a regular basis are indications of paranoia, disregard and disrespect. So there is no philosophical commitment so far as this government is concerned. 
—The minister calls for examples—interjecting, against your urgings, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—I don't need you to point that out. Continue.
—I do not mind the interjections. On four occasions in five days in December of last year, the minister for communications refused to rule out the privatisation of ABC Online, Triple J and ABC Enterprise shops and refused to rule out some of the commercialisation proposals found in the Bales report that would have led to a two-tier ABC where one group of people got one array of content and another group of people who could afford to pay for it got a different array of content. So this government would prefer to see parts of the ABC commercialised and privatised rather than respect the notion of an independent public broadcaster.
Secondly, there is the question of resources. This government ripped $66 million out of the ABC in 1995-96. In the meantime, it has failed to adequately fund the ABC for digital broadcasting, and we have seen those adverse consequences for Radio Australia, ATV and the ABC's programming. In a desperate attempt to save its political skin in rural and regional Australia, we saw the government in the last budget funding the ABC an extra $17.78 million—not making up for the $66 million that it dragged out in 1995-96, and only $17.78 million out of the $40 million that the ABC asked for by way of national priorities at the end of last year. No-one should be under any illusions: the only reason the government gave the ABC those funds was an attempt to save some of its political hide in rural and regional Australia. The consequence of those funding cuts over the past five years has been disproportionately adverse effects in rural and regional Australia, disproportionately adverse effects in the outlying states and disproportionately adverse effects so far as news and current affairs programming is concerned.
I noted today the Prime Minister and the minister for communications trying to make a furphy out of allegations about tied funding. The best two examples of suggestions of tied grants or tied funding so far as ABC funding is concerned were Senator Alston's letter to the Chairman of the ABC, Mr McDonald, when the last triennial funding came around and Senator Alston's cabinet-in-confidence document which was leaked shortly after Mr McDonald became chairman of the ABC. Both of those documents show you that the government of the day would very much love to inveigle itself into the detailed funding disbursements so far as the ABC is concerned. I note that in the minister for communications' press release today he does not put in any of the quotations from me. On 15 May, in the context of the budget, I had this to say on the question of tied funding:
Thirdly, this funding increase may set a dangerous precedent, whereby the Government of the day will effectively direct the ABC as to where it wishes its funding to be spent. This has the potential to undermine the independence of the ABC.
Governments should provide the ABC with an adequate general level of funding. Generally, they should not provide the ABC with funding for specific and selective purposes, except in special circumstances, for example, the transition to digital broadcasting.
Or indeed, for overseas broadcasting—which is precisely what the government have done today, five years after they should have left it alone. 
Third is the notion of independence, of a genuinely independent and genuinely national broadcaster. We have seen for five years this government putting the ABC under financial and political pressure. There is probably no better exposition of that than the commentary by Mr Greg Barnes, the former chief of staff of finance minister John Fahey, on ABC Radio National last month. When he was asked in the course of the conversation about the ABC, he said this. Remember that this is a person who sat around the expenditure review table with Prime Minister Howard, Treasurer Costello, minister for communications Alston and finance minister Fahey. He said:
... I think the real issue is the fact that you do get a little bit of cowering and you're currently getting it because relentless attacks by Ministers in the Government and Board members of the ABC eventually wears with you down. That's the real issue.
That gives the lie to the articulation of the Prime Minister today in question time that the government is walking the walk rather than just talking the talk insofar as the independence of the ABC is concerned. The problem for the Prime Minister and the problem for the minister for communications and the problem for the government is that, when they talk the talk about the ABC's independence and adequate funding, no-one believes them. No-one in the community believes they have an attachment to those important principles.
What are the adverse consequences of all these things that I have outlined? The first and most important one is that, as far as ABC staff are concerned, there is now essentially a climate of fear in the ABC. We have seen the adverse consequences on ABC programming and content. The ABC has given evidence at the Senate estimates committee that it needs to have about 1,000 hours of TV programming in store, but it is now down to 400 hours or less. The adverse consequences are also seen in news and current affairs programming and in programming to rural and regional Australia and to the outlying states.
At the next election the Australian community, insofar as the ABC is concerned, will have a clear choice. They can return the Howard-Anderson government, which is out of touch with community concerns about the ABC and which has the wrong priorities in relation to the ABC. It will spend more money on advertising than on the ABC. It will say one thing about the ABC's funding and independence and do another thing. And, when it gets to that point in the cycle where it wants to save its political skin, it will do backflip after backflip. The Australian community will have a clear choice: if they want a government which will respect the independence of the ABC, they can have a Beazley Labor government. (Time expired)

Leave granted.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Government Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,2001-06-20,"—The starting point of this debate on the matter of public importance is the terms that the opposition have submitted:
The adverse consequences for the Australian community of the Government's sustained financial and political attacks on the ABC.
That is untrue. It is as simple as that. The terms expressed by the opposition in their matter of public importance are a complete falsehood. I will summarise the shadow minister's case in support of the outrageous accusations and allegations contained in the wording of the MPI. His allegations against Senator Alston in terms of his MPI are as follows: firstly, that he closed down the Senate estimates committee hearing a week or so ago; secondly, that he wrote an article in the Saturday Age which was titled `Expose the Friends of the ABC' and, thirdly, that he somehow—and I am not quite sure how—in an interview with Laurie Oakes on last Sunday's Sunday program, excused the chairman's alleged political behaviour but accused the Friends of the ABC of acting in a political way. The member for Perth has only just tabled the transcript of that interview. We have to question why he did not quote from it. But I know why: he was verballing Senator Alston. I need to study that transcript, because I listened to that interview and that was certainly not the explicit meaning, nor the implied meaning, of Senator Alston's answer to Laurie Oakes. So those are the accusations. 
On the other hand, the member for Perth has claimed that, to be sustainable and to be influential, the ABC needs three pillars and that the government has failed on each of them. Let me summarise them. They were that the ABC needs a policy approach which acknowledges its existence and a commitment to its independence, that there has to be adequate resources funding and that there has to be respect for independence, which is really just a repeat of the first pillar.
I want to deal with all of these. They are pretty easily despatched. The first allegation against Senator Alston is that he closed down the Senate estimates hearing. That was a sensible and necessary cooling off period because the thuggery and brutality of Senator Faulkner and of Senator Schacht had got out of hand. There was nobody who witnessed that Senate estimates hearing who did not think that it was a very good idea to adjourn for 20 minutes. The blame—if there is to be any blame for a mere adjournment of 20 minutes after a long day—lies with the Labor Party senators because of their line of questioning and because of the rudeness and arrogance they displayed towards the ABC general manager and staff.
The second allegation against Senator Alston is that he accused the Friends of the ABC of being overly influenced by politics. That is pretty easy to substantiate, because we know that the Friends of the ABC are very heavily influenced by the CPSU, the union of the ABC. How do we know that? Well, we know that the CPSU jointly organises—and I suspect funds—these Friends of the ABC rallies out of entire self-interest. But the real giveaway was revealed by the Australian Financial Review edition of 9 June this year. About the Senate estimates questioning, which had to be adjourned for 20 minutes because of the behaviour of the Labor senators, the newspaper said:
Three Labor senators attacked in rotation falling ratings, restructures of restructures, scheduling upheavals, resignations, payouts, Media Watch, leaked documents, police raids—it was all there.
When Faulkner had worn out one line of questions he would hand over to Chris Schacht and slip back to the public seats for a briefing with the Community and Public Sector Union representative, Graeme Thomson.
So Graeme Thomson, the secretary, was giving the bullets to the Labor senators and they were firing them. This is the same CPSU which, with the Friends of the ABC, jointly organises these rallies which attack the government. I suggest that those sincere and genuine—however misinformed—Friends of the ABC should distance themselves from the handmaidens of the CPSU who seem to be leading them. It is very disappointing to me and to a great many others, particularly in regional areas which depend heavily on and support strongly the ABC, especially its regional radio network, to see the Friends of the ABC captured in this way. This is the same CPSU which has donated $76,000 to the Labor Party over the last two years.
No wonder Faulkner and Schacht were getting their riding instructions from the CPSU; they were merely paying their dues. They were doing exactly what the CPSU wanted, and it influenced their behaviour. The brutality of their performance will live long in the memory of those who watched it. So the second allegation against Senator Alston, as laid out by the member for Perth, collapses down around his ears. On the third allegation, regarding the Sunday program, I would need to study the transcript, which has only just been tabled. Quite frankly, Senator Alston has been completely and utterly misrepresented; otherwise, if there is a smoking gun, if there is an accurate accusation against Senator Alston, the member for Perth would have read from the transcript. 
Let us deal with the three things that the member for Perth claims the government is failing on. The first was a bit general but it was along the lines that there had to be, as a policy, an emotional, spiritual, conceptual commitment to the existence of the ABC. Well, you have got it. We know how valuable the ABC is as a cultural institution, as a disseminator of objective news and current affairs, as an educator and enlightener on arts, science and legal matters—the list goes on. I grew up with the ABC, like everybody else, and took much of my cultural nourishment from it. I cannot say I took a great deal of my spiritual nourishment from the ABC, but many people do. The Compass program on a Sunday night is a very good program and shows much of the religious and cultural diversity of Australia. So if you want it, we will say it—we always say it. And what follows from that is a commitment to the independence of the ABC.
The second thing is adequate funding. Look, this government is funding the ABC $96 million more today than Labor did in its last budget. The only cut to the ABC was the 10 per cent cut in 1996 across all government departments except Defence. The ABC was not singled out. Every government department and agency had to have its funding reduced because of Labor's black hole: a $10 billion deficit. When are the Friends of the ABC going to factor that into the public debate? When are they going to say that it was not just the ABC; it was every government department? Quite frankly, it is cowardly of the Friends of the ABC and cynical of the opposition not to explain that reason. So the idea that the ABC was singled out is completely false.
The third pillar that the member for Perth wants us to build the ABC upon is respect for independence. Well, let me just say this: I do not know of any member of the National and Liberal parties who has had a public statement issued by the Chief Executive Officer of the ABC claiming that there has been opposition intrusion on ABC independence. That is an allegation that Brian Johns, a Labor Party apparatchik and appointee, made against the member for Perth in February 2000. The heading is `Opposition intruding on ABC independence'. The hypocrisy, at worst, and inconsistency, at best, of the member for Perth is breathtaking. I quote from Mr Brian Johns's statement:
I find it ironic that the federal Opposition and others in the name of protecting the independence and integrity of the ABC are intruding on that very independence by seeking a parliamentary inquiry, an inquiry, incidentally, which would follow last week's intensive examination of the proposed agreement by Senate estimates. The Opposition is seeking to intrude on our rights.
So there you have it: the attackers on the independence of the ABC. But the hypocrisy of the opposition attacks on the government knows no bounds on this issue of independence. The member for Perth actually said that the $70 million over four years that we have granted to the ABC in the last budget is somehow tied. The ABC came to the government and made an argument for a number of areas that they believed needed increased funding, and one of them was regional services. So they put it forward. We have not tied the money. But, presumably, if they argued they needed $70 million for regional services, that is where they will spend it. Not like the ALP: in 1998 they went to the election with a communications policy that, yes, did give the ABC an extra $100 million over three years, but it had to be spent in the following ways: $12.5 million, Radio Australia; $19.5 million, Triple J; $78 million for the sole purpose of financing their migration to digital broadcasting. That is from the ALP policy platform 1998, Kim Beazley's `Plan for the nation: rebuilding the ABC'. They tied the funding explicitly, and they are still at it. The Friends of the ABC's Canberra newsletter—this is fascinating—summarises the discussions they have just had with the member for Fraser, a senior member of the Labor Party's leadership group in this parliament. It quoted him as follows: 
Bob McMullan wants a strong and robust ABC—
Who doesn't? We all do. But we want it independent and we want it objective in all of its coverage and all of its commentary. It goes on:
On the key question of funding, Bob was guarded, assuming the Labor Party were to win the election, and sought to get across the message of not to expect too much too soon.
Don't expect too much too soon! How much funding are the ALP going to actually direct towards the ABC? We know Bob McMullan has told the Friends, `Don't expect too much too soon.' Funny, they are saying that to everybody. It is remarkable, isn't it, how they are guarded and hedging their bets? But in the context of this debate about tied funding, he goes on to say:
... his concern about leaving it to the ABC to determine how to spend taxpayers' funds led Bob to argue for a much more direct involvement of the government minister in identifying areas of dedicated funding.
The member for Fraser sought to take a personal explanation. It was gobbledegook; he ducked and he weaved. But now from the Friends of the ABC, who claim to be the natural allies of the ALP—why, I do not know; the ALP are the ones with the track record of interference in independence, as Brian Johns has said; they are the ones with a record of tied funding proposals, which is hitting at the independence of the ABC, according to the member for Perth—we see it is backed up by Mr McMullan. He was not the only one; there were others interviewed for that purpose. We see people like the member for Canberra, Annette Ellis, who is quoted as saying:
She was not completely comfortable with the idea of tied funding—
that is to her credit, but—
she would have fewer reservations if real priorities were the object of tied funding.
The Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro, Steve Whan, is quoted as saying:
He saw himself as possibly accommodating tied funding.
The only person interviewed who rejected the idea of tied funding and sought to maintain the legislative as well as the cultural and social independence of the ABC was the member for Eden-Monaro, Gary Nairn. According to the newsletter, he says:
He did not think the government should dictate too much on how the ABC should spend funds allocated to it.
So he stood up for them. Political interference: this is the oldest furphy. Does the name Rod Cameron mean anything to anybody? Rod Cameron, the Labor Party's pollster throughout the decade of the 1980s, a key strategist, is now still an informal adviser to the ALP. He is a board member. Does the name John Bannon ring a bell?
—It does.
—John Bannon, the former Labor Party Premier of South Australia? Good heavens! He was a member of the ABC. David Hill, former chairman and chief executive officer—
—He was a candidate.
—For which party?
—The Labor Party.
—Good Lord! Surely the ALP in government would not appoint Labor Party hacks to the ABC board and management team! Brian Johns I have already dealt with—also an ALP insider. As for bullying, this is beautiful: Greg Turnbull, a press secretary, a good fellow when he was a journalist in the press gallery, as I remember him, was reported in the Australian on 8 March this year as blasting Mark Willacy, a current affairs reporter with the ABC, by saying that he had `gone too soft' on an interview with the Treasurer. He called him `a sycophant' and `too soft' and he said this, which is quoted in the newspaper:
Wait until we're in government, we've got a long memory.
There is political interference for you! There is an impingement on the ABC's independence! So the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth should be judged by the actions of their henchmen, whether it be Senator Faulkner or Greg Turnbull. The final word on this should go to the last Labor appointee on the ABC board who, on his departure, was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 February this year. He said this in regard to the government appointees to that board: 
Almost without exception the people on that board have the ABC well in front of any political allegiance.
He went on to say that the ABC was not the target of a coalition government for funding cuts. The ALP ask one token question at question time, one question only; if they were serious about the ABC, they should have made it the issue of the day. This is merely grandstanding to the Friends of the ABC in whatever numbers they may have assembled here in Canberra. They talk down the ABC; they do not celebrate the greatness of the ABC and support it in the way that the Liberal and National parties do.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I might say that for those on this side of the House it is a bit rich being lectured by the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation about issues of independence. Talking about independence, this minister has the audacity to stand up and say that, because we have senators in our Senate estimates process who may talk to members of the CPSU, we are somehow totally lacking in independence in the questions we ask because the CPSU give us, the Labor Party, donations. The very minister making these allegations earns more—he makes more money—per year from his ownership of a pub, a gaming facility, in my electorate than the CPSU give per year to the ALP, and he thinks there is no conflict of interest when he is actually handling a piece of legislation that deals with interactive gambling. I must say it is a bit rich to be lectured about independence by a minister who does not see that there is any issue of conflict in that sort of situation. 
However, the matter of public importance that we are debating is this government's sustained financial and political attacks on the ABC. I was disgusted, when I was in question time today, to see how totally dismissive the Prime Minister was of a question asked about funding for the ABC. He could not care less about the community's concerns and really did not deign to answer the question at all. This sort of dismissiveness actually turns to maliciousness with this government, because they have form when it comes to trying to silence their critics. They have real form: for the past five years they have taken every opportunity to silence critics and to withdraw money not just from our public broadcaster but from every small charitable organisation that has dared to say anything against them, such as community legal centres that might bring some sort of action against governments, as they are often wont to do. The government  have been withdrawing funding from the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, AYPAC, withdrawing funding from women's groups, and attacking HREOC when one of the human rights or sex discrimination commissioners has the audacity to disagree with them. This government just cannot handle criticism, so when it comes to the ABC they see it as another opportunity to continue on in their entirely consistent manner and make sure that anybody that might say anything against them is silenced.
The latest disgrace on this front is the attack that the government is making on charities. The Minister for Family and Community Services is seeking to restrict the capacity of charities to speak out and to even issue a press release on any matter without it being cleared 24 hours beforehand by the minister or the department. I am surprised that the government has not been asking the ABC to perhaps run some of their news items past the minister. Perhaps the minister who was previously speaking on this would like 24 hours notice of any issue that might actually be raised on the news. I think it is ridiculous that we get to the stage that the Minister for Family and Community Services is seeking to add gag clauses to the funding contracts the government has with peak welfare groups, such as ACOSS and the Federation of the Homeless, vetting press releases by welfare groups 24 hours beforehand and vetoing material prepared for publication if it contains departmental facts and figures. 
What next? You must wonder about the reason that the government is so determined to ensure that the ABC do not have sufficient funding to be able to be critical of governments, no matter what government it might be. The ABC run news and current affairs programs. They should, as an independent public broadcaster, make sure that we are accountable—that is their job. But you do have to wonder if the reason that the government goes so hard on the ABC and does not worry so much about the other news services is that it can buy its advertising on the other news services. The government does not have to worry about what is said on Channel 9, Channel 10 or Channel 7 because it makes sure that the ads between any of the news items are paid for by it and send its message. That is what we have been seeing for the last week. It has been paying with our taxes millions and millions of dollars in advertising its message, making sure it can say whatever it likes. It does not care what the news and current affairs message is on any other radio and news station because it just buys the ad time in between. That is the government's real concern: it cannot buy any advertising on the ABC; it cannot buy the message that it wants.
We have seen their sensitivity to criticism. The member for Sturt in his absolutely pathetic display in question time today showed yet again just how touchy he can be on these issues. I cannot believe that a member of this House could be worried or offended by a sticker being displayed in this House which reads: `Independent media: simple as ABC'. I think that Mr Pyne may not have learnt his ABC as well as some of the rest of us did. He obviously was not a friend of the ABC as a child and still is not. He did not learn his ABC or his 1-2-3, I do not think, when he was watching Play School. He clearly is the sort of killjoy, the dobber in class, who would want to jump up and turn off the television if everyone else was enjoying Bananas in Pyjamas; he would be the first to turn it off. This government have done a bad enough job in the way they have slashed funding to the ABC, but if someone like the member for Sturt were actually responsible for it I worry what the funding cuts would be like. As the member for Griffith mentioned before, we need not worry about the privatisation of Telstra: he would be privatising Bananas in Pyjamas. He would start with B1 and, if the Nationals agreed to it, he would then be on to B2, and it would just go on from there. I really think that we need to be worried about what this government are up to when members of the backbench can be so offended by a simple sticker that says `Independent media'. That is something that I would have thought everybody in this House supports. 
It looks to me like the member for Moreton might be the second speaker in this matter and, as he comes from the media, it would be disgraceful if he did not stand up and talk about the independent media. Admittedly, he comes from commercial media; he probably knows what it is worth to buy advertising on commercial radio stations, and no doubt he will be telling us about that. Maybe the member for Moreton might be able to shed some light on what it is actually worth to a commercial radio station when a government is out there in the marketplace spending $20 million a month on advertising. What is it that commercial radio and television actually want? How much can you buy for that sort of money, and what can you actually buy? Just a spot? Advertising? Or are there other things that you can buy? The member for Moreton might like to enlighten us on this.
Importantly as well in this debate, one of the things that the government likes to brush over all the time is something that the Minister for Trade has just slipped in in recent times, something that is of great concern to the ABC—that is, his suggestion that our local content rules should be put on the table in negotiations with the US over a free trade agreement. This is something that I find quite staggering, and it is no doubt the type of ill-considered comment that fuels community concern about what happens in trade negotiations, where we know that there are very sensible agreements we need to reach. This content issue, however, is an area where we need to be concerned. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister responsible, the member for Fraser, have already clearly said that we are concerned to maintain our local content rules the way that they currently are.  
I must say that I have a vested local interest in this. Not only is my electorate of Gellibrand home to many Australian actors but it is also the `filming home' of both SeaChange and Blue Heelers. It is something that brings a lot of prosperity to the electorate, and we are very proud that we feature in those TV shows. The actors are very proud that they live in our area, and we would like to do everything to encourage the growth of successful programs and the increase of Australian content. We do not want the government to be constantly attacking the ABC, putting the ABC under pressure, taking money away from them so that they struggle to be able to meet the local content requirements and struggle to be able to do their job properly in a way that we would all like to see. So I hope that this government understands how strongly the community feels about this issue. The importance of our having an independent national public broadcaster cannot be underestimated, and I hope the trite comments that were made by the minister will be improved upon by the next speaker, although I do have some fears that we may just get more of the same.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Government Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—I am actually pleased for the member for Gellibrand that her time has expired. Normally these MPIs really are a matter of `union' importance, and today I would say that it is the MCPSUI—it is the matter of the Commonwealth Public Sector Union's importance. It was a very sad contribution just made by the member for Gellibrand, so I suspect even that union is somewhat embarrassed by her contribution today. 
I have no doubt about the importance of an independent public broadcaster. I actually worked for the ABC for 10 months, so I have a little bit of an understanding of the value that the ABC brings and the sense of responsibility that independent and individual staff members have towards the product that they produce. I am, of course, gravely concerned that during the 13 years of the previous government we saw a disembowelling of what was the ABC. We saw the `Sydney Broadcasting Corporation' evolve under the stewardship of Labor Party member David Hill. When David Hill was in charge of the ABC, we saw in my city and in my state, in Brisbane and in Queensland, ABC facilities being downgraded while the Ultimo centre was constructed and while Sydney became far more important than it should have been in the overall scheme of things. So, in a lot of ways, it is a misnomer to call it the Australian Broadcasting Corporation because of the style of approach that the Labor Party adopted during their time in government and because of their deliberate appointment of David Hill to that position.
What this government has been trying to do is restore some of the Australianness of the ABC. In fact, in meeting the quite legitimate and reasonable request from the ABC for additional funding for regional services, we are in fact restoring and improving the prospect of great growth of ABC services targeting, and also sourced from, rural and regional Australia. You have to understand that, in the ABC scheme of things, anything outside Sydney and Melbourne is regional. So in cities like Brisbane, where TV studios have been mothballed for years, and in major cities like Rockhampton and Townsville where radio and television studios have been essentially mothballed and hardly ever used except by occasional people passing through, I think that there would be some cause for great excitement about what is going on within the ABC.
But the CPSU has infiltrated the once noble Friends of the ABC. I have got to say that I have met with the Friends of the ABC on many occasions, and there are many quite impressive and pleasant people amongst them. But the sad part about it is that they have now been so infiltrated by those who do not want to see the sorts of changes that are taking place in the ABC and who do not want to see the restoration of services and focus back on the whole of Australia, getting outside of the Ultimo Centre. The CPSU has infiltrated the Friends of the ABC to such an extent that you cannot tell them apart. What is worse again is the CPSU's co-sponsoring of rallies, events, propaganda and stickers—and we have seen those opposite blatantly disregarding standing orders today through the use of slogans and so forth in this chamber today. All of those things are jointly funded by a union—a union which contributes heavily to the Australian Labor Party—and there you just see the full circle now being completed. 
It is sad in the extreme that those opposite should get up and try to condemn this government for in fact being part of a process of funding an independent ABC which has made a decision to get its operation outside of the Sydney comfort zone and get more people on the ground in towns like Longreach, Townsville, Geraldton and Albany—towns that I have visited this year as part of this House's Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and the Arts, which has been inquiring into regional radio services and has found shocking things, like the ABC turning off the short-wave service that used to support vast areas of the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate. There are people in Australia who cannot receive ABC radio broadcasts. That is a decision made over a period of years when those opposite were in power. The focus has been on what is good for Sydney must be good for the ABC and must be good, therefore, for Australia. There is a lot more to Australia than what is going on in Sydney.
For those opposite to come in here and try to prevent the change to restore reasonable services, reasonable support in the placement of personnel in country towns—the sorts of things that I understand the ABC management now want to do with the extra funds that we have provided—shows how stupid this matter of public importance debate actually is today. To think that they could term `adverse consequences' as part of the matter before us today! I think I have rather successfully outlined that the adverse consequences of the pre-1996 style of running the ABC gradually, slowly but surely, unpicked the way the ABC used to work, the way the ABC used to provide not simply something being transmitted on relay out of Sydney but faces on the ground, people on the ground. This is something that this government is certainly determined to try to encourage the ABC, through funding, to do. `The sustained financial and political attacks on the ABC' is mentioned in this MPI. The fact is this year we are funding them $96 million more than in the last year of the previous government.
—$96 million. The Chief Government Whip had not heard my first comment. $96 million does not sound anything like a sustained financial attack on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In fact, that $96 million is more than the Australian Labor Party spent in their last year in office. In fact, $70 million will be spent over the next four years to back up ABC management's attempts to get the organisation back out into rural communities.
I have got to say that the ABC in Brisbane do a marvellous job. It is almost loaves and fishes country in the city of Brisbane for the ABC. Their staff numbers have been hacked down. During the time I was at the ABC in 1987—when the Labor Party were in government—we were watching people taking all sorts of redundancy packages, we were watching people being forced out, and at the same time we were watching from Brisbane the bloat of staff numbers in Sydney. So Brisbane was being sacrificed for Sydney. In fact, regional and rural areas all around Australia were being sacrificed for Sydney, and I think that those opposite attempting to try to justify that by condemning the government and its efforts to back reasonable measures to try to get these sorts of things reversed over a period of years is disgraceful in the extreme.
The Australian Labor Party certainly cannot be friends of the ABC. I would say to the Friends of the ABC to break the nexus that is now exposed between you and the Australian Labor Party. Break this nexus completely, because if you had any credibility left as a result of what we now know you would in fact be condemning the history of the Labor Party in government over 13 years. 
—The leadership of friends.
—The leadership of friends need to be purged of the Labor Party links that they now have, those CPSU links that they now have—their $57,000 worth of funding of rallies. There is a lot of pieces of silver caught up in that. After all, if the ALP was a real friend of the ABC, then the Friends of the ABC would not let their friends do what they did to the ABC. We on this side say, `Friends don't let friends vote Labor.' I would say to the Friends of the ABC, `Don't let the ALP get back into government ranks to do what they did in years past,' because of their lack of understanding of the need to properly resource areas beyond the comfort zone of Sydney, beyond the comfort zone of Melbourne—and, for that matter, even places like Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Darwin, which struggled for all of those years as their staff numbers were being cut, as they were having to wind back on local production, as studio cameras were being loaded onto the back of trucks and taken off to Sydney and as studio services were being mothballed.
 You could walk past TV studios in Brisbane and you could look in and see, like Daleks, the leftover cranes that the television cameras sat on. They were just sitting there with little bits of dust on them. People with white coats would go in every so often and oil them and then hop on the plane and fly back to Sydney. This is what the Labor Party did during their time in office to the ABC. They unpacked the Australianness of the ABC. This government is all about bringing the `A', the `Australian', back to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I am pleased to see these sorts of efforts. They are things that I have been very well aware of for many years. As I said, 1987 was when I was with the ABC. It has been going on since that time, and we as a government at least are now starting to address the need to undo the damage done by the Australian Labor Party. The ABC management under Brian Johns said that the Friends of the ABC were an embarrassment to him. They certainly must be an embarrassment today. Their nexus with the CPSU does them no credit at all, nor does the pound of flesh, the many pieces of silver, they take from their Labor Party connections do them any credit either. (Time expired)
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The discussion has concluded.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Government Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—You would think that the last country in the world to bring in a GST would be able to get it right, but not this government. As you know, we have opposed the GST on many grounds but, whether people agree or disagree with the GST, it is not the GST that the people were promised. The government have comprehensively botched the implementation of the GST, and many Australians are suffering as a consequence.
Let us just go to the promises that were made about this GST, because I think that is pretty instructive. The point I want to prove is that not one promise made about it, not one thing said in its favour, has actually been borne out. Take the fact that the government—and the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in particular—claimed that everyone would be a winner under it; that all Australians would be better off under the new tax system. The opinion polling consistently shows that most Australians feel that they are not better off under the GST.
—Have you told Australia about roll-back, Simon?
—I notice that the Minister for Small Business is at the table. He might, instead of interrupting, just listen and do something constructive for his constituency for once. `No small business will go to the wall,' was another great promise that was made by the Treasurer back in May last year. But, since the GST has come in, bankruptcies have increased—by 25 per cent in the March quarter of 2001. 
A third claim made about the GST was that small business red tape would be slashed. I am pleased that the minister is at the table, because he is responsible for this. Remember the promises, Minister—`A coalition government will slash the burden of paperwork and regulations on small business, with our aim being a 50 per cent reduction in our first term in office'? That was John Howard in January 1996. He went on to say that tax legislation had become a tidal wave which threatened to overwhelm small business. When asked in August 1998 if the tax act would be reduced by the introduction of the GST he said, `Yes, it will.' But what do we see? The GST legislation and explanatory memorandum are thicker than three telephone books and already the government's simple new tax has had to be amended 1,800 times. As for the claim about reducing the tax act, instead of slashing small business red tape by 50 per cent the income tax act has blown out from 3,000 pages and will soon be running over 8,500 pages.
Another claim made was that the GST would produce more jobs. The truth? Since the introduction of the GST, the rate of job growth has almost halved and the unemployment rate has risen. Another claim is that, under the GST, the black economy will disappear. But the truth again is that, if you listen to tax experts around the country, they now concede that the black economy has probably increased under the GST. Peter McDonald, National Director of Taxpayers Australia, is reported in the Herald Sun on 18 June this year as saying:
Anecdotally, the feedback we are getting from a number of sources is the black economy is going ballistic.
Another claim is that the GST will not be a tax on a tax. We have the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, saying that the first principle is that you do not impose a tax on a tax. Yet what is the truth? The GST applies to the final retail price of goods and services, which often includes other taxes. Well-known examples of where you get the tax on a tax, despite what the government said, are petrol and other fuels, alcohol and tobacco.
Another claim made of the GST was that all people over the age of 60 would get $1,000. On 25 August 1998, John Howard said:
You get a $1000 savings bonus for all people over the age of 60.
The truth? A total of 40 per cent of Australians over 60 got nothing and a further 10 per cent got less than $50. Then there was the government's attempt to try and meet this promise in the most recent budget, where people were paid $300—$300 in $1,000, 30 cents in the dollar, to try and buy their way out of this broken promise. Even the creditors of the HIH collapse are expecting more than that. Another promise was that pensioners would get a four per cent pension increase. The Treasurer claimed, on 23 August 1998, that social security and veterans pensions would be boosted by four per cent. The truth? The government clawed back two per cent of the four per cent rise in March 2001.
Another claim is that health and education would be GST free—the Treasurer said that on 23 August 1998. But again the truth is that many health and education items are subject to the GST. Education costs such as school uniforms, school shoes, public transport, books and school bags all face the GST. Many health items also attract it, including skin creams, denture repairs, sanitary products, vitamins and minerals. Another claim of the GST was that the Aussie dollar would be worth more. Again, to quote the Treasurer back in 1998, he said that lower costs for exporters will be reflected in a moderately stronger exchange rate over time. Since the GST has come in, the Australian dollar has depreciated significantly.
Another claim about the GST is that nothing will go up by the full 10 per cent. Again, the Treasurer said that in August of 1998. But consumers know that many items have gone up by more than 10 per cent since the GST came in. The minister at the table was asking us to talk about roll-back and polling. The recent Quadrant poll, reported in the Herald Sun on 18 June 2001, shows that 68 per cent believe that most goods and services have increased by more than 10 per cent. 
The other claim made by this government was in regard to petrol prices. `Petrol prices won't increase as a result of the GST,' the government claimed. John Howard, in August 1998:
The GST will not increase the price of petrol for the ordinary motorist.
When the GST was introduced, fuel excise was cut by 6.7c a litre, but the GST added 8.2c a litre. That is what yielded a 1½c hike in taxation, which itself was indexed. Of course, it was the outrage around that broken promise that led to that huge backflip by the Prime Minister on petrol taxation.
I go through these things because what we are dealing with today is more GST roll-back—roll-back forced upon the government because of pressure from the Labor Party but in circumstances in which the roll-back is demonstrated again to be necessary since what people thought they were getting with this GST they have not got. They were misled about the GST, and that list of things that I have gone through demonstrates that nothing that the government asserted about the GST has been proved correct. They should be condemned for it. Nevertheless, we are stuck with the tax as a consequence of the deceit.
It is not just in the general sense that this deceit has been practised, because the business community did not get the tax it thought it was seeking. The truth of it is that the business community was part of the cheer squad for the GST, but it has been left seriously disappointed and frustrated by the botched ineptness of this government in its introduction. That is why the roll-back package in this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001 has been forced on the government, because they just could not get it right. They are not the first amendments that have come from them. Remember that the amendments in this bill, which total 160, take the total number of amendments from the government to their supposedly simple and new system to over 1,800, the figure that I mentioned before. These 160 new amendments cover the areas of GST returns in payments, payments of GST by instalments, substituted accounting periods, correcting GST errors, pay-as-you-go instalments and deferral of due dates. 
But, importantly, the bill before us proposes to enact the BAS backflip package announced by the Treasurer on 22 February this year. It was a package hastily conceived and announced in reaction to the administrative nightmare that was engulfing small business under the original BAS proposals. Of course, we know there will be more to come. There have to be, because there have to be better steps to simplify the collection of this tax. The government just has to get it right, and if it does not we will—
—because this is a botched effort on the part of a government that thought that all it had to do was to pass the legislation through the parliament and the rest would look after itself. This is not a simple new tax and that is what the small business community is finding out. Everyone knows that the GST needs to be made simpler. The government ridicules Labor, and you still hear the Minister for Small Business at the table saying, `Who wants roll-back?' I tell you what, Minister: the small business community in this country wants roll-back, because they want the tax to be made fairer, they want it to be made simpler—and they have told us so because they have welcomed the initiatives that we have announced. Go and ask COSBOA what they had to say in welcoming Labor's initiatives. Labor's initiatives are roll-back to make this tax simpler, and the small business community is very interested and supportive of them.
—I ask the member who is interjecting, `Who disagrees with making this tax simpler?' Does the member for Petrie disagree that we should try and make the GST simpler? Is that what she is saying? Is she opposing measures to make the GST simpler? Is that what you are saying, Member for Petrie?
—You are making it more complex.
—That is not the question. I am asking you: do you oppose making this tax simpler? It is a simple question.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order!
—If you want to interject, at least be prepared to answer. Do you oppose making it simpler?'
—Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will not encourage the honourable member for Petrie to interject and the honourable member for Petrie will cease interjecting.
—Let me make this point: Labor supports making the GST simpler, and it is Labor that is committed to effecting roll-back that does make the GST simpler. The government can ridicule that as much as they like, but we know that we are getting the sympathetic ears of the small business community around this country. The people that disagree are a government that are obsessed about the view that this GST is the best thing since sliced bread, but they are also a government oblivious to the criticism and concerns about the complexity associated with it. I ask again: who is opposed to making the GST simpler? It is only the government that are frustrating this process.
Remember that it was the Treasurer, Peter Costello, who claimed over a year ago that the legislation was fine. He told Neil Mitchell on 24 January 2000:
Well, it does mean that we're not changing the legislation, that we've got it right.  
There goeth the Treasurer back in January of last year saying that there was no need for legislative changes, but he has been in here ramping the amendments up—1,800 we have clocked up now with the meter still ticking—to the simple new tax that he said then required no change. Of course it requires change, because it is a botched implementation, and we are going to continue pursuing that which is necessary to effect its change. But the government still has not got it right and it is the Labor Party that has been forcing its hand. It was Labor that announced—
Government members interjecting—
—You can laugh up there at the back, but I just remind you that it was Labor that first announced the simplification package for the BAS. This was to allow business to choose to remit an instalment based on a simple ratio of the net GST payable over a previous period to the turnover of the firm for the particular quarter. That is what Labor put out last February: let us identify the ratio of net GST remittances based on past performance and give the option to small businesses to apply that to the actual quarter in which the turnover occurs. When we put that out last February, the Treasurer—smart as ever, sharp as a tack—said that it could not be done. He said it was impossible to do and that Labor was just on about some hoax and was raising expectations. But it did not take long. Within a fortnight the Treasurer had been forced by the Prime Minister to turn up at a press conference—I remember seeing him in the blue room—trying to pretend that they had not had to do a backflip—
—He had that lovely smile.
—He had that lovely smile—the smirk doctors had not worked this day. The smirk doctors had obviously failed on this occasion, because there he was— Cheshire cat and all—trying to make out that this was his initiative. The truth is that it was forced upon him; he does not believe in it. Left to his own devices, he would not have done it. But at least the Prime Minister saw the pressure that was building and said, `Well, I'm being told that what Labor is proposing makes some sense. You'd better do something about it,' and so the Treasurer did. But he did not adopt precisely what Labor was proposing and they still have not got it right. The government said that their option was: `Let's give businesses the option of paying for the March and June quarters of this year what their GST remittance was for the December quarter of last year.' Anyone who knows anything about small business would know that the December quarter, in the vast majority of cases, is their biggest quarter. It is the Christmas rush period; it is when sales are high. So the government really was not giving them much of a choice at all. It was saying, `As a simpler method you can choose to pay what in certain circumstances might require you to pay more than otherwise.' We know that many businesses had the downturn in the March quarter, because that was the quarter when we saw the greatest mugging of the economy by the GST. 
Our proposal was to apply the ratio to the actual quarter, so that if the economic cycle of the business turns down in the quarter they only have to pay the appropriate amount. The ratio stays the same but the total remittance goes down because the turnover goes down. It makes sense. It is a flexible application and it is simple. But no, the government could not bring itself to the circumstances of bipartisanship, agreeing with Labor on a sensible initiative. It could not bring itself to doing the proper simplification. As a result, many small businesses have opted to continue with the old system, because to do otherwise will further worsen their tentative cash flow situation. So it is another example of the government having to be forced, kicking and screaming, to do something and then botching it when they get the chance. They are too arrogant to adopt a bipartisan position with us and they are still not listening.
One example of them not listening is a small business in the electorate of Aston. We have heard the government talking about the electorate of Aston a couple of times over the last few days. This is what a previously committed Liberal supporter had to say, and it is quoted from the Herald Sun of 17 June:
But for the first time since he first voted, Mr Ferguson, 53, says he will not vote Liberal at the 14 July by-election.
In case there is any confusion with my friend and colleague sitting at the table with me, this refers to a Mr Michael Ferguson who runs a small business in Bayswater in the seat of Aston. He goes on to say:
`The GST has been a debacle for small business.' Mr Ferguson has had to lay off one in 10 of his staff. `I never realised the GST would change my life so much,' he said.
He then goes on to list the things that hit him under this government. First of all, he was hit with a double taxation because of an overlap between the tax systems. Then there were the long delays in getting refunds from the Australian Taxation Office, which choked his cash flow. Then there was the fall in the Australian dollar against the Japanese yen, the country from which he imports his engines. Then the GST crunched used car prices, driving many car dealers out of business. And then he was also being hurt by second-hand vehicle restrictions, which he was assisted in, interestingly enough, by the member sitting at the table with me, Mr Martin Ferguson. This must have been the Scots getting together to work things out. He was a previously committed Liberal voter, he had his business drastically curtailed because of the introduction of the GST and other initiatives, he got no support from the Liberal Party and he had to turn to the Labor Party for support. This is one of the small businesses in the seat of Aston.
The electors of Aston have another opportunity to continue to send the wake-up call to this government, because the government is still not getting it, even in the wake of the Western Australian election result that saw a Labor government returned, the Queensland state elections that saw the state government of Peter Beattie returned and the federal by-election in the seat of Ryan, vacated by the former Minister for Defence, which Labor won. All of these electors were sending this desperate call to the government through both state and federal opportunities: `Please wake up and fix the problems with the GST.' But they still have not got the message. There is another opportunity with the Aston by-election to send the message to Canberra: `You're still not listening. You're still not acting. There still needs to be simplification. There still needs to be fairness. There still needs to be roll-back of the GST.' 
The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party has listened to the community through the tax debate. Just as with the committee process that we had looking at petrol prices, which came forward with recommendations which we forced the government to adopt and which saw the GST spike flushed out of the petrol pricing arrangements, we established a committee to look at the problems of small business, with the small business community being crushed under the BAS red tape. We were out there with the committee chaired by the shadow Assistant Treasurer, the member for Wills. That committee has had 18 hearings around the country, in every state, with more planned. We have received hundreds of submissions, both oral and written, and we have made recommendations and announcements based upon what we have been hearing. We have not just been consulting and listening; we have been prepared to make changes based on those consultations. 
Out of those consultations, two things keep recurring—two particular areas that need attention: simplicity through a reduction in the compliance burden and the problems associated with cash flow. The consultation process has produced a further simplification model, a proposal that I announced last month at the National Press Club: a further refinement based on what we put out earlier, building on the notion of utilising—giving people the option to exercise—past performance as an indicator of the ratio of net GST remittances. 
—Explain it.
—Think about it in terms of a business. Every business—
—I will, if you can just explain it.
—If the minister wants to listen instead of stupidly—
—Explain roll-back.
—If the minister would just listen instead of blathering, he might be able to understand what we are talking about. By the first year of operation, every business—think of this, Minister—is going to have had a net remittance of GST receipts of somewhere between 0 and 10 per cent. It is the personalised, simplified accounting method, if you need it put in any simpler language. Based on that performance, people should be able to opt to remit that to apply it to the GST turnover for the quarter—to the turnover of the business for the quarter. 
—Provided you don't have roll-back.
—The blatherer continues, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a person not interested in listening. This is the whole point I am making. We are in the middle of trying to explain it to him so even he can understand it, and all he chooses to do is interrupt.
—You need a whiteboard.
—I know that the small business community has given up on you, but let me continue to explain our proposal. What we are saying is this: give them the option of applying that ratio to the quarter in question so that the net remittances of the GST adjust according to the business cycle. We have proposed that, if it can be done in a revenue neutral way, and we think it can, we could be able to get away from the need for an annual reconciliation. Wouldn't that be great? Not only have we got away with getting rid of the quarterly reconciliation which this government insisted on; we are prepared to look at getting rid of the annual reconciliation. 
This is something that the small business community has welcomed, Minister. If you continue to smirk and reject the notion that these things matter to it, again you are not listening. The aim of our proposal is simple: to free small businesses from the nightmare of GST reconciliations in a manner which protects the revenue for the community. The commitment is to do it in a revenue neutral way, and the committee that we have announced will have the task of ensuring that is the case. We think it can be done in a simple way and in a fair way. We will be establishing a specialist GST review committee to advise us on the implementation of aspects of the new option. 
—Not another committee!
—This is the government that established its own Vos committee to advise on the implementation of the GST. Why shouldn't there be the equivalent body to advise on roll-back? Or is there some double standard, Minister? The trouble is that you are trapped whichever way you go on this. You have a mess; you know it needs to be simplified. Labor is putting forward constructive proposals for simplification, and we are prepared to put an expert committee together to guarantee the parameters against which those initiatives are undertaken. That body will advise government on the implementation of the roll-back it will announce before the election, it will provide workable options for further GST roll-back for both the first term in government and beyond and it will ensure that we do not add to the complexity. The basic commitment is to ensure that our commitment to roll-back makes the GST simpler and fairer. The community will have its voice on that committee—unlike this government, which treats members of the community with scant regard, which takes no notice of them. 
At the small business summit run by COSBOA, I also announced another important part of simplification. I think the minister might have even been at the summit. I announced an initiative to try to assist small businesses with some of the cash flow pressures from the GST. The fact of the matter is that a high proportion of businesses are struggling under the new tax system because of slow payment causing major cash flow problems. Small businesses in particular are being squeezed by their major customers. This is an area where government can make an immediate difference. Government is a major consumer of business goods and services. There are certainly concerns about governments being slow payers. It was a Labor government that introduced the 30-day rule for the payment of bills by the Commonwealth. It is this government that has let those standards slip. It has not insisted upon them. Labor will ensure that all Commonwealth agencies comply with the 30-day payment rule.
So there you have the situation where we are dealing with a bill that involves the government being forced to roll back the GST, being forced by the pressure of the Labor Party to do something to simplify the methods by which we collect the GST. We believe it can go further. It is only the Labor Party that is putting up constructive proposals to address this issue. I am astounded that the Minister for Small Business, who is sitting at the table, is not prepared to embrace these measures in a bipartisan way. I think that the small business community deserves better. It has had a bad deal from this government, and it has been a party that has traditionally supported the government as it stands today. But it is also a constituency that has become mightily disillusioned. Labor will continue to work with the small business community to find more effective means by which we can simplify this GST. The business community deserve it, and under Labor they will get it. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—I rise tonight to speak in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001. The bill provides for the simplification of the reporting processes for the GST and pay-as-you-go system. Change is never easy. When the change is momentous, as it was when we moved to the new tax system, teething problems are bound to result. When we think about the million-plus businesses that dramatically changed the way they interact with the Australian Taxation Office and the way they collect and pay their tax, we realise what an enormous undertaking changing to the new system was.
By the same token, the ATO also had a large workload, particularly when we think about the components of the new tax system, including the introduction of a goods and services tax and related wine equalisation tax and luxury car taxes; personal income tax cuts; increased family benefits; the introduction of the pay-as-you-go system for instalments and withholding taxes; new fringe benefits tax measures; the introduction of a savings bonus for older Australians; the introduction of binding oral advice for individual taxpayers with simple tax affairs and simple inquiries; the introduction of the Australian business number and establishment of the Australian Business Register; the introduction of the business activity statement; registration and endorsement of the exemption and gift deductibility status of charities; an extension of the diesel fuel rebate for off-road vehicles; and introduction of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme for certain on-road transport and the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme for regional and remote service stations. 
This was a heavy workload. However, there was no excuse for some of the confusing, complicated and contradictory correspondence which was sent from the ATO to individuals and businesses. I have seen letters three pages long which really only needed to be one page in length, or longwinded letters which indicated that the liability was zero. In the end, some businesses felt like they were being swamped with paper from the ATO. These things did not help the introduction of the new tax system and I think ended up confusing matters and blurring the real issues.
Some examples of the real life issues that were brought to the attention of the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer included a notice of assessment for a diesel fuel rebate sent out by the ATO which looked like an account that needed to be paid. It said on the form, `Please see reverse for important details about your assessment'. On the back of the assessment it listed details about how to pay the ATO. Several businesses paid back to the ATO the diesel fuel rebate they received in their bank accounts. It was not really a notice of assessment but a statement of how much they had been paid. Again, because the paperwork was not clear, it created unnecessary confusion. In other words, instead of saying `assessment', which for every taxpayer meant `this is a bill', it should have said, `This is a remittance advice.' For most businesses, if the ATO had used the simple term `remittance advice', that part of the confusion would have been removed completely.
The second example involved a voluntary payments book, which was sent out by the ATO. After the small business had to phone to find out, the ATO advised that the book was for people who wanted to pay any of their tax in advance. The letter accompanying the book made no reference to its being voluntary. The letter did, however, state that it could only be used for `the tax type for which they are designed'. There was no mention in the letter of the tax type for which the payment was designed. These examples serve to highlight that the majority of problems with the new system were largely administrative and not legislative.
I made contact with some of the larger accounting firms in my electorate, and we sat down around the table and discussed some of the possible positive changes that could be made which would preserve the system but make compliance easier for small business. We came up with a number of suggestions, which I put to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. One of the more important points that were raised was that the standard of correspondence from the ATO needed to be lifted. Many of the suggestions thrashed out at the meeting have been picked up in this bill.
The extension of time required to lodge the BAS is an important change. This bill provides a permanent extension so that the lodgment dates will now be 28 July, 28 October, 28 February and 28 April, which shows the government does understand how difficult it can be over the Christmas and holiday period. Most taxpayers will have the option of the ATO calculating the quarterly pay-as-you-go for them, which will mean that they will not have to calculate income on a quarterly basis. Sole traders, partnerships, companies and super funds with a turnover of under $1 million will have access to this option. Entities paying GST by instalment will only be required to lodge one return for the year, or part of the year, during which they are instalment payers, although instalments of tax will have to be paid quarterly on the same date as the quarterly returns are due. 
Primary producers and other special professionals will have two instalments per year. These taxpayers are subject to income averaging due to the fluctuating nature of their income, and it is viewed that twice yearly GST instalments could enable some of the fluctuations in GST accounting to be smoothed out. To be eligible for two instalments, such people must have had a profit from the relevant activity in the last tax year. I think this will be of particular benefit to small producers in my electorate. When the annual return and quarterly instalments are used, the difference between the amount paid by instalment and the liability calculated in the annual return will be payable at the time the annual return is lodged. For businesses that currently report quarterly, GST payments can now be made on a simple remittance form with an annual information statement. This will need to be lodged with their annual income tax return.
A further option has been introduced for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million. Those businesses will have the option of paying quarterly GST instalments based on the amount adjusted by the GDP factor. Naturally, variation provisions will be available. As every business knows, income and revenue are never constant. In the building industry, in particular, there are ups and downs, and sometimes those ups and downs in the business cycle have nothing to do with profitability. Those businesses that choose the GDP adjusted amount will pay the ATO calculated amount and, in time, the ATO will send out preprinted customised forms. I understand from the ATO that, by removing boxes which are no longer needed, it will endeavour to customise BAS as much as possible for each business.
I am pleased with the IAS changes as well. Taxpayers with investment income of up to $8,000 will be able to pay annually if they wish. They will also have a choice of getting the ATO to notify them of the amount of tax they need to pay. Those taxpayers with investment income of $250 or less have been removed from the new system. Those taxpayers with investment income of more than $8,000 per year will still have to pay on a quarterly basis. However, those individuals can also, if they choose, get the ATO to advise them of the amount of tax payable. These are positive changes.
I received an email from an accountant in my electorate, which states:
I am not aware of a single client taking up the so called easier methods.
By this he means the methods in this bill. He goes on to say:
All stuck to full calculation sheet or derived from accounts. Even more interestingly is, I can't find anyone outside of our client base who has switched.
So, if the compliance is such a terrible thing, why is there such a low take-up rate of the easy options? My suspicion is that this is not an isolated experience. My view is that it is important to allow businesses and taxpayers to have these extra and more flexible options. 
I also want to alert the House to one more change I would like to see made, although it must be made by the ATO at an administrative level and not at the legislative level. I would like to see additional flexibility applied to meat processors, who, because of the way the new tax system was altered in respect of food, have been caught up in a cash flow squeeze. This is because these businesses pay significant amounts of GST on their business inputs while selling products that are wholly or substantially GST free. There is a provision in the pay-as-you-go withholding legislation that could offer substantial relief to these businesses. This provision authorises the Commissioner of Taxation to allow a large withholder who is an employer who withholds in excess of $1 million annually in tax from salaries or wages to pay as a medium withholder. A medium withholder is required to remit amounts withheld from salaries and wages to the ATO on a monthly basis, and a large withholder is required to remit on a weekly basis. This will enable large withholders to better manage their cash flow. Being able to directly offset the pay-as-you-go-withholding amounts against GST credits with monthly accounting for both amounts would provide significant relief to businesses suffering cash flow detriment arising from the implementation of the GST. 
The meat processing businesses in my electorate that have applied to the Commissioner of Taxation to seek access to this provision have had their applications refused. The reason given for the refusal is that the commissioner does not have the discretion to make the change on the basis of cash flow. In actual fact, the commissioner does. The ATO has merely set up a list of criteria which will be applied to this decision. It is my argument that this was not the intent of the legislation. I have looked to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for support in this matter, and I will continue to lobby the ATO for change in this area. This is a matter of great import to the processing sector and the many employees of the processing sector in my electorate. I am determined to assist them to maintain a very healthy industry. The measures outlined in this bill provide additional flexibilities for taxpayers and small businesses, whether or not they take up their options. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001 is just another piece of ad hoc legislation which we can now add to that never ending pile of evidence to show that this is an economically incompetent government which is mean spirited and deceptive and simply cannot manage or understand the real impacts of its own taxation policies.
Since the GST was introduced on 1 July 2000, all we have heard from this government is that the GST is a great relief to the taxpayers of Australia. We have heard how it would reduce red tape for small and medium sized businesses by 50 per cent. We have heard from the government how Australian families would be better off with their tax cuts. And we have heard how the GST would cut down the black economy. As a matter of fact, we have heard a whole range of predictions, myths and untruths from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister about their GST. Who could forget the Prime Minister on radio saying that the price of ordinary beer would not rise by more than 1.9 per cent. We all know what happened there. The Prime Minister said that the price of petrol would not rise as a result of the GST. We also know the truth about that one. But probably the biggest untruth told by this government was that no-one would be worse off under a GST.
Maybe in the Treasurer's and the Prime Minister's own world these predictions and myths about the GST have come true. Maybe, as the Prime Minister sits in his home at Kirribilli House, looking over Sydney Harbour, he thinks to himself, `Everyone is better off thanks to my government's GST.' Well, perhaps those living near Kirribilli House are doing better under the tax package; I am sure they were doing pretty well before and that they will continue to do so in the future. But, if the Prime Minister took his blinkers off and bothered to step outside his comfort zone, he would see that the majority of people live in the metropolitan suburbs of our capital cities. They live in electorates like mine, like the electorates of my colleagues and the electorates of his government's own backbench—even electorates like yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis.
The Prime Minister will, I hope, realise that there is now an overwhelming consensus among the people, the families, the workers and the business community that no-one is better off under this government's GST. The main part of this bill aims to reduce the amount of time that small business owners spend on the much despised business activity statement by allowing it to be lodged annually rather than quarterly. This is something this government was dragged kicking and screaming to do, I might add. It is something that the government said could not be done. This government said it was too difficult. But it was something that we in the opposition have constantly said needed to be acted on, and now.
The Treasurer stood in this chamber only a few weeks before he made the announcement of a roll-back on the BAS and said that the GST was set in concrete. He said that there would be no more changes to the GST package and then started to go on with his ramblings about how unworkable a roll-back would be. We even had the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation—you know: the Coca-Cola man—in this House saying why the tax burden on small business owners could not be eased and why the business activity statements could not be lodged annually. I quote the minister from the Hansard of 6 February this year: 
... you cannot change the tax base and expect to have comparable quarterly figures. You cannot have roll-back and deliver an annual return. You cannot do it ...
That is what the minister said and, despite what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister want to call this piece of legislation, whether they call it streamlining the tax package or just a logical seamless progress, to call a spade a spade, it is a roll-back. But it is not the way we would do it.
The main difference between this government's roll-back and Labor's plan is that Labor's plan revolves around simplicity and listening to the concerns of small business owners in order to make this tax easier to manage, while the government's plans clearly do not do this. This latest roll-back demonstrates just how out of touch the Howard government is with the real needs and concerns of Australians. It took a concerted effort from the opposition and the small business community, and two devastating state electoral defeats of the Liberal Party, for this government to wake up to the red tape BAS disaster it had created.
But do not just take my word for it, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Financial Review's Alan Kohler reported on 27 February that through this roll-back this government has not, as the government claims, decreased the amount of red tape for small businesses by 50 per cent. Instead, Kohler argues, it has increased the amount of red tape for businesses. Kohler wrote:
... the volume of small business red tape has taken three or four steps forward and now one small step back. Far from cutting small business red tape by 50 per cent, the Howard Government has increased it by 50 per cent in net terms.
Kohler argues that seeing that all other taxes, such as PAYG withholding and PAYG instalments, still have to be paid each quarter, most small businesses will continue to keep filling in the BAS each quarter so that they avoid making further reparations or end of year catch-up payments or being charged interest if their quarterly calculations turn out to be incorrect. This, Kohler argues, would result in more red tape and more work for our small business owners. He described this government's decision as the `Great BAS Roll-back'. His article stated that it was:
... the perfect political announcement: it produced ... headlines for a day or two ... but was almost entirely bereft of substance and will actually save, rather than cost money.
It is not the taxpaying small business owners who will be advantaged, mind you, but the Australian Taxation Office. He continues:
The only fly in that ointment is that small-business people are not stupid and generally know a pup when they have been sold one.
The GST is the brainchild of this government, which claims that it is on the side of small business owners but, when it comes to the crunch to help the small businesses out, this government increases their workload, digs into their cash reserves and ruins their chances of making a profit and taking on new employees. This is why we on the Labor side have said constantly that the GST would be a slow burn. The reason we have said it would be a slow burn is that we know about small business. We listen, we understand the concerns of small business owners and we know that it is crucial that small business owners put some cash away for a rainy day or emergencies, and that this creates a safety net for possible future hard times due to circumstances which are beyond their control, such as economic downturns or the prolonged sickness of a valued employee. However, due to the GST, many small business owners have used up their cushion of cash reserves in the first GST instalments so that, by the time the second and third payments have now come around, businesses no longer have these cash reserves. This situation places them in danger of falling on hard times and not having the extra cash reserves that are meant to save them from hitting the wall. 
The government would have you believe that we on the Labor side are all from the union movement and know nothing about small business. I say to the government members that I was a small business owner myself before entering parliament, as were many of my colleagues, and I was still a member of a union. So we do feel that we know the pressures and the stress that a high taxing, unsympathetic and out-of-touch government such as this one can cause for small business.
Every time it made a change to the new tax system, the government made it clear that there would be no further changes. These comments show just how little this government is willing to make the tax easier for small businesses to collect. The Treasurer himself was adamant last year that there would be no more changes to the business activity statement. The Treasurer's repeated mantra—in countless question times and in statements to the media when he was selling the GST—was that there would be no more exemptions to the GST, that the GST would not change and that the GST was set in concrete. It might surprise the Treasurer to learn that this bill makes the grand total of changes to the GST package exceed 1,800 since it was first proposed and voted on—1,800 amendments and changes. So, if the Treasurer wants to come into this chamber with his infamous smirk to ridicule roll-back, it is about time he realised the joke is now on him.
This bill shows that the government belatedly realised that the political cost of being stubborn and only reluctantly allowing exemptions and changes to the GST package, of its bungling of the introduction of the GST and of the BAS disaster was far too high and that something needed to be done. This bill would not have been necessary if the government had delivered on the GST when it meant to stamp out the so-called black economy. It was the crackdown on the black economy that was a major drawcard when the government was running around the country trying to sell the GST. The black economy, or the cash economy, is a major tax evasion loophole, reported to be worth as much as 14 per cent of our national output, or roughly $100 billion per year.
The government has sung its song loud and proud about how it has reformed the tax system and has been able to stamp out things like the black economy and tax avoidance, but the record speaks for itself. In fact, the black economy has flourished under the GST tax system. In other countries that have a VAT or GST system, the evidence has clearly shown that black economies can thrive under consumption taxes—and it looks as though it is occurring here as well. The Daily Telegraph reported on 7 May 2001 that many businesses are offering customers cash discounts to avoid the customer paying, and the business collecting, the GST. Malcolm Farr reported:
A national survey has revealed that since the new tax system came into force last year millions of consumers have received offers of lower prices if they pay cash.
The article stated that 31 per cent of people surveyed by TMP Worldwide had been offered a price with the GST component removed. This government promised a $3 billion crackdown. It said the GST would not stop unreported income but would eventually catch tax dodgers, because it was charged on their basic input, distribution and other basic costs. But this evidence shows that the black economy has already shrugged off the constraints of the GST.
This is a government which is soft on tax avoidance. It slugs ordinary people with its GST, deceives and uses dirty tricks to get the tax package supported by the public and then allows tax avoiders to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. This is a government whose high taxing policy has made life more difficult for pensioners, self-funded retirees, students, the unemployed, workers, families and small business owners, and has failed to stamp out the black economy. 
In conclusion, this bill before the parliament shows that this is a government which is in a desperate panic. It has been out of touch for so long that it has forgotten how to listen. All Australians know that the government has been forced into making changes to make the tax system easier and fairer. Everyone knows they it has tried to copy Labor's policies and that it has failed dismally. This bill shows that this government cannot be trusted to keep its word. Two weeks before it announced the changes to the business activity statement, which are contained in this bill, the Treasurer was in this House ridiculing the very same changes to the BAS which this bill now enacts. The most notable of these changes occurred this year on petrol and on beer, and now we have a backflip on the BAS. The Treasurer was reluctant to legislate all these changes until, of course, he saw the election results in Western Australia and Queensland and in the Ryan by-election. The Treasurer now insists that this is the last change to the BAS/IAS. This is an admission that the coalition does not want to listen to the small business community. It is comments and attitudes like those of our Treasurer that allow small business owners to realise that the Treasurer no longer cares about the concerns of the small business community and their problems with this tax. Labor will continue to listen to these concerns long after the Howard government has lost interest.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—In speaking on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001 this evening, I thought I would throw in some words from perhaps the greatest of philosopher parliamentarians, Edmund Burke, who said in 1775:
To tax and to please,
no more than to love and to be wise,
is not given to men.
I am sure the member for Prospect would agree with me that, 226 years later, Burke's judgment has not been faulted, dare I suggest, with regard to either taxation or love. Nevertheless, while governments require revenue for the provision of public goods, taxation remains a necessary evil. What is incumbent upon governments is to ensure that the taxation collected from citizens is collected in a fair and efficient manner and is in turn spent in a fair and efficient manner. And by `fair' I do not mean the `fairness' that so proliferates the comments of some members of this House. But I refuse to believe that the state confiscation of not only more of one Australian family's income than another's but an ever increasing proportion of that family's income is somehow fair.
Income taxation is a burden on Australians, particularly on Australian families, that ought to be reduced to as minimal a level as is possible. On this side of the House we believe in lower income tax rates, lower company tax rates and lower capital gains taxes. We support the abolition of taxes on financial transactions and taxes on imports and the abolition of excise on petrol. And the community knows that. We have done the hard yards in tax reform.
Prior to the Howard government's taxation reforms, our taxation system was unfair, inequitable and unwieldy. Just cast your minds back to prior to July 2000. Australia was encumbered with an ancient, inefficient, indirect tax system. The burden of tax lay on incomes. Australian families faced income tax rates that applied at 34 per cent after only $20,701, at 43 per cent between $38,000 and $50,000 and at 47 per cent after $50,000. On 1 July 2000 this government cut income taxes by $12 billion, raising the threshold to $6,000, and reducing rates to 17 per cent from $6,000 to $20,000, to 30 per cent from $20,000 to $50,000 and to 42 per cent from $50,000 to $60,000. This extraordinary achievement now ensures that 80 per cent of Australians pay an income tax rate of 30 per cent or less.
Considering all that has happened between then and now, it is vital that we contemplate just how rotten the old tax structure really was. Yes, it was disappointing that the original tax cuts that the Liberal Party openly took to an election were blocked in the other place, and I do hope we will be afforded a future opportunity to revisit this issue. Personally, I believe that it is imperative that future economic reforms in Australia include the further reduction in marginal income tax rates. How long can we, for example, continue to punitively tax the earnings of our most successful professionals and scientists and other achievers? In fact, in last night's debate on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 I sought to make this point, with particular regard to the retention of our best and brightest scientists and researchers in Australia. I was seeking to indicate that it was not only hypocritical but downright negligent for the opposition to cry crocodile tears about the so-called brain drain, while supporting punitive income taxation which would affect our best and brightest. 
The opposition's incredulous position in this regard was highlighted by the contribution of the member for Rankin, who is considered, I gather, to be one of the more moderate members of the opposition and one of the few members of the opposition who is not a reflexive socialist. And, yet, in his contribution to that debate, he dismissed out of hand that the wholesale confiscation of the incomes of professionals, whose expertise is in demand elsewhere, might be an incentive for those professionals to seek employment in more tax welcoming environments. That is a disappointing position indeed, but, as he will no doubt agree, disappointment is relative to expectation. Perhaps he will redeem himself, for I note from the speakers list that the member for Rankin will have the opportunity later this evening to engage in this debate on income tax rates, and I welcome a more spirited, or at least an informed, response to my proposition on lower income tax rates.
While I intimately appreciate the benefits that tax reform to date has brought to Australia, all public policy requires a process of adaptation and reform, and the bill before the House brings into law the changes announced by the government in February this year in relation to GST and PAYG reporting. These changes will allow entities that presently account for GST on a quarterly basis the flexibility to report and remit GST in the present manner—that is, reporting and remitting actual GST amounts quarterly—or to remit quarterly and report quarterly but save detailed information for an annual return, or, if eligible, to pay GST instalments and lodge an annual GST return. Many more taxpayers will be able to make PAYG instalments based on an amount advised by the ATO, rather than through quarterly calculations of instalment income, unless they prefer the present reporting requirements. The bill also allows for special rules for primary producers and other averaging entities or taxpayers such as artists, authors and other professionals, so that they are in fact required to complete only two GST PAYG instalments in each year. As a consequence, their taxation requirements will better match their fluctuating income cycles.
Other changes include the extension of the business and income activities statement deadlines to the 28th of the month after the end of the quarter, with special recognition of the needs of business over the Christmas and New Year periods; the release of entities using substituted accounting periods from the requirement to account for GST monthly; and the allowance for minor GST errors to be remedied in future BAS returns rather than through the completion of an additional BAS. These reforms have arisen from close consultation between the government and small business. This is consultation that has been applauded by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, CPA Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the National Farmers Federation. It will make compliance with the PAYG system much easier for taxpayers and it will both simplify and streamline the GST requirements placed on smaller businesses.
This close consultation is to the credit of the Minister for Small Business, who I am pleased to see is in the House. I am particularly aware of the very real interest the minister has had to ensure that there has been wide consultation. I appreciate the minister's natural affinity with the interests of small and medium sized enterprises, as I have had the opportunity to bring together small business proprietors from the electorate of Curtin to meet with the minister, as he will recall, at a consultative forum in Shenton Park in my electorate in April. The minister met with over 90 local business people and I know they greatly appreciated the opportunity to speak directly to the minister, to tell him of their experiences and their concerns and to discuss their needs. I am aware that those businesses found it to be a valuable opportunity, for the minister listened, he asked questions and the government has responded. 
It is important to note that those businesses who are comfortable with or accustomed to their present reporting and remittance arrangements are not obliged to adopt these changes. I also note that the government's proposed amendments in this bill will ensure that GST registered businesses entitled to claim input tax credits will be entitled to claim full input tax credits for motor vehicles acquired or imported by those businesses on or after 23 May this year. This measure will also apply to some trailers and vehicle bodies that have also been subject to the phasing-in of input tax credits. This further initiative, announced as part of the 2001 federal budget, will be a major boost to Australian businesses and particularly to the motor vehicle industry. It is estimated that, as a result of the bringing forward of input tax credits, the cost of vehicles to businesses should fall by around nine per cent.
It is with some disappointment that I note that the opposition has chosen not to welcome these necessary modifications to tax administration, but has instead signalled that it will seek to make political capital out of undermining good public policy. Already the claim has been made that these changes represent a roll-back of the kind advocated by the opposition. Of course, in the light of day this argument is paper thin. But you have to ask: why was Labor's roll-back so poorly received by taxpayers? Why was roll-back quickly stuffed in a bottom drawer, only to be revived as and when the opposition is stuck for an answer on its non-existent policies? Because it promised nothing and everything to no-one and everyone. But when you filter out the grains of substance from Labor's voluminous rhetoric, `roll-back' means removing the application of GST from certain goods and services and raising alternative taxes to compensate, or, for that matter, to overcompensate, for the resulting lost revenue. In short, it means changing the fundamentally broad based application of GST to goods and services along arbitrary lines to meet the needs not of taxpayers but of the news cycle.
Quite how this reinjection of unfairness into the indirect taxation system equates with the gradual and considered improvement of taxation administration is not immediately clear; nor has it been clarified to date by the contribution of opposition members to this debate. Perhaps they have been too busy talking down the Australian economy. I note their performance has been somewhat flat since the release of the most recent national account figures, which absolutely rebutted the suggestion that Australia might have stumbled into recession, as hoped by the opposition. Those national account figures revealed that, in the March quarter, economic growth rebounded, with seasonally readjusted GDP rising by 1.1 per cent in that quarter and by 2.1 per cent for the year.
The opposition tried to peddle the line that tax reform was leading us into recession. Far from it. The national account figures largely confirmed the cautious assessment of economic performance in late 2000 and early 2001 as resulting from anomalous factors such as the end of the Olympic Games, changes in the construction industry and the transitional impact of legislative reforms. But of particular note is the strong performance in the services sector, given that services were not previously subjected to a tax; and the strong performance in the net exports sector, which has had taxes removed from it. This sector contributed 0.8 per cent to the quarter's growth and helped drive the current account deficit down to 2.8 per cent of GDP. At the same time, inflation remained low and the forecast growth of 3.25 per cent in 2001-02 appears to be accurate.
The opposition have criticised the fact that the government is introducing changes to simplify compliance with the new tax system. The member for Prospect seems incensed that we are simplifying compliance. Well, they would say that, wouldn't they? They do not want small business to have the advantages that will come about as a result of the removal of burdensome taxes, the reduction in income tax rates and company tax rates and the abolition of taxes on transactions, financial institutions duties and the like. The government makes absolutely no apology for seeking to ensure that the taxation system meets the needs of taxpayers. That is what we are seeking to do with these bills. It would be a foolish government indeed that ignored those concerns. We have taken them on board and, as such, I commend to the House Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—Pre-GST, the Prime Minister promised every pensioner in Australia $1,000 compensation because of the GST. He later reneged on that promise. As a result, some pensioners received as little as $1, some received nothing and some received part of the $1,000 he promised and were asked subsequently to pay it back. The latest round of promises, of $300 to offset the GST, is also full of holes. For instance, we had the disgraceful situation where the Minister for Veterans' Affairs wrote to veterans and war widows advising them that they would receive the full $300. As I demonstrated in the House yesterday, he then had his department write and advise an unknown number of veterans and war widows that the minister was wrong and that they would not receive the promised funding. It is interesting that the minister who wrote the first letter did not have the decency or the courage to write the second letter and respond as a man of character would have done. These pensioners will join all other pensioners under age pension age who have been excluded from this very targeted funding of the government. I raise these issues because, as everyone but—
—I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the member for Cowan wants to cast aspersions on another member in this place, there are proper ways of doing that; otherwise I would ask him to withdraw his comments about the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.
 (Mr Hollis)—I think it was used in very general terms; he was not specific. If you insist on it being withdrawn, I would have to put it to the member, but I would hope that we could let it go and let the member continue with his remarks. I really do not think it was a point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for that ruling. I would be more than happy to debate in this chamber that issue with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs if ever he has the courage to come in here and address that issue, but he has not.
—I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Cowan was reflecting on the character of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. There is a proper way of proceeding with that debate. I ask the member to either withdraw his aspersions on the character of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs or to move the proper motion.
 (Mr Hollis)—I would put it to the member for Cowan that, although I gave the ruling, the minister is insisting that the comments be withdrawn.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy to withdraw them, but I do note that the minister had to hide behind the Prime Minister yesterday and behind this minister today. I am not surprised that the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, who is at the table, this minister who has so poorly mishandled the whole HIH issue, is sensitive about the needs of pensioners and battlers in our society! This minister is part of a government that wants to spend millions upon millions upon millions of dollars telling taxpayers how good the government is, yet the moment it is asked to front up and explain or look pensioners and battlers in the eye, it cannot do it—and this minister is just one of many. But I do not want to get waylaid or ambushed by this minister, because I know that he wants to keep me away from the things that I want to talk about in relation to this bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001. 
I want to look at just how this bill is impacting on some of those people in our electorates who really are feeling the pinch of this GST, some of those people who, for instance, did not get a penny of the $1,000 that the Prime Minister promised or those Veterans Affairs' pensioners who did not get a penny of the $300 which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs promised or those people who join others, such as those on disability support pensions, who are getting nothing, and lots of other pensioners under the age pension age who will get nothing from this government and nothing from this Prime Minister. I am very fortunate to have some advice provided to me by Baron John de Clifford from Wanneroo, a very fine part of my electorate. He has been keeping very tight records, very close records, since before the introduction of the GST, and he wrote to me in November 2000:
Subject: The True Effect of the GST upon Pensioners
As a retired professional accountant, i.e. Group Internal Auditor, Western Mining Corporation Limited, for ten years, I was interested to learn of the effect of the GST upon widowed pensioners, me for example.
In order to achieve a reasonable result, I maintained records of income and expenditure for the four months prior to introduction of the GST (namely for the months of March, April, May and June 2000) and compared the results to the four months subsequent to the introduction of the GST (namely for the months of July, August, September and October 2000).
The end result was, unfortunately, far worse than I had ever expected and at the end of October 2000 my net expenditures were $232.12 more, with GST contributing $108.71 to the end result.
He further wrote to me in February of this year:
On 16 November 2000 I wrote to you concerning the effect the GST might have upon pensioners. At the time of writing, however, I was unable to ascertain the true effect because all specific details were not available to me. Now I can positively confirm that during the last seven months since the GST was introduced (from 1 July 2000 up to and including 31 January 2001), I personally have had to pay a total amount of $171.09 extra just for GST alone.
He wrote to me again on 18 June:
Attached please find how the GST has affected a widowed 80 year old pensioner during the period from 1 July 2000 up to and including the end of May 2001.
He also says:
I have summarised the amounts below and have also provided specific details of the attached.
This widowed age pensioner has set our very clearly, under a number of headings, how the GST has impacted on him. For instance, under `Supermarket shopping' he has broken a number of columns up under the side headings of `Coles' and `Rules'. He has the dates. He has the number of purchases that he has made. He has the cost of those items. He has separated them from GST and non-GST items. He has also provided the cost of the GST items along with the non-GST items. He has put in one column the GST tax, in another column the total number of items he purchased, and the total cost. He has done that, as I said, under `Supermarket shopping' broken into `Coles' and `Rules'. He has done it under `Car running', setting out a number of mechanical costs, costs which you could expect to have over the course of a year, things that include new tyres, RAC membership and car licence. Of course, it does not include petrol. If it had, there would have been a far more marked effect. He has also set it out under the headings of `Electricity', `Medicine' and `Telephone', and at the end he has summarised all of his GST expenses: `Supermarkets' $140.73, `Car running' $95.15, `Electricity' $44.44, `Medicine' $7.93 and `Telephone' $89.04. His summary of GST expenses for the 11 months comes to $377.29.
He set these things out very accurately. He appears to be a person who, in accordance with accounting practices, has kept very well tabulated and very accurate figures, and I compliment him on doing so. He shows that for 11 months some of his GST expenses amount to $377.29. Of course, the $300 that he may get from the government if the Prime Minister keeps his word this time will not cover those expenses. But the other thing is this: those expenses will be with him year in, year out; and you would expect them to increase, because the Prime Minister keeps telling us that the GST is a growth tax. However, on the other hand, this $300 is a one-off payment. 
I am also beholden to Mr and Mrs Taylor from Lakelands in my electorate, who have also been keeping track of their expenses. They have sent me some information which they tabulated between 1 July 2000 and 31 May 2001. In the left-hand column of the table they have provided, they show a number of items. The middle column shows the gross cost of the items, and they have included in the right-hand column the GST on those items. For example, for groceries the additional cost, the GST cost, was $85.10. For electricity, the GST was $26.78. For gas and delivery, the GST was $17.10. For telephone, the GST was $37.70. For household insurance, the GST was $20.29. For car insurance, the GST was $30.30. For hearing aid maintenance, the GST was $2.75. For car registration, the GST was $21.68. At the chemist, the GST was $8.12. At the shoe store, the GST was $4.68. At Kmart, the GST was $7.89. And at Big W, the GST was $21.63. 
It is interesting that the big-cost items for people like these are their cars and things like their telephones—and those are the sorts of things that older people rely on. Of course, when you throw in the cost of food, you see just how much this GST has impacted on and hurt seniors and those on smaller and fixed incomes in our community. It is no wonder that the mob opposite are now having to spend millions upon millions of dollars of taxpayers' money trying to complement the thing they do very well in here—that is, to tell everyone how good they are. At the end of the day, when you push aside the camouflage and the rhetoric, what you see is a sad, sorry lot on their way out of government with their tails between their legs, not yet even understanding or realising just how much they have hurt seniors and those on pensions and fixed incomes in our community. The sooner the government bring on the election the better; let us see how good the minister at the table is then.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—I am pleased to join the debate on the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001 to discuss further initiatives of this government to make the streamlined GST and pay-as-you-go reporting processes available to small businesses across Australia. I speak in recognition of this government's good understanding of the needs and aspirations of people who are involved in small business, recognising that the introduction of the new taxation system is the biggest change in Australia's history to the system of collecting revenue to assist in the payment of what government provides to its citizens. It is a change to the taxation system that was long overdue—and was never considered by those opposite, who have a very limited understanding of how revenue is generated, of how it is reported and of spending priorities, evident in their failures over 13 years through borrowing so much—and is a matter that has been part of the government's agenda since taking office 5½ years ago.
The Australian Labor Party over the next couple of months are going to spend a lot of time telling small business, `We will try to make this new taxation system simpler.' They are saying a lot of things to a lot of groups behind cupped hands and behind closed doors, never quite actually giving the final analysis of how they are paying for what they are talking about doing. But one of the things that is very obvious to small business in my electorate of Moreton is that every time the Labor Party in their previous governmental incarnation did anything for small business it cost small business something. Every time the Labor Party say to small business, `We will help you, we will assist you, we will give you something,' further control of their business is lost to government through increased red tape, forms and reporting processes. In one sense, that is fair enough, because if government money is expended one has to account for it. But the big trade-off for small business in doing deals with the devil—the Australian Labor Party—in the past has always been the impost of additional paperwork and additional control demanded by government and government agencies. That is certainly one of the reasons why small business in droves supported the coalition in 1996 and in 1998 and, of course, will do so again before this year is out. 
You have only to look at what the Australian Labor Party did while they were in office to know that these claims are very easily proved. We on this side understand the need to allow business to organise themselves in the way they see fit, obviously understanding that they have a responsibility to pay tax as they earn it and to collect the goods and services tax, which is passed by the Commonwealth completely on to the state governments. Small businesses all around this country are collecting the GST—which, in a lot of ways, is really the general states tax—and giving it to state governments completely to meet the costs of providing police, hospitals, roads and other things.
What the government has done in the legislation before us this evening is to provide for amendments to the tax laws to allow entities accounting for GST on a quarterly basis to have three choices in the way that they report and pay GST. These choices are: all quarterly entities can continue to report, pay and claim GST amounts quarterly; they can pay and claim GST amounts quarterly, report less information quarterly and lodge an annual information report on goods and services tax activities; or they can pay GST instalments and lodge an annual GST return. 
We are simply saying that small business can organise itself as appropriate, particularly the very smallest of small businesses: the one- and two-person operations; the mum and dad businesses—the backbone of this country, the sorts of people who have the capacity, if government assists them by keeping out of their way, to get on with the job and to create more jobs, to grow their business into something larger, to realise something for themselves, to get a return on the investment that they have made—their idea, their aspiration, their perspiration, their hard earned capital, their putting their houses on the line—and also return something to the broad community, to get their family advanced as we travel through the journey of life.
This legislation meets the expectations of small business in that variety of ways, understanding that with such a massive change to a taxation system there was always going to be the need to revisit things, to make these sorts of adjustments, to make these sorts of possibilities available and, best of all, not in the way that the Australian Labor Party are running around the country with this roll-back policy, which we hear about every so often, fashioning their roll-back. The Labor Party will probably suggest that what the government is doing in this legislation is our own form of roll-back, but the big difference between what we are doing and what they are talking about was evidenced just last week by Chris Murphy, the Australian Labor Party's economic modeller of choice, who said that for every $4 billion of roll-back—that is, less GST collected, less money going to schools, less money going for police, less money going for roads controlled by the state governments—we can see interest rates in this country going up one per cent.
One of the things that small business in my electorate remembers very clearly the last time the Labor Party were in government was the 23 and 24 per cent interest rates that they were paying on overdrafts, 17 per cent home loan interest rates and the way that people were not spending, as they were trying to survive the payments on their business and survive the payments on their house. I do not believe any thinking Australian wants to analyse the lack of detail from those opposite, the great rhetorical offerings that are being scattered all around this country currently. When the detail, if it is ever found, is released people will realise that this government has had to take the hard yards to try to bring about a fairer taxation system, a system that encourages people to spend by giving them less tax to pay as they earn it and giving them more pensions so that they can go and spend money. This sort of `encouragement to spend' taxation system that we currently have in this country is one where, if you start fiddling around with it the way of the Labor Party are wanting to fiddle around with it, you are going to have the sorts of problems that we have had in the areas of mixed businesses—businesses that have some GST items and some non-GST items inside their door. 
Every complaint that I have about tax reform as the government has presented it over the last 12 months can be actually sheeted back to the tampering by the Senate with the government's proposals promised at the last election. Every complaint, every complication and every additional burden has in fact been imposed upon people by the efforts of the Australian Labor Party.
—What rubbish!
—I am often having to remind people, and obviously I have to remind the member for Hunter opposite, that the Labor Party's disregard for the government's promised agenda, legislated, delivered in full in this House and passed by this House—the disregard for the government's agenda when it came to the Senate, the tampering and the deliberate bastardisation of the government's attempts—has created complications that have affected a lot of people.
You have only got to look at the way personal income tax scales were not dropped for middle income earning Australians to know that the Labor Party—which does not have respect for the majority of people in this place, supported by the majority of constituents in their electorates at the last election—not allowing the level of reduction for income tax purposes for middle income earners is still hurting a lot of people and is something that this government will continue to try to do something about.
Against all of this not really understanding the small business background, I am astonished to note that the Labor Party last week in my electorate issued some propaganda about a few things to do with packaging and pricing and made a quite startling accusation which I think underscores Labor's lack of understanding of the way business operates. The warning from the Labor Party is to watch for changes over the next six months as retailers may try to retrieve margins that they lost post-GST. What the Labor Party are in fact saying to constituents in my electorate is that local small business operators are ready to cheat and that local small business operators are ready to try to rip off consumers. I think this is a quite distasteful observation by the Australian Labor Party. It does absolutely underscore, as Opposition Leader Beazley said, that Labor is not naturally a party for small business. It does naturally try to create the sort of class warfare kind of suspicion that the Labor Party always has for anybody who has actually done something about getting some capital, some investment and some property and has invested in themselves, creating jobs and running with a good idea in the form of a small business. It does actually underscore some of the reasons why the Australian Labor Party is not fit to govern in this country.
I have a completely different view about small business operators in my electorate, because they are rising to the challenges of change. In fact, most small businesses now are getting on with the job, and the legislation before us today allows them to get on with the job in a number of different ways. I believe, from talking with small businesses in my electorate, that many of them will stick with what they were doing, despite the offerings in this legislation, because they have got their systems in place and they are operating well. Others will take up the opportunity to avail themselves of other reporting mechanisms. In this regard, this government is being completely consistent with its understanding of small business needs. Its response shows that we know that there are different types of small business, different styles of small business and different expectations from different small businesses.
We know that small businesses that have a responsible attitude to running their business properly and ensuring their books are in good order and that have an understanding of the need for organising their cash flow appropriately are doing extremely well as a result of the changes to this taxation system. We know that there are some businesses which are having problems, and a lot of their problems can be sheeted home not only to the way things were manipulated by the Senate but also to the misleading approach of those opposite, who have gone around and blamed everything, including the great plague in 1640, on the introduction of the goods and services tax. They have continued with their scare campaign of four or five years duration, yet straight after this next election the first thing they will do is keep the goods and services tax. What hypocrisy from Labor! But what else would you expect? ",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—It does disappoint me that the member for Moreton is about to leave the chamber, as it disappoints me that the government has restricted the time available to the House to debate this very important bill, the  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001, that is going to deny me the opportunity to speak about some of the bill's other measures, particularly those relating to the IAS. I need to focus on its impact on small business and I intend to do so. 
Never have I seen a government or a member, such as the member for Moreton, in such a state of denial. In the five years that I have been in this place, never have I seen a party in such a state of denial. Let me share with the House a quote on the impact of the GST on small business: 
I'm not sure how many businesses went ... out of business because of it—
the BAS—
but I certainly know that marriages were strained, small business were taken away from ... running their small business ... 
...			...			...
... the Government was sorry for foisting such an “undue burden” on small business ... “It was an unwelcome imposition ... 
The date of the quote: 26 February 2001. The person being quoted: Ian Macfarlane, the Howard government Minister for Small Business. I will give the Minister for Small Business credit for one thing. He has not had too many wins since he became the Minister for Small Business. He was rolled on a range of budget initiatives that the small business community was expecting. He has been ineffective in driving home changes to the BAS. He has been promising for months now that we would see BAS mark 2—you might even describe it as mark 3—but we have seen nothing. But I do give him credit for finally conceding on behalf of the government the damage that the GST has caused small business. It has not damaged every small business. I am happy to say that some have been able to tackle the issue very well—those who were highly organised and had the money to invest in the equipment, including the software, necessary to cope with such massive change. But overwhelmingly small business has been damaged by the GST. 
The member for Moreton says that the only pain which has been inflicted on the small business community is that which flows from the government-Democrat deal in the Senate, not the Labor Party deal. We have only ever had one position on the GST and that is not to have one. 
—Are you going to get rid of it? 
—I am happy to respond to the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation at the table. No, we will not get rid of it, because businesses have invested around $80 billion gearing up for the thing. Would the minister now like us to turn it over? This has involved a whole change in state-Commonwealth financial relations— something that is impossible to undo. But the Labor commitment is to do all it can to roll back the burden on small business. The member for Moreton says that the only pain being inflicted on small business is that which flows from the Democrat-government deal in the Senate. What absolute rubbish. You know that the government is in trouble with the small business constituency when it goes back to interest rates and when it goes back to unfair dismissal. 
Here we were last night in this chamber debating important amendments to the Trade Practices Act—a welcome backflip from the government. The Minister for Small Business came in here to talk about those amendments and all he could talk about for five minutes was unfair dismissal. He knows that that has resonance out there in the small business sector, given the way they have cranked up the issue. When you have got nothing else to say, start talking about unfair dismissal or interest rates. The member for Moreton obviously did not read the assessment by the Australian Financial Review of the comparative economic performances of the Hawke-Keating governments over 13 years and the Howard and Fraser governments over 12 years.  
—What about the 17 per cent interest rates? 
—I know that interest rates were high in Australia at one stage, as they were around the world. The intensive investigations by the Australian Financial Review showed that Labor's economic credibility is very strong and, on a range of economic indicators, was stronger than that of those who sit opposite. But when you are in real difficulty with your small business constituency you run out and tell them that, if the Labor Party is elected to office, interest rates are going to soar. What a lot of rubbish. When you have got nothing else to say, you trot out the rubbish. 
This bill, amongst other things, puts into place the business activity statements package announced by the Treasurer on 22 February this year. It also contains many measures that were not announced by the Treasurer, again highlighting the fumbled approach by the government to these issues. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has pointed out again, these were changes that the government was dragged screaming to. We proposed that small business be given the opportunity to report on an annual basis. The Treasurer said that that could not be done. A short time after, he changed his view and decided that it could be done. 
With the limited resources of opposition, we are putting forward proposals to address these issues. In stark contrast, the government, with all its resources, constantly says that no changes can be made, except from time to time it is dragged screaming on the back of Labor Party proposals. We will continue to put those proposals forward, as the shadow Treasurer did at the National Press Club recently in his response to the budget when he said that Labor would further investigate a proposal which would allow small business the option—I underscore `option'—of accepting a ratio from the Taxation Office which can be simply applied to their turnover to determine their GST viability. I heard the Minister for Small Business on radio saying, `Oh, this is going to be a terrible thing. Small business is going to be paying more than it is liable for.' What rubbish. The government already has a similar proposal under the simplified accounting method: small businesses are already choosing to take a ratio of their GST and non-GST related goods. It is happening already and it works, and it can work in its simplification for small businesses generally.
There are not too many variables involved here. The only possible variable involved which could cause a small business to pay more than it was liable for would be additional expenditure on capital purchases. It might be an additional computer, desk or furniture within the business. It might, indeed, be an additional purchase of petrol, because for some reason the small business proprietor travelled much greater distances in the quarter involved. But Labor's proposal would provide a mechanism for making adjustments to take into account those things. It is a very simple proposal. I suspect, given the history of the government so far, that in the not too distant future it will be agreeing with us—the government will again be adopting Labor's proposal. And so it should, because the small business constituency is screaming for some assistance. 
As I said earlier, the small business constituency was dudded in the 2001-02 budget: no compensation, no simplification, no extensions for the period of immediate write-off for GST related capital purchases and no changes to the many thresholds that take you through the simplified accounting method. These were all expectations of the small business community. It sincerely believed that, having had so much pain thrust upon it by this government, the government might attempt to make up some lost ground and give it some relief. It was very, very disappointed. 
The Labor Party have indicated that they will support these changes. Of course we will support these changes—most of them were Labor's ideas—and we will continue to support any change from the government side which goes some way towards making this very difficult exercise simpler for small business. We on this side will continue to work for more change. Our business activity statement committee continues to consult widely and receive submissions from the small business community. Some very good ideas are coming out of that process. We will continue to hold the government to account. We will continue to hold the government to account on its broken promises—its promise to reduce small business red tape by 50 per cent, its promise that the GST would be good for cash flow and its promise that the GST would be good for small business profitability, ideas now that, if they were not so serious, would be laughable.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—It is my pleasure to rise tonight in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001. It was particularly interesting to hear the comments of the member for Hunter. His speech was not long on any understanding of the issues; it was the normal Labor rhetoric. It was even more interesting to hear how embarrassed he was on the issues of interest rates and unfair dismissal. It is clear by his own admission. He knows what small business have had to say about Labor's track record when it was in government. They remember well the 17 per cent interest rates they had to pay. Usually that was just the beginning; many small businesses had to pay 22 per cent on a very regular basis. The thought of that returning horrifies them. Even though some of them may have complained about completing the BAS, it pales into insignificance compared with what they think about interest rates. If you want to provoke small business, talk to them about your reluctance to support the changes that we want to implement in regard to unfair dismissal. I am glad to see that you acknowledge your vulnerability in that area. You can expect us to continue to talk about that ad nauseam, because that is what people are interested in. You do not actually show that you have got any real understanding of the changes to BAS. You did not even mention it.
This bill shows that this government is listening to small business. It has made the changes. In speaking to small businesses in my electorate and to other small businesses, a significant group have said to me, `I actually find that the GST is working well for me. It helps me to account for my business's cash flow. I have now got it on the computer, I can complete it pretty quickly and it assists me in planning my business.' There is a sizeable group of small businesses who believe that. You know that. I know that the member for Hunter is a fair man, and he would have to acknowledge that it is one of those things that many small business people tell him. They do like it, are used to it and find that it is working well in their own area. Of course, there are those who say, `There's too much paper collection,' and this is what this bill is about: making it simpler for small business and giving people the option of continuing with their quarterly payments and completing the form every quarter or simply having the Australian Taxation Office do it for them. It also sets out penalties for those who underestimate their tax liability. That is the thrust of the bill.
I would have thought that, as the shadow minister for small business, the member for Hunter would be standing up in this House and congratulating the government for listening to small business, for understanding some of the problems that people are having in completing the form, for responding with these changes to the forms and requirements, and for allowing people the option to choose the way they want to go. But, no, we get the tired rhetoric. We also got the interesting admission that they are vulnerable in the two areas of skyrocketing interest rates that were experienced under Labor and the unfair dismissal bill.
In relation to this whole area of roll-back, I believe that the opposition are quite vulnerable. They talk about what they are going to do for small business without actually being able to quantify where the money is coming from. Also I believe that small businesses are starting to count up the cost of the promises that are being made. As the Treasurer has outlined, we are up to, without any problems at all, $4 billion, which is certainly going to push interest rates up, and that is one thing that small business does not want. This legislation is clear evidence that small businesses in my own electorate are being listened to. The Minister for Small Business—the first minister whose responsibilities solely relate to small business that we have had in this House—Ian Macfarlane, the member for Groom, did an outstanding job. He came to my electorate, listened in a roundtable conference to all of the problems being experienced by small business, took on board some of the issues and responded, and some of the changes that we see here tonight are as a result of that listening program. He is doing that right around Australia. 
In relation to the mechanics of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001, there are the questions of filling out the business activity statement and the government's decision to provide three options. That means that you will fill out fewer boxes—you complete only three boxes on the BAS and then lodge an annual GST return. These boxes are labelled G1, 1A and 1B on the BAS statement. Obviously that is important in terms of simplification. The tax office calculates an amount and businesses with a turnover of less than $1 million can choose to pay an amount worked out for them by the tax office and can then lodge an annual GST return to make up any difference or recoup any losses. The amount nominated by the tax office will be based on the business's return from last year. This option is also open to businesses which lodge monthly. However, these businesses must have a turnover of less than $2 million. Appropriate penalties are put in place for those that misuse it. For instance, a penalty will apply if the total instalments for a financial year are less than 85 per cent of the actual amount due for that period. The penalty will be calculated by applying the general interest charge to the GST instalment shortfall. Businesses will be able to continue to report and pay or claim their GST returns quarterly as they were doing previously. It is important to recognise, as I said before, that many small businesses have coped well with the transition to the new tax system.
Kate Marshall wrote in the Australian Financial Review on 9 March as follows:
The transition to the new tax system has generally been smoother for small businesses that have mastered the business activity statement by installing efficient record-keeping systems and exerting the necessary discipline over their records, invoices and GST transactions.
Small businesses that do not want to change do not have to, emphasising the flexibility of this legislation. Of course, these comments are made by independent people from the Financial Review and other papers and they reflect what I am hearing out in the community. The member for Hunter would do well if he reflected some of this as well.
In terms of PAYG reporting, for individuals registered for the GST, such as sole traders and partners, and for small firms and super funds with an annual turnover of less than $1 million, the government is now providing the option of having their quarterly instalment amount nominated for them by the tax office, as I indicated before. The amount stipulated by the tax office will be determined by the individual's previous year's income adjusted by a GDP factor. Briefly, one of the government's amendments to this legislation will also allow PAYG medium sized withholders who pay monthly to pay amounts that they have withheld on the 28th of the following month if another BAS amount is due on the same day. This will give additional flexibility to around 650 medium sized withholders, most of whom are wheat farmers.
There is also an extension of lodgment dates. The bill extends the due date for the lodgment of the BAS forms to the 28th day of the month following the end of the quarter, the exception being after the Christmas break, when it would normally be due on 28 January—that has now been extended to 28 February. That is a very good day—it is my birthday—so I look forward to that particular day. Previously businesses had to lodge their returns on the 21st day of the month following, so it is appropriate that we have those changes. 
Regarding special professionals, the bill will allow certain groups of professionals, such as artists, sports people, authors, playwrights and primary producers—many of the first group live in the electorate of the member for North Sydney; a very fine constituency it is indeed—to make only two GST and PAYG payments each year. This provision recognises the more erratic income flows of professionals in these groups. So again we are not only supporting small business but we are helping the artists who are struggling to establish their own activities. This shows that we are listening to that particular group, particularly the minister at the table, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. 
Further, we have input tax credits for motor vehicles. That is a very popular change recognised by small business and applauded by all of the distributors and retailers of automobiles throughout Australia. Michael Tynan, who is a major automobile distributor in my electorate, rang me and said what an outstanding job the government was doing in listening to small business about their concerns. 
People have responded very positively. I am sure that Madam Deputy Speaker has found a very positive response from industry in her electorate, including in the Whitsundays. Previously it was planned that businesses would be able to claim 50 per cent of their GST in the next financial year. That has been brought forward to 1 July so that the full amount can be claimed. There are other minor amendments as well. This bill makes a myriad of minor technical and consequential amendments.
The reaction to the government's announcement back in February has been very positive. Jocelyn Morton, the national president of the CPA, said:
The changes will lead to a significant reduction in compliance costs for small business. The changes mean small business operators can get back to doing what they do best—business.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:
It is clear from the government's announcement today that they have been listening to the concern of the business community.
So what this is about is that we have a government that is listening and that has made the changes. It provides small business with the choice of whether they want to have quarterly returns in their BAS—quarterly payments—or whether they want to do it annually and have the tax office provide an estimate based on their previous earnings. Professionals in certain areas can provide returns twice a year. This bill provides for input tax credits on automobiles, which is a great boon for small business. So overall it is a great plus for small business right across Australia. It has been well received in my electorate and I am sure in most areas of Australia. I certainly commend this outstanding bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—The previous Liberal speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Cook, has just indulged himself in the greatest bout of self-delusion I have seen in this House for a long time. If the honourable member really believes that the amendments that are contained in this legislation—forced upon the government by the opposition and the Australian community—are the end of the matter politically, he has another thing coming. The primary purpose of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001, according to the Minister for Small Business's second reading speech, is to ease the compliance burden for taxpayers in the PAYG system and to simplify and streamline GST reporting arrangements for small business. I find this an extraordinary admission by the government of its failure in this key area of policy. This bill is an overt admission by the government that it has absolutely botched the introduction of the GST and the new tax system. If it had got it right in the first place, if it had not botched the introduction of the GST so completely, there would be no need for this legislation in the parliament today.  
This is the second time today that I have had to rise in this chamber to address the problems created in the community by this government's incompetence. The first time today related to the government's supplementary assistance package for the dairy industry in the wake of the botched deregulation of that industry by the government. In that speech, I made the comment that on 1 July 2000 the dairy industry faced two momentous changes. The first was the deregulation of their industry; the second was the introduction of John Howard's GST—or, as it is known out in rural and regional Australia, Costello's curse on rural and regional households. Many dairy farms are small business enterprises. In complying with the GST, they have had to cope with the same problems as other small businesses in the economy. Not only have they had to contend with the government's botching of the deregulation of their industry, which has seen farm gate prices fall and incomes and land prices plummet for many Queensland and New South Wales dairy farmers; they have also had to bear the increased compliance costs associated with the introduction of John Howard's GST, or Peter Costello's curse on Australian households. 
The wreckage of this government's policy incompetence is strewn all over rural and regional Australia. Without going into the detail of this legislation, let me restate the government's own statement of the purpose of this legislation: to simplify and streamline GST payments and BAS reporting arrangements for small business. It is designed to provide a simpler option for business activity statements. According to the government, this bill allows businesses that are happy with the current BAS arrangements to continue along the same lines. It allows businesses that report quarterly to now also pay GST quarterly—complete only three boxes on the BAS quarterly return and lodge an annual GST information report. It allows businesses with a turnover of $2 million or less to choose to pay an amount each quarter, worked out by the tax office, and then lodge an annual GST return. Primary producers, as well as authors, artists and special professionals, will have to make only two GST or PAYG payments each year, one in April and one in July. The quarterly due dates have been extended for BAS and instalment activity statement lodgments and payments. The December quarter return has been extended to 28 February to allow for the Christmas-New Year break. The bill makes minor adjustments, in that businesses with substituted accounting periods will not have to account for GST on a monthly basis and entities will be able to make changes to the current BAS. This will correct a small GST mistake in the previous legislation. 
What does this bill say about the government's competence? It must be galling for member after member on the government side to come in here with their GST tails between their legs, eat humble pie and get up here to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. When this bill is boiled down, this is all the evidence the Australian people need—and especially small businesses in my electorate of Corio and in the Geelong region—that this government is absolutely incompetent and has botched the introduction of the GST. 
History will record that this Prime Minister's and this government's great contribution to the national economic agenda of this country was to introduce a 1960s tax. That will be their great contribution to Australia's economic history. I guess you could argue one way or the other—after all, it is just another tax. It does not make the wheat grow any quicker, it does not give us a better quality of milk out of the cow in the dairy, it does not make the sun come up in the morning and it does not put the kids in a better mood when they come home from school. If you listen to the Treasurer day after day, you would think this GST had some magical qualities. But, after all, it is just another tax. The sad thing about this is that it is a 1960s tax and, of course, this was one the Prime Minister said he would never, ever introduce.
I feel sorry for government members who stand up in here and try to justify this bill. They tell us how they have been out there listening, how they have made these changes and how flexible they are in their approach to this legislation. But if they had got it right in the first place, they would not be here today. That is the reality of it. How incompetent can you be? This was going to be the simple tax. This was going to be the tax that reduced the compliance burden on Australian business. And here we are, almost a year since its introduction, with record bankruptcies attributed to the GST and small business people tearing their hair out over the compliance burden. Government member after government member has had to come in here with their tail between their legs and justify this legislation to the Australian people. Of course, you can justify it to the Australian people on one simple proposition: the government botched it in the first place. That is why this legislation is necessary. 
It is important, when we consider this legislation, to reflect on the Prime Minister's original promises in relation to the GST and the new tax system. This whole taxation saga is a sad tale of deceit and betrayal. Firstly, we had the never, ever non-core promise concerning the introduction of the GST. Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, you are a person who has stood on the high moral ground on a whole range of issues in your electorate. I would have to ask you this question: if your child came to you and said that they had made you a non-core promise, what would you do? I know what my old man would have done to me. He was a pretty tough customer. He was a dairy farmer from the Western District, an onion grower and a spud grower. I tell you what: I would not have been game to say, `Oh, dad, I've just made you a non-core promise.' If he said, `Never, ever,' he meant it. Not this Prime Minister. When he makes a never, ever promise it is non-core. What a heap of gobbledegook that is. But he made it. He said, `I will never, ever introduce it,' and many Australians took him at his word. They have been terribly betrayed, including many people in rural and regional Australia.
The Prime Minister then went further in this whole taxation issue. He said, `We will introduce no new taxes.' That was another non-core promise. At the last count there were 113 of them. That is not a bad record for somebody batting at the crease on a non-core promise never, ever to introduce a GST and not to introduce any new taxes. But that was not the end of the story. The Prime Minister said, `We're going to cut red tape.' They have cut it all right. They must have been cutting off a big roll of paper, because the taxation act has grown. It has increased by thousands of pages. The government have indicated that they wanted to reduce administrative and compliance costs with the introduction of the new tax system. Go and tell dairy farmers, wheat farmers and horticultural producers that their compliance burden, their costs and the red tape have been reduced.
There is one reason why this government is back here with its tail between its legs with this legislation, and it is very simple: Western Australia—National and Liberal parties decimated in the state election; Queensland—Liberal and National parties decimated; and Ryan by-election—Liberal Party loses the jewel in the Queensland crown. That is why the legislation is before us today. That is why this government comes in here with its tail between its legs trying to justify a bill before this parliament—a bill that is necessary because of its own incompetence.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"— Madam Deputy Speaker, I can assure you and the House that I do not have my tail between my legs as I stand here this evening. When you have the biggest change in the tax system in Australia's history, it would be pretty incredible if you expected to be able to get everything right the first time round. It was just a huge change in so many areas of the taxation system. I think that the Australian public and Australian business understand that there were always going to be transitional issues. The government said there were always going to be transitional issues. The Labor Party calls it a botched introduction, but I think that what the government is doing with the presentation of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001 before the parliament tonight is entirely sensible. It is to the government's eternal credit that we are prepared to stand up and say, `There needs to be a change.' That is what this bill is about. There needs to be a change. If you cannot get up in front of the Australian people and say, `We agree; it wasn't quite right. We should do something about it,' and then do something, it would be a pretty sad day. The government gets points and gets marked up for being able to recognise that something was not quite right and should be attended to, and that is what we are doing. 
It is to John Howard's credit that the Prime Minister is able to say to the Australian people, particularly people in the GST system, that we are going to make a change that makes things better for them. I do not think it is a case of botching at all. Did you notice the content of the member for Corio's remarks to the parliament this evening? I did not hear one suggestion, one idea, about how things might be made better for Australian businesses. I just heard a tirade and a thumping of the dispatch box, but not one new idea. I also did not hear that the Labor Party would be getting rid of the new tax system. Despite all the tirade that we heard, the Australian Labor Party are keeping the new tax system. Hasn't that been their track record all the way? The Australian Labor Party, for their own cynical, political purposes, have opposed a new tax system for Australia.
But what has the new tax system delivered? Is the member for Corio unhappy that at this moment we probably have the best performing economy in the world? Is he unhappy with what the new tax system has done for our export industries in terms of our terms of trade and the returns that our farmers are now getting? You would know about that, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, coming from a regional seat. Is he unhappy that exports are up 20 per cent? Our exports are now cheaper because there is now no internal tax on them. Is he unhappy about that? Would he get rid of that? No, of course he would not get rid of it. We hear the emotive words `Costello's curse' but I can tell you that there are a lot of businesses out there that do not believe that the new tax system is a curse. This bill does not say anything about the government's incompetence; it says something about the government's competence. It says that we are prepared to stand up and make a change because we have identified a transitional issue that needs attention.
The Howard government is the only government that has listened very carefully to small business. It understands the importance of their role in our community and it values their contribution. I have come out of small business and I know how hard it is to make a dollar. I know how, as the years go on, it seems to be harder and harder and you work longer and longer, and that the last thing you need is more complexity. That is why this bill—and the amendments it announced—was warmly welcomed by the business community. The bill makes amendments to implement the changes to GST and PAYG reporting as announced in February and further changes that have been announced since.
Late last year the Treasurer came to Herbert, which has Australia's largest tropical city—the twin cities of Townsville and Thuringowa—and had the opportunity to listen to a group of local accountants and to hear first-hand how things were going in our community. He listened; I sat with him. The local people of Townsville were able to access the Treasurer of Australia and tell him what they saw as the transitional issues. Their views were listened to and acted upon, and that is what this bill is about. The accountants in my electorate who brought those concerns to the Treasurer certainly are very happy indeed that their views were listened to. It demonstrates how in this great country of ours local communities can make a difference on the national scene, particularly when we have a government that listens to their concerns. Many people from Townsville and Thuringowa small businesses came to me after the first two quarterly BAS returns and told me that they wanted a simpler option for the business activity statement. This bill gives them that. It cuts red tape, something which we all know small business can do without. 
It is important to note that these changes do not and will not force businesses to change the way that they complete the BAS. I certainly know of a number of businesses which, although they are not required to, continue to lodge a monthly BAS. They find that it is just so simple now. They have got into the way of doing it; their computer systems are set up. They say to me, `We want to do a monthly BAS.' They also say to me that they now know far more about their business than they have ever known in the past; that, in management, they have got information that they have never had before, that it has been very good for their business and that they recognise that. But businesses have the choice and, if they want to make arrangements other than reporting monthly, they can do that if they so choose. Businesses with a turnover of $2 million or less are also able to choose to pay an amount each quarter worked by out by the tax office and then to lodge an annual GST return. Taxpayers now have the choice to make PAYG instalments based on an amount notified by the tax office. They will no longer have to make a quarterly calculation of their income unless they choose to. And the bill allows taxpayers who have variable incomes a better way to meet their obligations.
Other changes made by this bill include ensuring that businesses with substituted accounting periods will not have to account for GST on a monthly basis, and that entities will be able to make changes to their current BAS to correct a small GST mistake in a previous BAS. These are all changes for the benefit of small business, and certainly they are welcomed. The bill also changes the quarterly due dates for the BAS and instalment activity statements—and that has been welcomed too, I know, as businesses have spoken to me about the way they operate their business and the timing cycles that they need to adhere to.
The government also recognises that the Christmas-New Year period for small business is always hectic—and it is—and so the quarterly return date has been extended to 28 February. Businesses were saying to me that they could not go away in January for a holiday, because the BAS was due in. This is a sensible change. It is a transitional issue. It is not a botching, as the member for Corio was saying; it is the government responding to concerns of small business and meeting those concerns. You cannot mark down a government for listening to the community and responding in an appropriate and sensible way.
These changes have been embraced by the small business community in Townsville-Thuringowa, and I am very proud to be part of a government that has listened to small business and has acted on their concerns. I am not in here with my tail between my legs at all. I am here to say to the Australian community that the government has listened, has delivered and will continue to deliver. In doing that, I support this bill.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Morris, Allan, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—It is a shame that the government is not proud of the amendments. It is quite clear that it has chosen to schedule the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001 on a non-broadcast day, because it does not want the community to hear this debate. It does not want the community to hear the embarrassment of its members trying to defend the indefensible—the member for Herbert no more so than others.
I must confess that I sat listening with some amazement—I guess I was not quite as awe-struck as the member for Lindsay was when he had the Treasurer there—that it seems that it is somehow rather remarkable that people talk to the Treasurer. I found those comments quite bizarre. How awe-struck can you get? His community should be really grateful that the Treasurer spoke to them! Aren't they lucky, having a Treasurer who gave them a dog of a tax and then talks to them about it! What a pathetic little exercise that was. I do not quite know how much further we will get with a government that starts talking to the community in that way.
The member for Herbert is proud that the government listens. The point of this whole exercise is that the government has brought in a dog of a tax. It is sending people broke in their thousands. Look at the escalation of bankruptcies. Look at what is happening to our business people. Isn't it lucky that the government talks to them! I am talking here about another 70 pages of amendments and 113 pages of explanatory memorandum for one little thing, just to adjust the BAS. This government has brought in 5½ thousand pages of new tax legislation, and is now bringing in hundreds of pages a week. Aren't we lucky! Aren't those business people fortunate! I tell you what: the government has deliberately made sure this debate was not broadcast, because it does not want the people to actually hear its defence of itself and the complications and problems that the tax system it has brought upon the Australian community is having—and not least the problem I mentioned earlier, the bankruptcies. 
We have a government that talks in one voice about tax simplification, and we hear it talk about cutting red tape and simplifying the tax system—at the same time that we are getting hundreds of pages of tax amendments a week coming into the parliament. What kind of hypocrisy, what kind of contradiction, what kind of nonsense is that? The starting point the government has is that this is all wonderful. We now have a new phrase. I often take delight in the new words that become trendy. We have Transition with a capital `T'—or is it all in capitals? We have `transitional arrangements' and `transitional problems'. But you cannot actually launder this problem. People are being destroyed.
This is not transition; it is terrorism, destruction. People's businesses and lives are being destroyed, and the government uses a word for it: `transition'. It talks of `transitional arrangements' and `traditional impacts' and says that `we are almost past the transitional effects'. Well, the aim of governments is actually to avoid these issues. Good government does not put its people through transitions. It brings in legislation that does not require thousands of amendments and many thousands of pages. The last time I checked at the end of last year, we were up to 1½ thousand amendments. We must be up to about 3,000 or 4,000 by now. The government says that good government is botching it up and then listening. That is all wonderful admission. The member for Herbert is actually admitting that good government is about botching it and then listening to people saying how it has been botched—nine months later.
The fact is that we also know that these amendments do not solve the problem. They solve just a little bit of it. They make it just a little less complicated, but they do not make it simple. We see the audacity of this government to stand here day after day, saying to the opposition, who have no access to Treasury, to the ATO or to the myriad ministerial staffers, `How would you fix it?' It is asking us to fix its problem and asking why we will not tell it how to fix it. In other words, it is our responsibility to tell the government how to fix its mess and, because we will not tell it today, somehow that is all our fault.
I must confess that the fact that the mess is still not fixed may be our fault: perhaps if we had told the government a bit earlier what it could do, it might have picked up at least some of it a bit earlier—because this is what the government is doing. Day in, day out, it is actually trying to pick up opposition ideas and proposals, whether they be on the Job Network or on the minister for employment's new and wonderful thing called tax credits. Where did he find that? In the last elections, it was in Labor Party policy in detail. It is all there, an excellent system, and he is finally admitting it.
This government actually starts on the wrong side of the coin. The opposition starts with the position that this tax was not necessary and, furthermore, in the framing of it and in its legislation, the government did not understand what it was doing and really did make a God-awful botch of it. Our starting point is that it has to be simpler. Roll-back is simply taken as a starting point, as this system can be simplified and made fairer and easier. That is our starting point. The government's starting point is that it is all perfect—nothing wrong with it: `We knew what we were doing, we're the experts and we've done it properly.' Go back to the Treasurer's speeches month after month on the BAS: it did not need fixing. `Business should feel lucky to see that they now have a system that lets them know more about their business.' Aren't they lucky! Aren't they fortunate! `We don't need to fix it and we don't need to change it, because it ain't broke. What we've done is correct.' Then, of course, the government eventually brings in legislation to change it. What we are seeing today is yet one more backdown by the government and one more admission of its incompetence. That is what it is about. It is the government admitting that it is incompetent: 69 pages of legislation and a 113-page memorandum about just the BAS and nothing else—not about the rest of the amendments that we are seeing. That is a massive admission of incompetence. 
I was talking last week to a person in business about how things were going. He is a computer man who services businesses and his main clients are business people. So he is mainly a business servicer. He said, `I know when the BAS is due because, for two weeks beforehand and for two weeks afterwards, I have no business. It stops while businesses assemble their money. I could not work it out at first. Suddenly my business would just stop dead, and then a month later it would pick up again. I could not work out what had happened. When I asked my customers, they told me that, for the fortnight before they put in their BAS returns, they have to start saving their money to get it ready to put in, and for the two weeks afterwards they are skint. So for three months a year my business is closed down. It is very tough because I cannot afford not to have any business for three months of the year.' He was not political. I raised the issue with him. I was just curious because of the particular line of work that he does.
It gave me a good insight into the issue that is most affecting people at this stage, which is cash flow. The government now say, `We will make it simpler; we will get it from you twice a year—in April and July.' Why April and July? They are three months apart. So you are going to have two belts: you are going to pay the year in two goes but they are only three months apart. It does not seem to me that that is actually going to solve the problem. It is more likely to solve the government's problem because they will be able to say, `We are doing something.' All that is about is perception. The government want to tell people, `We are fixing it. We have made these amendments.' The fact that the amendments might not fix it does not matter, but they had to make some amendments to actually answer the accusations.
The amendments are a concession of failure, but the results are not successful. This has been the case with the GST all the way through. We have had amendment after amendment, but they have not actually solved the problem. A lot of the problems are still with the design and the philosophy. To quote a previous parliamentarian, `As sure as night follows day, the GST will be extended.' As sure as night follows day, we will see a GST on food and on everything else. We know this government wanted it on everything and it will move towards that. We are seeing a government which, after saying for months and for years that this does not need fixing, is trying to pretend it is making it better and fixing it; but, at the same time, in its back pocket, it has a plan to extend it. 
The hypocrisy of this government is just unbelievable. I just find it so difficult when I hear the words `transitional arrangements', because they are talking about people being bankrupted. The way they put it, it is as if there is some minor hiccup somewhere along the line. We are talking about people being destroyed. People who have been in business for 20 and 30 years are having their businesses destroyed. Yet the member for Herbert got up and said that people are now better informed about their business. Well, thank you very much, members of the government! Thanks for what you have given me! I should be grateful that I am going broke, because I am going broke for the right reasons! Is that the answer? Is that the government's position—that I am going broke for the right reasons?
Years ago John Button told me a story about how the CEO of one of our major car manufacturers told him that he had a car which was a real dog and it just was not selling. Everything was wrong with it. Button asked him what he did about it. The CEO said that he just ran a $1 million advertising campaign. That was the answer. That used be the answer of Australian business: rather than get the quality right and fix it, just advertise it. It seems to me that that idea has been recycled—that this government is doing exactly that. If you have a dog of a tax, what do you do? Just spend more money advertising it. If you have a dog of a system out there in a whole range of government areas, what do you do? Just spend more money advertising it. But in John Button's story the CEO was spending company money, whereas here the government is spending public money. In other words, it is the audience who are paying for the advertising, not the producer, and I think that is a great insight. Certainly, the methodology harks back to the fifties and the sixties when it was at the root of Australian business and manufacturing problems. It is now up front and forward in the problems of the Australian government. The amendments in the bill are useful but do not solve the problem. I am supporting the bill, with massive reservations. My community needs much more and deserves much more than this. ",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—I assure the member for Newcastle and the rest of the Labor Party that they would be the last people that we would ask for advice because, frankly, they have not got any policies anyway. The member for Newcastle has got only complaints—no answers. He shows his ignorance about why there is a twice-yearly reporting period of April and July. If he understood anything about farming, he would know that the quarter leading up to July is when most farmers incur the costs of growing their crops, and of course a lot of their income comes in in the quarter leading up to April. That is the very simple reason why farmers have that option. That just shows his complete ignorance about what happens with the farming industry here in Australia. He even put forward the suggestion that the GST will be extended. He might be right, under Labor. If Labor won the next federal election and if they won the state election in South Australia early next year, they would be in government in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and federally, and then they would have the trigger to actually increase the rate of the GST.
We have never yet heard in this parliament a commitment from the Labor Party that they will not increase the rate of GST. It is only this government that has made the commitment that it will not increase the rate of GST. So where is the Labor Party when it comes to increasing the rate of GST? Will we have a 12 per cent rate under Labor? Will we have a 15 per cent rate under Labor? Who knows, because only then would they have the possibility of having the trigger to increase the rate of GST.
It gives me great pleasure to speak in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001 because it introduces a measure to further advantage the business sector in Australia, which is so important for providing jobs and security for Australian workers. I am also immensely pleased because, thanks to good management of our economy, this government not only has delivered on another promise on tax reform but also has delivered it early. Just as we have delivered taxation benefits early and backdated for our superannuants of pensionable age, we have delivered this enormous benefit to business and transport in my electorate of Barker and, of course, in the rest of Australia.
One of the great things about the tax system we have brought in is that we now have an effective, efficient and inexpensive transport system, which is so important to the electorate of Barker, with an area of 54,000 square kilometres. To service the constituents it is important not only to get consumable goods to and from the households but also to service the many businesses and farmers throughout the electorate. 
It might interest you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, to know that there are more trucks per head of population in the south-east of South Australia than anywhere else in Australia, largely because there are so many varying businesses and so much productivity. The forest industry, for example, is worth nearly $2 billion annually in my electorate, and that is set to expand even further when the blue gum industry gets into full swing. The wine industry is another growing example of what the producers of Australia can achieve, and we are helping them with the measures introduced by this bill. Both these industries are major exporters. It is no coincidence that we now have a tax-free environment for our exports which has partly resulted in this country having the best trade figures for decades, with continuous trade surpluses. They would be even better if we were not still paying off some of the debt that Labor ran up in the last five years of their last time in government, with resulting high interest rates. 
It took Australia 90 years to accumulate $16 billion worth of debt. Kim Beazley doubled that in one year—not in 90 years but in one year—and then he continued that trend for five years. In five years, from 1991 to 1996, Kim Beazley—
 (Mr Nehl)—The Leader of the Opposition.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, took Australia's net debt from $16 billion to $96 billion. It is no wonder we had high interest rates, high unemployment and the recession we had to have. It is very interesting that even their own preferred modeller, Chris Murphy, has come up with modelling that suggests that $4 billion worth of roll-back will produce another one per cent increase in interest rates. And it certainly does not take much to get $4 billion worth of roll-back. 
The Leader of the Opposition, when he was the Minister for Finance, took the debt for every man, woman and child in this country from less than $1,000 to more than $5,000. That meant that the average family was saddled with a $20,000 debt, thanks to the Leader of the Opposition. By the end of the year, this government will have repaid $58 billion of that $80 billion in extra debt run up by none other than the now Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, who has the dream of becoming Prime Minister. Talk about a nightmare for the rest of Australians!
This government has reduced the debt to less than $2,000 for every man, woman and child and we will continue to reduce it further because we know how to manage economies, we know how to reduce debt and we know how to get business moving again, even though the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the rest of the Labor Party have tried to sabotaged those efforts at every turn. They continue to oppose tax reform and GST, but they will keep it. They continue to attack the GST and tax reform, but they will keep it. They say they will have a roll-back, but they will not say how they will fund it. That was until Senator Conroy let the cat of the bag and raised the spectre of increased taxation under Labor. Will it be increased company tax? Will it be increased taxes for rich people? Will it be increased Medicare levies? Or will it be the reintroduction of their CPI increases in petrol tax? Whatever it is, it will be increased taxation of some form, and probably to the tune of at least $3 billion annually if the Leader of the Opposition is going to try the same trick he did after the 1993 election when he was finance minister. I remind the House that, with this government's repayment of Beazley's debt, we now save $4 billion every year that we can spend on things like health, education and many of our other good social needs, instead of paying that money to banks. It is money for jam.
The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001 is a good bill because it will allow most entities to have the choice of several options brought in by this government as a result of substantial consultation with the business sector. I congratulate the Minister for Small Business on the job he has done since he has been in that job. There was dissatisfaction expressed to the members of this government and to the ministers. Like any good government, we have listened to those concerns, unlike the opposition Labor Party who are not listening to small business because they do not want a bar of roll-back—that quaint little cliche that expresses a con job on the general public and will lead only to higher interest rates that hurt businesses, home owners and anyone who has to borrow money. 
This bill also extends the deadline for quarterly payments and gives several options for business to go about their normal quarterly payments. Small business can continue to go about their reporting in the same way they have since this tax system was introduced. I am sure many if not the vast majority of businesses will continue to operate in that way. They have got used to the system now and can see the benefits from having a better handle on the way their businesses are operating and how they are faring. They can opt for a system that has much less reporting, they can opt for a system that lets the Taxation Office work out the figure for them and they can do an annual reconciliation, much like they did in previous years.
Farmers also have a fourth option of reporting only twice a year because of the special seasonal circumstances that the member for Newcastle could not seem to understand. I know a lot of farmers are really noticing the benefits from receiving their record stock prices with the GST on top, because they get to keep that GST for up to three months, and that is extra money that they can use for cash flow purposes. 
So, all in all, I think these amendments make a lot of sense. They certainly give businesses a lot more choices as to how they do their reporting. Certainly they will be very helpful for the smaller operator, but frankly I think that a lot of people will continue operating in the way that they have been because we have introduced a system that now suits the vast majority of businesses quite well. I certainly support this bill, I have been quite happy to speak on it and I agree that this parliament should pass it at the first opportunity.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—A double backflip with two and a half twists in the pike position—unfortunately bellyflops do not count for much with the judges. The judges in this case are of course the Australian people. Once again the government, bereft of original ideas and scrambling for all they are worth to save their political hides, have had to resort to stealing from Labor the very policies that they claim do not exist. The Treasurer's fingerprints and those of the Prime Minister are all over this little theft and, because of their ineptitude as burglars, this piece of legislation proves that they cannot even steal properly. The purpose of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001, as defined in the BillsDigest, is:
To allow most entities required to lodge quarterly business activity statements to have the amount of payment calculated on their record of previous payments adjusted for changes in gross domestic product; extend the deadline for quarterly reporting and payment by a week; and to extend the range of people who may make pay as you go payments on amounts notified by the Australian Taxation Office.
The bill covers various areas of this so-called simple new tax system with 160—count them—new amendments in the areas of GST returns and statements, payment of GST by instalments, correcting GST errors, PAYG instalments and deferral of due dates. The bill proposes to enact the BAS backflip package announced on 22 February 2001. This bill is a belated response to criticism by small business of the enormous amount of paperwork that they now face as a result of this government's `simplification' of the tax system. If this is simpler, I would hate to see the government decide to make the tax system more complex.
Small business owners are now unpaid administrators and tax collectors for this government. Small businesses are now so tied down with paperwork that it has increased their working hours and reduced their profitability. There is no doubt that the GST has diverted the focus from other small business issues such as access to finance, e-commerce, training, retail issues, cash flow and marketing. How can businesses look to the future when they are too busy catching up on the work of the past? How can they build e-commerce solutions if they are so mired down in the paperwork of this regressive tax that they have no time or money to pursue this new technology? 
What the government needs to do is to reduce the amount of paperwork business has to do and to compensate small business firms for doing the work of government administrators and collecting revenue. We must never forget that John Howard's government was quite happy to force this extra administration cost on small business. The government has been saying one thing to small business while doing something completely different. Government policy is increasing the burden on small business, not reducing it. This is a simple fact that the government cannot escape from. Under John Howard's government, bureaucracy and reporting have increased considerably, despite promises to cut red tape. It now appears obvious to everyone that the red tape reduction promised was not a core promise and therefore was easily discarded by a government that does not seem to care about the practical realities of its theoretical and ideological policies. But now, with a number of electoral setbacks in Western Australia, Queensland and Ryan and after the infamous Shane Stone memo, the government is desperate to be seen to be doing something. The trouble is that it is only being seen to be doing something; in fact, it is not doing anything.
The infamous Shane Stone memo, written after the electoral wipe-out in Queensland, highlights a number of the shortcomings this government has. Mr Stone quoted members of his government saying such things as `our leadership is not listening', `the government won't even listen to our own people so what hope the public?'—indeed, what hope the public?—and `all we have achieved is to raise the anxiety levels of ordinary Australians'. Mr Stone also complained of `forms, forms and more forms'. He said:
We have buried our supporters under a sea of documentation.
Also:
There is a clear view that we are reactive rather than proactive and have to be `dragged screaming'to fix things and are just so far behind public sentiment on a range of issues.
In summing up, Mr Stone wrote that `the recurring theme was that government was dysfunctional, out of touch and hurting our own'. I do not find myself agreeing with too many on the other side of the House, but on this occasion I believe that Mr Stone and the Queensland backbenchers have got it right and should be congratulated for their directness. I do not know whether the Minister for Small Business, who is at the table, was a backbencher at the time.
The government have been slow to move. As Mr Stone pointed out, they need to be `dragged screaming'. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer appeared from newspaper reports to have conflicting views on the business activity statements. The Prime Minister, in his recently acquired guise of a knee-jerk reactionary, wanted action immediately, while the Treasurer took the hard line, insisting that small business would get used to the system the longer they worked under it. However, the pressure from small business continued, and the government fell into line with Labor's proposal and indicated that they would allow small business to report annually instead of quarterly, although they would still have to pay the GST every three months. The Treasurer still appeared to be dragging the chain on the change and was reported as saying that business would be forced to wait at least six months for any big change. 
After spending over $210 million on GST advertising—there seems to be some conflict as to how much money has been spent on advertising the GST, but I will be conservative; the conservative figure that most people agree upon is $210 million—the small business community is still unconvinced of the GST's value. The effect of this unfair tax has been to chain and lock small business into a prison of administration and to throw away the key. It has put pressure on margins, it has put pressure on profits and it has mugged the economy. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in the March quarter this year company profits before income tax are down by a seasonally adjusted figure of 11.2 per cent over the same period last year. Total new capital expenditure is down by a seasonally adjusted figure of 9.6 per cent over the same period, the 12 months to March. Prices have gone up by six per cent over the 12-month period to March, with essentials like food rising by 6.6 per cent, clothing by 5.6 per cent and housing by 7.4 per cent. Alcohol and tobacco are up over 11 per cent. Average weekly earnings have not kept pace, and full-time adult earnings in the private sector are up by only 3.9 per cent. Prices are up, profits are down and it all comes down to the new tax system.  
This was supposed to be a simple new tax system. The Treasurer said as far back as February 2000:
Well, it does mean that we're not changing the legislation, that we've got it right.
As Margaret Thatcher once said, `The lady's not for turning.' But we have now seen over 1,800 roll-back amendments to this confusing new tax, with 160 in this bill alone. So much for getting it right; they have not. So much for not changing anything; they have. Industry sources are suggesting that there are still more to come, and many more amendments will be required to make this confusing new tax acceptable to industry. 
An incoming ALP government's position on the GST is well known. When we are advised as to what finance is available, the leader, Kim Beazley, will announce details of our policy.
—When?
—When the information that we need becomes available. If the GST were wiped completely, as a lot of our supporters would like us to do, we would have a further three years of total confusion like the confusion that we have had over the last two years, and there would be increased administration costs and further taxpayer expenditure on education and training—and on advertising no doubt. As has been pointed out on a number of occasions, you cannot unscramble an egg. You can make a fairly decent tasting omelette out of it, but you simply cannot unscramble it. 
The most responsible position for an incoming Labor government to take in our first term would be to make the GST fairer and to remove some of the administrative costs incurred by small business. The Leader of the Opposition has announced that, when he becomes Prime Minister, we will remove the GST from charities. A second- and third-term Labor government, under the prime ministership of Kim Beazley, would then be in a better position to respond to public demands in a responsible fashion. 
There are many changes that could be made to make this regressive tax a little less regressive and a little fairer. In Canada, for example, people on low incomes can claim back at tax time some of the GST that they have paid out during the year. I am not announcing any new policy here—after all, I am only a backbencher. I am simply pointing out that there is a whole host of suggestions out there that need to be investigated in order to make this dog's breakfast of a tax a little bit fairer on those that it hurts most.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—in reply—In rising to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2001, I will firstly address some of the statements made during this debate by those who sit opposite. They are quite right when they say that this tax is not as simple as we would have hoped. The only way we could have achieved that simple tax would have been to have had some bipartisan support from the Labor Party—support promised by the Leader of the Opposition in the lead-up to the 1998 election. But, like so many of their election promises, both then and in the past, they reneged as soon as the election was over. So we have had to battle our way through, with some compromises to the system.
I have to remind all those in this chamber that this was the biggest tax change in Australia's history. There was always going to be a requirement to finetune the system. What assistance have we had from those who sit opposite? None. What is their approach to the GST? They have a twofold approach. First of all, they are so opposed to the GST that they are going to keep it. In fact, their Labor state colleagues are so opposed to the GST that they cannot get their hands on the money fast enough. The other approach that they have is to talk the economy down and to blame the GST for everything. When interest rates went up, the Leader of the Opposition said, `That's the fault of the GST.' When interest rates came down, the Leader of the Opposition said, `That's the fault of the GST.'  It is clear from the debate here tonight that those who sit opposite, firstly, know little about the economy and, secondly, know little about the need for tax change. It is their colleagues who are taking the greatest slice of this tax. The state premiers are taking all the GST; all the GST is returned to the states. It is those state Labor premiers who are exploiting the system by making sure that they put their state taxes on before the GST is charged. 
In terms of what we have seen from the Labor Party during this debate to date though, there are some interesting hypocrisies, to say the very least. We hear them talk about roll-back, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer was quick to quote Rob Bastian and small business support for roll-back. Let me read to the House what Rob Bastian actually said about roll-back. He said:
We don't know too much about what Labor is ... and of course we are frightened about the roll-back statement. The opposition has been trying very hard to convince us—
that is, COSBOA—
that we are talking about rolling back complexity. But of course if we are rolling back coverage of the GST, that will increase complexity and that will cause a lot of pain.
Is not just COSBOA that is concerned about our roll-back; we have seen a series of surveys, and they talk about the reaction of small business. Pitcher Partners released a survey which showed that 70 per cent of small business think roll-back will be detrimental to their business.
—The member for Brisbane can interject, but the reality is that this is not the only survey. Morgan and Banks: 90.5 per cent of respondents rejected roll-back. Yellow Pages: 66.6 per cent of respondents oppose roll-back. Even the Labor Party is not game to road test its roll-back policy. It did not include it in its BAS inquiry. The Labor Party knew that the roll-back policy was on the nose with small business, and that is why it did not take it out there and include it in this inquiry. Having an inquiry into a tax system—the cornerstone of which, according to the Labor Party, is going to be roll-back—and not including roll-back only shows that roll-back is shallow and deceptive and really will only add complexity for small business.
As if roll-back was not bad enough: we then had an ill-considered and dishonest proposal put forward by the shadow Treasurer a few weeks ago about having small business pay their GST on the basis of a ratio intended to reflect their liability. I challenged the shadow Treasurer tonight to explain to me how a business could take a ratio from the ATO and then be confident that it was not paying too much tax when the ALP introduced its roll-back policy. Where does roll-back actually fit in this ratio tax policy? They are like oil and water: they do not mix. 
Despite his angry response, he failed to explain how that policy would work. He could not even in this House when challenged explain to me how what are now seen as the two central planks of the Labor Party tax policy actually fit together. How does a business do its GST on a ratio when Labor is behind its back changing the ratio? I would not be so suspicious if as part of that policy there was an annual reconciliation. So Labor changes the tax base and the business keeps paying on its historical basis, and what happens? The business pays too much tax. No wonder small business is so suspicious of the Labor Party.
—Read it. Read the bill.
—I hear some chuckles from opposite. Let me explain it to you. A newsagent gets his or her ratio from the ATO and under roll-back, I understand, although I can never get these things confirmed, the ratio gets changed, the tax base gets changed, books get exempted and the newsagent is still including in his ratio the percentage figure that includes books. Time is not going to allow me to talk about the shadow minister for small business and his inane contribution to the debate tonight. Let me just say that he admits that unfair dismissal is an issue for small business and he admits that low interest rates are important to small business. Those are two areas which this government is trying to address and which those who sit opposite continually oppose. 
May I just say a few words in summing up. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate. I acknowledge the opposition speakers and also the fact that even those speakers have acknowledged that this bill is good for business. This government spend their time talking to small business and understand that their needs have to be taken into consideration, and we act accordingly. This bill will help business by giving them options that will significantly ease their reporting requirements. I commend the bill to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I rise in the adjournment debate tonight to bring to the attention of the House the need for proper and official commemoration of one of Australia's most significant, important and costly military campaigns of the Second World War, the battle for Australia. The allied campaign against the advancing Japanese forces in the Pacific between 1942 and 1945 and in Malaya prior to the fall of Singapore in 1942 is known as the battle for Australia. The various campaigns involved more than 200,000 Australian and American allies. More than 10,600 Australians gave their lives. Thousands were wounded and many Australians were taken prisoner of war, where they were subjected to some of the most inhumane and intolerable conditions imaginable. 
It is said that the Gallipoli campaign of the First World War carved out a national identity for Australians and forged a long-lasting Australian ethos of mateship, courage, determination and egalitarianism. Similarly, it was in the Pacific and in the islands to our north during the years 1942-45 where those values of mateship, determination, courage and egalitarianism were revisited and were further entrenched into the Australian ethos.  
Following the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942, the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, announced to the Australian nation that `the fall of Singapore opens the battle for Australia'. For the next 3½ years, Australian forces fought the Japanese in places such as Rabual, Papua, New Guinea, Kokoda, Milne Bay, Buna, Gona, Sananada, Wau-Salamaua, Lae-Nadzab, Huon Peninsula Sattelberg, the Bismark Sea, Port Moresby, Bougainville, New Britain, Borneo and other places in the Pacific. It was during the battle for Australia that Darwin was bombed by the Japanese, sinking 10 ships and killing 243 people. Darwin suffered a total of 64 air attacks between 1942 and 1943 and the Western Australian towns of Port Hedland, Broome, Derby and Wyndham, Townsville in Queensland and Katherine in the Northern Territory were also reported to be subjected to Japanese air raids. The bombing of Darwin was the first enemy attack on Australian soil in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. 
On 31 May 1942, Japanese midget submarines were found in Sydney harbour and for the first time the war had come to Australia. Australia was no longer a part of the war effort which involved thousands of Australian men and women defending distant and foreign lands. The war was now on our doorstep.  These events marked a turning point in Australia's thinking about its place and importance in the war and brought home to Australians the need for an allied victory in the Pacific.
One of the strategically significant victories in the Pacific in the defence of Australia was the Battle of the Coral Sea, where the Japanese forces attempted to isolate Australia by seizing Port Moresby and other nearby ports. An allied force of US ships fought the Japanese in the Coral Sea to Australia's east and eventually forced a retreat, thus marking an important and strategic victory for the allies. Prime Minister Curtin announced after the victory that the success in the Coral Sea had `undoubtedly saved Australia from a definite and immediate threat'.
The Japanese then attempted to take Port Moresby overland by travelling along what is known as the Kokoda Trail. Australian troops stationed in New Guinea held the Japanese advances and forced a retreat back along the Kokoda Trail. This was a campaign which, like Gallipoli, entrenched unique Australian values upon its participants. The Kokoda Trail is associated with the courage of the wounded Australian soldiers who found valuable help from the indigenous people of New Guinea, known to the troops as the `fuzzy wuzzy angels'.
The Japanese continued to be active in the Pacific right up until their surrender on 2 September 1945. Australian forces were instrumental in stopping the Japanese advances in the Pacific and thus protecting and securing Australia's freedom and the lifestyle that many of us enjoy today. It is only fitting that we honour and commemorate the battle for Australia and remember the thousands of Australian and allied servicemen that fought in the various campaigns in the battle for Australia between 1942 and 1945, including those who served in the earlier defence of Malaya.
It was during these years and these campaigns that many of the classic images and special memories of Australians at war were created. These are the images and memories which now encompass the spirit of the original Anzacs: for example, the images of the fuzzy wuzzy stretcher-bearers carrying wounded Australian soldiers in New Guinea, images and stories which depict the hardship suffered by the Australians on the Kokoda Trail, the plight of those Australian men who were taken prisoner by the Japanese following the fall of Singapore in 1942 and the invaluable hope and help that the Australians received from the indigenous people.
This year the battle for Australia commemoration will be held on Wednesday, 5 September. I must express my view that this is a day which is in need of more promotion and the battle for Australia needs a national day of commemoration. This year of the Centenary of Federation provides us with a great opportunity to promote Australian history and other significant issues so that Australians who fought in the battle for Australia are given the proper recognition and commemoration they deserve. I believe that Australian children and our schools should take an active role in the commemoration process. By teaching our younger generations about Australia's war heritage, the legacy of those who fought for all Australians will remain in their memory. 
Next year will commemorate 60 years since the fall of Singapore, the bombing of Darwin, the Battle of the Coral Sea and Australians on the Kokoda Trail. These are all events which have had significant implications for the battle for Australia and they must be nationally commemorated. There are many people in my electorate—the old diggers—who would like to see that happen and I speak on  their behalf.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Second World War: Battle for Australia</title>,Adjournment,16,1
"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—It appears that it is ingrained in the psyche of the federal Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs that he must do all in his power to bludgeon and marginalise public education. In case that statement is regarded as overstated by those opposite, let me prove it to all in this chamber by referring to the only statistic that means anything in the expenditure on education. The percentage of GDP expended on education is falling, and falling dramatically. In 1996-97, it was 2.06 per cent. For 2001-02, it will be around 1.6 per cent. That is a 20 per cent cut. That is the real truth—forget all the other statistics. They account only for inflation and increased enrolments.
Historically, elitist conservative forces in Victoria have always tried to marginalise public education. It is part of the psyche in certain quarters in that state. It is still the case, particularly, with the current education minister. This minister is to dogma as propaganda is to indoctrination—George Orwell describes him most accurately. He continues a long line of elitist conservative propaganda agents in Victoria who have always tried to marginalise public education.
Those of us who are from states other than New South Wales and Victoria are often bored by the many senseless debates between proponents of those states. However, one comparison between New South Wales and Victoria is particularly edifying when it comes to public and private education. A Victorian educational researcher found that in New South Wales over half the people with entries in Who's Who were educated in public schools. But when it came to Victoria, over half came not only from private schools but from just five schools: Scotch College, Wesley College, Geelong Grammar, Melbourne Grammar and Geelong College. How much more elitist conservative can you possibly get? The minister obviously wants to keep it that way—just look at where the Victorian contingent of cabinet frontbenchers went to school.
This continues an evil tradition of conservative forces in Victoria when it comes to education. In the early 1900s the so-called top private schools in Victoria were successful in limiting the breadth of curriculum offerings in public schools. That is what they went in to bat for, and they actually won it—hard to believe, but true. At various times, even in the 1950s, that divisive debate was continued by elitist conservatives in Victoria to retain for private schools a competitive edge. Of course, the practice of cherry picking the most able from public schools operated then as it does now.
Judgment day comes for people who do harm to the future national interest of this nation. Sometimes that day can be very slow in coming, but as certain as night follows day it does come.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—I suggest that it might suit the convenience of the Main Committee to consider the items of proposed expenditure in the order and groupings shown in the schedule which has been circulated to honourable members. The consideration of the items in groups of departments has met the convenience of the House and the Main Committee in past years. I take the opportunity also to indicate to the Main Committee that the proposed order for consideration of departments' estimates has been discussed with the opposition and the Independent members, and there has been no objection to what is proposed.
The schedule read as follows—
Attorney-General's Department
Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business
Department of the Environment and Heritage
Department of Transport and Regional Services
Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts
Department of Family and Community Services
Department of Health and Aged Care
Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry
Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 
Department of Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs

 (Mr Nehl)—Is it the wish of the Main Committee to consider the items of proposed expenditure in the order suggested by the minister? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.

"Sercombe, Bob, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—I take this opportunity to raise with the Attorney-General the support his department might extend to Australians in the international arena when they face complexities with the operation of overseas criminal justice systems. In 1998 and 1999 I spoke in the House, during the adjournment debate, about the frightful circumstances of constituents of mine, a family whose son was murdered in Greece in the middle of 1998. This boy's name was George Karalis.
The matter is, obviously, deeply grieving to the family because of the essential circumstances—it was a particularly horrific murder—but their grief has been added to dramatically by the extreme difficulties they have been experiencing in getting the necessary degree of cooperation from the Greek authorities. Inadequate cooperation has been given not only to them but to Australian judicial bodies, in this case the Coroner's Court in Victoria. In 1998 the Victorian Coroner issued an order, which I am quite happy to provide to the Attorney-General, for the supply of a significant amount of information. Well over a year later, that order was—through the efforts of the Australian post in Athens, I think—largely complied with but not completely, according to my information. On 4 September 2000, the Victorian Coroner's Court issued a quite detailed request—which once again I would be happy to provide to the Attorney-General—for further information. This request relates to obtaining statements by homicide police officers, the harbourmaster of the port of Rafina and forensic examiners, telephone records and the like. From the detail that the Victorian Coroner is seeking, clearly he is satisfied that there are substantive matters for him to look at, yet this considerable time later we do not seem to be getting anywhere through the post in Athens with the appropriate Greek authorities.
This is not a matter of an Australian investigating body seeking to put its nose directly into a matter that ought properly to be within the investigative jurisdiction of an overseas country. We have a situation where clearly the way in which Australian courts, in this case the Coroner's Court in Victoria, seek to carry out their work is not being successful in the way it ought to be. Certainly there is some criticism by the family and by the family solicitor of the way in which DFAT has operated in this matter. They are matters I will raise more directly with the Minister for Foreign Affairs at a later stage in this process. Meanwhile, I take this opportunity to raise this matter with the Attorney-General. He would not be briefed on it at this point, I am sure; nonetheless, the opportunity is too useful to miss. I raise this general matter with him and will seek his advice in due course. 
The solicitor for the family, in correspondence with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 5 March this year, has also raised the question of the circumstances in which the Australian Federal Police might be able to liaise with Greek police in matters of this type. The solicitor for the family refers to a report in 1997 by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee which refers specifically to the disappearance of David Lindner in Iran. That report stated that the presence and liaison of the AFP officer in Nicosia:
... encouraged Iranians in their endeavours, and kept that case going when otherwise it might well have ceased to be in the in tray.
The family is drawing a comparison with the circumstance of that investigation where, apparently, a foreign jurisdiction was encouraged by its relationship with the AFP to more vigorously pursue an investigation. The suggestion is very strongly made that there may well be a role for the AFP in this case, in terms of encouraging the Greek authorities to, frankly, get off their backsides and handle this matter with the diligence it deserves. That certainly has not been the case. I will raise some of those matters with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but it would be most helpful, at this point, to get the Attorney-General's view on the general position of his portfolio in these sorts of circumstances, and, in due course, to seek his more detailed advice.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2001-06-20,"—There is one matter that I wish to raise relating to the funding of legal aid, and that is with respect to family law. I raised this matter in the same debate a couple of years ago with the Attorney-General, and got what I thought was a completely unsatisfactory answer. The answer was that all I was seeking to do was to line the pockets of family law lawyers. The particular issue that I am concerned about is the number of—mostly male—non-custodial parents who find themselves in the Family Court unable to afford proper representation and unable to get legal aid. They usually face their spouse, who does have legal aid and is therefore at a considerable advantage. Many of them run up bills of $10,000 to $20,000 before they realise that their lack of legal aid is going to leave them bankrupt if they persist; they then start to represent themselves and the results of that are normally fairly dreadful. They enter the court and they believe that they are going to get justice. They raise a series of matters that they believe are important and relevant and find that, as far as the court is concerned, they are totally irrelevant, and this adds to their disillusionment and disenchantment.
I realise that it would be extremely difficult for the Commonwealth to get itself into the situation of funding both sides of actions, the progress of which is determined by the parties, and that the parties in these situations are at odds with each other and are not necessarily going to behave reasonably, and the costs could be quite inordinate. There is one proposal that I put to the Attorney-General a couple of years ago, and I would like his comments on it now—even if he is not going to comment on the need for more legal aid assistance funding. That is a proposal to allow the cost of family law—at least for an initial set of orders—to be treated as a charge against the assets of the marriage. So that both parties, if they are seeking to preserve as much of the assets of a marriage as they can, would then have a motive for settling the matter, and it would not be a situation where one side was represented and the other side could not afford to be. I think that would be beneficial, I think it is worthy of some exploration and I would be very grateful for the Attorney-General's views on it.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2001-2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,18,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2001-06-20,"—In response to the member for Maribyrnong, I can mention a few things. He correctly surmised that I am not briefed on the particular case. We have had some problems in dealing with Greek authorities in relation to criminal matters. It has not been an entirely satisfactory relationship generally. 
—Is there a treaty?
—Off the top of my head, I am not aware whether there is either an extradition treaty or a mutual assistance in criminal matters treaty. Certainly, we have the capacity, through the AFP, to provide assistance to criminal authorities in Greece if it is requested. Here, the circumstances seem to be the other way around—although the offence is committed in Greece, the investigation is in Australia. I would be happy if the member for Maribyrnong were to either write or speak to me, to my office or the department about the circumstances. Basically, dealing with the Greek authorities is the responsibility of DFAT. The AFP has liaison officers in a number of different locations around the world, as the member for Maribyrnong is probably aware. They may be able to provide some assistance if the requisite action is not being taken in Greece. I issue an invitation to the member to raise the matter in a formal way.
On the subject of legal aid, raised by the member for Kingston, the circumstances in relation to legal aid that pertained two years ago are really quite different now. It has been the case for some time that issues relating to contact with children between warring spouses have been a running sore in members' and senators' electorate offices. Within the last two years, we have taken two major steps that we hope will alleviate some of the problems. One difficulty that many separating spouses face is the cost of proceedings in the Family Court. Specifically to address that problem—where, for example, a father goes to a lawyer and is told that he will have to put down $10,000 in order to commence a case in the Family Court and he will probably have to pay more, when all that he is seeking is regular contact with his children—we have established the Federal Magistrates Service, which is specifically designed to provide a cheaper, faster and simpler service. In fact, it is doing that. It has been a very successful institution and is now readily accessed both by lawyers and by unrepresented litigants.
The second step that we have taken is to amend the Family Law Act to make provision for better enforcement of orders relating to contact with children. We have instituted a three-step process under which, at the time of separation, the parents are given some counselling. If there is a subsequent breach of the order, they may be ordered to participate in a counselling process. If breaches continue, at the third step there may be penalties invoked. It only came into operation at the end of last year, so it has not had a long time in operation in order to test the effectiveness of it, but we will obviously be monitoring the process to see how it is working.
On the proposal specifically mentioned by the member for Kingston to allow the cost of the initial set of orders to be a charge against the assets of the marriage, my initial reaction is that this is unlikely to work. It does not seem to be a matter of money for many of the people who have intractable problems, particularly in relation to residence of, and contact with, the children. I do not specifically recall this proposal being raised two years ago, but we will look at it and, if we see any merit in it, we will see what can be done. 
The difficulty will be that the parties will have, at some stage, divided the assets, and most of the problems do not seem to arise in relation to contact where one party is legally aided and the other is not at the time of separation, they seem to arise further down the track when the parties have been separated for some time and the property has been divided. It is a complex issue that we will never fully address, but the measures I have mentioned—the creation of the Federal Magistrates Service and the three-step enforcement of contact orders process—will assist. The syndrome of the male `non-custodial'—that is the word used by the member for Kingston; I would urge him not to refer to `custody' but to refer to `residence', as the 1995 amendments of the Family Law Act do—parent being unable to afford legal aid with the spouse having legal aid is not as common a situation, I suspect, as is represented. While there is no doubt both merits and demerits on both sides of the issue, legal aid is not the only thing that is going to resolve the issues between parents who are squabbling over the custody or residence of their children. 
In this context, we anticipate in the very near future a report from a body set up by the former Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, and me called the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group. That body was set up to look at the routes taken by participants in the family law system and how we can better direct people to resolve their issues without ending up in court or in dispute. We look forward with some hope to that report providing a better means for resolving those sorts of issues.
