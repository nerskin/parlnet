"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-11-12,"—I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of the Eastern Region Operations Centre at RAAF Base Williamtown, NSW.
The Department of Defence proposes to construct new facilities in the operational zone on the base. This will enable No. 41 Wing Headquarters and No. 3 Control and 
 Reporting Unit to be collocated and integrated, leading to operational efficiencies, and will replace existing unsatisfactory accommodation occupied by No. 3 Control and Reporting Unit at Duckhole Hill near the base.
The proposal will provide administrative, operational, technical and training accommodation for the two units, which will have a combined strength of 170 personnel.
The estimated out-turn cost of the proposal is $18 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction would commence in November 1998 and be completed by March 2000.
The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 30 June 1998, recommended the construction of these facilities and commented that it is both necessary and urgent for state, local government and the Commonwealth to address the question of responsibilities and combine forces to undertake flood mitigation measures. The department agrees with the recommendations of the committee.
I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,24,1,speech
"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—Naturally, we on this side of the House are not going to oppose this motion—indeed, we welcome it—but we want to express our concern about the unnecessary delay.
As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration said, the Public Works Committee tabled their report in the parliament on 30 June. In the lead-up to the presentation of the report, with the whiff of an election in the air, the Public Works Committee worked very hard to bring this report down. It was not only the committee members themselves who worked quickly on the report; the staff of the secretariat also worked quickly on it. We knew how important and necessary this facility at Williamtown was—that had been stressed to us.
The report was tabled on 30 June and there were four parliamentary sitting days after that. What always happens with these expediency motions is that the Public Works Committee report is presented one day and the minister or the parliamentary secretary comes in the next day. What happened with this report? It 
 sat on the desk of the Minister for Finance and Administration. He did not know it was there. The parliament was sitting. The report was bought down on Tuesday, 30 June. Parliament sat on the Wednesday and Thursday. We also sat on the Friday. We made telephone calls asking: `Where is the report? Where is the expediency motion?' People were waiting.
We were told that this was urgent work that needed to be done. There were local contractors ready to take up contracts. Everything was there. Then I thought: `Oh, well. It's not lost.' If you remember, we came back on 15 July. I thought: `Oh, well, surely the minister or one of his parliamentary secretaries will come in.' They did not bother to come in. The point is this: this work has been unnecessarily delayed now for something like six months. The facilities are urgently needed.
I do not want to go on to the next motion, but I want to say this: this project will cost $18 million. The next one that we will deal with, RAAF Base Amberley, will cost $73 million. This is $91 million dollars worth of work but, because of the sloth of this government, or the minister involved, or because of their non-attention to the detail of their work, this work has been delayed. This is the crowd that is always telling us how important defence matters are and how important it is to have these facilities. These are urgently needed facilities but, because of the sloth or the non-concern of those on the other side, especially the office of the Minister for Finance and Administration, they have been delayed. I think they should be condemned.
We on this side of the House welcome the fact that, at long last, after a six-month delay, the work at Williamtown will start. It is long overdue.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,24,1,speech

But it is only now, after finally being approved—and never opposed by the opposition; as a matter of fact it was recommended by the opposition that it proceed—that the government is going to proceed with it.
If we took a purely cynical point of view we could only assume that this is another show of the indifference this government has to the plight of the Hunter.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—The Wool International Amendment Bill 1998  which we are debating here today amends the Wool International Act of 1993 and gives effect to the Howard government's decision to free sales from the stockpile managed by Wool International until 30 June 1999. The bill also provides for Wool International to support and meet the cost of privatisation of the stockpile. The government stated its intention to proceed down that path when it made its announcement to freeze the wool stockpile some months ago.
Before I proceed to debate this bill, I wish to place on the public record my disappointment at the manner in which the opposition has been treated by the government in preparing for this very important debate. I am prepared to give the new Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry the benefit of the doubt on most matters, as the new minister seems to be a fairly decent bloke. I find it hard to entertain the thought that he is motivated by any malevolent intent.
However, if I rule the line on any malevolent intent, I am left to conclude that it was 
 confusion and incompetence yet again from the Howard government that led to the situation where I received a one-page, four-line brief on this legislation at 7.30 on the night before the government tabled this legislation in the House, and a copy of the legislation barely two hours before the minister introduced it into the parliament.
That is not good enough. On these matters of considerable importance to wool growers and to the industry generally I would have thought it would have been appropriate for the government to give us a substantial brief and a copy of the legislation long before it did. I put it on the public record that the minister has the full resources of the very professional federal government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
The minister has the support of at least 10 eager advisers, all keeping a watchful eye on a reinvigorated opposition which is about to take power again in the next 18 months, and yet we received a one-page brief on the legislation the night before it was introduced into the House, and a copy of the legislation barely two hours before it was tabled in this parliament. Apparently, the minister saw fit to make a copy of the bill available to the Democrats early on Tuesday afternoon in the other place, but he could not extend to the opposition the same courtesy that he was prepared to offer to the Democrats.
This is not an innocuous piece of legislation. It is a very important piece of legislation for one of Australia's great industries—the wool growers and their families who make a living in that industry. The wool industry was one of the mainstay industries in rural Australia well before the turn of the century, as it still is today. Its growth and development has not only supported many rural and regional communities down through the years, but its ability to earn export income for the nation has also been very important.
Indeed, the wool industry is well entrenched in the folklore of the nation in the expression that Australia rides—or, indeed, in the past `rode'—on the sheep's back. But the wool industry today is an industry in great difficulty. It is facing substantial challenges in the marketplace which many within the industry 
 itself consider it ill-equipped to meet. Wool faces intense competition from cotton and synthetic fibres, the latter being able to compete in the marketplace sometimes at a third of the cost of wool. The demand for apparel wool is falling at a disturbing rate, which has promoted an intense debate over appropriate marketing and promotional strategies for the industry as it enters the new millennium.
The Asian and global economic downturn has led to significant falls in demand in key European and Asian markets such as Japan and Korea. A combination of these short- and long-term factors has produced a situation at present where large sections of the industry are facing enormous economic pressures from declining demand and lower market prices.
The wool industry has already undergone a considerable process of adjustment over the past decade. In 1990, Australia had 170 million sheep producing over one million tonnes of wool. Currently, Australia has about 120 million sheep producing 650,000 tonnes of wool. In 1990, for example, China, which is currently our largest customer, produced seven per cent of the world wool clip. Today, that nation produces 13 per cent of the total world wool clip.
There are quite fundamental forces at work shaping the future directions of this industry. A key question we need to ask ourselves today is whether the government's decision to freeze the wool stockpile which is enshrined in the legislation before us—a decision which has been condemned by very important sections of the industry—adds to its capacity in any way to cope with the forces which will shape its fortunes in the new millennium. The opposition's view is that the legislation today does very little in that regard.
It is important to appreciate that the issue of the disposing of the stockpile is but one dimension to a set of problems currently faced by the industry, some of which I have alluded to already. In 1989-90 the wool stockpile was negligible but growing as a result of the reserve price scheme. During 1990-91 the stockpile grew rapidly to around 4.7 million bales against a backdrop of falling prices, which continued falling during the first half 
 of the 1990s before recovering slowly in 1996-97 and then falling again in 1997-98.
In response to the stockpile problem, Labor legislated in 1994 for a fixed schedule of sales to dispose of the stockpile, a principle that was accepted by the coalition when they came to power in 1996. Several amendments have been made to the original wool bill, building into the disposal mechanism of Wool International a legislative requirement that an appropriate balance must be struck between disposal of the stockpile and the new wool coming into the market from producers, to maximise returns to growers and the value of their equity in the stockpile.
I think it is fair comment to say that Wool International has managed that flexibility in a market sensitive manner within the legislative constraints that have been imposed upon it. While many in the industry did not like the market situation that they were forced to operate in, they viewed the programmed disposal of the stockpile as the best available solution to the industry's oversupply difficulties. It delivered programmed and foreseeable elimination of the stockpile by 31 December 2000. It also delivered a degree of stability and certainty to key players in the industry, to producers, marketers and processors.
The fundamental problem faced by the industry is simply that, while there is less wool being offered for sale, the price received by growers has declined, which is evidence of a serious problem being faced on the demand side of the market equation. As far as wool stocks are concerned, it is estimated by ABARE that the official stockpile of 1.08 million bales has now been overtaken by stocks held by growers and brokers of more than 1.1 million bales. The amount of spring shorn wool coming into store is likely to increase the stockpile held by growers and brokers.
The ABARE analysis indicates that poor prices were the main factor driving the growth of the private stockpile and that farmers with mixed cropping and wool producing businesses were the ones storing most of the wool. High relative grain prices have increased the financial capacity of those growers to store their wool and to pursue more flexible mar 
 keting strategies in response to price movements. The ABARE analysis also showed that the composition of the on-farm stockpile is quite different from Wool International's stockpile profile. This is an important point to consider in assessing the efficacy of the freeze decision. The majority of wool in the Wool International stockpile is 21 to 23 microns, while over 50 per cent of the standard group and wool held on-farm is 21.5 microns or finer. Given all these factors, there are many people in the industry questioning whether the focus on the stockpile is indeed the main event or is merely the sideshow.
There are some very cogent reasons why the freeze decision should not have been taken. This decision is one of the worst examples of policy on the run we have seen from this government. We have seen policy bungles in aged care, for example, in the last parliament, with about 12 policy backflips before the government actually settled its position. It managed in that policy area to create massive confusion among groups comprising the aged care industry, and its incompetence has created uncertainty and long-term damage to that constituency. We have had further policy bungles on the waterfront, we have an absolute shambles in the Job Network area and now, to compound it all, we have the wool stockpile.
Policy on the run is invariably bad policy, and it is a hallmark of the Howard government that it has time and time again proved its incapacity to rationally think through positions, to sift through the various propositions that are put by people from the industry sector and to come up with a rational and reasonable government response to very difficult situations. In this instance, the government was not motivated by that cool assessment of how this industry should cope with its current situation or how it should move in the future. It was motivated by political panic, and that is the very worst basis on which you can possibly make a decision. 
—Absolute rubbish!
—We know that the position of the member for Wannon is a little bit different from that of the member for 
 Corangamite on how this issue should have been resolved. They are both Liberal backbenchers and they have a long and honoured history of association with this particular industry. I guess that particular division between those two backbench members indicates just how difficult a process it has been for the government to come to terms rationally with the problems that have been faced by this industry. But in reality the coalition sat like frightened rabbits in the One Nation spotlight. That was the basis on which this decision was made, and you cannot run away from it. They sat there quivering in the One Nation spotlight, and at the first sound of gunfire they ran for the rabbit hole.
Wool growers of this nation expect a little better from any government in power. They expect a cool and rational assessment of the problems of the industry and a cool and rational response. On this occasion they got a knee-jerk response to a very important issue to the wool industry. We in the opposition ask this very simple question: if freezing the stockpile was such good industry policy why didn't the former minister take that proposal to cabinet? Why didn't he take that freeze proposal to cabinet? He did not. He knew the industry believed it was dopey policy. He had an alternative that he believed was in the best interests of wool growers. That is what he took to the cabinet and he was rolled by the Prime Minister and indeed he was rolled by the backbench committee. The Prime Minister was got at by the backbench wool committee in the coalition and the National Party ministers just rolled over.
I say this to the National Party ministers and the National Party backbench members: who rolled you on this issue? Liberal lawyers, Liberal businessmen and Liberal stockbrokers all hopped in and rolled National Party farmers who, when the spotlight was put on them, went weak at the knees and could not stand up and hold sway in the cabinet and get a proposal that those National Party ministers knew was in the best interests of wool growers. We got policy on the run, a frightened response to very deep problems in the wool industry and the worst possible decisions that you could imagine.
We believe it is bad policy because of the damage it caused to the industry's credibility among buyers of the stockpile wool. Historically these buyers have been suspicious of precipitous government decision making. It has taken some laborious work by many players in the industry to restore our broken credibility since the accumulation of this massive stockpile. Many buyers of the stockpile wool have significant investments in plant and equipment to handle the wool. As members would know, stockpile wool can be six to seven years old and has been triple packed. It has to be opened and treated carefully for grease and lanoline build up. And many processors have invested in warm rooms and steam injecting equipment so that they can use the stockpile wool in their industrial process.
But that has all been done at a cost. This precipitous government decision has literally destroyed the credibility of the government and the industry in the eyes of these buyers. That is a problem you are going to have to deal with in future. Your decision has literally set the industry back a decade. There is a very real danger that many of these buyers will simply turn to synthetic fibres and cotton in their industrial process.
—What would you know about it?
—Rubbish!
—Then there is the question of the staff of Wool International. In case the honourable member for Corangamite and the honourable member for Wannon have not cottoned onto it, there is a human dimension in the decision that was taken to freeze the wool stockpile. I understand that there are 63 people on the staff of that body. They are highly skilled in the areas of appraisal, information technology and the treasury functions. They have been put on long-term contracts. We believe that it would have been in the interests of the industry for that expertise to have been retained.
Some farm organisations have put the cost to wool growers of the decision to freeze in the region of $16 to $18 million up to $30 million. We could call the freeze the $30 million decision by the Howard government. 
 The only possible economic reason that you could proceed to freeze the stockpile is that you are absolutely confident that the decision would significantly lead to a rise in prices. You have to balance the short-term against the long-term considerations. This is what the New South Wales wool growers had to say about the situation:
From past history there is every chance that a freeze will produce little or no improvement in wool prices as other factors take effect. However, a 12 months freeze would result in further instability in the market, a reduction in the value of Wool International equity and the likelihood of further uncertainty in July 1999 as arrangements are reviewed.
I am asking those members of the coalition here today: do you agree with the New South Wales wool growers, or don't you? They have stated very clearly that they have some very real concerns about the measures that you have taken.
There were some discreet advantages of the stockpile plan as it existed. It provided market certainty and predictability, it restored our credibility, the credibility of the industry and the government in the eyes of buyers and it represented a disciplined plan to rid the industry once and for all of the stockpile.
I want to take the minister to task for some of the matters that he raised in his speech. He said:
The government's decision to freeze stockpile sales through to 30 June 1999 was a response to this request from the industry . . .
I am wondering who indeed did request this. Was it the Wool Council of Australia? Was it Wool International? Was it the Australian Council of Wool Exporters? Was it state wool grower bodies in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland? Was it the New South Wales Farmers Federation? I would like the minister and the government to clarify for me and for the wool growers in this industry just exactly who made this request for the stockpile freeze.
The minister goes on to state in his speech that this will:
. . . end the debate about the management of the stockpile . . .  

I think we will still be having the debate about how we handle the rest of the stockpile for many months to come because the program of disposal that we had all signed up to has now been seriously disturbed. He says:
The freeze will allow the industry some breathing space—an opportunity to focus on real issues such as how to increase demand, how to increase farm productivity, how to improve the quality of our wool to better meet customer requirements.
These are long-term issues. You could have added half a dozen more propositions, because it is time the government exercised its authority in setting a framework and encouraging people to come to the table and express a vision for their industry; not just to limit the discussion to a few real issues but to go into the length and breadth of what this industry requires to get it back to being one of the top, if not the number one, rural industry in this nation.
I take issue with the minister regarding the statement that he makes that it is both possible and prudent to suspend stockpile sales. I understand that, before the cabinet decision was taken, there were 11 bodies in the room giving the minister advice and nine of those said, `Don't freeze it in the way that you are proposing to; let it continue to trade.' Nine out of the 11—
—How many were wool growers?
—How many were wool growers? I am not quite sure who was there. Do you know who was there?
—I said: how many were wool growers?
—Were you there around the table? The honourable member for Wannon might be able to tell us who was actually at the table. You have to understand also that, if we are going to find solutions to the problems facing this industry, all dimensions of the industry have to be consulted and have to sign up.
As far as the privatisation proposal is concerned, Labor established Wool International in 1993 to discharge the $2.28 billion debt accumulated in acquiring the stockpile and to dispose of the 3.9 million bales of 
 wool which, at that time, constituted the stockpile. On both counts the structure set up by Labor has been demonstrably successful. The debt was reduced to $250 million and the stockpile was reduced to 1.08 million bales. The net assets, including the stockpile, now stand in the region of $529 million. Labor's 1993 act went on to detail a very clear process with a very clear time line for the eventual privatisation of the stockpile. These provisions were removed by this government last year. In their place, we are offered a vague commitment to begin the process of demutualisation. There are few details and the industry is asking some very serious questions about this proposal.
This bill gives few real clues as to how this minister intends to take Wool International down the privatisation road. Labor had a clear, unambiguous vision for a privatised stockpile, and we are now left wondering what sort of vision this minister has. The bill before the House requires Wool International to cooperate fully with the minister to plan for and set up a registered company to take over the assets and liabilities of Wool International. It requires Wool International to meet both its own and the Commonwealth's expenses in the process.
We are assuming that the intention is still to privatise Wool International by converting grower equity into shares in the privatised companies. However, there is nothing in the bill to make this necessarily the case. Those provisions were deleted from the original act last year. The former minister was forthcoming with his intention with regard to privatisation as recently as 15 October when he said in a press release that Wool International would be replaced by a private shareholding company, with shares allocated on the basis of individual equity entitlements in the stockpile. This proposition would appear to be supported by the minister in his second reading speech, but we hope that the proposal he is putting accords with the model set out by Labor in 1993.
In his second reading speech, the current minister said that the government has asked the Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing to examine the most efficient and effective 
 method of transferring stockpile responsibilities to Wool International equity holders. The bill is light on detail in this respect, and there are many significant questions remaining to be answered.
There have been some fairly harsh words said by players in the industry about the government's handling of this whole issue. The Courier Mail described the freeze as `sheer panic' and `policy on the run'. The Executive Director of the Wool Council said:
It offers no relief to cash-strapped growers and there is no guarantee of any increase in prices. It also creates great uncertainty in the international marketplace, which has become increasingly concerned at the constant government changes to stockpile policy.
The VFF Pastoral Group Wool Committee member, Rob Tehan, had this to say:
The value of growers' equity in the stockpile will be diminished over time with interest, other holding costs increased and market overhang compounded.
The New South Wales Farmers Association attacked the freeze decision, saying:
The government has badly misjudged the issue and sacrificed the long-term interests of the wool industry for short-term political agendas within the coalition.
We propose an amendment that gives expression to the sentiments that have been expressed on this matter and to raise some matters concerning the detail of the privatisation proposal. I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst supporting the principle of privatisation of Wool International, the House calls on the Government to introduce provisions which will:
(1)	 provide for Wool International to continue sales from the wool stockpile at least to accommodate interest payments on stockpile debt, and associated costs of maintaining the selling infrastructure of the stockpile;
(2)	 maintain the client base of Wool International and the credibility of both the Government and the industry in dealing consistently with those clients;
(3)	 ensure the retention of the core expertise in Wool International to assist any non-government entity constituted to further dispose of the stockpile; 

(4)	 ensure that the privatisation process will be an open, transparent process along the lines proposed by the ALP in the 1993 Act;
(5)	 include details of a mechanism to allow growers to exit from the privatised entity if they do not wish to participate;
(6)	 take into account and protect the position of those growers who have borrowed against the security of Wool International entitlements;
(7)	 ensure that all wool buyers will have equal access in a transparent process should the Government decide to sell the entire stockpile in one lot"".
That amendment is being circulated in my name for the information of honourable members. We vigorously debate the decisions which government takes. But, at the end of the day, I address these words to members opposite: you must make some very clear decisions about where you want this industry to go. It is the role of government to clearly articulate where it wants this industry to be in five and 10 years time. There is nothing in the decisions you have taken, in your public pronouncements, to indicate to those on this side of the House, nor to the industry, that you have come to grips at all with the new promotional and marketing requirements of this industry. I have not read anything that you have said to show that you acknowledge the momentous changes that are taking place in the culture of production and the culture of growers. There are some very interesting things happening. (Time expired)

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1998-11-12,"—In listening to the member for Corio, I must admit that I was slightly amused. I realise that he is new in his job as the shadow minister and we should really make some concessions because of that, but I thought his lack of knowledge and understanding of the wool industry was very disappointing. I think it is very sad that the Labor Party could not find someone with a better understanding of the wool industry to take on this job.
I also found it rather petty when he began his comments by saying that he had not been 
 given due warning about this  Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 . You have known for weeks—in fact, you have probably known for a couple of months—that this legislation would be introduced and put through the parliament very quickly. If you read the press release from the Prime Minister on 1 October, he said, very clearly, under the heading `Wool Stockpile':
The Government remains committed to its decision to freeze sales from the wool stockpile.
If the Coalition is returned to Government, legislation to implement the freeze will be introduced as a priority when Parliament resumes after the election.
It could not be any clearer: `as a priority when parliament resumes'. That was stated on 1 October, and you said you did not know about it.
We received a bit of a history lesson from the honourable member for Corio, but a lot was left out. I think it is worth reminding all honourable members about the role of the Labor Party with regard to the problems which the wool industry currently faces. Labor had many years to do something for the wool industry and all it did was to compound problem after problem.
When we talk about credibility, it was the Labor Party which shot the credibility of the wool industry. It was the Labor Party which changed the legislation back in the late 1980s which led to that unrealistic floor price. It was the Labor Party which dropped the price from 870c to 700c. It was the Labor Party minister who went around the world and said, `This is a cast-iron guarantee that I will not drop it again,' and within a matter of months he had done so. And we talk about credibility! What about the amount of money lost by some of the European processors because they believed John Kerin? Don't ever come into this chamber and talk about credibility. The Labor Party ought to be utterly ashamed of itself having regard to what it has done to this industry.
I know that you are new in this job. I realise you may not have been following wool  
 matters until very recently, but I suggest that you read a bit more about it. I think you would then be somewhat more circumspect in your comments about who has shot the credibility of wool in the eyes of other people in the world.
—I suggest to the honourable member that he should direct his remarks through the chair.
—Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. When we look at the reasons why the government has taken this decision, we see that there are very cogent reasons why we should have this freeze, contrary to what the opposition has been saying. We listened to the opposition spokesman talking about his concerns for various people. It is funny that there are 50,000 wool growers and he does not seem to be able to talk about them very much. It is very interesting. Talk about getting your priorities right; we are concerned about the future for wool growers. If there is no future for wool growers, there is not much future for the rest of the industry, either. It was very sad to listen to the Labor spokesman talking down the industry. It certainly adds nothing to the future of the wool industry.
—You ran scared. That's what really happened. You ran scared.
—Order! The honourable member for Corio has had his turn.
—It was interesting to hear him talking about figures. He had great difficulty working out what it would mean to freeze the stockpile until 30 June. He mentioned figures of between $16 million and $30 million. He obviously has not done his homework. He ought to be aware that, if the price of wool increases by about 8c a kilogram over the period of the freeze, that will more than offset the cost of the freeze. I have a chart here which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The chart read as follows—

—It shows very clearly on two occasions what the freeze will do. If you go back to the beginning of August, when the government announced the freeze, you can see from this chart that the price of wool actually jumped. When the election was announced and the freeze did not proceed immediately, the price of wool then fell significantly. When the government was re-elected and it was made clear that the freeze would proceed, we again saw the price of wool recover, and it has been recovering since. It is still at a very low level. It is at a significantly lower level than when the freeze was first announced. But because the Labor Party refused to give its endorsement to the freeze, you could say that that was a factor in seeing the wool price continuing to slide until the government was re-elected and it could be reconfirmed that what the Prime Minister said on 1 October was to be introduced. Therefore, the Labor Party does have a lot to answer for in that regard.
This amendment is a pious amendment. Obviously the government will not accept it. It is interesting to note some of the points in it. Apparently the opposition supports the principle of privatisation. There is no mention of a time frame here, so we are not clear as to whether or not they will in fact support the time frame that has been proposed by the government.
The other point I would make to the opposition is the extraordinary emphasis on the role of government. I would have thought the most important thing government could do is get out of the way of an industry. The more government gets out of the way, the more the industry will prosper.
I come to this debate as a fourth generation wool grower and I am proud of it. I would like to commend the new Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for the way he has moved quickly to stamp his seal on this portfolio by taking decisive action over the whole wool stockpile. With the strong leadership that is being shown by the new minister, by the Prime Minister and by the government, I think the wool industry can now start to plan, with some confidence, what it can do to pick up from what has been a very difficult 
 few years. In the future we will look back on this time and say, `Those were the dark years of wool.' I am confident that from here we can expect to see very good improvement.
The key points in the minister's second reading speech pointed out that the time has come for this privatisation process. The stockpile is now significantly more valuable than the debt and there really is no ongoing justification for government to be involved in its management. In a press release on 11 November 1998 the minister said:
This Bill starts the process of privatising the stockpile which will allow it to be managed on a purely commercial basis by a private sector entity in which the Directors will be responsible to the shareholders who own the stockpile.
That makes it very clear where the responsibility should be and, as the minister points out, it will be managed on a commercial basis—those are very important words. The press release goes on to say:
The industry will then be able to take charge of managing its own affairs, a theme consistent with Government and woolgrowers' objectives.
Contrary to what the opposition spokesman had to say, the government has a clear plan on the privatisation process and `the Office of Asset Sales has been instructed to examine the most efficient and effective method of transferring stockpile responsibilities to Wool International equity holders and to keep the costs to a prudent minimum'. That could not be clearer. The press release also says:
The Government's role will be to hand over the business of Wool International to the new commercial entity which will shape its commercial activities including presenting a business plan to stakeholders in line with normal commercial practice.
I think that is all very clear. I do not know why the opposition have so much difficulty in understanding that. The whole idea of making the stockpile management a commercial one means that, at long last, we will see the stockpile turned into an asset. We understand the reasons why, but the fact is that the liquidation has been going on for long enough and the consequences of the liquidation have been there for everyone to see. It is interesting to note some of the problems which that can create. I allude to a couple of comments that were raised in a recent Four Corners report on the ABC looking at the wool industry where some of the difficulties that Wool International had run into with its methods of selling from the stockpile were highlighted.
I would like to talk a little more about some of the wider issues that affect the wool industry because I think this new commercialised entity provides some opportunities to take what was a liability in many ways and turn it into an asset. When I say `a liability', it is commonsense to realise that when you force Wool International to keep selling into a weak market the results are obvious—the price keeps falling. That is exactly what happened. Every time the market was weak, because Wool International had to meet its obligations of selling certain quantities, it inevitably pushed the price down and there is ample evidence to back that up.
I refer honourable members to page 22 of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation's annual report. This highlights some of the challenges that face the future of the wool industry. I seek leave to have a chart incorporated into Hansard.
Leave granted.
The chart read as follows—

—This chart shows world production of wool, cotton and man-made fibres from 1950 through to today and really does tell a very sad story. It shows that clearly the production of cotton has continued to rise, from a not dissimilar amount to wool back in 1950 to now being significantly many times greater than wool. Man-made fibres have risen at a similar rate, while wool production has been almost static and, in the last few years, has actually been falling. This reinforces that there really do have to be some new directions for the wool industry.
It is not good enough to read in this annual report words like `the production of man-made fibres during 1996 had risen to an estimated 23.2 million tonnes, of which 20.3 were synthetic, a seven per cent increase dominated by polyester'. That is significantly more than the total production of wool and it goes on to talk about the problems facing fine wools. All of that seems to me to be not accepting that the challenge is there to go out and beat these people at the marketing game, rather than just keep referring to the problems. That is another issue that the wool industry is really going to have to face.
I say that, also, against a backdrop which offers some optimism. A chart produced in the very good publication Analysing Agriculture in July this year showed that the world production of wool—I emphasise that word `production'—has actually been less than the consumption of wool for the last year and a half. In other words, the world is actually consuming more wool than is being produced. The difference, obviously, is being filled by stocks. So, if we were to look at the future opportunities for wool, already it is clear that the market is still using more wool than is being produced, and I would have thought that anyone with an eye to marketing would say that represents a very good opportunity. I seek leave to have that chart incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The chart read as follows—

It is for that reason that I get very frustrated when I read some of the so-called wool industry experts' comments about all the problems that the wool industry is facing. When we look at the problems in Asia and so on, it is always difficult and there is always some reason why we cannot do it. I contrast that with the wine industry. There was a big story in the Weekly Times about three weeks ago about how Australian wine sales to Japan have doubled in the last twelve months. I think that tells a very big story: it can be done. All the talk about Japan being in recession—which, clearly, it is—does not mean there are not opportunities there. I think it is time that sort of thinking infected people in the wool industry, because I know there are some who feel that way. There are others who find it too easy to find an excuse. These are the sorts of challenges that are facing the wool industry. They have to be dealt with in a much more positive way than they have been up until now.
The other matter I want to raise is the costs in the wool industry. Again, when people are trying to find problems facing the wool industry, they often overlook the obvious. There was a very good paper produced earlier this year by the ANZ Bank. It was written by Mr Bruce Brown of the Australian Agribusiness Advisory Unit, and was headed `Can the Wool Industry Survive?' He threw out some very good challenges. I have not had time to go through all of them, but one point he alluded to was the cost estimates of handling, selling and distributing cotton from farm gate to mill compared to wool. It was quite an amazing comparison because the differences were nearly double. This shows that we have some real opportunities here if we can focus on those key issues. What I am saying, of course, is that the structures which have been in place have not assisted in getting those improvements and that extra efficiency which, clearly, this industry needs if it is going to survive.
When we look to the future, we must first of all look, in an analytical way, at what has happened in recent times. I think, sadly, the results speak for themselves. It is quite tragic that the industry, as I have pointed out, has 
 been losing market share. Over most of the last eight years, prices have been below the long-term average of production and, yet—in that scenario—market share is being lost and wool growers are finding it extremely difficult to survive. In fact, many have not.
The paper by Mr Brown of the ANZ bank offered some suggestions for the future of the industry. He said:
If the industry is firstly to survive and then prosper, it must be able to develop an efficient low cost wool handling, distribution and processing chain which provides for the timely flow of information. Additionally, the industry as a whole must be able to develop a technology pipeline capable of providing for continuing increases in productivity.
He went on to talk about market focus and to look at: Progressive industry models, such as those developed within the dairy and wine industries—
which—
have involved product enhancement and differentiation, leading to an expansion in market share and the development of price premiums. Certainly profitability attracts capital and quality human resources; but how did these industries achieve a ""market focus""?
One can well remember that the dairy industry, some 14 years ago, was in desperate trouble, yet it turned itself around. It is this opportunity the wool industry has to find. Stockpile management is one step in assisting the industry to do just that. The opposition ought to be commending the government for the action it has taken here, rather than criticising it and putting forward a mealy-mouthed little amendment which really does not say much. The opposition should look at some of the challenges that are in papers like this because there is a great opportunity.
I think that the industry is now starting to come alive. There are progressive wool growers around now who are not prepared to accept the continuing low price and the continuing loss of market share. They believe, very passionately, that there is a strong future for the industry. They certainly believe in what the government is doing. Many of them ring me up and say, `Thank goodness someone has finally done something'. They say that this whole stockpile management is but one step in giving the industry the opportunity to take what has been far too much govern 
 ment involvement—which has been a millstone around the industry's neck—and turn it into a real asset.
I strongly support the minister in what he is doing. I believe it will be the start of a new future for this industry. I urge the opposition to get behind the steps the government is taking, because this is the way we can ensure that wool growers have a future. We have stopped talking about a wool industry; we talk about the future of wool growers—because without wool growers, there is no wool industry.",REPS,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—My congratulations, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, on being back on the Speaker's panel. I was intrigued at the decision to go ahead with the freezing of sales of the wool stockpile. I thought this was only a move to shore up the electoral prospects of a number of National Party and Liberal Party candidates, in view of a move by the Hansonites to squeal about the price of wool during the campaign. That was the only reason. We know that, I think most wool growers know that and most Australians are well aware of that.
I remember a press release just before the election in which Mrs Hanson called for the wool industry to be revamped. She reckoned that the selling of the wool stockpile was forcing price levels down and that if there was a freeze and a small levy made it would lead to an increase in prices. Her somewhat bizarre suggestion was that manufacturers should produce items for distribution for foreign aid rather than providing cash for foreign aid.
I think this must have panicked some of the coalition members and candidates into making that decision. They set out to try to get the sales frozen until after the election, and they were successful in that. But, in the end, Wool International had to continue to sell, through their program and their schedules, because of the lack of any other legislation.
The other part of the bill to privatise Wool International is probably more understandable and may well reflect, I think, the views of producers and shareholders in this industry. They are keen to have more direct control over their industry. I am not sure that this 
 move will necessarily lead to the price of wool rising, but at least growers will not be able to blame anyone else but themselves if prices continue to deteriorate. They need to look to the future and determine where we need to position wool in the marketplace in the longer term.
As to this other business of freezing the sale of the stockpile until next year, the only result I can think of is that it will help those bigger growers and others that may have stockpiles of wool to sell off their own stockpiles and make a few additional dollars at the expense of smaller and non-specialist growers. This is backed up by a press release in February this year in which ABARE said that, in moving to the open market, private stock holdings are likely to take an increasingly important role. It goes on to say:
While prices are expected to improve as wool availability declines and overall wool demand improves, a sharp and sustained increase in wool prices as the stockpile runs down is unlikely.
Some of our private wool stockpilers perhaps want to make sure that they will get an income from their product before the stockpile is brought back into the market. I do know that the industry has some grave doubts about the freezing of the stockpile but that it is prepared to bite the bullet in order to have privatisation started.
According to Wool International's own account—and I found the detail of its legislative functions on the Internet—it was established by the Commonwealth government in 1993. It succeeded the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the AWRC, in managing and selling the stockpile and in repaying the commercial debt which is guaranteed by government.
During 1997-98, Wool International's objectives and functions under the Wool International Act were to undertake the disposal of the stockpile of wool in a manner which would enhance the value of the wool stockpile as much as possible having regard to Wool International's obligation to comply with the disposal schedule. This required Wool International to deliver between 90,000 and 350,000 bales per quarter, and to deliver 
 the last bale of stockpile wool by 31 December 2000.
Wool International is also required to sell the stockpile in a manner that seeks to maximise the value of all wool, to manage the wool stockpile, to buy wool only to the extent necessary to ensure the sale of stockpile wool proceeds according to the disposal schedule and to prepare and implement a strategy for the management and progressive repayment of the accumulated debt. Wool International's target is to eliminate the debt by June 1999. It is to manage wool premises and wool store properties, keep the register of equity holders and distribute the surplus money standing to its credit. Other functions given to Wool International under this or any other act empower it to do everything necessary to meet its functions and objectives. Further, Wool International has a commercial obligation to exercise its powers in a manner consistent with sound commercial principles and practices.
Under the coalition government, the legislative framework under which Wool International operates was amended in June 1997, to take effect from 1 July of that year for the 1997-98 season and beyond. The amendments narrowed its functions to selling the stockpile, eliminating debt and returning surplus funds to wool growers. So its functions were narrowed a year or so ago.
In addition, savings provisions allowed Wool International to undertake market reporting, futures and forwards education and to investigate, subject to ministerial approval, the potential for setting up a wool trading enterprise for wool growers to invest in through a unit trust. These provisions ceased on 30 June 1998. The amendments now also allow for the distribution of equity in Wool International to unit holders and for the winding up of the organisation.
On 30 March 1998, the government extended the debt elimination target by up to six months, to 30 June 1999. This was in response to low wool prices through the March 1998 quarter resulting from weak demand in key markets and the Asian economic situation.
During the year the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 was legislated. It provided a single set of core reporting and auditing requirements for directors of Commonwealth authorities, including Wool International, and set out standards of conduct for officers. This act replaced relevant sections of the Wool International Act, including preparation of an annual report and financial statements.
Wool International is directly responsible to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who is now the Hon. Mark Vaile MP. Under section 58 of the Wool International Act, the minister, after consultation with Wool International, may give it directions relating to the performance of its functions in the public interest. This power was not exercised in the 12-month period to 30 June 1998.
So this current legislation is to move Wool International along the road to allowing growers to control their own destiny. However, the government have provided no detail on how it will be done, except to say that they call on Wool International to assist the government to privatise it, and Wool International will pick up the cost.
But the government, for some extraordinary reason, still wish to freeze the stockpile during this process. The opposition opposes this. The amendment moved by my colleague the member for Corio and shadow minister for agriculture, fisheries and forestry, Mr O'Connor, opposes this freeze, which is a very sensible amendment. A living and active entity is easier to sell than a moribund one, one that is not operating. So it is a case of `We will have a business that is not working and we will sell it.'
I wish to touch on some discussions going on in the wool industry at present. Changes are becoming evident, and there is obviously a need to continue reviewing some of the structures Labor put in place. A research paper entitled Profile of Australian wool producers by ABARE shows that there have been a number of changes over the years and certainly there has been a reduction in the number of farms producing only wool. The paper published results of a survey carried out 
 by ABARE for the purpose of assessing how farms were faring and what was contributing to the success or failure of wool growing establishments. It is very interesting that the member who spoke before me, the member for Wannon, did not mention this.
Only 27 per cent of the current farms are specialist wool producing farms and derive the majority of their income from sheep and wool. They produce about 39 per cent of wool output. The remaining farms receive most of their income from enterprises other than sheep and wool.
The survey also found that 75 per cent of total wool production in 1996-97 was from 37 per cent of farms that produced more than 11,000 kilograms of wool—63 bales. Three-quarters of these are from mixed farms. Larger farms contributed a slightly lower proportion.
Wool still ranks among Australia's most important agricultural commodities. It was worth $4 billion dollars in  1997-98. But it has been going through structural adjustment for some time, like most other industries. Many farmers have moved away from purely wool production and have gone into grains and other livestock, so shorn wool production has fallen from 1,031 kilotons in 1989-90 to 650 kilotons in 1997-98.
In the survey the top performing farms were larger, obtained lower farm receipts from wool, obtained higher receipts per labor unit, and were operated by younger farmers. The survey also showed that the bottom 25 per cent of those farms specialising in wool were operated by older farmers.
There also seemed a definite association between successful farms and those that involved themselves with Landcare, farm planning and management training activities. From these studies, it seems that wool growers need to do a lot more work in restructuring their industry if they are to benefit by the more open market. Maybe the privatisation of Wool International and more work done on drought proofing of properties and marketing the end produce might help this. 
But I still cannot see where the freezing of the sale of the wool stockpile will benefit this process. We are living in a world now where change is much faster, as we all know, where research must keep pace with the changes, and where we cannot afford to protect `the establishment' if they are not performing.
It is also time to start looking at what happens to rural products beyond the farm gate. I think the member for Wannon was starting to get there in his speech prior to mine, but I think he was still a little bit away from that point. We should be having a say not only how it goes from the gate but where it goes, how it is marketed, who is buying it and what can be done to increase the sales.
Brand names have always been important and are even more so now. We also need to move into niches where we can thrive. One area has been developing tops factories in Australia. The ones I know of are in the Geelong area, in the electorate of the honourable member for Corio which I have visited and, just latterly, in the old Coats Paton factory in Launceston in the seat of Bass a topping operation has stared up. Considerable funds have been invested there and it is now beginning to prove its worth. This is innovative process in the wool industry which is looking to the future and looking to production in Australia and having some knowledge of the broader range of the industry. Some years ago, not many people knew a lot about manufacturing of wool in Australia.
There are great opportunities for the future of wool, I believe. But it is about marketing and it is coming up against the competition of man-made fibres and cotton. It is up to the industry, through marketing and placing the product in the world marketplace, to sell more wool. I believe there are opportunities throughout the world for that to happen.
The Asian crisis has been cited as keeping down the price of wool. Maybe that has contributed but, apart from Japan, few others in this region have been big wool users. I think there have got to be some good expansion opportunities, particularly in China, for different levels of wool and these need to be further explored constantly. I think this marketing and restructuring is very important 
 to the industry. I think the growers are right. There are growers who are saying that they want to have more say in their industry. That is fair enough, and we should move towards that goal.
Judging by a lot of the comments from the other side, I think it is really very hypocritical in its approach. The honourable member for Wannon's comments about ex-minister John Kerin were very unfair and unjust. He was a very fine minister of primary industry. Many industries in that sector went through major restructurings under his leadership, restructurings that needed to happen. I think the criticism of that market price is very unjust and is a political issue that is being used very unfairly by the member for Wannon. It takes away from his credibility as a person to attack John Kerin in that way.
I believe the amendment the opposition has moved to remove a part of the legislation talks of the freezing of the sale of the stockpile, and I believe most growers would like it to be that way as well. It makes more sense for the entity to continue to operate while negotiations continue to work up a situation where privatisation can take place. That would be the most sensible response to the wool industry today, but the government has failed this early in its new term to be able to come to grips with that.
Some of the lazy old backbenchers from the National Party and Liberal Party have failed to stand up in their party rooms and do anything for the wool growers of Australia. They have been telling the people for years that they represent them, but when it really gets to the crunch, when it really gets to where an industry has to grow, looking at industry plans and opportunities, they have failed the test. These backbenchers—and there are two or three of them here at the moment—have failed to get up in the party room and stake a place for their region and the wool growers by saying, `We should be continuing to have Wool International operate until we do get to a position where we have the plans and the consultancies in place to give us the information to privatise it.' That is what should have happened, but they failed to the test.
I support the amendment. I believe the opposition's position is the best one. The amendment is showing the wool growers and the people that rely on wool in this country—and many people make their living from wool—that the opposition's position is a much clearer and better one than the government's.",REPS,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Forrest, John, MP",NP,1998-11-12,"—I am very pleased to stand here in defence of the Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 . I have to say right from the outset how disappointing it was to hear those remarks from the member for Corio and the member for Lyons. I am standing here, as the member for Mallee, with the previous speaker, the member for Wannon. Between the two of us our electorates cover the entire half of western Victoria. Couple these electorates with that of the member for Ballarat—who would love to be in here speaking in support of us but gives his moral support to this legislation—and the three of us represent the great bulk of the wool industry in Victoria. That is a large number of growers, and for the member for Corio, the shadow minister, and the member for Lyons to come in here and accuse us of not standing up for our constituency is the most unadulterated dribble I have ever heard.
This matter has received an incredible amount of public debate in the last three or four months, and I have come to this parliament having been re-elected with a commitment to the growers of the southern Wimmera that this would be the first piece of legislation we would consider—and we are doing that. If the Australian Labor Party was so convinced, in respect of the comments they have made in this debate, why is it opposing the freeze of the stockpile?
The member for Wannon has already incorporated in Hansard the schedule for the eastern market indicator which shows the impacts on the wool price. When the government announced its intention in the middle of August, there was an immediate rise in the indicator. It was of some regret that Wool International chose not to support the government's clearly indicated public position on that. After that short rise, when releases from the stockpile recommenced, the indicator 
 went into free fall, and I just think it is absolute nonsense for both of those members to come into this chamber and ignore that fact.
This legislation does not make out that freezing the stockpile solves all the problems of the Australian wool industry. The previous speakers have overlooked two things. The member for Corio spoke about 63 people, the staff of Wool International. He seems to forget there are in excess of 50,000 wool growers in Australia, probably representing in excess of 100,000 to 150,000 people.
I am really wondering how many wool growers he knows personally and what he knows of the financial struggle that many of the families associated with the wool-growing industry have had in the past decade. Apart from what the member for Lyons said about a former minister for primary industry, the sad fact is that, despite all the good things he may have done—as the member for Lyons asserted—the reserve price scheme for wool will be the one thing that is permanently inscribed, sadly, on his epitaph. The wool growers out there know and understand that, and they will not be swayed by the previous remarks of the member for Lyons.
This legislation puts into place a procedure by which to launch the wool industry. I share the comments of the member for Corio and his aspirations that we restore this industry; it was one of Australia's greats. The industry will be launched into a process of instigating what it needs to do. The industry needs to restructure and refocus.
Wool International is the statutory authority responsible for selling down the stockpile and retiring the associated debt. Back in the early 1990s, when the stockpile was a massive and major problem—4.7 million bales and an accumulated debt at that stage of $2.7 billion—it was appropriate to tell those purchasers of wool what our intentions were as a nation in releasing it onto the market. It hung like the sword of Damocles over the market, with consumers wondering whether we were going to burn it, dump it, or whatever. It was an appropriate measure then to establish Wool International to be the liquidator of that stockpile. It should never be forgotten that wool 
 growers funded Wool International to liquidate that debt. They do not get a lot of credit, but that was a credit to them.
The stockpile has now been reduced to almost 1.1 million bales and the massive debt is down to $230-odd million. Today, in 1998, the stockpile is not necessarily the problem it was in the mid-1990s. It is now manageable. In fact, many of the growers that confronted me outside post offices during the recent election campaign happened to regard the size of that stockpile as something of an asset. Even the figures that the member for Corio has put to the parliament confirm that. It represents a little over annual production. It can serve as a buffer for the uncertainties and vagaries of the market.
A new process has to be established on how we will deal with the fact that the stockpile still exists. Therefore, this legislation is quite timely. I have been somewhat anxious for it to be tabled in the parliament so that Wool International and everybody else will know the government's intention on the matter and the uncertainty that existed from August to October can be removed. I urge members on all sides of the parliament to support the legislation, including members in the other house, and to work with the government to achieve exactly what the member for Corio aspires for the wool industry. I represent these people. If there is no prospect of a future for wool, those in the industry need to know that so they can consider other options. I happen to believe there is a future. But it will not occur without the pain that is so often associated with the adjustment that is needed for those primary industries.
The member for Corio does not have an advantage that I have. I wish him well in his shadow portfolio, but I hope he takes a lot more time to be better briefed. I represent, as do others, including the member for Wannon, many industries—something like 55 different commodities in my electorate. All of those are in a phase of readjustment. What is badly needed today are industries which are market focused, consumer focused.
Later in this session of parliament a bill will be introduced to deregulate the Australian dried vine fruit industry. This is because, with 
 so many options available now for grape growers, the dried vine fruit industry has shrunk back to a niche and more lucrative market. Grape growers have many other options, be they table grapes or wine grapes. An adjustment requires a considerable amount of pain and it is the government's responsibility to provide some leadership. I think it cheapens the whole exercise for members opposite to come in here and play a cheap political game, taking cheap political shots.
—Well, it was a political decision.
—For the right reasons—not the reasons asserted by the member for Corio and others. Things have changed since the schedule for the stockpile was instigated. They have even changed since the initiatives of the government back in March last year to extend the debt recovery response to 30 June 1999. Since then we have had the impacts of what has happened in Asia and the falling demand for apparel consumption in our key markets, including Europe, Japan and Korea. The impacts on the price of wool have been dramatic, incurring direct pain on growers.
If the shadow minister, who is at the table, wants to be the shadow minister, he should be a little more focused about whom he purports to represent as the opposition's spokesman on primary industry. These are the growers. These are the people on the ground who are committed to their commodity, whatever it might be. They deserve better consideration than the remarks of the member for Corio reflect. I am a little disappointed in him because I think he is a decent chap, but so is the member for Lyons. I call on him to be a little more focused and to work with us more to get this important industry to Australia back on its feet.
I am confident, from the commitment that has been shown to getting this legislation into the chamber, that the government's commitment to growers is unshakeable. The reactions from the different sectors of the wool industry, which have been quoted here this morning by the opposition, are not unpredictable. For someone like me, and other rural members on the government side who have been associated with agropolitics for so long, it is 
 always difficult to get a broad consensus on these commodity issues. You will always have somebody who does not agree and who has a very high public profile. That is the nature of agriculture in Australia. We are dealing with a diverse geographical spread of people and we are dealing with a diverse professional background of people. In such environments it is always difficult to make sure proper communication exists.
It was no surprise to me to find the New South Wales wool growers saying what they said about the decision to freeze the stockpile. It was no surprise to find farm organisations in Victoria expressing a contrary view to what my growers were saying to me. I know what I heard from the 4,500 wool growers I represent, particularly during the recent election. I know what they said. I gave them a commitment that I would come back into this chamber and urge that this legislation receive speedy passage through not only this chamber but also the other place.
I hope that this legislation will ignite, for the wool industry, a focus on the things it needs to do to rehabilitate itself. I have been a member of this place now for five years. Prior to that I did not have a lot of detailed association with the wool industry, but in my former life I had an association with many of the other commodities. It has been somewhat amazing for me to find how difficult it is to get one voice out of the wool industry. The difficulty that industry has in expressing itself with a single and determined voice never ceases to amaze me.
That is the first thing I hope the wool industry can address, so that when requests come for the parliament to take action on a particular matter we get a more united voice which assists not just the minister but the government and all members of this place, particularly the opposition, to support good initiatives. This is a good initiative and it deserves the support of everybody around this chamber, irrespective of their politics.
I understand that at the annual general meeting of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation in Goulburn on 30 November, there will be a motion of no confidence in the Wool Research and Promo 
 tion Organisation. This is a little disappointing but it does, I think, indicate some of the frustration that growers feel that their wool promotion organisations, their marketing associations, that are supposed to be acting on their behalf are not representing their interests.
I hope that the motion of no confidence will not be the focus of the conference in order to score a point, go over old ground and look for scapegoats. The motion provides an opportunity for the industry itself to establish its own vision, which is clearly one of marketing and promotion and somehow finding a way to put innovative growers directly in contact with their marketplace. This has been a failure of the wool industry—the same failure that many other commodity industries have experienced in the past. They have been the producers of commodities leaving the farm gate when they have had no connection as to whether or not they were producing the right product.
Those industries that have succeeded in Australia, particularly those in my electorate, are those that have twigged to the necessity to connect to their consumers in an innovative way. I have already mentioned the Australian dried vine fruit industry. That is a good example, as is the dairying industry. There are many others around the nation. That is the key for the wool industry. It is my call to all of the leadership of the wool-growing and marketing associations to seek that goal. If this motion at the annual general meeting is just seen as an opportunity to score points, it will be very negative. They ought to take the next step and have a debate on refocusing the industry.
I hope that the legislation before the chamber today serves as the launch pad for the public debate on the need for a greater industry focus. It is not pleasant to see industries turning on themselves when they ought to be directing their energies to deciding for themselves what their future will be. We went through this with the grain industry. Thankfully, we have got through that long, drawn out process. I think great credit must be given to the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for steering the reform to the Austral 
 ian grain industry. We now have a wheat board that is structured in a way that provides ownership by growers and, therefore, their direct connection to the market is established. There is a process for that. The wool industry badly needs such a focus.
This legislation is just a small part of what is needed for the Australian wool industry. It must not be seen as the cure. It is a very short-term measure to shore up, I suppose, the industry—to launch it onto what it badly needs to do, which is a better focus on customers in the marketplace and, I am sad to say, a crying need for firm industry leadership and innovative approaches to the processing of wool fibre.
I have a habit of walking around and asking people, `How much wool are you wearing?' On many occasions people will be wearing clothing made of an alternative fabric, which is a much better product. That is why they buy it. They buy it because it does not crinkle, it is easy to wear and it does not itch—whatever reasons might apply in the fashion industry. This is the real challenge confronting the wool industry. In the last decade we have let some of our competitive fibres get the runs on the board and get ahead of us. This is another issue that the wool industry needs to address.
I am very pleased to stand here. I feel very satisfied that it is the first piece of legislation that the new 39th Parliament is considering. I am pleased to support it, and I urge all members to do the same. I am not all that moved by the opposition's pious amendment. I believe that all of the seven points addressed in the amendment are being taken into account by the government, with the one exception that we believe the leadership needs to come from the industry itself and that the government is just the facilitator. I use the model of the achievements in the Australian grain industry. I urge the leadership, growers and all those associated with the wool industry to follow the lead from the grain growers of this nation. I urge the parliament to give this legislation its support.",REPS,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,1998-11-12,"—It is an honour to return to this the 39th Parliament, particularly as the only Independent in 
 the House. Perhaps I can bring some sense of balance to this particularly important piece of legislation, the Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 , that affects so much of our economic endeavour and particularly affects many people in my own electorate.
First, let me take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Vaile, for his appointment to this very important portfolio. I also congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for your reappointment to the panel, and the members for Richmond and Hunter, who were in the House, for their promotions.
The people of rural electorates like Calare have very high expectations of agriculture ministers, perhaps even higher expectations of those ministers from the National Party. Certainly, one of the underlying issues in the recent election campaign was the state of the wool industry and the proposal contained in the Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 to suspend sales from the stockpile. Unfortunately, any real debate on this issue was submerged by the goods and services tax debate, but it is an issue that, wherever you go in the bush, people have an opinion on, and sometimes those opinions differ quite widely.
Since the early days of the Commonwealth, the wool industry, and governments' management of it, has always been controversial. Recently I have been reading speeches of some of my predecessors in this place. When one reads the collected speeches of former members for Calare, one sees that there are two recurring themes—namely, drought and wool prices. George Gibbons, the Labor member for Calare, who was elected for one term in 1929, made some interesting remarks in a speech that year, commenting on the then government's decision to prohibit the export of stud sheep from Australia. That decision, taken soon after the election of the Scullin Labor government, was a move aimed at bolstering flagging wool prices at the time. The member for Calare said at the time that the price of wool per bale had fallen from about £24 to £12 within the previous two years. The actual cost of producing wool was estimated to be £14 per bale.
Well may you say, Madam Deputy Speaker, that not much has changed. Interestingly, Mr Gibbons said it was essential for Australian farmers to concentrate on producing finer quality wools in order to boost their incomes. He said:
The breeding of distinct types of sheep and the improvement of wool quality are essential if we are to maintain the higher prices now obtainable for our wool, despite the unscientific methods of marketing it.
Seventy years later, there is still dissatisfaction about the way our wool is being marketed. But there is no way that MPs, or, indeed, farmers back then could have imagined the array of synthetic materials that would be developed over the next 50 years. Wool is no longer an essential fabric for clothing, and some would say it has become an expensive up-market fabric, with less than five per cent of the market share. In 1950 wool enjoyed 10 per cent of the fibre market, down from 20 per cent in the 1920s. I notice that one of the previous contributors to the debate detailed some of the changes over the last 20 years.
While it would be simple to suggest that wool has only a niche market future, statistics show it still enjoys more than 50 per cent of the men's market for suits, a large slice of the men's and women's jacket and sweater markets, and 12 per cent of the carpet market. While synthetics have gradually increased in use as substitutes for wool and other natural fibres, including cotton, there is a tremendous opportunity to develop new high-quality wool blends that combine the best features of wool and other fibres.
Changes in fashions may result in less wearing of suits, but fashions turn around and I am still optimistic when it comes to wool's potential. But we have to move fast. This bill, I believe, is the start. I hope these changes do put the wool industry on a business footing so that the growers are no longer price takers but price makers, with more value adding and proper marketing of the end result; in short, as the Bathurst Farmers Association Wool Committee says, restructuring the industry like other now successful rural commodities and leaving government out of the equation.
I have already mentioned there are opposing viewpoints evident in this debate, and I have actively sought the views of wool growers in my electorate about this proposed legislation. I would say that a clear majority support the decision to suspend stockpile sales—a move which does seem to have put a stop to the downward price spiral but at a level that benefits no-one but the buyer at the moment. I know that some wool growers in my electorate actively lobbied the government to implement this freeze, and I accept the minister's claim that it was a decision made after extensive industry consultation.
Unfortunately, like so many welcome, if belated, decisions taken by the coalition over the past 12 months to address major regional and rural issues, this decision was falsely painted by some sections of the media as a response to the electoral threat posed by One Nation. But there were many arguing the case for the reform of the wool industry long before One Nation realised there was a stockpile. There were many of us out there pointing out the deficiencies in Telstra, in mobile phone services, in the pork industry and so on. The Australian Wool Growers group in fact played a major role in bringing this debate on wool to a head. The credit given to One Nation for such policy decisions simply demonstrates again how out of touch many city based media organisations were when it came to reporting rural and regional issues.
That aside, the steps outlined in this bill will give the industry some breathing space. The existing legislated sales schedule, which saw more than 90,000 bales per quarter pushed onto a depressed market, was distorting that market in the same way as the former floor price scheme did. Of course, it is a decision that is not without its risks. It does threaten to further undermine buyer confidence, although the minister has given an assurance that Wool International will still be honouring its existing contracts. It will mean that the stockpile, which has overshadowed the market for so long, could now be around for that much longer. That concerns many who believe that the sooner the stockpile is out of the way the better.
The second aim of the bill, effectively transferring control and management of the stockpile from government to a new commercial entity, appears to have very widespread support. More than ever, growers seem dissatisfied with the overall management of their industry, and they want to have more of a say in its future.
One grower in my electorate said in a letter to me today that the industry cannot wait until next July for the proposed new company to be set up; it needs to happen immediately. There have already been several expressions of interest from consortia interested in buying the wool stockpile, and there is great hope out there in the industry that it can be sold off and disposed of in a manner which will put less downward pressure on the auction system.
I must say I have reservations about delaying the inevitable and delaying the stockpile sales, but I think the company set up to guide the industry should make any decisions relating to the stockpile without government interference. On that basis I cannot support the opposition's amendment. But, in saying that, I sincerely hope this new commercial entity proposed by the government will have a truly democratic structure, giving growers more responsibility for choosing the right people they want to manage their industry.
I note that the minister says the government will not be involved in shaping the new organisation's commercial activities. One only has to look at other successful rural sectors such as cotton, dairy, rice and in fact the wine industry in my own electorate to realise producers do a better job taking control and running their businesses.
Integral to the success of these industries has been the quality of the people engaged to run them. Sadly, wool growers lack confidence in many of the people who have been engaged to run AWRAP and Wool International and its predecessors. I met a group of wool growers a week or so ago, and they agreed most wool growers were not active in marketing their product—in fact, farewelling it at the farm gate with a prayer. They agree that growers need to take a greater role in the fate of their industry, they realise their short 
 comings in these areas and they are prepared to do something about them. But, by the same token, they believe their industry leaders have not provided adequate information or communicated enough. They do not see the results of their marketing dollar and one, a former farmer of the year in the Bathurst area, is in fact selling his clip at a loss, and he cannot sustain that for much longer.
A rural goods supplier at that same meeting pointed out how not only his business was 60 per cent dependent on the wool industry but so too are fencing contractors, weed contractors, air spreaders, a large sector of the transport industry as well as producers and sellers of sprays, dips and machinery. So it is a very integrated role that the wool industry plays in our rural fabric.
There are three exclusively wool-growing properties, totalling 12,000 acres in all, on the market in the Bathurst district at the moment. As evidenced by the comments I read earlier from the member for Calare 70 years ago, wool has always been subject to market fluctuations and cycles. Government involvement in sales marketing and promotion has made it all too easy for some growers to point the blame at others, who really do not deserve it because the problems are a result of factors outside their control.
Certainly there have been mistakes made over the last decade in particular—mistakes that would benefit with hindsight, of course, and the benefit of hindsight makes them very obvious. There is nothing that AWRAP, the federal government or Woolmark can do about the economic situation in Asia and the resulting slump in demand for wool. As the National Farmers Federation President, Ian Donges, said recently, the wool industry must realise how serious its plight is and work to overcome its divisions to win back markets from synthetics. I hope that this is the beginning of a fusing of those disparate forces within that industry.
So many growers would dearly love to go back to the postwar days when a pound of wool sold for a pound, but that is a pipe dream. When you look at the average price of wool this century, it would have to level out at being a lot closer to the actual cost of 
 production; that is the challenge. At this stage I doubt that even the best marketing in the world is likely to see wool recapture the significant slice of the market it once enjoyed. I hope I am wrong. Perhaps we need to realise that it is a niche product, largely, and do our best to produce, market and price it as such.
But I have spoken to others who know more than I about marketing and who strongly believe, because they have marketed other rural products, that proper marketing by proper marketing experts is the key that can restore, and in fact increase, market share. One thing is certain: more growers need to be encouraged to take advantage of forward selling and other such hedging tools to lock in prices so they are better able to ride out the slumps and bumps.
While the minister is here, I must point out some other factors at work to frustrate the viability of our wool industry. The Calare electorate has traditionally been home to many of the country's fine-wool producers. But, as I have stated in this House on many previous occasions, their livelihoods are in many cases under real threat because of ovine johnes disease. OJD is a problem affecting hundreds of families in my electorate and in other electorates throughout Australia, but particularly the tablelands region. Anecdotal evidence suggests some are now facing bank foreclosures, family break-ups and stress related illness. These families desperately need financial help. According to reports over the past week, the National OJD Eradication Program has been further delayed by uncertainty on the part of the New South Wales government as to how to levy producers to meet the industry contribution.
If ever there was a case of rural families needing exceptional circumstance assistance, I believe this is it. I, and many others, could not believe what we heard during the final days of the campaign when the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy refused to refer the New South Wales government request for exceptional circumstance assistance to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council only for consideration. I plead with you, sir, to urgently revisit this 
 situation. If this is not a case of exceptional circumstance, I do not know what is.
Wool, despite all the problems in the industry at present, is still our fourth largest export earner. It is a magnificent natural fibre and, as history has shown, it is an agricultural enterprise ideally suited to so many parts of this continent. Wool should have a great future, but this government should not kid itself that, by passing this bill and washing its hands of the stockpile, next year it will end its involvement in the industry. Some of the growers affected by OJD are producers of our best wool. This disease is a major threat to the merino fine wool industry. Problems like this are not going to go away if the industry is left to cope on its own.
So much could also be done to encourage efficient processing of wool here. At Bathurst, there is an enormous skeleton of a partly completed factory. It was to have been a woollen mill, but its backers have not been able to complete it because of a lack of financial support. I grant you that there is an onus on the industry to get involved in that sort of financial support, but I think it also needs more proactive support and encouragement from government if we are serious about regional development—and I wonder if we really are. Indeed, there was more support and encouragement under the previous Labor administration, which backed the establishment of very successful wool tops plants at Parkes and Dubbo.
This government should be doing a hell of a lot more in that area. One local National Party official said to me during the election campaign that his federal colleagues were desperately trying to do more to help the bush but were constantly stymied by their Liberal colleagues and the Treasury. I say to my National friends: now is your chance to really demonstrate what you can do. The Libs cannot govern without you; it is as simple as that. You have three years to show the people of rural and regional and Australia what good government is really all about.
Wool growers have felt helpless as they have watched their income and their wealth being steadily eroded, and it has cascaded down, as I have pointed out, onto the total 
 rural economic structure. Terms of trade have steadily and relentlessly declined, and country towns have suffered as sons and daughters have had to move away to find off-farm work. I believe that this bill is a step in the right direction towards reversing that trend and, with that in mind, I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>WOOL INTERNATIONAL AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Vaile, Mark, MP",NP,1998-11-12,"—Firstly, I would like to thank all the contributors to this debate on the Wool International Amendment Bill 1998  today. It is legislation that is urgently needed. The government's decision was made in advance of the calling of the election. Unfortunately, we did not get the important part of the process—the legislation—into the parliament prior to the election campaign to give those statutory bodies involved a clear indication of the intention of the government.
The purpose of the  Wool International Amendment Bill 1998  is to freeze the sales from the Wool International stockpile. It has been indicated in the contributions that have been made during the debate that there is a diversity of views amongst wool growers across Australia and also about some of the structural changes that may be desired in the Australian wool industry, referred to by the member for Calare. They are the subject of another bill that I introduced this morning.
This issue is about the stockpile that has been reduced. The debt has been substantially reduced, and this bill freezes that stockpile until 30 June 1999. It also allows Wool International to support and commit funds to a process of privatisation. I suppose the term `privatisation' is not entirely accurate because this is not a government asset. This is an asset that is owned by wool growers. It is their stockpile, and we envisage that they should have control of it through that process—without a statutory structure like Wool International with strictures on the sell-down process—so that there is more flexibility in terms of being market responsive as to how those sales take place.
It is interesting to note that, following the announcement of the freeze of the stockpile earlier this year, there was a bit of a kick in 
 the market price of wool. Then the election was called. Wool International went on with their statutory obligations. When the election was held, our government was returned. We reinforced the fact that we were going to freeze the stockpile and, from that point, the indicators have increased from 466c on 21 October up to 504c yesterday.
Some claim that is a result of the announcement of the freeze; others claim it is not. It certainly is a trend in the right direction, and I think we should be cognisant of that fact. We believe that this is the correct decision, that it is the correct way to go because, ultimately, it gives the wool growers in Australia responsibility for the decision making process about their asset—that is, the final disposal of what is left in the stockpile.
I note that the opposition has moved an amendment to the bill which, in principle, supports the privatisation of Wool International and the stockpile. We accept that. There are other elements of the amendment that the government does not agree with, and so we will be opposing the amendment. The structure of the privatised organisation will be the subject of future discussion.
In supporting the bill, it is important that we send a clear message to the industry and to the market that we are very concerned about the circumstances of the wool industry in Australia today—not only where it has been but, more importantly, where it is going. As the minister responsible, I aim to play a positive role, in partnership with the wool industry representatives across Australia, not just for the benefit of the wool industry but for the benefit of the entire Australian economy. As one of the previous speakers indicated, it is absolutely vital to the Australian economy and absolutely vital to the Australian rural economy. We want to ensure that it has an ongoing, efficient and viable future.	I commend the bill to the House.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—Like all other members of the 39th Parliament, I am delighted to have been successful in the 1998 October federal election. I would particularly like to thank the 
 Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, whose leadership of the Australian Labor Party during the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 is one of the main reasons that the Labor Party was so successful, winning a majority of votes but not a majority of seats.
I thank the electors of Greenway for the confidence that they have shown in me and I will be working hard to repay that confidence. There are many people who I would like to thank for their assistance in the campaign. I thank all my ALP branch members and supporters who carried out the many duties associated with the campaign. I would particularly like to thank my campaign director, Paul Gannon, for the excellent job he did prior to and during the campaign. I would also like to thank my senior electoral officer, Athol Cairn, who has been a constant source of assistance and advice to me. Whenever we have schools visiting parliament I always introduce Athol as my bodyguard. I think he does that job quite effectively.
I would like to thank my two Sydney based electorate officers, Christine and Sandra, for the work they have done on behalf of the constituents of Greenway. To my wife, Jan, I thank her for her constant support, advice and love. To my brother, Warren, I thank him for his continual spiritual support. And I thank our eight children who I know follow the career of their father with some deep interest. I would like to congratulate also the new members of this parliament who have delivered such excellent first speeches, and I wish them well for the future.
There are quite a few issues that I would like to address that I think are of vital interest to my electorate of Greenway. The first relates to the coalition government's goods and services tax. This is a messy and unnecessary tax that the Prime Minister is trying to push through prior to Christmas. I will quote from a book by Pamela Williams, The Victory, which I am sure a number of members in this House have read. It refers to the Liberal Party's policy formation prior to the 1993 election. It shows quite clearly that, despite the Prime Minister's remarks to the contrary, the GST was never far from the 
 thoughts of the policy makers of the Liberal Party. I quote from pages 167 and 168:
One tax question, that of the goods and services tax, was not on the agenda. It has been discussed in the month before at the top of the party and while there was a strong view that tax reform was both a necessity and inevitable the answer had been framed by the 1993 election. It was impossible to contemplate a GST now. The politics of the matter decreed that it would be firmly and unambiguously set aside. But it was a decision driven by the past and not the future and there was a general acceptance that the party would eventually look at it in government.
This quote must raise some serious doubts about the Prime Minister's never-ever statement relating to the introduction of a GST. We can all look back on history and see how political parties of all persuasions, and the Australian public, have been uneasy about the introduction of a GST. Attempts were made to introduce a goods and services tax by the Labor Party and this was defeated internally in 1985. Dr Hewson's attempt to introduce a GST was defeated by the Australian people in 1993. Mr Howard went to the Australian people in 1998 seeking their endorsement of a GST and lost many seats—over 14 seats. In fact, the Australian people voted for the Australian Labor Party. In total votes, the Labor Party received over 50 per cent while only about 49 per cent voted for the Prime Minister and his party. So one could hardly say that the 1998 election result was a ringing endorsement of the government's tax package.
While there is a need for governments to increase their revenue to enable them to provide the services expected by the Australian people, I submit that it is grossly unfair to tax the necessities of life, such as food and shelter, which are so important to all low income people. The government is failing in its duty in granting large tax cuts to people on high incomes while at the same time failing to close the tax loopholes. This has enabled some of our wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of tax.
Independent organisations such as the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economics and Social Research estimate that the consumer price index will rise more than the 1.9 per cent the government has allowed for. 
 Therefore, the four per cent compensation for those on benefits and pensions will not be enough. The institute considers that for families with three or more children the cost of the tax changes will be some three to five times more than the government has estimated.
Ross Gittins also picked up on this point in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 2 October where, after giving both sides of the political fence a serve, he concluded:
My perusal of the incomplete tables prepared by the Melbourne institute suggests that Howard would run pensioners and the unemployed perilously close to the wire. But individuals on income above $50,000 a year would get such big tax cuts that even if prices rose by a lot more than expected, they'd still be laughing.
One of the concerns that I am sure many people have relating to the GST is the uncertainty as to how it will affect them. Where will it actually hit? Another question that needs to be raised is in the area of our economy where there are no direct income taxes or where the impact of income taxes are not easily measured. For example, it has been estimated that a weekly train fare from stations in my own electorate to the city will increase from between $2.80 per week to $3.10 per week, or between $145.00 to $161.00 a year if a 10 per cent GST is applied on top of existing rail fares. Will there be a reduction in the current level of fares to account for the abolition of the existing indirect taxes before a GST applies, or will be there an increase in rail fares prior to the introduction of a GST, resulting in higher taxes being paid?
Another example quoted to me was of a small family run gift shop where no sales tax currently applies but where a 10 per cent GST will apply on all sales after 1 July 2000. In an article by Anne Lampe in the Sun-Herald on 23 September, a number of examples were given of how a GST would affect self-funded retirees. In one example she says:
For a retired couple of $30,000 a year, or $15,000 each, their current tax bill is $813 each. Under the Howard tax package they look forward to $863 in income tax between them. But according to the discovery analysis, their costs rise by $1748 as a result of a GST on food, rates, gas, insurance and 
 lifestyle spending. They have no private health insurance cover so they do not benefit from a health fund rebate. So they are down the drain to the tune of $885 between them.
Finally, there are two reasons that it is difficult for the general public to understand the government's GST tax package. Firstly, the package was released only two weeks before the election was called, thus allowing little time for detailed independent analysis. Secondly, as the package will not apply until the 2000-01 financial year, it is very difficult to make a complete assessment at this point on its likely effect. Of equal importance is that we are very likely to have another election campaign before the GST actually takes place with the possibility of a new government on the treasury bench.
The Australian public were being asked a few weeks ago to make a decision on the government's tax package that will affect them in two or three years time without its full impact being known even by the ministers who will bring in this legislation. This lack of public knowledge concerning a GST makes the holding of a Senate inquiry extremely important. Mr David Vos, who has been appointed to head the government's tax consultative committee, also supports the Senate inquiry.
To date the federal government have not provided information about the true effects of their proposal. It has not been subject to parliamentary scrutiny and it is therefore essential that a Senate inquiry proceeds to examine the government's taxation proposal.
The other issue that I was going to raise relates to the privatisation of Telstra. The federal government's desire to sell off a further 16 per cent of Telstra, followed by full privatisation at a later date, is now coming under increasing public scrutiny.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—My question is to the Prime Minister.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-11-12,"—This question passes strange out of the lips of the man whose government had 13 years to fix Commonwealth-state financial relations and did absolutely nothing at all. What I can guarantee to the Leader of the Opposition is that tomorrow I will talk to the premiers and the chief ministers of the Australian states and territories about the best ever offer from a federal government since World War II to reform Australia's financial relations. I have already indicated in private discussions with the premiers that we have no intention of using the route of specific purpose payments to take away through the back door what we are clearly giving in a very generous fashion through the front door in relation to our proposal.
What has got to be understood by the Leader of the Opposition, and what should be understood by all those who care about the provision of adequate money for roads, for schools, for hospitals and for police services in the states, is that the only way you can guarantee the continued existence of those services years into the future is to adopt the coalition's taxation reform plan.
One of the strangest things about the debate on the goods and services tax is that people attack it in the name of defending the welfare sector. This is a great defence of the welfare sector because what this plan will do is to guarantee, like no other plan, a flow of funds from the federal government to the state governments so they can provide the money for schools, hospitals and the police.
If any of you people who sit opposite, particularly the members who have joined us as a result of the last election, are interested in adequate schools, adequate health provision 
 and adequate police services, you will change your opposition to the government's taxation plan. You will change your opposition to the government's taxation plan because this is the greatest gift that any federal government has offered to the states of Australia to reform their capacity to maintain essential services.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: States Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,40,1,answer

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—At this stage in a parliament I think it is useful to lay down a few markers for how things are likely to proceed over the course of the next few years if a particular course of action that the government suggests or determines is actually followed by the parliament and it becomes a matter of law.
I want to take two quotes today from a speech that was made some weeks ago—in a ministerial statement, in fact—by the Treasurer of Queensland. I would like to read them 
 into Hansard as things to bear in the back of our minds as time passes. The first was a quote from a Treasury analysis of the government's GST proposals. It said:
Beyond the three-year guarantee period the states are accepting all the risk if the GST revenue projections are flawed—in particular the size of the base, the assumptions about the size of the black economy that will be brought into the tax net—$18 billion per annum—and the estimated level of enhanced revenue flowing from the improved compliance.
That was from his Treasury. The second quote is directly from him on the basis of his relationship with the Commonwealth ministers, and nothing in question time would have assuaged his fears on this. He said in the course of his remarks there would be `no guarantees to individual states regarding their revenue streams, no guarantee on the distribution of the GST pool, no guarantees that at some stage in the future income taxes won't rise and no guarantee about the future of existing special purpose payments to the states'.
Those two quotes bear a bit of marking, reading and contemplating. We have had 2½ years of this government and what we have learned from those years is this: any major public policy area in which much is claimed will invariably be bungled. There is in fact no example of this government acting in any way on any major policy area where public administration and policy have come together to deliver an outcome that achieves either the government's objective or an efficient outcome—not one—and this particular set of propositions is far larger in its impact on public administration than anything that has been proposed at this point.
I ask you to think back over the course of the last 2½ years and reflect on that. Firstly, nursing homes: 15 separate changes and still not an outcome—nursing homes in capital crisis. The second is the labour market programs: a complete collapse of employment programs, scandal associated with employment programs and complete failure to achieve objectives. That is another one for us to contemplate in that regard. Then we take their levy, their rebate, associated with health care: every cent of it claimed back effectively 
 from those who are members of the funds by the owners of the funds—every red cent of it claimed back by them—and a continuing fall in participation in health care; and like ignorant generals they seek to reinforce that.
As for what they trumpeted in this place about doing over high income people as far as superannuation is concerned, two points arise. Firstly, they did over a hell of a lot more than simply high income people—a couple of very low income people found themselves caught up in that—and, secondly, the administration costs associated with it have been almost as much as they have got back from it.
This group—and I could have gone through a whole range of other public policy areas that demonstrate the same appalling outcome—now wish to convince us that they are going to be able to produce a tax shift from the Commonwealth to the states of some $30 billion, an amount based on complete confidence that the revenues that they predict will be revenues that they receive, that they will be able to deliver an outcome in those states that will ensure that the states can sustain their services, that they have a set of taxation arrangements that they guarantee will broaden the base effectively of the tax system in this country and keep up essential social spending, as though this ever mattered to a government which has already cut in two budgets some $24 billion on a four-year basis from social spending and not a cent of it restored. Instead the surplus built on it was given away in tax bribes associated with this.
They are about to achieve this, they say, from their taxation arrangements. I say this: if it is achieved it will be a world first for introduced GSTs, because the universal experience in the rest of the world is that, firstly, GSTs do not produce the revenue that is anticipated from them by treasurers and, secondly, GSTs are massively avoided. So, from a situation where at least in the indirect taxation area levied by the states and the Commonwealth at the moment there is minimal avoidance, they are going to move to a set of taxation arrangements under which, on the experience elsewhere, evasion and 
 avoidance is optimised, and they are going to be interlinking.
As you evade income taxes, be it in the form of business taxes or direct personal taxes, so you will be encouraged to evade GST as well. If you do not think this is a problem, take a look at Europe. At the heart of the black economy in Europe are their value added taxes. They are the principal area evaded. Value added taxes are the centrepiece of the black economy in Europe. More than $1 billion is the worth of the black economy in Europe. In fact, something like 28 million people are employed in that black economy. It is 13 per cent of the GDP of Europe or the equivalent of the total British GDP. British Treasury studies show that one in three VAT-able tax transactions are evaded. That is the experience of Britain.
Now look at the recent experience of those countries that have introduced taxes. I refer to a very interesting article from a source not necessarily devoted to labour—Alan Reynolds, the Director of Economic Research at the Hudson Institute. This is what he says about Japan's experience with the GST:
Japan's total tax revenues have declined in real terms ever since the value-added tax and various investor taxes were introduced. Without the increase in social security tax, which depends on it remaining attractive for employers to employ and for workers to work, the budget would be in much more serious shape than it is. All these ambitious new taxes have been killing revenues.
We have the same piece of research now associated with Canada:
After Canada added a value added tax in 1990, revenues from all taxes virtually stopped growing. Revenues rose by 19 per cent from 1990 to 1995, only 1.2 per cent if measured in US dollars, compared with a 52 per cent rise from 1985 to 1990 and 59 per cent from 1980 to 1985.
Those are very interesting statistics which the states will bear in mind when they contemplate what is going to happen to them tomorrow because, when you sit down and logically think through the issues related to a goods and services tax, it does not take you very long to work out how much evasion is likely to take place.
But I will tell you the principal difference between Australia and those other countries 
 that have value added taxes. Virtually all of them have some form of social security tax which is substantially complied with by all concerned; a tax which underpins their social spending. Virtually all of them have that. In Japan, it saves them. In Europe, it saves them.
The value added taxes are a matter of scandal because they are routinely evaded. There are all sorts of interesting mechanisms that are developed, including VAT police who in Italy pursue people out of ice-cream parlours to check whether or not they have got a value added chit. Of course, the capacity of the Inland Revenue Service of Italy to pursue every single ice-cream parlour has been discovered to be somewhat limited. An Italian business friend of mind tells me this: the VAT in Italy has risen to 20 per cent. But when you approach even a hotel and ask for a price they will say a price if you agree to pay the value added tax, which is in fact not 20 per cent above the price that you would pay if you decided not to pay a value added tax but 30 per cent. Commonsense tells you this: the relationship between the income tax system and the value added tax system means that, if you are not actually declaring it for value added tax purposes, you will not be declaring it for income tax purposes either. So a very much lower receipt is obtained by the Italian government via that process. Precisely the same thing will happen here.
You were so proud of the New Zealand record of everybody registering. What Australian small business will find very quickly is this: it is useful to register in this arrangement. You will be able to establish under your registered company a loss-making company that will effectively enable you to claim back all your inputs under the GST arrangements—but do not register another company which will be your profit making company which operates outside both systems.
The wholesale sales tax system and all the FID, BAD and stamp duty that the states now impose—whatever objection there may be to the inequities or otherwise of those—have one characteristic: they are all paid, the whole lot of them. Unlike the income tax system, compliance there is complete.
What the states are now buying is essentially a pup. They are surrendering virtually all their revenue raising powers to a tax that they cannot raise themselves but which the Commonwealth has promised they will get control over. It is no wonder, in those circumstances, that the state premiers now are demanding of this government not only guarantees about the receipts that they will continue to get from that, not only some sort of indication about what their share of that particular revenue is going to be, given that Premiers Conferences are going to be abolished, but also some concessions from the Commonwealth in determining that special purpose payments will not in any way be tampered with and will be there for negotiated rises as time passes.
It is very important that they do that, because they will have learned from this government that they have achieved very high levels of incompetence in public administration in comparison with some of those governments that I have been discussing or drawn attention to so far. If those governments have not been able to grapple with that problem, you can bet your bottom dollar this government will not be able to either. It is well that they therefore ask for some guarantees as far as special purpose payments are concerned.
But the Commonwealth's intention is otherwise. Those special purpose payments cover virtually all the Commonwealth's contributions to education, all the Commonwealth's contributions to health and all the Commonwealth's contributions to aged care. The states know this: that in all these three areas there are massive inadequacies and crises mounting, particularly in the area of health where the states have been underfunded in terms of increases by an amount that they would claim is fourfold—which is, of course, an ambit claim, but somewhere between what they were given by the Commonwealth and what they actually wanted is the answer. What they will get from the Commonwealth when this crisis hits them and the regional services are closed down and the wards go empty—we get a story a day these days about somebody's confrontation of inadequacy in the hospital system in the states—is not a determination to increase the 
 payments as far as the Commonwealth is concerned but an invitation to the states to raise the rate of the GST. That is precisely what will happen from this point on.
So at the heart of the taxation system there will be a tax that will reflect these characteristics. Firstly, there will be massive unfairness because it is a tax that has no equity associated with it. Secondly, there will be a tax with total unreliability on the basis of the experience of everybody else who has imposed it. Nobody in Europe regards value added taxes as modernising the taxation system. When they talk about base broadening they talk about hypothecated taxes associated with things like social insurance. That is what they talk about when they talk about base broadening measures; not value added taxes, which are the subject of humorous television shows as far as Europe is concerned. They talk about massive avoidance.
You have gone back to a very old-fashioned European tax. But the problem, my friends, is that you have put at the heart of the tax system two massively avoided taxes with virtually nothing guaranteeing support around them, but with a dynamic in the system whereby every time a social crisis occurs in this country you will go to the states and say to them, `Raise the GST. Reinforce failure. Stick it up if you want more for your schools, more for your hospitals and more for aged care.' It is a doll!

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1998-11-12,"—In the short time that I have been in this parliament I have heard some eloquent defences. I have seen some opportunities taken by various people to turn defence into attack. I have seen a whole range of different people try to defend things that should never be defended. But I have never heard anyone come into this House seeking to take into the 21st century a Model-T Ford concept of a taxation system.
In all the travels around Australia of everyone on this side of the House as we consulted widely on the taxation system we are proposing, and in all the consultations, I did not hear one single person try to defend the existing taxation system. No-one has sought to defend 
 the equity of the current taxation system, no-one has sought to protect all those taxation laws in place which simply complicate things for small business and for Australians who want to try to make a fair buck for a fair day's work and which complicate the issues on taxation.
Yet the Leader of the Opposition comes into this House seeking to defend a taxation system that was built in an economy of the 1930s. It is important at this juncture to reflect on exactly what sort of economy Australia had in the 1930s. According to the 1933 census, services represented 48 per cent of the Australian economy. Today, services represent 66 per cent of the Australian economy—and that is growing.
At the time of the introduction of the wholesale sales tax in the 1930s, the rate applied by the Commonwealth was 2.5 per cent to 22 per cent. Today, the highest rate is 45 per cent. What this shows is that the Leader of the Opposition is seeking to defend a tax that is more suited to Australia in the 1930s than to Australia in the new millennium. It takes no account whatsoever of the global changes in the world economy. It takes no account of the movement of money, which in effect is the blood flow of the Australian economy, and it takes no account whatsoever of the shift in the Australian economy from manufactured goods and primary production right across to services and the export of services.
The current taxation system is accepted throughout Australia, almost without debate except in this chamber and in this MPI, as flawed for Australia in the 21st century. It is not the sort of policy you would take if you were providing a service to Australian business in the new millennium. The Leader of the Opposition seeks to defend it. How? He tries to cite the flaws in the application of the value added tax in places like Britain and New Zealand. Importantly, he did not mention any particular flaws in New Zealand but he talked about a few inconsistent applications of the VAT in Britain. Might I point out to the Leader of the Opposition—and this is going to be particularly important when we come to the debate in the Senate on the taxation 
 laws—that the more exemptions you have applying to a consumption tax, the more complicated it becomes, the more open the opportunity for people to rort it. So you get inconsistencies such as in Britain where he said one in three VATs are evaded. You get inconsistencies such that if in Britain you buy a hot doughnut over the counter the VAT applies, if you buy a cold doughnut over the counter a VAT does not apply. So what does every bakery in Britain have?—a microwave by the door.
—You need a thermometer.
—And a thermometer. That is what it has. Why? Because you can buy your cold doughnut and on the way out you stick it in the microwave and heat it up. Knowing the climate in Britain it is just as well they do have microwaves available. It is those sorts of inconsistencies which the Leader of the Opposition is failing to take into account. We all know how inconsistent he has been on this matter. Where was the Leader of the Opposition in 1985?
—He was beside Keating, saying we needed one.
—He was all the way with Paul Keating. `We need option C,' said Kim Beazley. In fact, at the National Press Club in June 1985 the Leader of the Opposition spoke these prophetic words:
There are very few such societies which operate with a tax system so heavily dependent on income tax as we do and very few which don't have a substantial component of their tax system reliant on broadly based consumption taxes.
He was an advocate, as was Bob Hawke, his Prime Minister and mentor. Bob Hawke said on the Sunday  program on 2 June 1985: You can't have a continuation of a tax system which is haemorrhaging—
This is 1985, nearly 14 years ago, when Bob Hawke, as Prime Minister, said this.
imposing burdens on those least able to bear them, economically inefficient.
What does this mean? It means the Leader of the Opposition is standing side by side with Henry Ford defending the Model-T as the modern vehicle to take into the 21st century—and it just does not work.
The Leader of the Opposition does not address the substance of this MPI. Why? Because even he has to concede that the current funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states are not working. He knows exactly what it means. He knows the real impact of the changes we are proposing and the benefits for services. Let me not simply put words into his mouth; let me use the words of the New South Wales budget papers. And we all know who is in government in New South Wales—Bob Carr, member of the Labor Party. What did the budget papers of 1998-99, the current budget papers, say about the current tax system and what did they say about the fairness of the current tax system? They said:
The overall tax system includes taxes imposed by states, many of which are narrowly based, relatively inefficient and inequitable. These are the financial taxes such as financial institutions duty, debits tax, share transfer duty, loan security duty and stamp duty on business transactions.
That was said by the Labor Party Treasurer, Michael Egan, and the Labor Party Premier, Bob Carr. They are admitting that the current taxation system is not working. Under our total tax plan—and this is not a capital gains tax pre-1985 applied in 1999; this is a total taxation package—we are abolishing nine separate individual state taxes that are currently impeding the free flow of money in our economy.
Those taxes are the major impediments to Australia becoming a regional financial centre. They are the major impediments to the easy flow of money in the Australian economy and to a boost in domestic demand and related effects. Those taxes also include the financial institutions duty, which we are abolishing. It is a scourge on people who seek to put money into their own bank accounts. Other such taxes include the debits tax and stamp duty on marketable securities. Of course, that applies to stamp duty on the transfer of shares, which the Australian Stock Exchange and various other instruments admit is a major impediment to foreign investment in Australia.
Yet other such taxes are conveyancing duties on business property, stamp duties on credit arrangements and instalment purchase 
 arrangements, stamp duties on leases, stamp duties on mortgages—and how many Australian battlers have mortgages? Others taxes are bonds, debentures and other loan securities, stamp duties on cheques and bills of exchange and, of course, bed taxes.
We all know who introduced the bed tax in New South Wales—the Labor Party. Why did they do it? Because they are looking for revenue. The states have an ever decreasing tax base from which to apply the proceeds to services. We are giving them the lifeline of a century. We are giving the states an opportunity to have a growth tax into the 21st century. At the moment the main sources of own-purpose revenues from the states are FID and debits and stamp duty. All those taxes are diminishing. Why? They are diminishing for a number of reasons, including globalisation and the effects on transfer of money.
We are saying to the states, `We are giving you a leg up. You have the services—the hospitals, schools, roads, police—so you deliver those services to the community.' We are giving them a leg up.
Ms Kernot interjecting—
—We are giving them growth revenue into the 21st century. Growth revenue is important because it means that they will be able to sustain their current levels of police service, hospital visits and support to schools. In fact, they are actually going to be able to improve those services.
Ms Kernot interjecting—
—The new member for Dickson, who keeps interrupting me, might not have read a document as long as 200 pages. I am putting to her that she should pick up this document, which is about tax reform—not about a new tax but a new tax system. I am happy to send you a copy. I would urge you to read page 25 where it refers to the fact that the projected revenue gain to the states is $370 million in 2003-04, $1.25 billion in 2004-05 and growing.
What does that mean? That means that instead of the states relying on stamp duty, which is going to pan out; instead of them relying on the proceeds of FID, which is going to pan out; instead of them relying on 
 the proceeds of debit tax, which is going to pan out; instead of them putting in more poker machines and more casinos to deliver new taxes to them through gambling, for the first time they are actually going to get a real growth revenue tax. They have not had that since they referred income taxing powers to the Commonwealth.
It delivers for them something more than payroll tax. Payroll tax is a growth tax. We all know how inequitable payroll tax is, but it is a growth tax, and so, instead of them creating new taxes like the bed tax and gambling taxes in their search for revenue to continue delivering services, we are throwing them a lifeline. That lifeline is very important. That lifeline delivers to them the opportunity to give the people of Australia better services into the future. That is particularly important in this regard.
As a true democrat—and I think everybody in this House is a true democrat; and that is small `d' democrat for the information of the member for Dickson—I believe we are all a touch embarrassed by the annual begging bowl ritual known as the Premiers Conference. I have had the opportunity to attend them in an advisory capacity in the past, and have found them a little bit insulting from a state perspective. It is also very difficult from a Commonwealth perspective.
We are promising to deliver an end to that farce. We are the only side of this parliament to put forward a proposal to solve the problem of Commonwealth-state relations. We are the only side that has taken a step forward in trying to deliver a fairer distribution of the proceeds of revenue in this nation. Most importantly, we are still waiting on this side of the House for the proposal from the opposition to try to resolve the Premiers Conference imbroglios that have dogged us in the past.
—You're the government.
—The member for Griffith says, `You're the government.' This is the man who, in his maiden speech yesterday, was telling us how important it is that the Labor Party have a vision for government for the 21st century. He has the gall to come in here and say, `You're the government. You 
 put forward a proposal.' I say to you, `You're the Labor Party. Come up with something better than your model-T Ford proposal for the taxation reform system. Come forward with something better than what you are proposing from the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries as a solution to Australia's financial problems into the 21st century.' Then we will start to take you seriously—and perhaps the people of Australia will then start to take you a little more seriously.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Government Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,51,1,speech
"Kernot, Cheryl, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—While most Australians have, understandably, been focusing on how the GST will affect their families, a massive, radical, and what we would call regressive, change in the way money is shared between the Commonwealth and the states is under way. It has been almost eclipsed by the understandable focus on personal circumstances, but nothing the member for North Sydney said about his interpretation of the structure of the economy would do anything to allay the concerns of Australians everywhere, but more especially of Australians in regional and rural Australia, about the delivery of services.
Make no mistake about this: we understand that this is a radical and regressive change. What is the reason for it put forward by the government? At its core it is simply ideology, and it is out-of-date ideology at that. It is ideological zealotry: more reform for its own sake, more claptrap about smaller government and states rights. And at what cost?
I think we should focus on the strength of the current relationship between the Commonwealth and the states, because the strength of that current partnership lies in its very fundamental obligation to ensure fairness and equity in service delivery between the states and the regions. The government's proposal does nothing to ensure that because, according to this government's new agenda, bad luck about fairness, bad luck about equity—it is back to survival of the fittest, depending on the whims and priorities of various state premiers. In one particular state it could come down to a choice between casinos and public hospitals.
This is not a progressive agenda for reform. It is regressive and it is divisive, and it turns 
 back the clock on half a century of progress in terms of a national agenda, a national approach and a national commitment to delivering services that are important to all Australians. Under this agenda there is absolutely no doubt that the dynamic between Commonwealth and state relationships will change. There will be no national commitment to setting national goals, there will be no pressure at all to work cooperatively and there will be absolutely no sense of joint local, state and federal responsibility.
I wonder what will happen to regions in this new pecking order. If we look, as the Leader of the Opposition said, at where special purpose payments are directed at the moment, we see that they go to schools, home and community care for frail aged people and people with disabilities, accommodation services for people with disabilities, road programs, road safety black spots, environment programs and grants to local government. I do not know about you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but on our side we do not have the confidence that this government is going to ensure that those sorts of responsibilities are picked up and are met in the regions as state governments, as the Leader of the Opposition said, take all the risks and come under increasing pressure from burgeoning metropolitan areas.
Who is going to ensure that local government is properly resourced when responsibility for local government funding passes to the states? As the President of the Australian Local Government Association said here this week, it is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. And why? Because this is the party that opposed the constitutional recognition of local government last time we had a referendum. It says a lot about this government's commitment to local communities and to regions.
Just today the National Rural Health Alliance in its blueprint for regional development called for the economic and social interests of rural areas to be placed nearer the heart of the national agenda for change. But how can we talk about bringing the regions within a national agenda for change when the national government is signalling its intention to 
 almost completely walk away from its responsibility for basic services like health, education and the environment? For too many years we have already heard the answer, `Don't ask me, it's a state government responsibility.' Well, now we will hear that it is anybody's responsibility—anybody's but the federal government's.
There are times when you could be forgiven for thinking that the entire purpose of this government's reform mania has been to completely eliminate Commonwealth responsibility for anything at all. In the last three years we have seen a constant round of cuts. The attitude of this government has been to tear down communities, not to build them up through service provision. What that leads to over time is some people, almost with a sense of desperation, grabbing at a GST in order to get some money for vital services. But what value does a GST funding base have if it also enables our national government to simply walk away from its responsibility for the delivery of basic services and entitlements?
—We won't walk away.
—You will. Under the GST arrangements proposed by this government, the temptation—and it is already there and it is already being pursued by this government—will increase for the Commonwealth to move completely out of national service provision. The temptation will increase to actually cut back special purpose payments and push even more responsibility onto the states. Because the GST will not, despite the claims of the member for North Sydney, produce the revenue claimed, it cannot be a guaranteed growth revenue.
What we would be left with is a nightmare mess of Commonwealth-state tensions over service provision. We would have a whole lot of permanent tussles over fewer and fewer social services. We could have a higher GST rate. We could have a broadened GST base. We could have the growth of regressive state taxes and user charges. Who would be the loser? Communities will be the loser under this so-called new federalism, and those on lowest incomes within the community will lose the most.
We in Labor believe that such a shift in responsibility from the national government to the state government level will bite deeply and disastrously into the economic and social wellbeing of Australia's regions. We in Labor believe that Australia is a nation first and foremost. We are not a set of competing fiefdoms. We in Labor believe that the federal government has the responsibility to build the nation, not to sit on its hands. We in Labor believe that the federal government has an obligation to honour, on behalf of all Australians, a commitment to delivering quality basic services irrespective of the state or the region in which we live. This week Dr Peter Brain's report on the state of the regions showed us very clearly an Australia in which some regional areas have already fallen further and further behind, facing growing levels of poverty and widening gaps in education and opportunity. And what does this government propose? To leave it all up to the states.
The simple fact is this: in this era of globalisation there is an important role for government, and it is about national standards and national citizenship rights. We cannot deliver jobs, services, infrastructure and equality of opportunity to Australians living in regional areas without a cooperative national approach to structural change. We on this side passionately believe that you will not deliver these things by going down the path of some sort of competitive model of devolution to the states. That is not the path to successful regional development. That is not the path to a successful national future.
We on this side want to see a nationally focused government that has the ideas and the vision to build a united and successful nation, not a government whose sole purpose, it seems to me, is to walk away from its commitment and its responsibility to nation building because it has no other ideas.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Government Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,51,1,speech
"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,1998-11-12,"—What a sad state the Labor Party has come to when we have the fairytale economics of the ex-Democrat Cheryl Kernot. Run by Kernot economics: is this the proud party that tried to bring reform to Australia that is sitting behind an ex-Democrat who is not even progressive enough for the original founder of 
 the Democrats? Don Chipp had the courage to say in 1993, `Let's go out and support a 15 per cent GST,' but that Democrat did not have the courage for that. She fled to a cowardly Labor Party that is looking back to the past and is incapable of facing the challenges of the 1990s, let alone the challenges of the next century.
I was stunned when I read the MPI today. I thought, `It is one from our side; Mr Hockey has put forward this MPI. That's good.' When I found out that it was actually a Mr Beazley MPI, I had to go back and read it again.
—We're interchangeable.
—I will not make the obvious comment. It asked us about the implication for services of a GST. I thought, `That is what we are all about—providing the revenue base for services.' But it turned out that that was what Mr Beazley was asking. So I am very happy to give him the answer. What are the implications of the GST for services?
Firstly, basically, free services remain free. Input taxes can be reclaimed. The cost of supplying services will actually fall because of the removal of inbuilt taxes. So some of those services—probably all of them—that we are now providing will become cheaper to provide.
The states will get their own revenue base. We have heard the member for North Sydney describe the disgrace that goes on at the Premiers Conference. Proud Premiers from proud states come to the Premiers Conference begging for money for health and education. It is time they had their own revenue base, and a revenue base that grows with their population. No longer will they be subservient to the Commonwealth. No longer will they have to beg for that extra dollar—they will have it from their own growing revenue base and they will therefore be responsible for their own services.
How many times do we hear this complaint from the community: `It's buck-passing. The Commonwealth says it's the states' responsibility; the states say it's the Commonwealth's responsibility.' Let us move into the next century by ending all that squabbling. Let us 
 place responsibility where it belongs so that Commonwealth services are Commonwealth services, state services are state services, and everybody has the revenue base to provide their own services.
I have given four basic improvements for services under a GST. But what is the most important? The most important is broadening the revenue base. For some reason, since 1985 the Labor Party seem to have forgotten that the world has changed, that we no longer rely solely on the sale of goods and that goods have become a smaller part of our economy. In the 1930s goods were pretty much all of the economy but now they are about one-third while services account for two-thirds. Yet the Labor Party over there in Cheryl never-never land says, `Oh well, we're not going to take account of the change in the economy; we're going to stick with the tried and true method—the 1930s tax system. It did us in the 1930s and it will do us in the 1990s, and we will go into the next century with this old beaten about tax system.' It will not, you know. You have to face the fact that your tax system—the tax system now—is collapsing.
The poor member for Werriwa, Mark Latham, is languishing on the backbenches. He is an intellectual force in the Labor Party who has to now sit there because nobody listens to him. They are not prepared to move forward with Mark into the next century. They want to stay behind. What does Mark say about it?
—He is a protege of Gough.
—Oh! A future leader of the Labor Party. Haven't you heard? This man was going to replace Beazley. He was recognised as an intellectual force, somebody who knew what policy was all about. What did he say? He said, `We talk about active government, but how do we fund it when the tax base has fallen to bits?' And that is the question that the Labor Party has failed to answer. And that is why the Labor Party is not going to be able to provide the growing services that this country needs. We have an ageing population that we have to provide services for. But how are we going to do it with a shrinking tax base? The only way is to broaden that base, and the only way to broad 
 en it is to bring in a goods and services tax—to tax the services as well as the goods.
What is the alternative? The alternative is to raise taxes. The Labor Party knows that. What did it do in 1993 after it rejected the GST? It raised the wholesale sales tax because it did not have enough money to provide for services without it.
—And the fuel excise too.
—And the fuel excise. This gets us back to the states again. At the moment the states are relying on a lot of inefficient, inequitable taxes, which the member for North Sydney reminded us of—
—The minister.
—The minister reminded us of the FID taxes and the debit taxes: those taxes that are shrinking because of globalisation and the use of offshore accounts. So the burden is not falling on the businesses, which have the cash, but on the individual consumers who are more likely not to have it but who are forced to carry the financial burden of these taxes. This, again, will go with a GST.
We have a crumbling system, as Mark Latham, the member for Werriwa, acknowledges and as did the Labor Party in 1985. But they got scared and ran away from it. We have to change it and we will change it because this government is going to do the right thing by Australia and bring in what Australia needs—a new, comprehensive tax system.
I started off by lamenting what would happen to the once proud Labor Party. Seeing as the member for Werriwa has featured in acknowledging that his own party is failing to meet the challenge, I went to have a look at some of his other words. In an article in the Daily Telegraph on 30 October this year he said:
The easy road in politics lies in the preservation of sacred cows—
and I presume the GST comes under the heading of `sacred cow'—
In Labor's case this now means turning a blind eye to the failings of the old economy and the old welfare state. 

What is the member for Werriwa doing to his party? He is showing us what they are: a party of old dinosaurs. They are policy dinosaurs, left in the past and unable to move into the future. Finally Mr Latham says in the Courier-Mail , about the policy vacuum that exists in the Labor Party:
I cannot remember the last time shadow cabinet had a serious policy debate.
What a comment on the opposition of this country. This opposition sees itself as a spoiler, its only role being to thwart the government, coming up with ridiculous MPIs, such as the one today, which actually support the government's case for a change in the tax system and reveal the opposition for what it is—a bunch of policy dinosaurs, left in the past and frightened of the future.

"St Clair, Stuart, MP",NP,1998-11-12,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to acknowledge the great privilege extended to me by the voters of New England in electing me to act and speak for them in the House of Representatives in the parliament of Australia. I am extremely proud to represent the northern New South Wales electorate of New England. I intend to work as hard as I can to ensure that the communities of New England—from Tenterfield to Tamworth, from Texas to Nowendoc, and the communities of and around Inverell, Glen Innes and Armi 
 dale—all thrive. Judith Wright, perhaps Australia's greatest poet, is one of New England's best loved daughters. She describes her `blood's country', the New England Tableland, with its—and I quote:
. . . high delicate outline
of bony slopes wincing under the winter:
low trees blue-leaved and olive, outcropping granite—
Clean, lean, hungry country.
There has perhaps never been a more eloquent description of the New England than this.
I should like to pay a personal tribute to the former member for New England, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. A great tribute was paid on the first sitting day of this parliament by honourable members in this House, and the people of New England would have been proud to have heard it. I will not go over Mr Sinclair's parliamentary record, as it was well articulated on that day. However, I will remind the House that he represented the people of New England for 35 years—an extraordinary feat by an extraordinary Australian. On behalf of the people of New England, I thank the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair for his unstinting service and loyalty to all those people over such a long, long time. To quote from Shakespeare, `Whence comes such another?'
The Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair's service in this place spanned a generation. In his time he saw nine prime ministers, from Menzies to Howard. He saw governments come and go. In his early days, young people embraced the music of Bill Halley and the Comets. Now we have the Whitlams—the younger ones. If we in this House think that the changes that have occurred in Australia in that time have been dramatic, to steal a phrase, `We ain't seen nothin' yet!'
The difficulty of change is that it can be painful, but the failure to change is absolutely fatal. The test of good government is to manage change for the benefit of all Australians. I believe social cohesion and strong leadership are the keys to the successful management of change. Social cohesion occurs when we are all moving down the same road together and not divided by ethnic, religious, social or geographical differences.
Mr Deputy Speaker, we live in a tough, competitive world. We cannot afford the luxury, as we have in the past, of the politics of division. Nowhere is this divide more evident than in regional Australia. Over the last couple of decades a rift has grown between country and city dwellers. The result is that many country people feel left out, that they are no longer part of the decision making that is changing Australia. They feel, Mr Deputy Speaker, that they have little say in their own destiny. Yet, as they know only too well, the wealth of this nation is not generated in Pitt or Collins Streets; it is generated on its farms, in its timber mills and in its mines.
Policy planners must learn to listen and respond to regional Australia. This is true not only for those of us holding public office and in the bureaucracy, but also for industry leaders, bankers and infrastructure builders.
Regional Australia is the powerhouse of this nation and has been since Australia rode on the sheep's back. It is time we healed the rift. The Howard-Fischer government, and the National Party in particular, has recognised this need, and I am delighted that my friend and electoral neighbour the member for Gwydir has been appointed to meet this challenge.
The other essential element to successfully managing change in our society is to have strong leadership. By that I mean leadership that is robust, not fragile; leadership that is courageous, not timid; and leadership that is inclusive, not divisive. Good leaders will take hard decisions where necessary. That needs to be repeated: good leaders will take hard decisions where necessary, always looking to the future, not to the past. Most importantly, good leaders have vision.
Good leadership is why the National-Liberal parties are sitting on the treasury bench and why the ALP is still in opposition. Over the past three years, strong national leadership has delivered a balanced budget. It has delivered a substantial reduction of debt. It has delivered an economy that is successfully weathering the Asian economic firestorm. It has delivered the lowest interest rates in a generation; and we have record exports. Most importantly, courageous leadership has pro 
 vided a blueprint for a much awaited modernising of Australia's taxation system.
That blueprint received a favourable judgment from the people of Australia on 3 October. But for the benefits of that vision for a new tax system to become a reality, the relevant bills must pass both houses of this parliament. The bills will pass through the House of Representatives, but an easy passage through the Senate is unlikely. The Labor Party, with the support of the minor parties and Independents, threaten to block them and substantially amend their content.
One vital aspect of the proposed new tax system is to reform the present tax on diesel used in transporting the produce of regional Australia to export gateways and markets. The National Party's vision is to remove the current tax of 44c per litre and replace it with an 18c per litre charge—a charge which approximates the cost of road damage caused by trucks. This initiative alone is a $3.5 billion per year boost to our regional economies. It is an initiative especially well understood in New England, it being a highway electorate. This National Party policy will remove a major tax on our regional exports, it will generate jobs and provide growth in our regional industries, and it will reduce the cost of doing business in regional Australia and encourage that most important decentralisation.
I believe in building a society which rewards effort, encourages innovation, values excellence and respects the rights of all. I believe in our Constitution, the flag and our Australian way of life. Yet, Mr Deputy Speaker, our Constitution is not without flaws.
The Senate is said to have been the price of federation. If that is the case, then the Senate's obstruction of our elected governments today may be a price too high to pay. If the latter-day Senate cannot accept the legislative legitimacy of a reformist government then perhaps it is time for the Senate itself to be reformed.
Across Australia, people are clamouring for governments to get on with the job of governing. They do not want excuses, they do not want compromises; they just want govern 
 ments to get on with the business of governing. Our people are sending us a powerful message. I hope that my colleagues on the Labor side have the ears to listen to that message and that they pass the government's taxation bills in the Senate.
Government in Australia stands at the crossroads here today. We can retreat to the time-honoured processes of backroom deals with the opposition, minor parties and Independents and so further entrench political cynicism, or Labor can accept the will of the people as expressed on 3 October and give speedy and unfettered passage to the government's taxation package through the Senate.
The Senate was conceived as the states house. It is interesting that even the Labor states are hardly opposing the tax package. They recognise that the funds they need to pay for their schools, hospitals and roads must come from somewhere. They recognise that a modern Australian economy needs a modern and equitable tax system if jobs and growth are to be generated. They know, too, that a general, consistent and simple tax on goods and services is a far fairer tax regime than having hidden wholesale sales taxes and a multitude of stamp and transaction duties, all of which have to be bolstered by growing state gambling taxes.
Even Labor icons like Gough Whitlam recognised a mandate when he saw it. Paul Keating recognised it in 1993 when he promised to support the Hewson Fightback package if a coalition government was returned at the polls because that package was put to the people. Now, though, Labor promises to oppose the very measures which formed the key plank of the recent federal election campaign.
And what of the Democrats? Their rallying cry over the years has been, `Elect us in the Senate and we'll keep the bastards honest!' Now they are plotting to force changes to a package which will force the government to break its electoral promises. So much for honesty and integrity there.
Government, I believe, must have a story to tell and a positive role in managing unemployment and poverty. Safety nets are certain 
 ly necessary, especially in times of rapid social and economic change. But if national wealth is to be generated and the dignity of employment is to be extended to all, governments at all levels must work together to provide opportunity and not stifle the talents and energies of our communities.
Our coalition government has charted a path here. We in this place and in the Senate must take up that challenge. The choice lies in the hands of the Labor Party and the Senate.
My views on society have been forged in a fairly rough crucible. My education was not at a prestigious university, but at the university of hard knocks. Timber milling, small business and my experience in local government have taught me many lessons. I have learnt to work hard, to listen and to act. These lessons I will bring to this parliament in support of the people of New England and Australia at large.
For me to stand here as the new member for New England, I owe thanks to many people indeed. I will not name them all today. However, I would like to thank the National Party—the second oldest political party in Australia—for giving me the honour to be one of its representatives in this parliament. I thank all those hundreds of party members and supporters who campaigned as volunteer foot soldiers—I repeat, `volunteer foot soldiers'—on my behalf over the last year, particularly Richard and Elizabeth White, of `Bald Blair', Guyra, and the Hon. Jenny Gardiner MLC, who provided me and my family with great strength.
I thank the electors of New England who have entrusted me to represent them here. Most of all, in closing I would like to thank my family: my wife Lynne for doing the hard yards with me, my youngest son Ben for his sense of humour, and my other sons Lachlan, Duncan and Rohan for sharing their experiences of life.
—Before I call the honourable member for Oxley, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,53,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. I extend my congratulations to you on appointment to your high office.
I stand in this House as the new member for Oxley, fully aware of the history of my seat and its recent elevation in the national consciousness. Oxley is the seat you have all talked about over the last three years. Everyone, it seems, has an interest in our community. But, unfortunately, all the attention has been for all the wrong reasons.
People are shocked and unsettled by the rise of political opportunists pushing an antagonistic cause. How did these people and their antagonism appear in our community? They appeared before us because there are real problems in Oxley, as there are throughout Australia. People are hurting. Too many people are genuinely hurting, and have been for too long. And, when people are hurt, they look to something new. And when the pain is great, they look for relief in something radical. They will often try something unknown.
Yet, without any of the theatre or hyperbole that ushered in this astonishing shift in our community, it has suddenly retreated and almost disappeared. They have lost any credible place in contemporary Australia. The remains of this self-proclaimed political force lay strewn like the ruins of the empire of Ozemandius:
. . . Half sunk, a . . . colossal wreck, boundless and bare.
They are gone now because people have seen that anger and fury are not enough. And their particular brand of misdirected anger did nothing to address the issues affecting the lives of us all in Oxley. And we do need the problems of our community addressed.
When I visited work sites like the meatworks in Dinmore and the railway yards of Redbank, I spoke with working people who had voted against Labor for the first time in their lives in 1996. These workers were prepared, though, to give us a go again because I gave them my commitment to roll up my sleeves and work alongside them to get things done.
Oxley cannot afford to be a launch pad for anyone's national political empire. Our concerns are personal and our needs local. This is not to suggest what we do here in this House makes no difference. We are certainly making a difference in people's lives but, regrettably, much of that difference is sometimes for the worse.
Many decisions made here are having a tremendously negative impact on the community we live in. While we often hear from the experts and the economists explaining harsh and unwanted policies—the policies of downsizing, privatisation and national competition policy—these people promote this in terms of flow-on benefits, benefits to the entire community. I do not doubt the sincerity of these experts and economists; I am sure they truly believe in the benefit of their policies. 	But, out in the community, we feel the impact of these policies, and we are not receiving any of the flow-on benefits. We are not benefiting one bit from the relentless pursuit of competition. The end result is often more pain for those who can least afford it. Some may not wish to accept this, or even try to mount an argument to show that it is not true, but the anger out there in the community is evidence enough.
The results of the last election highlight exactly how little support there is in the community for this harsh economic agenda. It is like the game of Chinese whispers—what makes sense in the very beginning can end up scrambled as it goes down the line. This is what happens with government policies. What seems rational in economic models and consultants' reports makes less and less sense as it travels down the line to the community. The mums and dads and the families of Oxley are a long way down that line. What was supposed to help us may, just as likely, end up hurting us.
So much of the current economic agenda, the ideological demand for competition, the blind faith in the markets and the worship of individualism fail to provide for human needs. The relentless pursuit of unfettered competition has led to a disastrous social outcome.
In Oxley, we like our sport, and one of the things that sport teaches us is that in every 
 competition there are some winners and there are also some losers. When you seek competition, you do so knowing that some communities do not have the advantages of others and that some families also do not have the advantages of others. Ours is one such community, and we have many such families.
When you pursue totally deregulated competition, it is people like us in our community who are likely to end up behind on the scoreboard. It is our jobs under threat, it is our services stripped from our community, and our families that are thrown into anxiety and despair. We are invariably the users that pay in a user-pays world.
And, in a cruel irony, in the sickest joke, it is those who have lost their job, taken at the altar of the almighty competition, who can no longer rely on the assistance of a Commonwealth employment service. Instead, this government replaced it with a shambolic and failing jobs network, a network that does not work. It does not work and it will never work because it is in competition with itself. This government has introduced competition to a service that cannot function without cooperation.
But this government is not stopping there. There are further cuts, this time to Centrelink. The government's outrageous plans will drastically scale down services to individuals most in need in our community, and also will take away 5,000 jobs. These are exactly the reasons why we must begin again in Oxley, why we must begin again to rebuild the relationship between people and government.
Relationships are built on communication, and this will be at the heart of my efforts in Oxley. I will always maintain the conversation between the people of Oxley and their government, regardless of who is in power. I want to talk with people; I want them to tell me what their issues are and what impact the government is having on their lives. I want to know about them and their individual circumstances. I want to share their stories.
Through listening to the people of Oxley, I feel I am then able to speak—and speak not to the people but for the people of Oxley. I will carry forward their concerns here in this House and anywhere their message should be 
 heard. I will promote no agenda, save for that of the people of Oxley.
I will earnestly carry forward their message with tolerance and compassion because compassion is the challenge of our times. That struggle for competition has been at the expense of a compassionate society. But compassion must come before competition and, in this period of social, financial and technology change, it is what we must all strive to achieve.
It may seem romantic and idealistic but these are the goals I have set for myself. Both compassion and competition are fundamental elements of our humanity. But competition emerges from us with ease and dominates us without reluctance. For competition and dominance will be forever linked. The successful will always welcome competition and the successful often get their way. But compassion is tough. It seems to take so much from us and give us little reward in return. Milan Kundera said this:
There is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even ones own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels with someone, for someone, a pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echoes.
Government must lay the foundations for a caring society. It must support us in our endeavours to support each other. A compassionate society is built around an infrastructure of respect and tolerance. We must provide shelter for all from anxiety and bitterness. It concerns me that, under Howard, government obligations are replaced with glib homilies and media friendly labels designed more to make us feel better about those that are struggling rather than do anything meaningful to alleviate their problems.
We are not battlers in Oxley. We are pensioners, we are returned service men and women, we are families with sick children, and we are sole parents struggling on low incomes. We are casual and part-time workers desperate to find full-time work, we are people to whom English is not our first language, we are workers threatened with retrenchment, we are school leavers looking for an opportunity, we are disabled, and we 
 are households that dread Christmas for the bills that it brings.
We are all this and we are more. We are the parents helping out on school fetes, we are drivers for meals on wheels, and we are the managers of our neighbour's footy team and the coach of our daughter's netball team. While others may call us battlers, when you come from where I live, we call each other friends, neighbours, workmates and family.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not allow anyone to give up on fixing the problems in our community, to label us as battlers and consign our problems to the political and economic too-hard basket, because we have not given up on ourselves. We are striving as individuals and as organisations for positive changes in our community.
Local P&Cs continue to raise funds and work hard at improving education for our children. Our sporting clubs are doing a terrific job providing leisure and recreation to our community. Our trade unions are continuing the struggle to protect the rights, wages and the dignity of working people in Oxley. Our charitable organisations are asked to do so much more and receive increasingly less assistance from government. Yet they are still performing miracles in our community, but for how much longer.
These organisations are ready to step in and lend a hand and assist people with the basics, like a place to stay, or someone to talk to. Our resource centres are providing advice and advocacy for the vulnerable and marginalised. Our migrant communities and organisations are adding to the richness and character of our region.
Local industry is the linchpin of our local economy, because we need more than just jobs for the people of Oxley. We need local jobs. Local jobs provide so much to our region. Our sense of community comes not only from living together but also from working together. Local jobs bring dignity. And, of course, local employment means more local jobs. When people commute out of Oxley they take money with them and, when that money goes, local jobs go with it. The role of local industry is vital in our area.
None of these groups could do what they do, and do it so well, without the perseverance of a large number of committed and largely unrewarded individuals. And as just one other individual, I am humbled before them—humbled and proud: proud in the knowledge that I am in a position to serve my community. The electorate of Oxley is certainly my community. I have lived and worked in all of the major centres throughout the electorate of Oxley.
At the south of my electorate is the suburb of Inala. This is where I grew up. My family and I came to Australia from another country without much, but a desire for a new start and the opportunity to give something back. Inala is where I learnt about Australia and where I became an Australian. It is where my parents still live. It is truly the place of my formative years.
As a young man I went to school in Inala, got my trade in the Wacol industrial park and, in Ipswich, the metropolitan centre at the north of the electorate, I celebrated my marriage to my wife, Margy, and the birth of my children, Timothy and Emily. And in the geographic heart of the electorate is the growing region of Goodna and Redbank Plains. This is my home and this is where we are raising our family, whose aspirations and needs are the same aspirations and needs as most families in Australia. I am, therefore, privileged to have the opportunity to give something back to a place that I feel so completely linked with and to whom I owe the most tremendous debt of gratitude.
As I look upon my opportunities to serve the people of Oxley, I am struck by the challenges in representing this electorate. As I pointed out earlier, Oxley has several social and commercial centres. The electorate can be divided into three main hubs. To the south of the electorate are the suburbs around Inala and Acacia Ridge. They cannot be treated as outer suburbs of Ipswich City.
At the other end of my electorate I have the heart of Ipswich, divided by an artificial electoral boundary. Services for Ipswich cannot be neatly partitioned off between the two electorates. And representing, as I do, the vast majority of Ipswich City, I therefore 
 recognise the need to preserve and protect all services in the heart of the city.
In the centre of Oxley is the region of Goodna and Redbank. A commercial and administrative hub is in our electorate. Services to this area are under continual threat by the rationalisation of government services. The recent closure of our CES by this government has forced job seekers to travel to Ipswich or elsewhere for employment services. Our electorate is growing rapidly, particularly outside of the Ipswich City heart, and in suburbs like Forest Lake and Springfield. I recognise the need for services to be maintained throughout the electorate and not concentrated in one or two areas.
I am also committed to creating unity amongst all levels of government to provide these vital services. Free of the recent distractions and the pettiness and tribalism of the past, I am confident we can achieve this. And if we can, we must. I will support the work of the local government. The Ipswich City Council is a dynamic and innovative force in our community. The development of global information links and the establishment of Ipswich as a technology town are a triumph and a model for others to follow. The Brisbane City Council's financial commitment to reinvigorating the Inala corridor is achieving real results and greatly improving the local outlook.
The state government, which provides so many vital services in our community, is well aware of the work that needs to be done. Premier Peter Beattie has made jobs his No. 1 priority. Frankly, nothing else would have been good enough for the people of Queensland and Oxley. I am certain our state Labor government will deliver on their commitments in our community. I congratulate the premier on setting these goals and pledge my support and assistance in any endeavour that will create more jobs in my electorate.
Our electorate is also challenged by our recent history. The controversy and ill feeling created by the previous member for Oxley cannot discourage us from discussing and debating the important social issues affecting our community. I welcome any debate on immigration and population policy—any 
 debate free of acrimony and conducted with reason. And I also believe the time is right for us to review and debate the family law and child support policies. Now we must search for solutions to minimise the pain of family break-up, for all involved.
I would like to conclude by thanking those who were central to my success at the recent election. I thank my family, in particular my mother, Suzanne, for her undying love and belief in my abilities, and my father, Andre, for instilling in me the work ethic and courage to pursue my dreams. I thank my soul mate, Margy, for her unconditional support, understanding and love, and my children, Timothy and Emily, who made me realise what life is about and why we must all struggle for a better and just society.
I thank Kim Beazley and my Labor colleagues for their support and advice before and during the election campaign. I would also like to thank the committed and hardworking ALP branch members of Oxley. Success would not have been possible if it had not been not for their hard work and dedication. They organised a magnificent campaign, and the result is a credit to all of them. To all these people and to the electors of Oxley: I am forever in your debt and always at your service.
—Before I call the honourable member for Lowe, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,53,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to congratulate you on your elevation to high office and ask you to extend my congratulations to the Speaker and the other deputy speakers.
I am very honoured to enter this chamber as the representative of the people of the electorate of Lowe. The seat is named after Robert Lowe, Viscount Sherbrooke, who advocated the discontinuatioon of the deportation of convicts to New South Wales and supported the interests of convicts, workers and townspeople during his political career.
My presence in this House today is the result of a collective effort. I would like to 
 sincerely thank the electors of Lowe for showing confidence in my ability to represent their interests. l would also like to thank the party members in Lowe who worked tirelessly during the election campaign to bring Lowe home to Labor. I believe that the ALP's campaign, led by Councillor Virginia Judge and Cherie Burton, was conducted by a very professional team and that that was a decisive factor in the final outcome.
I would also like to acknowledge the enormous contribution made by the former member for Lowe, Michael Maher, and the member for Drummoyne and Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, the Hon. John Murray. I also wish to thank my colleagues whilst on Drummoyne council, Councillor Tony Fasanella and Councillor Angelo Tsirekas.
I also wish to thank the trade union movement for their help, in particular: the Community and Public Sector Union; the Construction Forestry and Mining Employees Union; the Public Transport Union; the Maritime Union of Australia; and the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Union.
Further, I wish to thank the former Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Bob Hawke, for his visit to the electorate. I am pleased to report to this House that he has lost none of his electoral appeal, especially with the ladies. Furthermore, I wish to thank my parliamentary leader, Kim Beazley, and the then shadow ministers who visited my electorate during the campaign. May I say to you, Kim, that your many visits to our electorate were a source of great inspiration to me as you were warmly and affectionately greeted by the electorate at large. In particular, your own style of campaigning enhanced those characteristics of integrity and decency which the Australian electorate expects of all its parliamentarians.
I would also like to thank my brother, Brian, and sisters, Frances, Anne, Maureen and Clare, who have given me great support but unfortunately cannot be here today. I also wish to express my thanks to the one-and-only Olga my mother-in-law, and Hector my father-in-law, and Amelia his wife. I regret that my parents did not survive to see this day 
 for I know they would have been very proud of their baby boy.	Finally, I wish to thank my wife, Adriana, who is on the floor of the House today, for her unfailing love and support. Honey, I could not have done it without you.
I am proud to represent the people of Lowe. The electorate is one of Australia's most volatile seats. The reason for this volatility derives from its vast demographic differences spanning Sydney's inner-west. Mr Deputy Speaker,  you will be interested to learn that Lowe in a microcosm of the new Australia. As many as 40 per cent of my electors were born overseas. Further, Lowe is an electorate which has one of the highest proportions of people over the age of 65 years in New South Wales.
Liberal Party members of this House will reminisce on the period of Sir William McMahon as Prime Minister, who held Lowe from the period 1949 to 1982. In 1982, Mr Michael Maher, the Australian Labor Party candidate, captured Lowe in an historic by-election. That win signalled the return of Labor to government under Bob Hawke the following year. Mr Maher held this seat with distinction until 1987. In 1987, Lowe again returned to the Liberal Party, this time held by Dr Bob Woods, who held the seat until 1993. In 1993 Mrs Mary Easson regained the seat for the ALP. In 1996 Mr Paul Zammit won Lowe for the Liberal Party before resigning from the party in 1998 and becoming an Independent member of this House. In summary, since 1982, Lowe has changed hands on five occasions. This is a sobering fact and will be a constant reminder to me not to take the electors of Lowe for granted.
I personally wish to recognise the two outstanding ALP members of this House who have previously represented this seat, namely, Mr Michael Maher and Mrs Mary Easson. Michael Maher represented the area in both state and federal parliament. In the New South Wales parliament, Mr Maher was member for Drummoyne between 1973 and 1982. I wish to pay special tribute to Michael Maher, who is widely loved and respected for his dedicated parliamentary service. If I can 
 half fill his shoes, the people of Lowe will be well served in the life of this parliament.
As I mentioned a little earlier, Mrs Easson also		represented Lowe with distinction, having served in many positions throughout her time in this House, including those of National Secretary of UNICEF and as member of the Communication Commission for the Sydney Olympics bid.
I also wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the long service in both the New South Wales parliament and this House given by my predecessor, Mr Paul Zammit. In particular, I wish to thank both Mr Zammit and his wife, Rita, for the gracious manner in which they conceded defeat on election night. Might I also add that Mr Zammit's preferences were warmly received by the ALP on election day.
I was born in 1950 in a little country town in New South Wales called Dunedoo. Dunedoo is not very far from Baradine, from where my parliamentary colleague the member for Rankin hails. We, being country boys, understand the importance of looking after rural interests.
Prior to my election to parliament I worked for 28 years in the Australian Public Service. I also served for three years as a councillor in the Drummoyne local government area. During the recent election campaign many issues affecting the electorate of Lowe were raised with me, and I would like on this occasion to briefly address two of these in the first instance—namely, (1) aircraft noise or, as the issue should be more properly put, the question of a second airport for Sydney; (2) taxation and the GST. Later I will go into some detail about the Howard government's attack on the Public Service and my concerns for its future.
But, first, let me return to aircraft noise. There is perhaps no single issue that has affected the hearts, minds and eardrums of the electorate of Lowe more than the Sydney airport issue. So significant is this issue to Lowe that the former Liberal member, Mr Paul Zammit, lost confidence in his government's willingness and ability to tackle the issue and felt compelled to resign from 
 the Liberal Party and contest the election as an Independent.
The people of Lowe have not forgotten the Prime Minister's broken promises on aircraft noise. This House has heard much debate on this issue, and it will hear a lot more during this 39th Parliament. However, I will make this point now, and repeatedly over the next three years: the residents of Lowe will not accept an unbridled continued expansion of Sydney airport—this is made even more urgent by recent predictions that the numbers of passengers travelling through Sydney airport will almost double over the next decade—nor will the citizens of Lowe accept uneven distribution of noise afforded in the long-term operating plan.
It is thus incumbent on this government to show some leadership and see that a second airport is made a priority. This concept includes opposition to airports at Bankstown, Hoxton Park and Camden becoming the dumping ground for regional air traffic movements, thus promoting Sydney airport as `Jet alley'. This is clearly the intention for Sydney airport under the Howard government. The combined effects of the long-term operating plan, coupled with the entire traffic of Sydney airport being jet aircraft, amount to a fundamental failure of this government to adequately address aircraft noise, air safety and associated issues.
I turn now to taxation and the GST. The key message in the ALP's Plan for the Nation is: give the people a fairer taxation system. This means delivering real benefits to families on lower and middle incomes. It also means enabling government to raise the revenue necessary to increase services in critical areas such as health, education and the provision of jobs for all Australians. Labor remains committed in its opposition to a GST.
The reasons for opposing the GST are clearly spelled out: (1) GST affects consumption—it is a regressive tax on consumption—and (2) it affects those with a higher propensity to spend, that is, the higher your percentage of disposable income on consumption, the higher percentage of your disposable income is corroded by the GST.
Before looking at some facts, it is salient for this House to remind itself of some basic tax theory. A tax regime's fairness is not based on its incidence—that is, where the tax is levied—but where the ultimate burden of the tax falls—that is, on whose shoulders the tax most falls upon. The fairness of a tax must be understood in its burden, and understand who actually bears the greatest burden of a GST.
Let us look at some facts. Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure survey, it is concluded that those households with lower income spend a higher percentage of their income on goods and services. For example, the ABS notes that the distributional impact of a GST on average weekly income would produce a regime of tax burden where the lowest income earners pay a higher percentage of GST impost than higher income earners. The ABS notes the GST impost on lowest income earners is more than four per cent of disposable income, while the impost on highest income earners is just over a one per cent impost. This government knows that the lower income earners spend a higher percentage of their disposable income on consumption. It therefore stands to reason that these people will bear the higher burden of the tax. Thus the effect of a GST will be to unfairly burden lower income earners.
On 9 November 1998 the government's own tax and superannuation expert, Liberal Senator John Watson, was reported as pressing the Prime Minister to make concessions on the government's tax package. Senator Watson was reported in the Financial Review as calling `for increased compensation for low income earners'—a position in line with the Australian Democrats and the Independents. Senator Watson was quoted as saying at the Tasmanian Liberal Party's State Conference in Burnie:
I think it may be necessary to offer some concessions, concessions perhaps in terms of lifting the compensation to those who are perceived to be most affected.
The writing is on the wall: the government faces the most profound political backlash from implementing the GST as is. All this is based on a preconceived notion that this 
 government has the mandate, based on the previous federal election, for a GST. But this government does not have a majority vote, nor can it assert a mandate from the last election that the people voted for a GST.
Any tax that hits those least capable of paying is a bad tax. The GST burden crushes those least capable of paying the tax and, for this reason, must be abandoned. I find it particularly galling that the rich and powerful, through the employment of slippery lawyers and accountants, pay relatively little tax while the battlers haemorrhage. It is all very well for the government to preach tax reform to the Australian electorate, but the Australian people do not accept that in relation to the rich `It's all too hard' to get them to pay their fair share of taxation. They expect us, the parliament, to fix it.
What is happening to the Australian Public Service? Prior to coming to this place I was employed for 28 years in the Australian Public Service. I say that with considerable pride because I am proud to have been part of one of Australia's great institutions established by the constitution and recognised around the world as one of the best administrations there is. It is disappointing to me to acknowledge that this government neither recognises the importance nor appreciates the work of the APS.
Since 1995 I have watched the APS being torn apart. This has resulted in absolute job losses in the public sector. At a local level in Lowe I have already had, in response to the savage cuts to Centrelink, a deputation from the CPSU. I look at the Centrelink branches in Strathfield and Ashfield and see the severe budgetary cutbacks that have greatly reduced the services they provide, thus causing social distress amongst the growing number of people who rely on these services. Already I have had complaints about long queues and long waits on the telephone. I am reminded of the words of the Hon. Bob McMullan MP who said:
I think there are areas where we have made cuts that mean we are spending less but we are achieving much less.
Cutbacks in Centrelink is one such area. These Centrelink cutbacks mean the absolute 
 loss of services to our constituents. In scaling down and outsourcing services, the responsibility of government in its social contract between itself and its citizens is fundamentally compromised. Employment is not a question of price efficiency. You cannot reduce Centrelink's efficiency to a profit line, nor can imputed efficiency savings be converted into real dollar cutbacks. Yet this is precisely what is happening, with disastrous consequences.
The Public Service is, amongst other things, the interface between the government and the governed. It provides services fairly, honestly, without discrimination and with great efficiency, remaining always accountable to the elected government of the day. The service is independent of the whims and fancies of individual politicians as it is required to act always in accordance with the law. Not only is the Public Service the interface between the government and the governed, but also it provides a simple means of feedback and advice from the governed to the government, avoiding the need for other channels, such as the news media, to sometimes create embarrassment to the government in pointing out failures of policy or administration.
It seems to me that the government is seeking to destroy the effect of interface between the government and the governed. Functions have been and are being outsourced to people who know little about them and who cannot be held accountable for their performance. Other functions are, it seems, being destroyed; functions such as assisting the jobless to find jobs or to at least acquire relevant skills. The simple and expedient device seems to work of starving the Public Service of resources, with the resulting failures of government policy and administration then being blamed on the bureaucracy.
The Howard government's approach has been characterised by a vindictiveness towards its employees which is destroying morale and making it easier for sackings to occur. It seems to me that it is not just Commonwealth government employees that the government is determined to get rid of but those who provide services required by the community. If I were really cynical I would 
 think the government wanted to rid itself of those citizens and others who receive pensions and other forms of support. Why else would they decimate Centrelink which has so outraged the community? What a lot of nonsense to say that service delivery on an individual basis will be more efficient with something like 30 per cent fewer staff?
The slash and burn policy of staffing the APS has been cruelly underpinned by the passage of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which has shattered the unity and cohesion of the Public Service. It is now a number of fiefdoms with their own pay and conditions under their own agency agreements. The difficulties this created with machinery of government changes after the October election were anticipated by the Public Service, but this did not make it any easier to make the changes.
When a group of people were taken from one department and willy-nilly dumped in another with a different agency agreement in order to punish one minister or reward another, the resulting chaos about pay and conditions simply generated more work for other public servants to fix up. There was the failed attempt to rewrite the Public Service Act 1922. I assume the attempt will be repeated, and I eagerly look forward to the debate when the time comes.
I was proud of the Labor Party's defence of things that matter in public administration, most particularly the need to protect the professionalism and independence of heads of government agencies. Labor supported continuation of the existing proscription on patronage and favouritism and successfully campaigned for a new definition of merit in the now lapsed bill.
The primacy of merit in the selection of people for appointment to the service or promotion within it is mercifully not an issue about which there is partisan disagreement. The World Bank, in its publication, World development report 1997, acknowledges the importance of the merit principle in national development. Good government, the World Bank notes, includes mechanisms such as the merit principle to ensure independence and the absence of corruption. An independent, 
 corruption-free Public Service immeasurably assists both public and private sector performance. A genuinely independent Public Service is seen as an instrument of development, as reflected in the conditions now being imposed by the International Monetary Fund on countries seeking rescue packages.
In Australia, however, there has been considerable argument about the necessity for and the nature of mechanisms for ensuring the merit principle really is applied. For the last eight years of my 28 years with the APS, my work was with the Merit Protection and Review Agency, MPRA. Although now administratively amalgamated with the Public Service Commission to form the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission, the MPRA remains an independent statutory body whose role is independent external review of decisions and actions which affect all Commonwealth employees as employees.
The object of the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984, requires the MPRA to ensure that such decisions and actions are fair and equitable and in accordance with sound personnel management practices, taking account of the efficiency of the employing authority and the need for good relations between employees and their employing authority. In practical terms, this means that the MPRA runs appeals on the merits against promotions. Other major activities include grievance resolution and mediation. I remain very proud to have been the New South Wales state manager performing this important review work.
I also want to acknowledge the work and contribution of Ann Forward, who was the director of the MPRA until the amalgamation in late 1995, after which she was the Merit Protection Commissioner until her retirement last July. Ms Forward will always be remembered for her loyal service to the government of the day and as a fierce defender of the Public Service.
While I am a member of this House I will retain a keen interest in the health of the Australian Public Service. I will see it as one of my key contributions in this place to ensure that this parliament properly scrutinises any further proposed changes to our great 
 Public Service to the detriment of civic society in Australia. I will also ensure that concerns about the Public Service reach out beyond Canberra, because in my electorate people are feeling it too. The annihilation of the Public Service means nothing less than the elimination of responsible government, the denial of people's right to be heard and the elimination of the most fundamental vehicle that enables natural justice to prevail. I will speak out against the grossest offences against the frail, the aged, the sick, migrants, the elderly, war veterans, those requiring state housing and those needing education, and health and law and order protection. I give a commitment to those who elected me to retain an efficient, effective, accountable and independent Commonwealth administration.
In concluding, more than ever the values of the Australian Labor Party will be represented in this House. We stand with an encouraging increase in numbers when compared with the last parliament, and we look to a future that is ever striving for a more equitable distribution of resources. I shall give myself fully to this task. The work and programs in this parliament are formidable. As we approach the 21st century we face a generation of jobless; people who have never known the meaning of the words `job security'. Discharging my duties to the electorate of Lowe is my first responsibility. I commit myself to the pursuit of job creation, social equity and a diverse economy that can sustain the growth necessary to enable my constituents and all Australians to live with dignity and happiness, and to achieve harmony in a more independent, tolerant and egalitarian Australia.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,53,1,speech
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,1998-11-12,"—Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I would like to extend to you and, through you, to Mr Speaker my congratulations on your election. The positions of Speaker and Deputy Speaker are of fundamental importance to the standing and operation of this House and I know that you will discharge your high obligations with great distinction.
This is the third time in less than four years that the electors have done me the honour of returning me to the House of Representatives as the member for Kooyong. The people of 
 Kooyong have always been fair minded and forward looking, and I wish to place on record my sincere thanks for their continued support. I reaffirm my commitment to communicating with them, to listening and to giving them service and effective representation in the House.
I would also like to place on record my thanks to my federal electorate chairman, Wolf Garwoli, and to the members of the Liberal Party branch in Kooyong. Their efforts have kept the seat of Kooyong secure for the Liberal Party and their unstinting physical and material support of other seats in Victoria have made a substantial contribution to the Liberal Party at large.
The Governor-General's speech put forward a wide-ranging program for the Howard government in its second term. There are a number of its themes that I wish to touch on in the course of this speech, but first I want to say something about the election. The 1998 federal election was, beyond question, a very tough, hard fought contest. A real tribute is due to the discipline and focus of John Howard and the coalition leadership team and to the hard work of the federal secretariat.
I would also like to recognise the work of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party. Since we took nine seats from Labor in 1990 Labor has, at every election, briefed the press that they would make massive inroads into the number of federal seats held by the Liberal Party in Victoria—and every time Labor has hit the wall. I would like to congratulate the Victorian division for its professionalism and its determination not to be distracted from the task of beating the Labor Party.
We on this side of the House owe a major tribute to the tenacity with which the coalition's marginal seat holders fought to maintain the support of their constituents. It was their efforts at the grassroots which made a vital contribution to preventing a swing to Labor being converted into a change in government. Nonetheless, a number of my colleagues in marginal seats were defeated, despite the strength of their campaign and the contribution their efforts made to the coalition's overall victory. The government 
 has lost some very fine and very talented parliamentarians, who would have continued to make a very substantial contribution to the parliament and to the national interest.
Politics is a hard business. We are all adults, the stakes are high and we do play to win. But I do not believe that the will to win has blinded members on either side of the House to the fact that politics can sometimes be very cruel in terms of its impact on the lives of individual politicians and their loved ones. In this context I want to mention Warwick Smith and Russell Broadbent in particular because, having lost their seats in 1993, they once again left their other lives and successfully stood for parliament in 1996 only to lose again at the 1998 election.
I doubt if there has ever been a golden age in which democratic politicians have been universally held in high regard, but I think it is equally fair to say that today the Australian public views politicians with a heightened sense of cynicism. I think the cynicism might be diminished just a little if there was a wider recognition of the sacrifices that people like Russell and Warwick and their families have made because of their desire to make a contribution through this parliament to creating a better Australia.
I wish to make another observation about the election. It is not one based on partisanship, although I have to say I do derive some partisan enjoyment from it. Having been involved in federal election campaigns since 1975, I have seen strategic mistakes made on both sides of the political hill. Some of these mistakes have been due to pressure, some due to overstretching due to imperative political demands, others caused by simple arithmetic errors or merely indulgently taking one's eye off the ball. In some campaigns I have seen all four of these happen. But I have never witnessed an unforced strategic error of the magnitude of the Labor Party's promise to impose a capital gains tax on quarantined pre-1985 assets. There was no imperative to impose such a tax. The reported revenue that flowed from such a tax did not greatly contribute to Labor's bottom line.
The tax contradicted Paul Keating's commitment that the new capital gains tax he 
 introduced in 1985 would `be prospective in every sense'. To put it crudely, the 1998 proposed tax was retrospective. This tax put off a huge number of voters who for over a decade had premised their actions on Labor's 1985 commitment. Not least, the proposed tax could be attacked utterly without distortion by quoting Labor's own policy. I quote from the policy at page  61:
All pre-CGT assets must be valued as at 1 January 1999. All real gains made from the valuation date will be subject to CGT.
I believe that the Labor Party paid dearly for that. Perhaps the people who were busy rewriting Mark Latham's education policy would have been better off scrutinising Labor's tax policy.
The issues at stake in the 1998 federal election and which will be addressed during the term of the current parliament are many and varied. There are, however, three issues in particular that I want to look at it. The first is tax reform. I do not think there can be any disputing of the fact that the central issue leading up to and throughout the 1998 election campaign was the reform of Australia's tax system. For the first time in modern Australian political history, and I think that is probably being a little historically modest, both domestically and internationally, the government went to the election with a clearly defined and comprehensive plan for redesigning Australia's tax system, the plan which included the GST—and the government won.
What emerged very clearly over the government's first term of office was a real sense that Australians are fed up with the complex, confusing, inefficient, inconsistent and unfair nature of the existing tax system and that they want it fixed. The government had the courage and honesty to put forward a bold plan of tax reform which proposed key reforms. The government proposed reforms to indirect taxes and state finances designed to get rid of the worst of the current indirect taxes levied by both the Commonwealth and the states and to replace them with a simple and transparent goods and services tax, and to address the issue of Commonwealth-state financial relationships.
The government also proposed reforms to income tax and social security systems which were designed to provide across-the-board tax cuts, compensate for the impact of the increase in direct taxes, and achieve a more sensible integration of tax and transfer arrangements. It also proposed reforms to business taxes to improve the certainty, consistency and fairness of business tax arrangements, to address tax avoidance opportunities, and to ensure that tax arrangements more closely match commercial realities. There are also reforms to tax administration to reduce the administrative workload on individuals and companies, and to remove some of the inequities in payment arrangements between different types of taxpayers.
The plan will deliver substantial long-term improvements in the operation of the economy, to the benefit of all Australians. These improvements will be reflected in higher economic growth, a stronger export performance, more jobs and lower unemployment.
On election day, the Australian people, having been subjected to mountains of information from the government and misinformation from the opposition, as well as persuasion and dissuasion on the tax reform plan, re-elected the government—the government which was demonstrably, publicly, unequivocally and totally committed to implementing this plan.
The simple fact is that the Australian people elected the coalition—not Labor or the Democrats—to govern. The government's intentions were clearly put and the government now has an unambiguous responsibility to implement the platform on which it stood, the platform on which it was elected. The Labor Party is trying to prevent a government implementing the mandate on which it was elected.
The Labor Party's position on this is not only opportunistic but it is also hypocritical in the extreme. Whenever the topic of taxes and elections is raised, my mind instantly goes back to the events of 1993. I admit that some bits of 1993 were a touch traumatic—actually, lots of 1993 were a touch traumatic—but it is worth the pain of remembrance because what Labor did then underscores the utter invalidity of Labor's current stance. 
In the lead-up to the 1993 election, the Labor Party legislated a raft of personal income tax cuts. Paul Keating promised, in his now famous words, `not to put up tax'. That is now history, because after the election Labor dumped its tax cuts and increased indirect and other taxes in the 1993 budget. The Labor Party then went on a rhetorical binge when the coalition held it to account for breaking its fundamental pre-election commitments after the election.
Today, however, the Labor Party is desperately thrashing around trying to prevent the coalition government from keeping its fundamental election commitments. The only consistency, at least that I can find, throughout this is that Labor is resolutely determined to ensure that the Australian public does not get the tax policy that the party elected to government clearly campaigned on.
In 1993, the Labor government dishonoured the tax promises it made and, in 1998, Labor wants to use its representation in the Senate to prevent the coalition from honouring its tax promises. 
Of course the election was about more than just tax. As the Governor-General made clear in his speech, this government will be about more than just tax.
One of the most important challenges facing the government over the next three years will be to put in place measures to ensure high quality health services to all Australians, both now and in the future. This challenge has confronted every incoming Australian government for at least 25 years. It is a challenge which I think this government is well positioned to confront. The government supports absolutely Australia's Medicare system which provides universal access to public hospital facilities and helps to subsidise people's medical costs, both in and out of hospital.
However, the government recognises that Medicare cannot stand alone. It must be supplemented by a strong, viable private health insurance system. I have advocated the significance of private health insurance over many years, and I have consulted widely on it with the constituents of Kooyong. I have received their overwhelming support on this.
In my first speech in this House, back in February 1995, I said that revitalising private health insurance is `not just a matter of need, but also a matter of rationality. If the 700,000 Australians who have let health insurance lapse since 1990 access public hospitals at the rate of Australians overall, the drain on the public purse will be about $495 million per annum. If immediate remedial action is not taken, the outcome is clear. We will have a non-viable private hospital and private health insurance system, with the public system collapsing under the weight of burgeoning waiting lists, and an unacceptable financial drain on government and taxpayers'.
The problems of Australia's private health insurance system stem essentially from the decline in private health insurance coverage from 68 per cent in 1984 to just over 30 per cent of Australia's population today. This decline, caused by a string of Labor actions and inactions, has driven up premiums as the group of net contributors to the funds has diminished. Additional pressures have consequently been placed on the public hospital system as people dropping out of private health insurance have come to rely primarily on the public system.
I am not sufficiently naive to presume that such an established and self-reinforcing cycle will be simple to correct—far from it—but we have to make every endeavour to reverse the cycle. During its first term in office, the coalition government introduced a number of measures designed to address the problem. These developments were positive and they went beyond anything ever contemplated by the Labor Party, but still more needs to be done.
The government's proposal, announced at the time of the tax reform plan, to provide an uncapped, un-means tested rebate of 30 per cent of people's expenditure on private health insurance puts the most important element of an eventual solution in place. The incentive will be a tremendous relief to those Australians who have struggled to maintain their private hospital insurance in an era of rapidly increasing premiums. It will ease some of the pressures placed on the public hospital system 
 by the Labor Party's total neglect of a critical part of Australia's health care infrastructure.
That is one part of the Howard government's strategy for rebuilding Australia's health care systems and equipping them for the needs of the next century. Another is the provision of over $3 billion in additional funding to the states for public hospitals.
The Labor Party, I understand, will oppose the new rebate, as I expect it will oppose most of the initiatives put by the government to the parliament over the next three years. But Labor can put forward no alternative scheme to turn around the decline in the private health insurance sector and thus no viable long-term solution to the problems of financing Australia's health care needs.
The simple fact is that more than 25 per cent of Australia's total health expenditure, in excess of $13 billion, is financed from private sources, either through private health insurance or as direct out-of-pocket expenditure. If private expenditure were to be run into the ground, this 25 per cent would be lost, placing an extra $13 billion or so funding requirement on government.
A universal access, effective and efficient public health system is vital for Australia. For this to be really effective, it must be complemented by a system which actually encourages people who can do so to make an additional contribution to their health care costs. That is the rationale behind the government's efforts to encourage people back into private health insurance. It is something that the Australian health system needs and it is something that the public wants. If the Labor Party tries to prevent it being put into place, Australia's voters will punish Labor. That is a simple statement of fact.
The other important outcome of the election was the defeat of Pauline Hanson's misnamed One Nation Party. Pauline Hanson made bold predictions about significant increases in One Nation's representation in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The election's outcome has given One Nation one defeated leader, not one seat in the House of Representatives and only one senator. I think this is a testament to the intelligence, openness, 
 tolerance and fair-mindedness of the Australian community.
I do not believe, however, that there can be any room for complacency. The hard fact is that One Nation received 8.5 per cent of the primary vote for the House of Representatives across the country—almost one million primary votes. The hard fact is that One Nation did win 11 seats in the Queensland state election. The hard fact is that in future elections, with or without Pauline, One Nation will have the benefit of the public funding they derived from this election, as well as the experience of having run a national campaign. We cannot assume that the One Nation party is over.
I believe that the Prime Minister was right when he said of those attracted to Mrs Hanson:
A few no doubt are [bigoted, narrow-minded and racist]. Most, however, are not.
In an environment where change is ongoing and often dislocating, it is easy for people to be attracted by simplistic solutions to the problems we face. To address the appeals of Hansonism, we need to hammer away at simplistic proposals that just don't work—at the two per cent Easy Taxes. And we need to constantly hammer away that beneath these simple solutions is the fundamental basis of Hansonism: a hard core of bigotry, racism and intolerance

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1998-11-12,"—Yesterday in my first speech in this House I put on notice that the people of Shortland were sick of this government ripping services out of their community. In fact, my parliamentary predecessor, Peter Morris, brought the concerns of the electorate to this parliament when the Howard government closed the Belmont Medicare office. He presented petitions and he raised the matter in adjournment debates here.
Belmont Medicare office was a very vital service for the people of Belmont and the surrounding area. The Howard government really demonstrated their lack of knowledge of the electorate of Shortland when they closed that office. It meant that people have to travel many, many kilometres to Charlestown—which the government were not even able to spell correctly—to gain refunds from their local Medicare office. The area it served has a lot of elderly people and people with young families, and often they needed to get the Medicare refund from the doctor's bill to be able to purchase medication.
There was also the closure of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. I worked in the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service myself for many years, and I was an employee of that service when the office in Charlestown opened. It was opened to provide a better service to people with disabilities. It was part of the Labor government's philosophy that you should deliver services to people near to where they live. Instead of people with disabilities being able to go to Charlestown and travel maybe 10 kilometres to get the assistance they need, now they have to travel right into Newcastle. It is argued that staff can go and provide the services for people in those areas, but you cannot perform a physical tolerance assessment in a person's home and you cannot undertake a vocational assessment in a person's home. It is all about disrespect for the people of Shortland and it is all about not providing those services that people need in their areas.
The cutting of the Centrelink visiting service to Swansea was another example of the disrespect held for the people of the area. It benefited Eastlakes Neighbour Aid Centre, where they went, and it also benefited the people of the area. Once again, they have got to travel many kilometres to Charlestown. Public transport takes them an hour and it costs them money to get there—money that they do not have.
Unlike this government, my approach is to provide more services rather than fewer services to the people of the electorate. Where the Howard government removed the services from the people of Shortland and took away 
 that visiting service to the people in Swansea, what I will be doing is providing a visiting service to the people in Swansea and other areas throughout the electorate. Tomorrow I will be going to Swansea. I will be going to the Eastlakes Neighbour Aid cottage, the cottage where Centrelink once visited. I will be seeing people there, and I will be prepared to offer a service.
We on this side of the House are about providing services. We on this side of the House are about people. We on this side of the House are about community. We on this side of the House care about people: we care about the people in Shortland, just as I care about the people in Shortland.
We are going to fight to see that you on that side of the House do not take away any more services from these fine working people of Shortland. These are people who can no longer go to the Belmont Medicare office and who have to travel a number of kilometres to get their refunds. These are people with disabilities who can no longer get the services that they need in that area. These are people in receipt of social security benefits who now have to travel a number of kilometres to be able to get those benefits paid to them. They have to rely on public transport. They do not have the money to be able to access those services because those on the other side of the House are always taking away their benefits and restricting what they are entitled to.
I am about making sure that the people of Shortland have those services and that they get the good strong representation that they deserve.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Health: Disability Services</title>,Adjournment,54,1,speech
