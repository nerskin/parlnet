"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,"—I understand that the minister wishes to close the second reading debate on the Superannuation Safety Amendment Bill 2003. I thank all honourable senators for their contributions on the bill. It is obviously an important bill to the government. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Original question, as amended, agreed to.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2004-03-10,"—There are a number of issues with the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003—and I will be outlining them in a moment—but first it is important that I give a brief background to this legislation and how it fits into the Howard government's dreadful management of alternative fuels policy. The sorry saga of the government's alternative fuels policy dates back to 1999, when the government announced the Measures for a Better Environment package as part of its deal with the Democrats. This package committed the government to assisting the alternative fuels sector in return for the Democrats supporting the introduction of the GST.
Following the introduction of the GST, we saw petrol prices soar with the highest-taxing Treasurer in the nation's history relishing the windfall. However, following pressure from Labor and the community, the Treasurer had to relent and, in so doing, announced the fuel taxation inquiry headed by David Trebeck in July 2001. After receiving many submissions, Trebeck recommended that all fuels should be placed on a level playing field and taxed according to their energy content. However, no sooner had Trebeck reported in March 2002 than the government announced the rejection of the report. To all intents and purposes, the Trebeck report was dead.
But then mysteriously and out of the blue, on 12 September 2002, the government announced it would impose excise on fuel ethanol blended with petrol at the same rate as the excise on unleaded petrol—at 38.143c a litre—taking effect from 18 September. At the same time, customs duty on imports of ethanol of 38.143c a litre was also imposed. We now know why this all happened: `ethanolgate'—the Howard government's stunning modern example of crony capitalism; the coalition's deliberate effort to subvert good public policy and fiscal rigour and replace it with insider backroom deals. 
So why the government's sudden rush to impose the excise? Why the government's change of mind? It is pretty simple really. It is because on 24 July 2002 representatives of Trafigura Fuels met with Manildra in an attempt to secure a domestic ethanol product. Manildra choked, refusing to supply Trafigura and another competitor, Neumann Petroleum. Thanks to FOI documents we now know that on 1 August the head of Manildra, Dick Honan, met with his mate the Prime Minister where they discussed a producer credit to enable ethanol producers to compete with the cheaper Brazilian product. The deal was being done.
Following the Honan meeting, on 10 September cabinet ticked off on Honan's request for an excise and an offsetting production grant for ethanol producers. These grants have not been cheap. To the end of January this year they had cost $28.5 million, around 90 per cent of which has gone to just one company—Dick Honan's Manildra. We also know that Treasury and Finance were opposed to this, and for good reason. Crony capitalism takes revenue from the many and gives to the undeserving few.
But the story does not end there. Because of Manildra's intransigence, and completely unaware of the backroom deal that had taken place, Neumann and Trafigura had arranged an alternative shipment from Brazil—the overseas shipment that the PM has stated was not an import. They entered into the shipment contract without a tax, but the tax was implemented in the dead of night as the ship was en route. They were basically stranded on the high seas. What was the final upshot? Honan scored a public subsidy of more than $20 million and his two competitors were stranded on the high seas with losses of up to $1 million. The government and Honan were happy knowing that their decision stranded Manildra's competitors. It was a case of shocking policy on the run—pernicious, as Mr Paul Morton of Neumann described it—policy for the insiders and for the Prime Minister's mates. 
Given all of this, shouldn't Labor be concerned about how the government manages producer grants in the alternative fuels sector? It is precisely because of `ethanolgate' that we are suspicious of how this government deals with alternative fuels. The government's approach to alternative fuels is laced with ad hoc decision making designed to suit mates and the interests of the time, which brings me to the 2003 budget.
Following the excise decision, and despite initially rejecting the Trebeck report, the government had to retrofit its ethanol decision and make a silk purse from a sow's ear. This took place in the 2003 budget. The government proposed changes to the way fuels are taxed and in late May introduced the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 to give legal effect to its decision to impose excise on fuel ethanol. In June 2003 we also saw additional excise on high sulphur diesel as part of the Better Environment undertakings. The government also quite sneakily appropriated moneys for production grants or subsidies, as they used to be known, to ethanol producers as part of the appropriation bills. The government labelled this `fuel tax reform', but a better description is fuel tax retrofit. It is backfilling after the original ethanol decision. 
All this background serves as a useful prelude to this bill. It is little wonder that the warning lights should come on. From 18 September, biodiesel became subject to excise and customs duty by virtue of the government's decision of 12 months ago. This bill provides a grant equivalent to the amount of duty, giving an effective zero excise-customs rate for a period of five years. It is an offset, and the opposition and more broadly the industry have concerns about it. I will deal with the latter first.
Industry have raised the concern that the so-called five by five arrangements may not be long enough. They have argued that the five-year window until 30 June 2008, during which the grant offsets the excise, is too short. I note the Democrats' dissenting report calls for a 10 by 10 regime. It is a pity the Democrats have not emphasised the need to ensure stronger performance and accountability measures for the alternative fuels industry in their report. Mutual obligation, which seems to be a catchcry of the Howard government—should be equally applicable to industry welfare as it is to individual welfare. You cannot have one rule for some and another for others. The other concern is that the industry have not been well consulted and there is considerable uncertainty. In short, the uncertainty is due to this government's policy on the run. Blame it on `ethanolgate'. It is as simple as that.
For both these criticisms the blame rests squarely with the government. In their desire to approach alternative fuels policy as an exercise in `looking after your mates'—or, in this case, the Prime Minister's mates—the government has allowed policy to be managed in an ad hoc and incoherent fashion. Basically, it appears that, if the industry feels let down, it is because of ethanol, Manildra, Honan and the Prime Minister. The industry is right when it calls for a transparent and logical approach to alternative fuels policy—something we do not appear to be seeing from the other side of the chamber. This government supports crony capitalism. Labor will reward effort and innovation. The coalition reward their mates.
Labor has looked closely at this piece of legislation and our view is deeply coloured by the ethanol deals. We look with suspicion at the lack of transparency in the subsidy arrangements. Why have two approaches, one for ethanol and one for alternative fuels? Why not have a consistent approach that captures all alternative fuels, irrespective of their type? And what of the so-called progressive nature of the scheme where the regulation prescribes what is a clean fuel as it becomes eligible for a grant, not the other way around? It is because the government only support clean fuels if it will help their mates—or, in this case, the Prime Minister's mates. 
—The Minister interjects that we take our orders from the trade union movement. We certainly do not. We have a relationship with them. But I can tell you who the Prime Minister listens to most when it comes to this area of policy—his mate Dick Honan. Any analysis of the public policy position you have taken in relation to ethanol can only come to one thing—and that is, Mr Honan met with the Prime Minister and he got what he wanted. That is the truth of the matter, Minister. 
I return to the so-called progressive nature of the scheme where the regulation prescribes what a clean fuel is as it becomes eligible for a grant, and not the other way around. As I said, it is because the government only support clean fuels if it will help their mates. And how, in the year 2003 and during this era of mutual obligation, can we allow production subsidies to be given to so-called infant industries, without establishing a system to review performance or success? When does the infant finally grow up?  
Finally, what does it say about Australia's commitment to free trade? The Labor Party established the Cairns Group, which includes Brazil, a nation now concerned about the trade implications of these insider biofuel deals. This government talks free trade and free markets but does not do anything to back them up. At the end of the day it is a government for insiders. Overall, the fabric of the government's alternative fuels policy is piecemeal, driven by industry interests, is oblivious to the needs of consumers or taxpayer, is riddled with pernicious dealism and is a return to McEwen protectionism. 
It is back to the future for the coalition—back to the classic days of Tory McEwenism, a model of government that perhaps secretly they have always longed for. Yes, we know the coalition always try to appropriate the best words—or the words they think are the best: choice, markets, enterprise—but they never have the best vision. That is always left to Labor and Labor governments. Labor are the party of competitive markets, thrift and opportunity. We deregulated the financial markets, the airline industry, telecommunications and energy. We introduced the Trade Practices Act and the industry commissions. We cut the tariffs. On this side of the house we believe in equal opportunity for all and special privileges for none; the reconciliation of fairness and enterprise—this is the Labor way.
Labor will not be opposing this bill, but we will be watching its management and administration very closely. We will be watching who the winners are and who gets the preferences. We will be watching how much money is spent and where it goes. And we will be looking out for crony capitalism. That is our undertaking.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-10,"—The problem we have with the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 is entirely what Senator Wong has just indicated—that is, competitive markets. What the government is asking for here is for the alternative fuel industry to be competitive with petrol. The point which was missed by the last speaker, Senator Wong, is the fact that these are very different fuels that we are dealing with. On the one hand, petrol and its emissions, as we know, are damaging to health and, on the other hand, alternative fuels offer some considerable benefits over petrol. Senator Wong may be pleased with Labor's position on competitive markets, and she talks about equal opportunities for all, but the losers here are those of us who have to breathe the air which results.
The Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 would not be necessary had the government stuck to its election promise and not imposed excise on cleaner fuels. At the end of the day, that is what this is all about. The government did decide to impose that excise and, sadly, the opposition has indicated support for that policy decision. This bill seeks to impose a grant to effectively offset that excise. The government wants to phase in an excise on cleaner fuels, starting in 2008, in five incremental steps. That excise is applied at the final rate in 2012. In practice, the excise would be introduced retrospectively from 18 September 2003. Between 2003 and 2008, the government proposes to offset the excise by way of a grant, the framework for which is created by this bill.
In 1999, as part of its agreement with the Democrats to introduce the new tax system, the government announced the Measures for a Better Environment—or MBE—package. Part of this announcement included a commitment to encourage the conversion from the dirtiest fuels to the cleanest. The government's budget announcement last year to tax alternative fuels at the same calorific rate as petroleum fuels went entirely against that commitment. 
Prior to the 2001 election, the government announced a target production of 350 million litres of biofuels per annum by 2010. That would be around one per cent—a very small percentage—of the total transport fuel use. It also committed to maintaining the fuel excise exemption to cleaner fuels as well as announcing $50 million in capital grants—something the Democrats entirely supported, it being very appropriate to see this industry grow to a very small one per cent. Sadly, that $50 million has now been whittled away to $37 million. We are still waiting for an explanation as to the reason for that. Perhaps the minister will be able to enlighten us during this debate. In March 2002, Minister Truss assured Dalby biorefinery:
I can confirm on behalf of the government that, as stated in the Biofuels for Cleaner Transport policy, the current exemption of fuel ethanol from 38c per litre excise on petroleum products will be maintained and that the capital grants scheme would be in place by July 2002.
That promise has been broken. The Democrats opposed the introduction of an excise on cleaner fuels and we continue to do so. We believe that fuels such as LPG, compressed natural gas, ethanol and biodiesel should be encouraged—and taxing them is not giving them that encouragement. In fact, there are many places around the world where there are direct encouragements by way of subsidies and incentives for vehicles and alternative fuels.
There are a number of reasons why we think these fuels should be encouraged. Cleaner fuels, as the name suggests, present greenhouse and air quality benefits and a broader diversity of fuel stocks in the fuels markets, which reduces our reliance on imported oil and improves Australia's fuel security, particularly LPG and natural gas, of which Australia has plentiful supplies. Alternative fuels, particularly ethanol and biodiesel, provide further opportunities for regional communities to diversify and add value, creating valuable jobs in regional areas.
The blending of biofuels in petrol and petro-diesel provides health benefits, in that biofuels are oxygenates and, when added to petro-fuels, they result in a cleaner burn. The effect of this is fewer particulates in emissions, resulting in public health benefits. The American Lung Association of Metropolitan Chicago credits ethanol blended reformulated petrol with reducing smog forming emissions in the city by 25 per cent since 1990. Professor Ray Kearney, of the University of Sydney, has also done extensive research in this area and advocates the mandating of biofuel blends to reduce the rates of respiratory illness, including asthma, emphysema and lung cancer.
Unlike petroleum based fuels, these alternative fuels are niche fuels and have yet to establish themselves in the market. They are particularly vulnerable to price fluctuations, as was evidenced by the crisis facing APA Manufacturing in my home state of Victoria. APA, Australia's largest LPG component manufacturer, went into administration last year due to falling orders of LPG components, and that was a direct result of the government's tax announcement. In a market where petroleum fuels are entrenched and have gained familiarity with consumers over generations, one of the competitive advantages that cleaner fuels do have is price, and they need that price advantage. But the imposition of an excise has the potential to take that advantage away, not only threatening the viability of existing producers and the livelihoods of those currently employed in the industry but also jeopardising the future of new up-start plants. 
The cleaner fuels industry presents many opportunities to regional communities which, as we all know, are experiencing tough times. Regional communities are always on the look-out for new industries, for opportunities to add value and for employers who will provide much needed jobs. The ethanol industry is one such industry. Ethanol can be produced from sugarcane and grain, providing opportunities for both inland and coastal areas. Senators may be aware of plans to build a $79 million plant at Dalby, west of Toowoomba in Queensland, and an $80 million plant at Gunnedah in north-western New South Wales. Combined, these plants will create over 80 permanent direct jobs, 535 indirect jobs and over 900 construction jobs. That is from the establishment of just two plants. So there is a real chance that, with the right government incentives, plants such as these could be established up and down the Queensland coast and also into New South Wales—which should interest Senator Wong. I am also aware of preliminary plans to build plants in Swan Hill in my home state of Victoria. There is also talk of a possible mixed cane and grain plant that would operate at Mareeba, in North Queensland. The Mareeba plant would have the benefit of having to rely on grain as a feedstock for part of the year and on cane for the rest of the year.
Bearing in mind that the government has clearly stated its policy intention and the ALP has stated on the record that it too supports the imposition of excise on alternative fuels—we have heard very little about the advantages of alternative fuels, so obviously the ALP does not feel that there is a need to oppose this excise—the Democrats welcome this bill as a means of offsetting the negative immediate impacts of the imposition of an excise on cleaner fuels. We are, however, very concerned that the new excise regime and the government's stated policy to offset the excise are not enough to see the establishment of a serious cleaner fuels industry in this country. We say there is no use in passing a bill that only goes partway to helping the industry, because that will not achieve the goal of establishing a viable cleaner fuels industry. It will not benefit new producers in regional areas, such as those in the Deputy Prime Minister's seat of Gwydir or in Dalby, adjoining the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources's seat of Groom. It will instead result in a very small cleaner fuels industry comprising one or two producers whilst other existing producers or potential start-up operations fall by the wayside. 
The Democrats will move amendments in committee to guarantee minimum time frames for excise free periods. I note that this is not currently in the bill—it would be left to regulations—but we feel it is important to see those periods put in legislation. We will also move amendments to guarantee that, when an excise is imposed, it is phased in gradually over a five-year period, as the government says it should be in its policy.
Senators and members in the other place who have had any involvement with this issue will no doubt have met with prospective ethanol producers from Dalby and Gunnedah, the towns I mentioned. They will hopefully have heard that their plants will not get off the ground without at least a seven-year excise exemption, and that is after their plants commence production. Senators will also know that these prospective producers have spent many months and a lot of money researching and planning their plants and the technology they will need and working hard to secure finance for those plants. It obviously also takes time to build a plant and to commission it—bearing in mind that any new prospective producers, such as those in the sugar industry, will need to go through a similar process. 
We believe that the absolute minimum period of excise exemption that the industry needs in order to get off the ground is 10 years. Ideally, as I said, we would prefer to see no excise until there is a target achieved in terms of penetration of the market for alternative fuels, but we recognise that this is unlikely to be supported by either of the major parties, which seem not to care about alternative fuels. In this context, we suggest that there should be a 10-year excise free period for any ethanol producer from the time their plant commences production, but we note that the government has indicated it is unwilling to consider this position because of what it claims are administrative issues. So, in the spirit of a compromise, we will move amendments which would be four years from 2004 to allow new entrants to start production—there is no point in creating a situation where we have monopoly production—followed by seven years of excise exemption with a phase-in period of five years, as was proposed by the government. Our amendments will reflect that.
I want to say that this is not an argument about revenue. This is not an argument about balancing the books. It is not an argument about competition or about giving one sector an unfair advantage over another. It is an argument that is ideologically driven. The economic rationalists in the government and the ALP will argue for the need to achieve competitive neutrality. They will argue that there is a need for an equal tax regime to achieve competitive neutrality. I just ask senators in this place: what competitive neutrality is there when petroleum producers control more than 90 per cent of the total fuel market, where consumers have developed generations of familiarity with petrol fuels, when consumer confidence in fuels is at an all-time low—thanks in no small part to a scare campaign which has been peddled by many players in this whole debate, including the automotive industry and the ALP, possibly in consort with petroleum companies, and of course assisted in the parliament by arguments such as we have heard already this morning? What competitive neutrality is there in a fuels market where the dominant player, the petroleum industry, has had decades and decades within which to establish economies of scale, infrastructure and distribution networks and to build upon, develop and enhance that infrastructure and those networks? There is no competitive neutrality in the current fuel arrangements, and an excise regime will certainly not deliver any. But, more importantly, this purely ideological approach ignores the real benefit that alternative fuels provide to regional communities, to fuel security and to public health.
As I have said, this is not an argument about revenue. The revenue from the alternative fuels sector is so small as to be hardly worth discussing. It is the case, of course, that the health benefits from alternative fuels would negate any loss that might be coming through revenue in terms of health costs. The revenue raised by imposing an excise on LPG is slightly more significant because it has been around for about 25 years longer than the other sectors. However, a tax on LPG will only generate revenue for Treasury as long as that industry survives.
The original government announcement in the May budget was to impose an excise which would be based on calorific value—in other words, the energy content—at rates that the industry simply could not have sustained. It was only as a result of pressure through intense lobbying by industry groups and by the Democrats—and, I might mention, Senator Boswell, by government backbenchers and members of the National Party who saw this decision impacting seriously in their electorates—that the government was forced to review its excise rates and subsequently declared that they would be half of what they were in the first proposal. 
If Treasury are serious about addressing revenue through transport fuels, taxing alternative fuels is not the way to go. The revenue raised by taxing alternative fuels could easily have been raised by reintroducing indexation on petrol. That was suspended indefinitely by this government in March 2001—after rising petrol prices had begun to settle, I might add. The revenue forgone since March 2001 by not indexing petrol excise to CPI now totals $2.5 billion. So we are trying to patch up a bit of revenue by taxing a very small industry in a way that may well see it go out of business, but we are ignoring the fact that we are missing out on $2.5 billion by putting a ceiling on that indexation.
In its criticism of the government's policy there is one point which the opposition did get right. That is that, if this bill were to pass the Senate unamended and if the Treasurer were to make regulations in accordance with the budget announcement of May 2003 and the Prime Minister's announcement of 16 December last year, there would be only one winner out of all this, and that would be Manildra. The ALP has gone to great lengths to make a big fuss about Manildra and to drag through the mud not only that company's name but also the reputation of ethanol as a transport fuel. I think that the ALP should be ashamed of what it has done in that respect.
However, having gone to great lengths to mention Manildra in every debate concerning ethanol in this place and in the other place, if the ALP does not support the Democrat amendments to this bill it will see that Manildra will be the only producer that stands any chance of surviving the imposition of excise, with the possible exception of CSR in Queensland, which produces small amounts of ethanol—and, I might add, has been doing so for many decades. If the government and the ALP are serious about ensuring the establishment of a broad based ethanol and other alternative fuels industry, they should see that it is not dominated by one player and that it is not an effective monopoly. I look forward to the ALP supporting our amendments. I hope that the government can see their way to doing likewise.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2004-03-10,"—There is no doubt that the future of Australia's transport industry, the future of many of Australia's agricultural industries and, indeed, the future of Australia's sugar industry are closely linked to the future of a strong ethanol industry in Australia. A successful ethanol industry in Australia can be based on wheat, barley, sorghum and sugar cane. A successful ethanol manufacturing industry that delivers a 10 per cent blend of fuel ethanol into the engines of Australian motors will have a huge impact on our economy and on the health of this nation. It will effect a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and significant reductions in vehicle exhaust emissions that cause air pollution and pose a threat to public health. It will also have a major impact on the viability of rural and regional Australia. The debate should not be whether Australia should have an ethanol industry. We should be asking, `How soon can we have a significant industry up and running, providing health benefits for us, additional financial security for regional Australia and the future energy security of our nation?'
An ethanol industry should not be viewed as a saviour for the cane farmers. It is not a magic wand that can be cast over sugar seats and miraculously provide substantial returns to farmers. Ethanol is part of the answer for the sugar industry. So is industry restructuring, increased farm efficiency, immediate temporary income support and exit packages for those who can no longer go on. A vital ethanol industry will result in increased fuel self-sufficiency, an improved balance of trade, a reduction in vehicle regulated exhaust emissions, massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the reinvigoration of rural and regional Australia. Future technology which some say is only five years away will also enable viable ethanol production from the walls of plant cells, making productive use of forest plantation waste, crop stubble, bagasse and other waste products from cropping. 
Future generations will thank this government for taking the steps to ensure a cleaner environment, free from the various toxic milkshakes that make up engine emissions and smog. Globally, Australia is a long way behind in the production of clean fuel—essentially, ethanol. Many other nations have embraced with both hands the opportunity to have resource security and they have committed millions of dollars to support the development of this alternative fuel source. With the world in such a state of insecurity, any measures that increase Australia's self-sufficiency in fuel and reduce the need to be dependent on the stability and reliability of supply from the major oil exporters must be seen as a plus. Some people question the cost to government of supporting the development of this new industry. I ask: can we afford not to do it?
It is not surprising that ethanol production and its inclusion in transport fuels has been fought by the petroleum industry. Scare campaigns based on fuel consumption and as yet unsubstantiated claims of engine damage have been doing the rounds of current affairs shows and petrol station noticeboards. This is not new. Exactly the same thing happened in the USA over 20 years ago. In no country in the world have the major oil companies voluntarily facilitated access for competitors or for competition fuels such as ethanol to the transport fuel market that they dominate worldwide. Mandates or regulated use of biofuels based on clean air and health have been necessary to provide free and open access to transport fuel markets. In America the oil industry fought like wounded bulls to keep control of their cosy existence and market domination. The oil companies questioned the environmental and health values of ethanol, they questioned the risk to engine function and warranties, and they questioned the economic viability of ethanol production.
Years later, after US government production assistance and clean air legislation, ethanol production has grown to over 10 billion litres per year and is expected to exceed 20 billion litres by the year 2012. In the US, there are currently 70 ethanol production plants on line with a further 13 plants, each with a capacity of over 110 million litres, under construction. Oil companies were forced to remove MTBE from their fuel supply as it was found to be contaminating freshwater supplies. The oil companies replaced MTBE with ethanol as an oxygenate in reformulated fuel. Numerous studies in the States have reported massive increases in air quality as well as major health benefits to their citizens.
The introduction of ethanol into the American fuel supply has had no impact at all on the price of fuel. Ethanol is blended into 30 per cent of America's gasoline. Ethanol blended fuels, either E10 or E85, are priced on a par with all other fuel options. Replacing MTBE with ethanol in California reduced the average price for reformulated gasoline in 2003 by 8c a gallon. Brazil is currently the largest ethanol producer in the world and regulates the use of ethanol in all transport fuels. In Brazil the petrol ethanol blend ranges from 22 per cent to 26 per cent. Brazil produces ethanol from dedicated sugarcane crops and produces between 12 and 15 billion litres of ethanol per year, depending on the sugar season. Canada is aiming for a 10 per cent ethanol blend in 35 per cent of all petrol sold by 2010. India has mandated a five per cent ethanol blend in a number of its states. Japan has announced its intention starting with the mandatory introduction of a blend of 3.5 per cent ethanol in petrol. Europe is setting an alternative fuel target. Thailand is constructing ethanol plants. China is the third largest producer of ethanol, with a production of around three billion litres a year. 
Currently in Australia we have two major producers of ethanol: the Manildra group, which produces ethanol from wheat starch, and CSR Sugar, which produces the product from C-grade molasses in Mackay. Of the 135 million litres produced in Australia, 75 million litres are used in industry and 60 million litres are used for fuel. Already the volume of ethanol being produced by Manildra displaces the need to import over one million barrels of crude oil. In Australia, a mandated 10 per cent of ethanol blended petrol would have a massive impact on our economy.
A recent report found that 10 per cent volume ethanol petrol, or E10 blend, offered significant benefits in terms of reducing exhaust and greenhouse gas emissions, with no apparent detrimental effect on other aspects of engine or vehicle performance. Based on the 1999 Australian passenger fleet figures, the report's results show that using E10 decreases the carbon monoxide exhaust emissions by around 32 per cent, decreases the total hydrocarbon—THC—exhaust emissions by 12 per cent and decreases the net carbon dioxide emissions by up to seven per cent on a fuel carbon cycle basis. There was also a massive decline in cancer causing elements such as benzine by 27 per cent and toluene by 30 per cent. Other increases and decreases of less than two or three per cent have been noted in the myriad of chemicals that make up the exhaust emissions that we currently breathe in every day. Surely the health benefits of E10 can best be summarised by an astonishing 24 per cent decrease in the carcinogenic risk when E10 is used instead of our current fuel source.
Other results of the Commonwealth funded E10 trials on the 60 vehicles from the Australian car fleet in 1997-98 are worth noting: fuel consumption rises by two per cent on both a city and highway cycle and there is a reduced tendency for engine knock under hot and cold conditions, no discernible impact on any plastic or elastomer materials, no discernible corrosion of fuel wetted parts and no additional or unusual engine wear. E10 requires no modification to vehicles in service now and in the foreseeable future and, with minor adjustments, is totally compatible with the existing fuel distribution infrastructure.
More recent scientific evidence confirms that, if ethanol were to be used in the refining process of petrol, as little as 2.5 per cent of ethanol can completely strip the benzine content in petrol to one per cent as required by the Commonwealth fuel quality standards in 2006. This process would enable fuel refiners to meet the clean fuels standards for 2006, without significant capital expenditure or structural change. Any use of ethanol in this capacity would be considered as part of the composition of the petrol and not be considered in any E10 calculations.
Australia uses 19 billion litres of petrol and 14 billion litres of diesel annually. If this fuel were to be replaced by a 10 per cent alternative fuel blend, Australia would be looking at a potential market of over three billion litres of biofuels per year. If each ethanol plant produced an average of 100 million litres of ethanol per year, that would require 30 new bio-refineries operating in rural Australia. The current government support program is aimed at a modest 350 million litres of biofuels—ethanol and biodiesel—production by 2010. Realistically, this 350 million target will be met over the next three to five years. The ethanol will be produced from a variety of agricultural sources. 
We already have the operating technology to produce ethanol from grain and sugar. Distilleries are currently operating in Mackay, near Nowra in New South Wales, Bundaberg and Rocky Point. In the Commonwealth capital grants scheme, applications have been received for assistance from ethanol distillers at a broad range of locations, including Millmerran, Mackay, Bundaberg, Dalby, Gunnedah, Quirindi, Swan Hill and Coleambally. Some of these are for ethanol from grains; some are for ethanol from cane.
There is no doubt that ethanol is a viable by-product from the processing of cane. The key to its long-term viability is capital support for infrastructure, technological improvements aimed at maximising the number of by-products from the process, the efficient use of cogeneration of energy from the mill to the distillery and the development of a retail market which is confident in the use of ethanol. A tonne of C-grade molasses yields between 170 and 290 litres of ethanol, depending on the sugar content. In 1999, 1.2 million tonnes of molasses was produced in Australia, of which 0.6 million tonnes was used domestically and the remainder exported as stockfeed or used in ethanol production. If exported molasses was also converted to ethanol, it would yield an additional 166 to 174 million litres of ethanol, less than the 360 million litres required to supply ethanol for an E10 blend in Queensland alone. Ethanol from grain production in Queensland could nevertheless supply another 150 million litres.
A cane grower will benefit from an ethanol distillery operated conjointly with the mill to which he supplies. If it is a cooperative mill, any increase in the value of the molasses via the production of ethanol will be returned to growers as the profitability of the mill increases. In the USA, 40 per cent of operating ethanol plants are farmer owned and are delivering substantial value added returns to farmer-owners. Methods of payments to suppliers of cane to non-cooperative mills will need to be negotiated to ensure that the suppliers of the cane see direct benefits on the increased value of their molasses via ethanol production and sale. As a product, ethanol is three times more valuable than molasses. While creating ethanol in rural and regional areas will boost returns to cane growers, its real benefits are in the regional impact of a vital new industry and the added employment and income growth that the construction and operation of the industry will provide.
On average, a 50 million litres per year distillery employs about 36 people directly. Using the CSR distillery at Sarina as a real indicator of the indirect jobs specifically generated by the plant, a multiplier of 5.5 indirect to direct jobs is valid. This means that more than 200 local jobs are created as a direct result of the Sarina plant. This would be a significant boost to any area, especially when you take into account the increase in economic activity that the jobs stimulate, the skilled and unskilled jobs created, the increase in taxes to local, state and Commonwealth treasuries, and decrease in welfare expenditure as a result of job creation.
The beauty of ethanol production is that it is at its most viable when produced locally in regional areas. The product is then transported to local fuel depots where it is blended with 90 per cent petrol to create an E10 blend. This distribution method works successfully in the United States and already operates in Australia where trials of E10 fuel have been completed. Ethanol is a `drop-in' fuel. It does not need to be added in at the refinery. It blends successfully at the depot, minimising transportation costs for ethanol producers while maintaining the distribution methods already utilised by fuel consumption tax. The use of ethanol as a drop-in fuel keeps the focus on the regional area where it is produced and ensures that the economic benefits stay in that region. Motorists are using locally produced ethanol. They can see the advantages in the economy, breathe the advantages in decreased toxic emissions and feel the advantages in the performance of their vehicles. 
In the United States, economic analysis has determined that the real income and expenditure benefit of ethanol plants are contained within a 200 kilometre radius of the plant—in the order of 80 per cent of the income derived from the mill will be spent in the region. The impact on the economy of the industry operating at the government's 2010 target of 350 million litres, which is less than the capacity required to supply 10 per cent ethanol to all fuel sold in Queensland, will be five new ethanol and biodiesel plants; 1,000 new permanent jobs in rural areas; 2,300 new construction jobs during the five-year development period; $49.4 million in direct public benefit in the form of personal and company tax; reduction in unemployment benefits; and $9.4 million additional tax payable from indirect employment. This could all be possible as a result of the production of Queensland's ethanol requirements alone. The production of 350 million litres of E10 can directly result in a $14 million per year saving in expenditure on greenhouse abatement measures; $59 million per annum in savings through reduced air pollution costs; savings of more than $1 billion in health related costs, due to the higher oxygenated fuel improving the combustion process and reducing the cancer causing particles and emission of carginogenics such as benzene. E10 will contribute to a major decrease in illness—cancer and asthma—related to pollution from transport. 
Ethanol will impact on all our lives by increasing national security and fuel self-sufficiency, by developing vital new industries in regional communities and improving the quality of life for our children and grandchildren through the very air they breathe. That is why the government has chosen to support the development of an ethanol industry. As a result of this government's cleaner fuels legislation and fuel quality standards, oil producers will be required to increase the oxygenate levels of their transport fuel from 91 to 95 for standard grade unleaded fuel from 2006. This will need to be achieved without the current oxygenate MTBE being used. 
Oil producers will be able to achieve this clean fuel measure both by using ethanol in the refining process and by producing an E10 blend of fuel at the retail level. Without the support of the government for a home grown ethanol industry, the ethanol required to fulfil this standard will need to be imported, once again lessening Australia's fuel self-sufficiency. The coalition government is providing $37 million to fund capital subsidies for projects that provide new or expanded biofuels capacity.
 (Senator McLucas)—Senator Boswell, your time has expired.
—I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The federal government will also work with the industry to develop a campaign to restore consumer confidence in ethanol after it was so badly damaged by a campaign orchestrated by the Labor party, with the support of the oil industry. 
Unfortunately the current label developed to restore public confidence is having the opposite effect, and should be amended as soon as possible.
The development of an ethanol industry is a positive step for this country.
Through this government's support for the ethanol industry, via the measures I have described here today, an industry will develop.
Whether that industry is based solely on grain or whether this new opportunity is embraced by the sugar industry is yet to be seen.
I believe there is a massive benefit for sugar communities to support this industry. The returns to growers are not as good as sugar, but as an `add on' industry, and one that is a constant, providing new employment and economic growth, and prosperity to the region it is all good news.
I call on the industry to grab this opportunity. The government will do everything possible to assist the industry's development.
As I said earlier, ethanol production is not the magic wand, returning massive income to growers and make fields of cane return a positive cash flow. It is however part of a solution. It is an integral part of a regional approach to the reinvigoration of rural and regional communities.
On the face of it sugar today is valued at approximately $200/tonne and molasses at $55/tonne. Ethanol is valued at approximately 3 times molasses or about 55c/l.
I am convinced that, through proper management of the distilling process, the efficient use of co-generated power and the efficient management of the by products, like bio-fertilizers that become an integral part of the manufacturing process, ethanol production from cane is the next step in the future viability of Australia's sugar industry.
It is a perfect example of value adding at a regional level.
Ethanol will enable the sugar industry to broaden its revenue base and ensure continued financial viability.
Ethanol is the fuel of the future.
The technology and know-how is available, the benefits are proven and the method of production and distribution is already in existence.
There is no time left to debate whether Australia should be developing an ethanol industry. We are. It is happening and this government is right behind it.
My recommendation to all in rural and regional Australia is act now to be a part of the future.
Embrace ethanol production and ensure regional Australians lead the way to providing cleaner air, healthier people, more efficient vehicles and revitalised rural communities.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2004-03-10,"—I would like to congratulate Senator Boswell on his comprehensive overview of the debate on the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 and Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 and the importance of ethanol and why the government believes its advancement is in Australia's best interests. The ethanol industry is in Australia's best interests, and I honestly cannot understand the political opportunism of some of our opponents on this issue. The federal coalition government, in particular The Nationals, are 100 per cent behind developing the industry in rural and regional Australia. A comprehensive strategy has been initiated in cooperation with the biofuels industry to support both the production and the use of ethanol Australia wide. An expanded ethanol industry has the potential to create employment, growth and increased productivity in regional areas, greatly improving the economic climate of the agricultural sector in regional communities that depend on the prosperity of agriculture generally.
The Nationals have fought hard on developing measures to promote investment in the industry, the use of ethanol and the continued production of all biofuels. The increased production of ethanol will provide an alternative market for grains, such as wheat, barley and sugar. Additional ethanol plants will create real employment in many regional areas, which are crying out for development opportunities such as this. The increased production and use of ethanol will also be a huge benefit to the environment, creating a renewable, clean, green fuel alternative. There is no downside, as far as I can see, to this industry—it is a win-win situation. It is unbelievable that there is so much vexatious argument about it, particularly put by our political opponents. The government should be supported in any and every effort to create cleaner and greener fuels; therefore, it should be supported in its push to expand this industry. It will be good not only for the environment but for the development and growth of our regions and agricultural industries generally. 
In these troubled times of global relations, it is also vital that Australia be able to produce its own biofuels. The natural development of a biofuel industry in Australia is in line with what has happened in the United States and Canada. The oil companies in North America worked overtime to discourage the development of this industry. Some of our oil companies are doing the same here. The simple facts are that oxygenation of fuels in this country will demand local ethanol in the not too distant future; otherwise, if we do not have our own, we will clearly have to source our ethanol from overseas—and that certainly is not in Australia's interests for all sorts of reasons.
Perhaps the only solution is to mandate ethanol use, as has happened in the United States, and we should look at it very carefully. In July 2003 the government announced its decision to allocate $37 million to fund one-off capital subsidies for projects that provide new or expanded biofuels capacity. The government has received 38 applications to make use of this funding for new biofuel industries or ventures. Seventy of these are for ethanol projects and a number of them are in regional areas. Senator Boswell in his comprehensive analysis of the industry identified where they were—very much through the north-west of New South Wales and also in the sugar areas of North Queensland. In response to the government's announcement of capital funding in July last year, the Leader of the Opposition said that the extra $50 million of expenditure could be better used elsewhere.
The subsidy will provide 16c per litre to new and expanded projects, producing a minimum of five million litres of biofuels with a maximum grant of $10 million per project. There are also existing production subsidies in place, providing the equivalent of 38c per litre, which will be available at this stage until 2008. After that, they will be reduced in five annual phases. A 10 per cent limit of ethanol content in petrol has now been set down, with a number of service stations in Queensland trialling and selling the E10 fuel. The government also announced in July 2003 its decision to provide short-term assistance to all existing fuel ethanol producers to assist in the transition of E10 standard to allow the current production subsidy to be paid in advance of the payment of excise. Legislation is also now in place for the compulsory labelling of ethanol blended fuels at the pump. The government has decided it presents a balanced approach to the use of ethanol.
In connection with the labelling, the government took advice—as required under the trade practices legislation—and also from the ACCC. That was the umpire making a recommendation to government and whether or not we like it that was the advice we received. After asking an independent umpire to make a decision about labelling, that is what came into effect. The Nationals, as part of the coalition, are committed to doing what they can to get behind promoting the ethanol industry either by way of assistance to producers or by attempting to increase con-sumer confidence in ethanol use. The bill before us today provides for the payment of a cleaner fuels grant to manufacturers of ethanol. Concessions such as this, and any others that we can provide to producers of ethanol, should be supported and will be supported. Assistance like this will encourage investors to support the industry, which will hopefully result in the establishment of further production plants. 
I mention some of the ethanol benefits. The use of ethanol blended fuels can have essential benefits to the environment. Currently, when transport is increasingly being used, any effort to try to decrease pollution emissions should be promoted. Using ethanol in fuels can reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and other ozone pollutants. It contributes little, if any, carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, greatly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Ethanol is low in reactivity and high in oxygen content and that is why, as we undertake our commitments to cleaner and greener fuels in the future, we will require the use of ethanol or other biofuels. The oil industry, which is committed to cleaner and greener fuels as well, will require the use of ethanol and other biofuels to reach the oxygenation levels required under a whole range of international commitments and commitments they have made to the government. Ethanol blends are clean and green. They are an alternative to petrol and, as I have said, they have been used in the United States since the 1970s.
I would like to say something about our political opponents in connection to ethanol. As I said in my opening comments, I honestly believe that the ethanol industry should be receiving bipartisan support because it is really good news, not only for regional and rural Australia but for the economy, the environment and Australia generally. But our political opponents have shown a complete lack of interest in regional Australia in connection to ethanol and generally in the production of alternative fuels—which surprises me a great deal. Labor has repeatedly condemned the coalition's support of the ethanol industry in a most opportunistic way and is yet to provide any positive response on what it will offer the industry if ever it was lucky enough to be elected to office.
The opposition has resorted to cheap politics by promoting a scare campaign about ethanol. And for what purpose? I do not think there are many votes for them in promoting an anti-ethanol view of fuel production. In recent meetings with several proponents of a proposed ethanol plant Labor has said it would consider—only consider—some of the government's amendments to assist the industry, but they are yet to say what they will do for ethanol when it comes to their policy development. The Nationals in Canberra will continue to support expanding the ethanol industry, which will bring tremendous benefits to Australia. I congratulate John Anderson and his fellow Nationals, and of course a number of other country members in the parliament. They have fought very hard to obtain the measures.
—I acknowledge Senator Boswell's interjection. A number of Liberal members who come from regional areas have worked very hard. There are some Labor members too who privately admit the importance of the industry. This should not be about pure political opportunism. The ethanol industry has a great future. The biofuel industry is very important. I cannot make clearer the opportunity that lies ahead of us if we promote this industry. There are a number of people—particularly Liberals but also some Labor people—who have worked agreeably to put these measures in place. We need this industry for Australia's sake. We are going to work very hard to get it and I hope that we can. ",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1

To interrupt another bill in this place which, of itself, you can argue has far greater urgency is not to be accepted. The Greens will not accept this interruption to the Senate's business for a political purpose of the government, which is what we are dealing with here.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-03-10,"—I do not agree to the resumption of the debate being made an order of the day for a later hour. The resumption should be right now; it should be forthwith. We were dealing with a fuel tax bill, the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003, which is more urgent than the bill that is now to be given precedence. The Greens want justification from the government for interrupting the Senate to ram a bill through parliament in one day to rob East Timor of its oil and gas resources. What is occurring here is unethical, wrong and involves an act of piracy on behalf of the oil companies by the Howard government. We are not going to allow that to happen as easily as the government or even the opposition might want. How dare the government suddenly, out of the blue, decide it is going to ram a bill through this parliament in one day to rob the East Timorese people of their Greater Sunrise oil and gas fields and remove all the normal forms of debate, remove the ability to go out and talk with the—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I understand that the honourable senator needs to be relevant to the motion, which is that resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour of the day. He is now trying to talk about multinational oil companies and other matters. Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention to the fact that the senator is sailing very close to the wind, reflecting on an overwhelming vote of the Senate, which was to have the matter adjourned. The question now is that the debate be an order of the day for a later hour of the day. Senator Brown seems to want the debate to be resumed immediately, which would be to negate the motion that we have just carried—that is, to adjourn.
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—Senator Brown, you do have to be relevant to the motion. I am listening carefully. Also bear in mind that you have four minutes before the debate is terminated.
—The relevance to the motion is that we must take into account the motivation, as stated by the government, for the motion. The motivation of the government is to bring on the Greater Sunrise bill to get it through this place today. We are not having this change in the order of business of the Senate simply because this is a minor matter. It is a major matter—and the whole of the Senate knows that. All of us who have been watching the debate in the House of Representatives this morning—where the four members outside the major parties ended up forcing a division to try to bring some order to the way this Greater Sunrise bill was being foisted on the parliament—will be ashamed of the process that occurred there. It is wrong. Why should we move away from the fuel bill to make way for the government's new priority? Where is the explanation from the government? The Senate deserves a clear explanation from the government, but we have had none. The government simply comes in and says that it has an urgent bill it wants to bring on later in the day. It should explain the urgency. It is not up to me to give that explanation to the Senate; it is up to the government.
A very unusual process is occurring here today—I do not remember when it last occurred. The Senate is suddenly ambushed by the government with a bill that was not available to any senator this time yesterday or last night. The government says, `Everything in the Senate is going to be skittled today in order for us to get this bill through.' The government has to explain to the Senate why we should vote for that. The Greens, for a start, are not going to agree to it unless the government gives that explanation.",SENATE,<title>ENERGY GRANTS (CLEANER FUELS) SCHEME BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-03-10,"—There is some concern about the process. It is unusual. In my view, it would have been preferable for the government, after question time and in the ordinary routine of business of the Senate, to have come forward with a proposal about the priority government business for the remainder of today's sitting. That would have been a sensible way of doing it. Why we would have such a motion at this time, given that there is now only about one minute and seven seconds for us to debate this bill before matters of public interest, I am not entirely sure. However, when faced with deciding whether or not to introduce a bill, I do not think the opposition had any alternative but to vote for that substantive motion.
There is now an opportunity for discussion to occur around the chamber about the procedures in place for this legislation. I commend that course of action to the government. That would be sensible. I suggest to the government that there was a lack of communication with those who, so effectively, are responsible for chamber management on the opposition side. Not having any foreknowledge that this was going to occur, they found themselves in a similar situation to the situation Senator Brown outlines. However, having had that vote, which has only had the impact of losing a little of the time for debate on another bill, there is an opportunity for consultation around the chamber. That is what ought to happen and it ought to happen forthwith.

"Senator JOHNSTON,",LP,2004-03-10,"—In February this year Perth experienced a bout of above average hot weather. This is not something new. Every year Perth has a number of days in succession when the mercury exceeds the old century mark. It follows that most suburban homes are increasingly either fully airconditioned or partially airconditioned. Indeed, our state electricity corporation in Western Australia, Western Power, has been running an advertising campaign to get people to use reverse cycle airconditioners.
It was hot in Perth between Monday, 9 February and Wednesday, 18 February this year. Monday, 9 February is the day all Perth residents will remember as the day the chaos began. One constituent came to my office to report that the power pole outside his house had just exploded, with power lines having been brought down and lying over the busy road in front of his house. The explosion of the power pole was so loud, he recounted to me, that he thought a bombing had occurred in the street in front of his home. The Western Power repair crew took over an hour to respond to this emergency and three hours to restore power because, as it turned out, this was not an isolated occurrence. Power poles were exploding all over the Perth metropolitan area and repair crews were stretched to their physical limits. The constituent who reported his problem first-hand to me was one of the lucky ones because his power was restored after three hours. Some parts of Perth were without power for more than a day. 
A situation in which large parts of the Perth metropolitan area are without any power for up to 24 hours is completely unacceptable. Western Power, a corporatised state government body, have a monopoly in supplying power to all Western Australians, and in this case they clearly failed in service delivery. They simply had not performed the maintenance tasks of washing the transformers and insulators that are on top of power poles. A combination of misty rain and hot temperatures created the entirely predictable recipe for disaster. The ensuing chaos that eventuated across the Perth metropolitan area was almost exclusively due to this lack of maintenance. Western Power have admitted that they have not had the resources to perform this and other essential maintenance since Labor came to office three years ago. They say that they no longer carry out this regular maintenance and that what little maintenance is carried out on washing the transformers is performed by private contractors. As one fieldworker said in the Sunday Times on 22 February this year:
The management ethos is if something is working, why fix it. They are waiting for things to go wrong rather than fixing things before they go wrong.
For example, we used to do insulator washing towards the end of summer...
The washing of the insulators is pretty basic preventive maintenance that just does not get done any more by Western Power. This period of four to five days from 9 February this year was simply chaotic, with large parts of metropolitan Perth blacked out at various times because of the detonation of numerous power pole transformers. It was only because of the heroic and sustained efforts of the Western Power repair crews that some semblance of order was achieved. This is a sad and sorry tale that has been brought about through the resource stripping of Western Power by the state Labor government in Western Australia.
Now you might reasonably expect that, in this day and age, things could not possibly have become any worse. Unfortunately for every person living in Perth—that is over a million people—they did: the city's population was treated to two days of unprecedented and absolute mayhem on Tuesday, 17 February and Wednesday, 18 February when the state's electricity system went into meltdown and failed. Admittedly, these two days were hot, but, as I have said, this is not uncommon for Perth. Equally predictable was the response of the many households in the metropolitan area when, in the heat, they turned on their airconditioners.
The result was that the Western Power system could not cope with the demand and went into shutdown mode. Whole sections of the Perth metropolitan area were blacked out for hours at a time without any warning whatsoever, and families and businesses were thrown into complete chaos. Some suburbs experienced blackouts for more than a day. So for the second time in two weeks we had chaotic scenes all over Perth and the metropolitan area, with traffic lights out, ATM machines not operational, shopping centres plunged into darkness and production lines in factories grinding to a halt. It was the essence of Third World stuff and was, quite frankly, a disgrace.
Early on Tuesday, 17 February the spokesperson for Western Power was asked on Perth radio whether they had sufficient generating capacity to cope with the expected demand associated with a hot day. He responded by saying that there was no problem, that there was no cause for alarm and that people should go about their daily business without any concerns about the power generation capacity of Western Power. All of us in Western Australia now know that nothing could have been further from the truth: the power generation system failed completely, and it is evident that both Western Power and the state Labor government knew or should have known that it would. Later that afternoon, on Tuesday, 17 February, Minister Ripper, the minister in charge of energy in Western Australia, received a visit from the chief of Western Power, Dr Stephen van der Mye. Dr van der Mye broke the disastrous news that indeed Western Power had run into serious transmission problems and that the following day, Wednesday, 18 February, they would be forced to implement unprecedented electricity bans on consumers, not just in rotation but everywhere, right across the board, in the Perth metropolitan area. 
What followed was a monumental communications nightmare as consumers battled to understand what the bans meant, to whom they applied and to what extent they applied. Despite Minister Ripper being informed at 4.15 in the afternoon about the impending bans, nobody in Western Power, in the minister's office or in the Premier's office thought to relay this information to the public via that evening's television news broadcasts. The impending bans were not communicated to the public until advertisements appeared in the newspapers the following day, warning consumers that they faced fines for using electricity—$10,000 for businesses and $1,000 for individual residents.
What caused unprecedented confusion was that no-one was really sure what was entailed in the bans. Talkback radio switch-boards lit up in Perth, with mass confusion being the order of the day because people simply did not understand what was implied by the restrictions being imposed upon by them by Western Power. It got to the stage where little old ladies were ringing talkback radio to ask if they could switch on their fans, because they did not want to risk a $1,000 fine. Schools shut down their airconditioning systems because they thought the bans did apply to them, when in fact they did not. A school principal came into my office and told me that he went to the Western Power home page to check the conditions for the bans; however, he found no useful information so he carried on regardless and kept the airconditioning on, figuring that it was better to incur the wrath of the authorities rather than risk the health of children and, indeed, the teachers in the heat. Hospitals were unsure of where they stood; could they use full power supplies to generate essential power for equipment or not? Most were not too sure, so hospital administrators cancelled numerous operations and sent patients either back to their wards or home. On 20 February, a journalist with the West Australian, Steve Pennells, summed it up well when, talking about the advice from Western Power, he said:
The advice over the course of the day was arrogant, arbitrary, unresponsive, muddled and contradictory. Clearly Western Power was flying by the seat of its pants.
The week beginning 9 February was a disaster with pole fires. However, Tuesday, 18 and Wednesday, 19 February were catastrophic for both Western Power and the Gallop government in Western Australia. Wednesday, 19 February will be forever remembered in Western Australia as `Black Wednesday'—the day the state was brought to its knees by the hopelessly incompetent Gallop government.
It was decided that, in the face of this outrage, action had to be taken and something had to be seen to be done—anything had to be seen to be done. The Premier marched down to Western Power, with TV crews in tow, and summoned the board together. There he gave the Labor appointed chairman of the board—and I might add a person who is very highly respected on both sides of politics—Mr Malcolm Macpherson, his marching orders. A short while later they forced the resignation of the CEO, Dr Stephen Van der Mye. 
Dr Van der Mye was Mr Ripper's hand-picked operative to oversee the break up of Western Power into four operating entities. He was considered by Minister Ripper only a few short months prior to this as being such a vital cog in the Western Power machine that he could name his own price and conditions of employment, making him easily the most highly paid public servant in the state Labor government. He was on a salary of just under $500,000 per year; he could commute on a weekly basis from his home in Melbourne and enjoy the advantages of other perks that fellow public servants could only dream of.
In an entirely face-saving political exercise this wise man from the east was sent packing by Dr Gallop and Minister Ripper. What is astounding is that Dr Van der Mye was never employed to be operational head of Western Power; he was essentially employed to use his financial skills to bring about the de-segregation of Western Power. Dr Van der Mye said just before he was sacked:
The facts are that Western Power had every single piece of plant working. At the end of the day, we simply ran out of fuel and that's because the Dampier-Bunbury pipeline did not have enough capacity.
Dr Van der Mye was the Labor Party's scape-goat for this unmitigated disaster that gripped Western Australia for two weeks in February this year.
What I find truly amazing is that both Dr Gallop and Minister Ripper cannot see that they are culpable for these two weeks of chaos. Their steadfast view is that everyone else is to blame, but certainly not them. The plain and frightfully simple truth behind all this is that the Gallop government could have headed off this period of chaos by applying a few simple rules of planning for the future. It was as simple as booking enough gas to meet the expected peak summer demand. Western Australia is fortunate enough to be one of the world's greatest producers of gas. It just beggars belief that arrangements were not in place to tap into what we have in abundance—namely, gas supplies.
One company, CMS Energy, has come forward and told the government that, with a bit of planning and foresight, it could have supplied the metropolitan area with as much gas as was needed to cope with not just a couple of days over 40 degrees but a month-long spell of such days. Even if the Labor government found this too hard it had plenty of other options; it could have extended itself to purchase readily available gas supplies at slightly higher rates than normal.
Dr Gallop and Minister Ripper could have and should have signed a new long-term agreement with the owner of the Dampier-Bunbury gas line that provides the bulk of power for the Western Power generators. They had three years to do this and failed to do so. Epic Energy, the owner of the gas pipeline, was caught between a rock and a hard place with this dilatory state government. It has not been able to negotiate a realistic price for its gas with the government appointed gas regulator, which has also meant that it had no capacity to plan for the future or for further expansion of the pipeline.
When the pipeline was purchased in 1997 for $2.42 billion the purchaser had a reasonable expectation that it would be able to increase tariff and, by doing this, invest in future expansion of the pipeline. The three main purchasers of gas from Epic—namely, Alcoa, Alinta and Western Power—all supported such an increase, so it is difficult to understand the state Labor government's intransigence on this fundamental commercial issue. Epic Energy CEO, Mr David Williams, said in the Sunday Times on 22 February: 
This week's power shortage might never have happened if the Government, in the past three years had encouraged Western Power to sign up new contracts beyond 2010. This would have given the company the financial security it needed to expand the pipeline's capacity.
The government has failed to provide a stable investment environment such as would have allowed Epic to make a long-term investment in the pipeline's capacity. When first elected, Premier Gallop professed that the mark of a good, modern government was to get in and sort out the issues. This state Labor government, in contrast to its words, has shown no leadership on this issue whatsoever.
What has outraged and perplexed all Western Australians is the announcement on 25 February, just seven days after `Black Wednesday', that Western Power had negotiated an agreement with Wesfarmers and Alinta to provide sufficient standby gas to generate an additional 200 megawatts of power for several days at a time. So now we know the truth—namely, that with just a bit of planning and foresight this agreement could have been signed as soon as Western Power became aware that they had a generational stock problem. This is a smoking gun disclosing of an amazing level of mismanagement and ineptitude by this dozy state Labor government.
In short, it is quite simply outrageous. In continuing desperation to unearth a scapegoat, Dr Gallop has commissioned an inquiry into just why, how and who is to blame for this chaotic period of events. Every Western Australian knows who is to blame: it is him. All notions of accountable government have evaporated in Western Australia since Labor took over. But do not take my word for it; take the word of the federal member for the safe Labor seat of Perth, Mr Stephen Smith. The ALP shadow minister said in last weekend's press:
There is not an appreciation at the highest levels that the Government—
he is talking of the state government of Western Australia—
is in some considerable political difficulty. 
In other words, the Premier and his deputy have lost the plot. With an election due in early February next year, you can bet that the Gallop Labor government will be wishing and hoping for cool weather given that Western Australians will forever relate hot days to a chronic level of ineptitude in public administration, the likes of which have probably never been seen in Australia before.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Western Australia: Electricity</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-03-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads (Senator Ian Campbell) to questions without notice asked by Senators Forshaw and Denman today relating to funding for residential aged care.
The review of aged care conducted by Professor Warren Hogan was established via an announcement on 16 September 2002. On that day, the then Minister for Ageing, Kevin Andrews, announced that Professor Hogan would head up an aged care review costing $7.2 million which would look into the pricing of residential aged care. In all the various announcements made by the minister subsequent to that first one, he stated that the review would be completed in time for the recommendations to be presented to the minister by the end of 2003. The minister made that statement in media releases on no fewer than three occasions, and it was also noted in the annual report of the department for the year ending 30 June 2003.
Interestingly, on 23 December last year in an article in the Australian there was quite a detailed summary of Professor Hogan's recommendations. I do not have time to read them all, but the article referred to recommendations such as the introduction of accommodation bonds for high-care facilities and the adjustment of the indexation formula, which, it was acknowledged, is totally insufficient. As I said when I asked the question during question time, the Prime Minister on 4 February stated in an interview on ABC radio that the government had the report, was considering it and would be responding soon thereafter. Yet only seven days later, the Minister for Ageing, Ms Bishop, stated that the review was in its final stages. She said:
The final report is still being completed and will be submitted to the Government shortly.
Obviously there was some contradiction between what was said by the Prime Minister, who said that the government had the report—and had received it within the time frame that had been set—and what was said by the minister, who said that they did not have it at all. Yet the newspapers printed in great detail Professor Hogan's recommendations. Remember, this report followed a very extensive review that cost $7.2 million. I asked questions about this on 18 February in the estimates committee hearings, and there was a very interesting exchange. When I drew attention to the contradiction between what the Prime Minister and what the minister had said, an officer of the department, Mr Mersiades, gave this explanation: 
It was a draft outline of his thinking; it was a draft interim report—
referring to what Professor Hogan had provided to the government. I followed this up with further questions. With regard to the report, I asked:
What form is it in?
Ms Jane Halton, the Secretary of the department, said that it was typed. I asked:
Is it a one-page or a couple-of-pages summary?
Mr Mersiades answered that it was a draft outline of his thinking.
The transcript of the estimates committee hearing continues:
Senator FORSHAW—A draft outline of his thinking?
Mr Mersiades—That is how the minister described it. 
Senator FORSHAW—Is it a report or is it not a report?
Ms Halton—It is not yet a report.
It went on in this vein. The government committed $7.2 million to the preparation of this report. Professor Hogan undertook a detailed review. Clearly, recommendations from Professor Hogan were being provided to the government by the end of December. That was reported widely in the newspapers. This government is grappling with how they will respond to some of those recommendations, such as accommodation bonds. We have since had an attempt to rewrite the record—indications that there was never a report at all. The parliament, the people of Australia and the aged care industry are entitled to know just what is in Professor Hogan's report, when it was presented to the government and what this government's response will be.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-03-10,"—To listen to the Labor Party, one would think they had a squeaky clean record on the issue of aged care. Nothing could be further from the truth. I remind senators on the other side of the chamber about the Gregory report. The Gregory report was a report on the funding of aged care and the relevant standards, care outcomes and so forth of aged care facilities by the Labor government. It was the most shocking report one could ever imagine. The Gregory report demonstrated that not only had Labor left this country 10,000 aged care beds short and cut funding, but that many of the institutions failed basic fire safety, general safety and quality of care standards. That is the legacy of the Labor Party. Yet here they are, pontificating about aged care. They should be ashamed of themselves.
Not only that, but they did not go one step further. At the 2001 election the Labor Party gave a commitment to a proposed national benchmark of care. What hysterical nonsense! After 13 years of Labor's neglect of aged care, this government came up with the accreditation system. The Labor Party could have done it in 13 years, but they did not. They did not introduce legislated standards. They should be ashamed of themselves for not doing so, particularly having regard to the outcomes of the Gregory report. More importantly, the $54 million that Labor promised at the 2001 election would not have been available until 2004-05.
—This year.
—That is exactly right, Senator Hutchins—what a clever boy we are! It is a shame that Senator Hutchins did not point that out to the Labor Party in 2000, when they put their policy together. In 2000 they came up with the harebrained idea to do what has already been done by the government—but in another four years. What a joke! 
—What are you doing?
—You can't recover now, Senator Hutchins.
—As Senator Ferris says, Senator Hutchins cannot recover now. He has kicked an own goal. We have someone who does not know and understand the system saying that the Labor Party made a commitment four years in advance to do something that has already been done by this government, and that does not ring an alarm bell? Then they come in and criticise. They come in and say that it is not good enough. Why doesn't this Labor opposition say what they would do if they were ever re-elected to government? Their record in aged care is appalling, according to Professor Gregory. It is not according to Sue Knowles or anyone else, but according to Professor Gregory that the Labor Party's record is abysmal.
It has taken this government to turn it around. It has taken this government to implement the accreditation system. It has taken this government to set the standards. It has taken this government to ensure that the fire safety regulations and all the standard of care outcomes are observed. None of that was done in 13 years of Labor, yet they are complaining. I would not be worried about reports if I were in the Labor opposition—I would be worried about Labor's record. I would be desperately worried about their record and what they would do in the future if ever they were given the responsibility of the government benches again. Their record of responsibility when in government is nothing short of appalling. They let down the aged care community and they let down the aged of the future.

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2004-03-10,"—I support the motion to take note of the answers given to the questions on the crisis and challenges facing aged care. I acknowledge that the minister has recognised some of the needs in my home state of Tasmania but I want to go further with those because there are enormous needs there. One of the matters we need to address—and no-one so far has made mention of this—is that people with disabilities such as down syndrome, et cetera are living to be much older. No places have been set aside for those people in nursing homes. They do not slot into the normal nursing home environment. We need to take extra care to address their needs because we are living to be older, fortunately.
Perhaps a downside of living longer and healthier lives is that it has created a problem for nursing homes. People who are now going into nursing homes are more frail and the facilities they need are greater—hence the increased demand for high-care nursing homes. I want to read from a couple of articles in my local press. I have here a statement made by Pam Pattison, the Chief Executive and Director of Nursing, Karingal Home for the Aged, who said:
Aged care financial surveys have provided the hard facts, backing what the sector has been saying and experiencing. Over the past few years we have continued to experience a declining result. But there is no immediate crisis for Karingal—
Karingal is one of the more wealthy nursing homes—
However, if we don't address the issue then obviously there is going to be ...
I have another quote, from the Presbyterian aged care homes executive officer in Tasmania. He lists the facts of the crisis, and one of the facts on the list is: 
Community and residential care services are inadequate to meet the needs of older members of our society.
I think I have addressed that by noting that people in our society are living longer and, therefore, their needs will be greater because, when they do go into a nursing home, they are more frail. He continued:
Recurrent funding of nursing homes is inadequate to meet operational costs.
The minister may also have touched on that in his answer. The quote continues:
The government's capital grants program is inadequate to redevelop existing nursing homes to meet Commonwealth government standards. Aged care nurses and care staff receive inadequate wages for the quality and nature of their work.
That is something else we need to look at. I am also concerned about the shortage of aged care nursing places. In Ulverstone, on the north-west coast of Tasmania where I live and where I have my electorate office, the Salvation Army has just closed one of its nursing homes, and that has caused an enormous crisis. We cannot afford to allow operators who are doing a great job and who are providing a wonderful service to older Australians and to their families to go the wall. We have to do something about it. We simply cannot allow that to happen because of funding shortages. Again, the needs of elderly people will not be met if we allow this to happen.
The evidence of a crisis is mounting. It is obvious when nursing homes begin to close. We must prevent any further manifestation. We must never allow a situation to occur where older Australians are told that they must leave their nursing homes because they can no longer afford to allow them to stay there. When that happens, the crisis is with the family. Often the person in the nursing home does not have family close by, so they have to be moved. That is one of the other issues in Tasmania, and I guess elsewhere: you cannot always get into a nursing home in the area where you have spent most of your life. So you are moved out of that area; you do not have any family in the area and that in itself creates further crises. Having to close nursing homes and move people out of them is a problem.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2004-03-10,"—To be fair, I think the Labor Party deserve some congratulations today because they have shown real courage in coming into this place and raising the issue of aged care. If I had a record on aged care like their record, I would not breathe the word. I would not mention it. I would stay well clear of it. What we have on the record is a spectacular failure by the former Labor government to address the needs of ageing Australians. In contrast, we have had an enormously positive and appropriate response in the years since 1996 that leaves Labor's attempts to deal with the problems of ageing Australia in the shade. I think that comparison bears further exploration.
Back in 1995-96, the former Labor government spent just $2½ billion on residential aged care, which is a lot of money. But, as the Auditor-General's report in 1998 demonstrated, it left an enormous number of people unable to obtain care in residential accommodation. The Auditor-General identified a shortfall of 10,000 places in unmet need left to this government by the former Labor government. Since 1995-96, we have increased spending on residential aged care to $4½ billion—that is $2 billion more, or an 80 per cent increase, in spending on residential aged care.
None of us here needs to be reminded that there has not been an increase in the number of people needing aged care in the order of 80 per cent, so why have we spent that extra money? Why has the Australian government spent 80 per cent more on residential aged care in the last few years? I will tell you why: because Labor did not, because Labor failed the sector. Labor saw a need and chose to look the other way. Total aged care funding, which of course includes non-residential services to the aged in Australia, has increased from $3 billion when we came to office to $6 billion today. I am sorry, Senator Denman, but the issues you have raised in comparison with that level of increase in support for the aged in Australia pale into insignificance. 
I am sure there are some issues about the administration of ageing that, no doubt, have a lot to do with the Tasmanian government, but let us put that to one side. There are lots of issues about the detail of administration that we could discuss here today. But none of that detracts from the fact that this government has put the needs of aged Australians well and truly on the public agenda. It has backed its rhetoric about concern for them with dollars that will make a real difference to people in this community.
On Monday I had the pleasure of going with Julie Bishop, the Minister for Ageing, to two care centres in the ACT to launch two new programs for this territory's aged population. One was the Home from Home program designed to provide respite for carers of aged people suffering from dementia. There is huge pressure on these people, and it is extremely important to provide them with support in their own homes so they can support people with dementia. The Home from Home program will provide that kind of support in the ACT. I then went to the Jindalee Nursing Home in Narrabundah to launch an innovative program designed to help those people in residential settings caring for aged people suffering from dementia. This government provides real support for aged Australia where it is necessary; we have nothing to apologise for.
Senator Forshaw has raised some concerns about the status of the Hogan report. Senator Forshaw will want to know the answers to his questions when that report is tabled; he will want to know what the government is going to do about the issues and responses the Hogan report raises. We want to make sure we have those answers, which he will no doubt call for within moments of the report hitting the table. We are taking the time not to do it quickly but to get it right. I know those opposite are experts on making up policy on the run; I know they love to see a bit paper and to think up something on the spot and rush out with an answer. We prefer to think through our responses and to consider what is in the best interests of Australians and, particularly in this case, aged Australians. We prefer to have the answers at hand which will provide an appropriate and complete response to their needs. We have demonstrated that pretty clearly over the last few years— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2004-03-10,"—I also rise to take note of Senator Ian Campbell's answers regarding the state of the aged care industry in this country. There is a lot of talk about aged care funding at the moment. We have the ridiculous situation where the government has commissioned Professor Warren Hogan to present a report and we cannot even debate its recommendations. This report cost taxpayers $7.2 million, yet it can be neither analysed nor its recommendations applied. The government, as is so often the case, is refusing to release a report which could significantly improve the lot of thousands of Australians. In the debate about funding, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the poor state of the industry is due in large part to the failure of the government's Aged Care Act 1997.
Effectively, what has been created is cut-price care. The act created a deregulated environment in which providers are given taxpayers' money without any real control over the quality of care they deliver to elderly Australians. There is no benchmark of care, and we have a funding system under which proprietors have no incentive to improve the health of residents. There are no guidelines, let alone requirements, for the number of staff who should be employed in aged care facilities—a fact that most people are unaware of. This has led to the appalling situation we repeatedly see where facilities are understaffed to the point that the care of residents is placed in danger. 
Consider the case of Kaniva Hostel in western Victoria. For three years it was allowed to operate by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency without anybody working overtime or even being on the premises. The staff went home and the residents were left to fend for themselves if anything went wrong. Conditions were so bad that staff worked in a leaking garage that was used as an office, which was exceptionally cold in winter and unbearably hot in summer; they had no sink to wash their hands. When management finally decided to employ overnight staff, they towed in an old caravan and put it out the back. The wardrobe of the caravan was used to store the records of the residents.
An example that has not yet been reported is the Fraternity of the Holy Cross nursing home in Kentlyn in New South Wales. An inspection there found nobody actually worked overnight. Instead, one carer started at 4.30 p.m. and then slept over to hand out medication and finish work the next morning at 8 o'clock. In that facility there are serious behavioural problems among the residents—including repeated physical and verbal assault, threats with knives and residents absconding. Staff were also left for years without the appropriate training and education they needed to work in such a professionally demanding environment. The Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency said the staffing situation was totally inadequate but, because there are no minimum staffing standards, it cannot say what a proper level of staffing should be.
These are just two examples of the appalling state of an industry where providers are allowed to set their own staff levels and decide what training and education is needed for carers. The Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency often only inspects facilities every three years. When facilities are inspected, the accreditation standards are so rubbery that the agency is powerless to enforce effective standards of care.
While the government has been listening to employers via the former Howard staffer turned PR merchant, Graham Morris, Labor has been listening to all sections of the aged care sector, including the workers themselves. We understand the sector is in crisis, and that is why we intend to propose a Senate inquiry into the level of care that is being delivered and the appalling situation facing residents and staff. The inquiry would be a key opportunity for everybody in the industry to have their say about what its future would be and how we go about introducing a system in which residents and their families have some basic guarantees that they are going to be looked after properly. We are ready, as is often the case. However, the government is unprepared and denies there is a problem that needs to be addressed, and this is demonstrated by the poor answers we received from Senator Ian Campbell today.

Purpose of the Bills
The bills will bring the Unit Area created under the International Unitisation Agreement (IUA) for the Greater Sunrise petroleum field in the Timor Sea within the scope of relevant Commonwealth legislation, including those Acts listed in Annex II to the IUA, while at the same time removing the Unit Area from the scope of certain provisions of other relevant Acts.
Reasons for Urgency
Due to recent positive developments in areas relating to commercial negotiations on LNG, it is now imperative that this legislation be passed to provide certainty to those companies involved in negotiations to enable their negotiations to be advanced further. There is currently a window of opportunity to expedite the commercial development of the Greater Sunrise resource to the benefit of both East Timor and Australia.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-03-10,"—I appreciate the support of my colleagues in bringing forward this matter of public importance today. I am sure that all members of the Senate will recognise that the current crisis in aged care funding and accommodation is a matter of extreme public importance. In this country today we are facing a crisis in aged care funding, and it has been brought about because this government has neglected the funding needs of the aged care sector since it came to office in 1996.
It is worth repeating some of the history of the aged care sector since this government achieved office in 1996. As we all recall, following its election the government set about on a slash and burn process, cutting programs right across the board and slashing funding in a whole range of portfolio areas—health, education and so on. I well recall debating in the Senate for quite some time the government's proposals to turn the aged care sector on its head and completely restructure it. I recall lengthy debates in this chamber on the government's aged care bill. Indeed I was very involved, on behalf of the opposition, in those debates.
We warned at the time—and you can go back and check the Hansard record—that this government's proposals would lead to severe problems in the future. We warned that it would create uncertainty and complexity in aged care. We warned that it would lead to a lowering of standards because of the deregulation of areas such as staffing within nursing homes. We warned that residents and their families would be placed into positions of anxiety and concern because of this government's policies, which would leave them wondering whether they would have to find hundreds of thousands of dollars to get a bed in a nursing home for their loved one. It is all on the record. But we were told, `No, you don't have to worry about that.' We were assailed with the findings of the Gregory report, a report commissioned by the Labor government. We were told that we had got it wrong, that this government was going to fix the problem and that it knew how to do it.
Today, all of the key organisations are saying that the sector is in crisis. We have recently heard about reports, which were raised in question time today by Senator Denman and two days ago by Senator Harradine, on the potential closures of nursing homes in Tasmania because of funding difficulties. These reports point out that, whilst costs in this sector have increased by more than CPI percentages on a yearly basis, this government's indexation formula for adjusting the nursing home subsidy is limited to two per cent per year, leading to a shortfall of some $400 million across the sector since this government came to office. 
We have been made aware in estimates hearings—and I recall questions in the last few years of Senator Herron when he was the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing in this place—of some of the terrible situations that have arisen in nursing homes where residents have been put into a state of total despair because their nursing home is suddenly closed down or the company goes into liquidation. I am sure people recall the horror stories of the kerosene baths in the Riverside Nursing Home in Victoria. That has gone on and on. I do not have time today to go through these situations in detail, but I am sure we will get an opportunity in the future to do that.
It is very clear that, in the area of accreditation standards, the agency that was established by this government—that we were told was going to really clamp down on the shonky practices in the industry—has failed to do its job. We were told that this accreditation standards agency was going to ensure that the standard across the sector for nursing homes would be lifted. It has not happened. For instance, in Victoria alone in recent months four homes have had sanctions placed on them because of their failure to meet appropriate standards. But, when you look at those individual cases in detail, you find that it was only a few months beforehand that they had been given almost a 100 per cent pass on accreditation standards.
One in particular that I draw your attention to is the Chelsea Private Nursing Home. In September last year, it was inspected by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency and was granted two years accreditation. It passed 43 out of 44 standards. It was recommended that approval be granted. Tragically—and I cannot go into this in detail because it is a matter of coronial inquiry—one of the residents appears to have been involved in a struggle with another resident in the facility and, as a result, one of the residents died. That happened in November 2003—two months after this home had been given almost a 100 per cent accreditation pass. What was the reaction of the accreditation standards agency? They sent the inspectors in very quickly, but after the event. And what did they find when they re-inspected the facility? Only two months later, on 17 November, it failed 19 out of the 44 standards. How could that have occurred? How could it have passed nearly all of the standards in September and then failed almost half of them two months later? There are a number of examples of that situation.
I recall Senator Knowles, in the debate we were having earlier on taking note of answers to questions, referring to the Gregory report commissioned by the Labor government. I do not run away from that at all. But the difference between the Labor government and this government is that we commissioned the Gregory report and released it in all its detail. We released it publicly; we did not try to hide it, we did not try to cover it up and we did not try to rewrite it. It was out there in the public arena, indicating that much needed to be done to lift the standard of aged care facilities in this country.
This government came to office fairly shortly thereafter in 1996. As I said, it said it had the recipe to solve all the problems. What was part of that recipe? It introduced accommodation bonds for nursing homes. Mrs Judi Moylan was the minister who introduced accommodation bonds. There was such an outcry in the industry and across the community generally that the government had to withdraw that within a few months. It was total chaos, because people did not know whether they were going to be forced to sell their homes to get a bed in a nursing home. They did not know whether they could get a bed in a nursing home, because they would not have sufficient funds even if they did sell their home. I can recall it very clearly. What we warned the government about occurred. It belatedly understood that and withdrew its legislation for nursing home accommodation bonds. 
A discussion paper was released by the National Aged Care Alliance only a couple of days ago. It is an eminent organisation representing all the key agencies and organisations involved in aged care. This discussion paper is entitled `Capital creation in residential aged care facilities'. It is clearly on the agenda because we are awaiting the Hogan report—the report by Professor Hogan that was supposed to have been provided by the end of December last year—on what this government should do about improving capital funding for aged care facilities. This is the report that the government is sitting on. This is the report that the Prime Minister said on 4 February the government had already received and was considering, but only a week later the minister said there was no report at all—totally contradictory comments, as I said earlier in question time. This is the report of a review that cost $7 million and took almost 12 months to complete. And we are told, `Just you wait—it's coming. We're going to get the Hogan report soon and we're going to hear the government's response to it.' 
While the aged care sector is waiting to hear what the government's response is to these recommendations and while we are waiting to see the actual report, we find that it has been leaked all over the media. Detailed reports about Professor Hogan's recommendations were in the media as far back as December last year. Whilst I acknowledge that Professor Hogan has not actually stated publicly what his recommendations are, he has made a detailed speech on the review and the issues that he was considering. You would think that the government would at least release the report before its author was out there making speeches about it. I return to what the National Aged Care Alliance said. It stated in the discussion paper:
The Alliance recognises that, while the Federal Government has largely withdrawn from providing capital funds for aged care facilities, providers are increasingly unable to fund the capital costs.
It goes on to say, on page 2:
With the introduction of the Aged Care Act on 1 October 1997, responsibility for achieving adequate capital income to meet capital generation costs of approved residential aged care services was almost fully transferred to approved providers. The Commonwealth only provided a small capital grants program to assist some rural and remote services and special needs groups.
The Aged Care Alliance has recognised and stated that this federal government, despite all of the rhetoric and window-dressing, has essentially withdrawn from the area of providing capital funding.
—That is nonsense! Absolute nonsense!
—Senator Knowles says that it is absolute nonsense. She rejects it. That is what the National Aged Care Alliance has said. That is what people like Francis Sullivan and others have said. These are people who have respected records of integrity in this industry for many years. We in this building know that they are decent, honourable people representing this most important sector, aged care. They know what is happening in the industry, even if Senator Knowles does not.
We do know that there are problems out there. For instance, we know that the Salvation Army, which was a major provider of aged care facilities in this country, announced on 11 February this year that it was divesting itself of almost all its aged care facilities. It has 19 aged care facilities around the country and it is going to sell off 15 of them. That amounts to 2,390 beds. We hope that another provider will pick those facilities up. But the Salvation Army has made the decision to get out of this industry because it is no longer financially viable for that non-profit organisation to provide nursing home accommodation—something that it has been doing for many years. This is likely to continue to occur unless this government releases the Hogan report in all its detail, whether it likes the recommendations or not. Put it out in the public arena, let people look at it and tell us what you are going to do about it.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-03-10,"—It is interesting that Senator Forshaw has just spent 10 or 15 minutes consuming time in the Senate talking about aged care but there was not one sentence in his contribution about what the Labor Party would do if elected to government. They have been in opposition now for eight years and they still do not have a policy on aged care. Given the fact that Senator Forshaw has made the bland statement that this coalition government has done nothing, I am just going to run through exactly what has been done. The Australian government has released 8,666 new aged care places across Australia, worth $186 million in recurrent funding for this year alone. Since the coalition government came to office the number of aged care places has increased by over 55,000—bearing in mind that there was a 10,000-place shortage when the Labor Party left government after 13 years.
The 2003 release included 5,889 residential aged care places, 911 community aged care packages, 469 Extended Aged Care at Home packages and 702 places for national priorities, including restructuring to be allocated through the 2003 aged care approval rounds. The list goes on to include increased funding for residential aged care. In 1995-96 the former Labor government spent just $2.5 billion on residential aged care. In 2002-03 this government provided $4.5 billion to aged care homes, an increase of over $2 billion since Labor left aged care in a parlous state. Senator Forshaw comes in here and says that we have not done anything. How can he possibly say that when there are an extra 55,000 places and the funding has been doubled from when Labor left office? 
Earlier, when I was speaking on this subject after question time, I referred to the Gregory report. It is interesting that Senator Forshaw said, `We didn't mind releasing that report. We put it all on the table.' The report was released in 1994. They left office in 1996. Between 1994 and 1996 they did nothing.
—We released the report, though.
—`At least the report was tabled,' says Senator McLucas. Isn't that cute? Wouldn't it have been nice if they had released the report and actually acted on it? If you had acted on it, it would have been interesting. The Gregory report found the extent of nursing home building faults. Let me just have a look at those. Thirteen per cent of the homes failed the fire authority test. Eleven per cent failed the health authority tests. Seventy-five per cent failed Australian design standards. This is under Labor. That is a pretty good record, isn't it? Seventy per cent—this is probably the most alarming figure of all—failed outcome standards. That refers to the way in which treatment is administered.
There were all those problems. In addition, 12 per cent of residents were in rooms with five or more beds, with six per cent of people across all non-government homes being in rooms with six or more beds. Did Labor do anything about it? They did not do a thing. A further 39 per cent of residents were in rooms with three or four beds, which, according to the Gregory report, would be seen by many people as undesirable. What was the response to the Gregory report? Do nothing! Two years after the release of the Gregory report nothing had changed with those figures—and I might just run through them again quickly. Thirteen per cent failed fire, 11 per cent failed health, 75 per cent in total failed Australian design standards and 70 per cent failed outcome standards. In anyone's language that would be seen as a pretty bad record and one that should be turned around immediately. They had two years in government to turn it around and did nothing. Now they come in here again, for the second time today, and pontificate about the issue of aged care and about the release of the Hogan report.  
If they are so interested in releasing reports, why don't they release their Access Economics report into their tax increase options? If they are really keen on releasing reports, release that one. Then at least we would know the tax increases that your colleagues are talking about, and the Australian public would know, and then we might be able to squeeze out of you what you are going to do for aged care. You do not know what you are going to do about aged care. There has not been a coherent aged care policy in the entire time the Labor Party have been in opposition—not one. The only one that you had took four years to kick in. Not only did it take four years to kick in, it had already been implemented by the time that you announced it. That is pretty remarkable too. This mob want to be treated seriously as an opposition but we still do not know their policies. That is a bit concerning because here we are, they have had eight years, and we do not know what they stand for. Their record in aged care for the previous 13 years meant that aged care was in a very serious state.
Let us talk about the way in which people perceived aged care in those days under the Gregory report. The Gregory report said:
There is a clear difference between sectors here with 63 per cent of the complaints against private sector homes being found to be partially or completely substantiated as compared to 56 per cent for the charitable sector and with the private sector having nearly three times as many outcome standards being noted as a problem in substantiated complaints. This observation, however, tends to overstate the real difference between the sectors since more than one standard can be relevant in a single complaint.
There you go. The number of complaints was even upheld. If I were this opposition I would be hanging my head in shame at the record in government on aged care. To think that that report can be commissioned by them, released by them and not acted upon is just a total and utter disregard of the aged care community in Australia.
I challenge them: if they are so keen on reports, let us see the Access Economics report about their tax increases. Let us see where their tax increases are coming from. I think that the Australian people need to know where they are going to be paying more taxes and for what. Are those extra taxes that are going to be generated going to be put into aged care? I doubt it, because that is not their record in government. They do not care about the aged community. They never have cared about the aged community, the same as they do not care about the rural communities. So why start pretending that anyone in the Labor Party cares about any of those communities now? The record stands for itself. One does not have to make up figures because these figures have been provided by an independent source. Why don't they say: `We have to get our act together. We had the whole thing in a complete and utter shambles in government and it is about time we did something about it.' Instead, they keep coming in here carping. Yet we have almost doubled the amount of expenditure on aged care. 
—Do you support accommodation bonds?
—That is an interesting question. Let us see what the Labor Party says about accommodation bonds. Let us see what the Labor Party says about recurrent funding. Let us see what happens. We have on the record our achievements. We have in our budget papers the forward estimates for aged care. But what we do not have in this debate is the comparison. Let us have a look at your policy. Let us have a look at the way in which you are going to provide recurrent funding. At no stage have the Labor Party ever talked about what they are going to do in recurrent funding. I am very glad that Senator Forshaw raised that subject because we might find that Senator McLucas lets the cat out of the bag. Firstly, she might say what the increases in taxes that her colleagues have talked about are going to be and, secondly, she might talk about the recurrent funding issue. So it is a very important question.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-10,"—It is interesting to join the debate at this point in time. I agree to some extent with Senator Knowles, whose criticisms of the Labor Party and its response to the Gregory report and to the state of aged care when it was in office are valid. Nonetheless, we do know that the Hogan report has been made available to the government—late last year, I understand—and this $7.2 million review is very important to the industry. According to the National Aged Care Alliance, the delay in releasing this report is causing enormous uncertainty about funding levels. In a press release on the matter they say:
... the continuing provision of quality aged care is being jeopardised by the uncertainty ...
They go on to say that, despite all of that money being spent on this review, there is now more uncertainty about the quality of aged care than before the review was established. They continue:
Aged care providers are currently preparing budgets for next year, but the review has cast a cloud of uncertainty over likely levels of aged care funding from the Federal Government.
Without certainty in funding levels aged care providers cannot budget for effective staffing levels to guarantee high quality care.
And they go on. We would wish in this place to urge the government to get on with this report. Let us see it, warts and all. I think it is time for a bipartisan approach—if that is ever going to be possible on aged care—to funding and to aged care provision. I can understand the nervousness of the government on this issue. The last time matters such as bonds were raised, the ALP took delight in turning this into a great political point-scoring exercise which did more damage to the sector—it reminds me a bit of ethanol, actually—than could be justified in any terms.
I think the government has done a good job on accreditation. I think the standard of care has been raised since 1996, or whenever the accreditation began. There are certain to be some gaps in provision of care—and there are some nursing homes I still would not wish to see my mother or grandmother in—but I think we also have to seriously tackle this question of funding. The operating grants that currently are indexed by so-called COPO come in for a lot of criticism across the sector. So there are real issues about the long-term viability of nursing homes under the current arrangement, and I would like to see a debate in this place about them and about the provision of capital to allow nursing homes to build, to meet their accreditation requirements. 
A nursing home in my local area which I know very well is now looking at increasing the number of places they provide. They have done their sums and know that they must move to 60 but, because this is a community based, not-for-profit organisation, their opportunities to get capital funding to do the necessary work are pretty much non-existent. What just came to hand before I came down to the chamber was a letter—which no doubt was sent to all of us—from the Royal Freemasons Homes of Victoria talking about funding. They say:
I write to inform you that The Royal Freemasons' Homes of Victoria Limited is facing an enormous operating deficit of $700,000 for the year ending 30 June 2004.
Our organisation, established in 1867 was one of Victoria's first not-for-profit non-government aged care providers and is now one of its largest, operating 509 subsidised nursing homes, hostels and community aged care places.
They go on to say:
This enormous and unsustainable operating loss is attributable to the Commonwealth Government using its Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays formula (COPO Index).
They continue:
This index has been in use since 1997-98 and over this period the compounded negative impact of the COPO Index, compared to `actual residential aged care cost increases', is 8%.
The loss in care subsidy to this organisation in the current 2003-04 financial year is a staggering $1.36 Million.
I think we in this place have to listen to those examples of unsustainable operating funding. We know that the Hogan report will go this question. I hope it also tackles that serious question of where to find the capital to expand and otherwise bring up to standard the facilities that are available in aged care.
On the question of facilities, I want to expand this debate somewhat to talk about housing choices. The Australian population is ageing, and many would argue that our housing stock will be unsuitable for an ageing Australia. We have to consider not just what happens in nursing homes but also how we can work to help people to stay in their own homes, in suitable homes. I know my house probably will not be suitable for me if I am in a wheelchair, I know it probably will not be suitable for me if I have to climb into a bath when I am in my late 80s. I think we really need to start to examine this question.
Planning for the future means housing development and planning processes that lead to housing development. We should be looking at who will be using housing and related infrastructure well into the future. The future needs of an ageing society and the current needs of those with a disability mean that planning and design should incorporate the universal, adaptable housing standards. Disability advocacy organisations have raised these issues with the Democrats. The Australian Network for Universal Housing Design recently told us:
Poor design will exclude, disadvantage and limit people who have a temporary or permanent disability or illness. It negatively impacts on their participation in education, employment and community life. Currently people who have a disability or are ageing (and their families) often face expensive modifications and renovations to make their homes accessible at their own cost or public cost. More often, when renovations are not feasible, the person is forced to live in unsafe conditions or is displaced from their home into institutional care. The personal and public financial cost of inaccessible housing design is therefore very considerable.
I do know that some good work is being done at the local level through HAAC funding to make houses suitable—grab rails and the like—for elderly people so that they can stay at home longer and more safely. But we also know that HAAC funding is hopelessly inadequate and that there are people on waiting lists for changes to be made to their housing which could easily be done and should be afforded because, down the track, the savings would be very considerable indeed. 
What most people want to do is to stay at home. They would love to be able to access the community aged care packages. All up, for people over 70 there were 15.6 packages per 1,000 people in 2002-03, and that equates to around $288 million nationally. At the other end of the scale, $4.3 billion was allocated for residential care in 2002-03—that is, 95 places per thousand. So, nationwide, there is a balance of 15 community places versus 93 residential places. I think that the debate should look at the whole question of how to keep people out of very expensive residential care—care that very often people would sooner not be in because they would be in favour of staying at home in their own houses.
We should also talk about the so-called—dreadfully named, I should say—bed blockers, the 2,500 people who are in transition or wish they were in transition and are stuck in acute care hospitals. They really should be in more appropriate accommodation, and many of them are missing out on rehabilitation. When we get into this discussion about aged care we need to consider that there ought to be a place for people who have been treated in hospital, many of whom need to have extensive rehab services in order, in some cases, to avoid going to nursing homes. But, even if they get there, it is better for them if they recover appropriately from their hospitalisation. There are many more issues that we could discuss in this debate, but these are some of the issues that the Democrats would like to see on the table and being talked about.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2004-03-10,"—I want to remind members that this debate should not merely be about the past in aged care. As far as I am concerned, when we look at the past—and I think Senator Knowles has demonstrated this very ably—there is a very stark contrast between the performances of this government and of the previous Labor government when it comes to the provision of funding for aged care in Australia. No-one could even glance at those two records without realising that that has been the case. There has been a substantial uplift in spending on aged care under this government, and the needs of tens of thousands of older Australians are better addressed because that funding has been made available. But the future is also important in this debate. We need to make sure that we are looking continuously at what the needs of an ageing population might be. The government has had a great deal to say about ageing Australia in recent days. Obviously it is being focused on as a high priority. It has been described as the greatest social challenge facing this country today, and I think that that is not an exaggeration.
On top of providing very significant extra dollars for aged care places over the last few years, the government has committed itself to meeting a target of an extra 200,000 aged care places by June 2006. That promise comes from the 2001 federal election. In fact, in pursuance of that promise, already 55,600 beds have been provided since 1996 and we are well on the way to meeting that target of 200,000 aged care places. As others have said in this debate, that is not the full picture with aged care—and that is perfectly true—but it is the most significant thing that aged people would require when their capacity to care for themselves deteriorates. At the end of the day, it is vitally important to have a solid and effective aged care residential system in place, and this government has addressed that issue with a great deal of extra money. 
It is also important to look at other parts of the system. What we have done particularly is to look at ways in which we can improve other aspects of the aged care system. For example, it is true—at least in the past and almost certainly still today—that there are a significant number of aged Australians occupying hospital beds who ought to be in aged care places. Whether it is on a permanent basis or on a transitional basis, those beds need to be available in some form or another. The decrease in acute hospital beds in the last few years is a reflection of that problem. The Australian government has said very squarely that it wants to work with states and territories, which of course administer the public hospitals, to make sure that options are available for people in those circumstances. Initiatives such as Pathways Home, the aged care innovative pool and the Care of Older Australians Working Group have resulted from that desire to address this problem. Joint work is under way at present as part of the health reform agenda on improved transitions between the hospital sector and the aged care sector.
The Pathways Home program in particular is significant. It provides $253 million over five years to assist the states and territories in the provision of step-down facilities and rehabilitation care for older members of the community. That additional funding from the Australian government is designed to help states and territories to meet their responsibilities in a timely way, in a way which frankly has not happened before. On 16 February this year the Canberra Times noted that for some older patients in the Canberra Hospital:
There was no ongoing rehabilitation and no appropriate equipment such as chairs, beds, stools and bathing facilities.
That is a very sad reflection. Some of those people need to be in hospital for a period of time, but clearly many of them are staying in hospital much longer than they should be and there should be options for them, whether it is through HACC programs or through access to nursing homes.
In the ACT, I am pleased to say, a large number of additional resources have been made available in the last few years. Since 1996 some 660 new aged care places have been made available, worth nearly $14 million a year in recurrent funding. Again, that is not the full answer—and I accept that—but it is very significant in addressing the needs of people in this territory. Sadly, many of those beds have not been made operational because the territory has very complicated and complex planning laws. In some cases it has not been possible to get those beds actually operational, and I suppose that is not a problem isolated to the ACT. But the funding of the beds in the first instance is the most important thing.
The other issue which is very important is making sure that nursing homes, particularly aged accommodation being provided in the not-for-profit sector, is of an appropriate standard to meet the needs of Australians. We have all seen instances in our time in public life where homes have not met appropriate standards. It is therefore very surprising that it is only very recently that a sound system of accreditation of Australia's nursing homes and aged accommodation has really been put in place. The Gregory report to the former government found that in many cases nursing homes failed to meet relevant standards and care outcomes. That was not acted upon by the former government. It was the coalition in 1997 that established an accreditation system to make sure that the Commonwealth dollars going into aged care were reflected in a standard being met in those sorts of institutions. I am very pleased to say that that is being done. Promises from the other side of the chamber to lift the standards have come a bit late, frankly, and I think that reflects that this is an issue which has already been addressed properly by this government. We repeat that we have put many extra dollars into aged care in this country and we are proud of that fact. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2004-03-10,"—It is an appalling state of affairs when we on this side of the chamber need to bring a matter of public importance of this nature to the chamber. The Howard government has failed to address the crisis in aged care funding and accommodation, and its refusal to release the Hogan pricing review is quite frankly both a waste of public money and another of this government's futile attempts to cover up its failures.
For months now the Hogan report has been hidden in the bottom drawer of the Howard government's latest Minister for Ageing, Ms Julie Bishop. To give some explanation of why we are here dealing with this matter today, let me point out that this government seems to go through aged care ministers extremely quickly. We have seen five ministers in the past six years. It has been essentially a revolving door portfolio for this government, a portfolio that has suffered as its ministers—Mrs Moylan, Mr Warwick Smith, Mrs Bronwyn Bishop and then Mr Kevin Andrews—have come and gone while the crisis in aged care has deepened. Now we have the minister of the day, Ms Julie Bishop, hiding a review that cost taxpayers $7.2 million.
This review was promised in 2001. The aged care sector needs it, and needs it desperately; yet the government will not release Professor Hogan's report and will not give answers as to why. With no report publicly available, the headlines have been quite sensational: sweeping deregulation of the aged care sector; nursing homes would be able to offer different levels of accommodation, rather like star-rated hotels, at varying prices and charge new residents cash deposits; a more user-pays focused system for nursing homes; Warren Hogan would recommend nursing home operators be given unprecedented freedom to set their own prices; nursing home beds would be auctioned while residents and their families could use vouchers to choose their levels of care.
The community has a right to know what is going on. The community has a right to understand what Professor Hogan has written. The community needs to make an assessment of whether the $7.2 million that has been spent commissioning this report was in fact money well spent. We have to know whether or not there is a report. But we really have to know whether or not there are going to be accommodation bonds.
It is well past time for the government to put community fears at rest and reveal a comprehensive and caring plan for the future, because those sorts of headlines that we have heard relate to many of the most vulnerable people in our community—the frail, the elderly and their families and, we must remember, those people who tirelessly and selflessly care for nursing home residents.
Let us look at how this government has treated those carers—in the main, the nurses in the aged care sector. We are seeing increasing difficulty with the recruitment of nursing staff to the aged care sector, and I have to say little wonder. There is a significant wage differential between nurses in aged care and nurses in hospitals or other health service settings. The government has allocated some funding to the sector, but the disparity in wages is even greater now than it was before the government's funding announcement was made. 
I regret to advise the community that aged care nurses are leaving the sector for a range of reasons. Firstly, they are simply not being paid enough to undertake the increasingly complex tasks that are asked of them. Further, the lack of critical mass of qualified staff has led experienced and talented aged care nurses to simply give up as the pressures become too great.
Nurses who do stay do so because of their genuine commitment and determination to care for the residents with whom they have developed quite close bonds. It is certainly not because of the pay. They do the right thing in what I consider to be extraordinarily difficult conditions of work. Labor's shadow minister for ageing and seniors, Ms Annette Ellis, has spoken of a situation where a single staff member is on duty alone overnight in a facility of 60 people. We had an example at estimates earlier this year where staff had to use portable toilets and had no hand-washing facilities. These examples are simply unacceptable.
Labor's leader, Mark Latham, has said:
The measure of a civilised society is ... the way in which we treat our elderly ... We cannot aspire to be a decent, civilised society until we end this scandal.
I wholeheartedly agree with him and I am heartened by his concern and his determination to address this crisis, which really started when the government failed to ensure provider viability following the reforms of 1997. These changes had major impacts on the aged care sector and the aged care funding regime which fall far short of tolerability.
Let us look at what La Trobe University had to say in their fourth report for the National Aged Care Alliance, Residential aged care funding. The examination of sectoral funding arrangements points out:
... `current indexation arrangements using Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays'—or COPOs—`do not adequately adjust for wage cost increases', and, due to the current indexation method, the sector has been underfunded up to $405.8 million since 1996-97, which is an average of approximately $50.7 million per year over eight years. The reason for this underfunding is that the COPO indexation method underestimates the cost pressures faced by residential aged care providers. As a result, the funding is inadequate.
Last year this government had the temerity to put forward only a 2.2 per cent increase in residential aged care subsidies when the CPI was running at 3.3 per cent and when, according to the CEO of the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association:
The first five years of the post 1997 reforms have seen a 10.6 percent increase through indexation with cost escalations during the same period varying from state to state but some running as high as 26 percent.
The fact is that aged care providers are quite rightly required to provide high-quality care but that the processes developed by the government that must be followed for funding and accreditation to be granted are complex, time-consuming and not focused on improving quality of care; they are focused on form filling, as any aged care nurse will tell you. Yet, simultaneous to the introduction of many of these obligations, the aged care funding arrangements in place since the 1997 reforms have seen nursing homes starved of the necessary resources to ensure their compliance.
It is when nursing homes are faced with overwhelming financial pressures that you see compromises in the quality of care creep in. There have been a number of scandals highlighted in the media in recent times—in fact, over many years now. We must not ignore those warning signals. The pricing review submission from Aged and Community Services Australia says:
The pricing arrangements in place since 1997 have eroded product quality by reducing the quality of life of residents. They have done this through the pressure they have imposed on funding levels. This has resulted in a reduction in support for the quality of life of residents due to a reduction in the time staff are able to spend with them. 
In effect, this government is forcing a whole raft of trade-offs right across the sector. Nursing staff in enterprise bargaining situations are under enormous pressure to forgo parity with their hospital counterparts. Facilities have to consider how best to reduce their outlays—outlays that impact on the quality of life of residents. This could mean forgoing new equipment or the best quality food, cutting corners on training or occupational health and safety, reducing staff numbers or increasing charges. Further, there is continuing pressure on the public hospital sector as, when nursing home places are harder to locate, people who should be in nursing homes are taking up places in public hospitals.
For some facilities the financial pressure has been too much. We have seen a number of closures and we know of more to come. I would like to conclude by pointing out the situation highlighted in a letter we all received from Aged and Community Services Australia saying:
Unless these issues are addressed, the reality is that Australia is facing the collapse of the aged and community care system as we know it. This is not over-stating the case. Many of our members, despite making substantial productivity improvements, are carrying deficits that increase every year. Some can afford to carry these for a time through subsidisation from other areas. Most cannot. Without fundamental change to the current funding system, all our members will soon be facing the decision of whether they can continue to operate, if they are not already.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Health and Ageing: Aged Care</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2004-03-10,"—Most people in this place, and certainly in Tasmania, know that I have a special interest in the aged care sector, having spent seven or eight years on the board of Tasmania's oldest aged care facility—St Ann's, based in Hobart—and been a consultant to the aged care sector for several years prior to my entry into the Senate. Since my entry into the Senate some two years and one month ago, I have hosted five workshops and forums in Tasmania on aged care issues and the ageing issue together with, as special guests, the former Minister for Ageing, the Hon. Kevin Andrews and most recently, before Christmas, the Hon. Julie Bishop, the current Minister for Ageing. I commend them and congratulate them both as outstanding advocates for the aged care sector.
I am sure it will come as no surprise when I say that planning and delivering aged care services is complex and demanding, but I am also proud of the funding the Australian government has provided for the aged care sector over the past eight years. I am also mindful of the increasing costs and the greater demand for aged care treatment, and the urgent need for our governments and society to meet that demand.
Allow me to outline where we are at present. Total funding for aged and community care has increased from $3 billion in 1995-96 to a projected $6 billion for next financial year. So I find it somewhat hypocritical of the Labor opposition to point the finger. While Labor has dithered, the Howard government has delivered. This funding increase is a 100 per cent increase over that period of time. I am proud to say it demonstrates our national government's commitment to the aged care sector, but it also demonstrates the cost pressures in the industry in recent years.
In the past five years the Australian government have released more than 53,000 aged care places, and we are well on track to meet our target of providing 200,000 places by June 2006. In recent weeks the Australian government have released an additional 193 residential aged care places in Tasmania, with associated capital grants of $2.5 million. Amongst other aspects, this latest announcement will see the establishment of two new residential aged care services in southern Tasmania and the establishment of a new dementia care facility in northern Tasmania. In this regard, I congratulate Southern Cross Care for their initiative. It is certainly a first for Tasmania and a cutting-edge facility and service. 
Funding for our Home and Community Care program, which is jointly funded by the Australian and state and territory governments and provides services such as cleaning, personal care and transport, has increased by more than 70 per cent in the past seven years. The Australian government contribute about 60 per cent of this funding. We are on target to raise the number of community aged care packages from 2,055 in 1995-96 to more than 34,000—a huge increase. Since the coalition came to government, nearly 40,000 people have benefited from community care packages. These statistics mark a great leap forward in the provision of aged care. No longer is it regarded as an adjunct to general health expenditure, and nor should it be.
At the same time I should say that this has come about because of a profound shift in the demographics of our population, both state and national. I am sure that the community has heard and no doubt everyone here is fully aware of the Hogan inquiry into aged care services and the funding for those services. As Senator Ian Campbell said earlier today, and as Ms Julie Bishop has indicated, the government's response to this report is not too far away.
I believe that our treatment of the most respected citizens of our society is fundamental to our unique character as Australians, because if we short-change the elderly then we are short-changing ourselves and future generations. In the aged care sector, the Australian government has the job of pre-paring for a very different kind of Australia that we will be living in 20 years from now. The number of people in Australia aged over 65 is likely to swell from 2.4 million people now to 4.2 million people in 20 years time. Put another way, the proportion of the population aged over 65 will increase from 12 per cent in 2001 to around 18 per cent in 2021.
Tasmania currently has the second oldest population of any state or territory and it is projected that within 10 years the population will become the oldest in Australia, with a significantly higher proportion of people aged 65 and over and with a substantial proportion aged 85 years or more. In the next 20 years the proportion of the Tasmanian population aged 65 years and over is expected to increase from 13.75 per cent to 22.51 per cent. Tasmania will be the first state required to deal in depth with ageing related issues across all aspects of community living.
This will present both great challenges and great opportunities for government, business and the community sector. For government the challenge relates to the provision and proper maintenance of the aged care sector. The Australian government cannot do it alone; we need to work cooperatively with the wider community and the industry.
I am saying that the cost of providing individual and institutional aged care is likely to accelerate in the coming years so that, along with mainstream health care, Commonwealth budget outlays will be a whole lot greater, even by today's standards. These are exactly the sorts of issues that are considered in the Hogan report. That is why it has taken considerable funds and a good deal of time-—so that we get it right for the years and, in fact, the decades to come.
With the rising costs, I believe that the aged care industry faces a challenge in demonstrating to the rest of the community why aged care is worth the investment, how such an investment benefits us all, what we get from it as a society and what are the human and financial consequences if we fail to keep pace with these ever-rising costs. These are questions worth debating when there is much more time than I have today, but they will not go away and we need to face up to these issues very directly. 
I feel extremely confident in the Howard government's impending response to the Hogan report. I have enormous confidence in Ms Julie Bishop and I have congratulated her in public and do so again today for the way in which she has handled this very important and sensitive issue. We should show respect for our elderly, and I know that the Howard government will demonstrate that in our response to the Hogan report. Yes, it has taken time. That is because the elderly are important people. Older Tasmanians and older Australians are vital to our community and we want to show them respect. In our response to the Hogan report, we will do exactly that.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,"—The Senate has before it the Social Security Amendment (Further Simplification) Bill 2003. I make it clear to the Senate that I speak in a private capacity and not as a minister in this regard. It is an important bill. The Senate is in a slight conundrum at the moment in that we were intending to bring on the Medicare package. We were informed that the amendments had been circulated. Unfortunately they had not been. We are waiting for those amendments to be circulated in the chamber. The position now is that we have moved to the Social Security Amendment (Further Simplification) Bill 2003 and for very understandable reasons the senators on the speakers list are gathering their thoughts, bringing their notes and moving to the chamber in a most elegant fashion, with style and aplomb. 
What I am doing, in a private capacity so as not to conclude the debate, is allowing honourable senators such as Senator Collins and others to get to the chamber and gather their thoughts and their breath. There is nothing worse, in my own experience, than rushing into the chamber to talk on an important bill such as the Social Security Amendment (Further Simplification) Bill at such short notice. You do not know you are on. You think that you are probably going to speak tomorrow and your whip calls you up and says, `Where are you?' You come to the chamber and you have got to make a speech. When Senator Collins feels she has gathered her breath, is totally relaxed, happy and able to speak and nods to that effect, I will sit down in my private capacity and allow her to make what will be one of her normally eloquent, elegant contributions to debate in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (FURTHER SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-03-10,"—I thank Senator Ian Campbell for his complimentary remarks and reflect that, for me, the last time this particular circumstance occurred I was about seven months pregnant, so on this occasion it was much easier to race to the chamber to address this particular bill. The Social Security Amendment (Further Simplification) Bill 2003 for the most part makes a number of technical and minor amendments to the Social Security Act 1991. The two key changes include consolidation of rent assistance provisions in the act and changes to ensure supplementary payments may be recovered when compensation affected social security payments are reduced to nil.
The issues that we have with this bill firstly relate to rent assistance. Schedule 1 of the bill seeks to consolidate provisions for the payment of rent assistance to one place in the act rather than have the current situation, where provisions for the payment of rent assistance are repeated in the rate calculators for each of the payments that the rent assistance might be paid with. This will provide for some simplification with respect to administration, but the new provisions are still at least as lengthy as the existing provisions, except that they will be located in a new part 3.7 of the act. After examining the proposal, there appear to be no significant policy changes that result from the consolidation. Labor were wary that the consolidation may have replicated the government's efforts in the Family and Community Service Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 to change the payment of rent assistance to income support recipients with children. That change may have left some families worse off by virtue of reducing the income cut-off points for payments such as the parenting payment. Labor are satisfied that there are unlikely to be any such consequences in this legislation; however, we request that the minister provide this assurance to the Senate today.
Labor also notes, however, that the government has failed to take up Labor's policy to extend rent assistance to Austudy students. The current situation means that unemployed people face a financial penalty if they decide to take up study to improve their employment prospects. It also means that older students receive less financial assistance than their younger counterparts on Youth Allowance, who are able to access rent assistance. Labor will not move amendments on this occasion, as doing so would serve only to delay passage of this bill, but the government's failure to address this issue shows that it still is not interested in positive welfare reforms to move people off benefits and into work. 
Another issue relates to supplementary payments and compensation. Schedule 2 of the bill includes amendments to the compensation recovery regime. These amendments will ensure that supplementary payments are not payable and may be recovered when linked compensation affected social security payments are reduced to nil. Currently, only the income support component may be recovered when a lump sum or periodic compensation results in a nil payment rate. There is no basis for the recovery of supplementary payments, such as pharmaceutical allowance, telephone allowance or pensioner education supplement, which may have been paid alongside the income support payment. The inability to recover these supplementary payments is an anomaly when compared with the treatment of debts that occur as a result of ordinary income that results in an income support payment being reduced to nil. Under these circumstances both the income support payment and the supplementary payments may be recovered. This measure will only impact on individuals who receive compensation payments on or after 1 July 2004.
Labor are conscious of the fact that a number of the supplementary payments which may now be recovered, such as employment entry payment, do serve a useful purpose in assisting these persons into work. The role of this payment in assisting the transition is a good outcome for individuals and taxpayers in the long run. However, we do not consider that a subsequent decision to recover this payment should the person later be found not eligible for income support, as this bill would allow, will affect decisions to return to work or the value of the payment at that time.
Labor do wish to note, however, the appalling record of this government with respect to rehabilitating and reskilling those who suffer workplace injury and disability and often end up on the disability support pension. We suggest that if there were a far more coordinated and concerted effort to rehabilitate and reskill there would not be so many people on the disability support pension today and there would be improved labour force outcomes for those who remain on benefits. Labor support the government's latest changes, but much more needs to be done to assist those who suffer disabilities, particularly in the workplace. Reforms in this area will deliver good outcomes for compensation recipients and taxpayers alike.
Labor would also like to flag some concerns that have been raised with the so-called technical amendments to the assets disregard, which we believe have some merit. Item 28 of schedule 2 of the bill amends section 1112(1) of the act. This subsection currently allows the value of an asset to be reduced by the value of a charge or encumbrance. The current treatment regards that a person should only have the equity that they hold in an asset affecting their rate of payment. The effect of the proposed item 28 would specifically exclude the borrowings on financial assets from these rules. It would mean that a person with a financial investment subject to an encumbrance has the total value of the asset assessed. This could have an impact in relation to deeming and the assets test.
The measure, by virtue of the fact that more income is deemed to flow from a financial investment, may result in a lower level of payment affecting a person under the income test. Alternatively, by including the total value of the financial investment, a lower level of payment may result under the assets test. If these are the consequences of item 28 of schedule 2 then we invite the minister to confirm in the Senate today that this is the case. The explanatory memorandum simply states that the item is a technical amendment. Labor would be disappointed if the government were seeking to sneak through this measure by stealth and without any consultation. While this measure will lead to a differential treatment of financial and non-financial investments, there may be a plausible rationale. The current treatment may allow for a form of double dipping where a pensioner may gain both a tax and social security benefit from negatively geared shares. Labor believe, however, that these issues should be out in the open rather than pushed through in the fine print of a bill such as this. Labor also wishes to flag with the minister other items in the bill. 
Items 25 to 27 amend section 1118 of the act. This section, among other things, allows for concessional assets test treatment of the sale of the principal home. Sale proceeds are disregarded under the assets test for 12 months, often to allow time to buy a new home. However, Centrelink has deemed the proceeds under the deeming rules. These amendments appear to clarify the treatment in this regard. We would ask the minister why this is required. Has Centrelink been acting without legislative authority for this treatment of the family home for almost a decade? We look forward to the minister's response to this and the other issues that we have flagged. We also note that negatively geared shares in respect of social security benefits and allowances have been dealt with. But why does the government continue not to be prepared to deal with this issue in the same way with respect to the family tax benefit?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (FURTHER SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-10,"—I want to speak, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, very briefly on the Social Security Amendment (Further Simplification) Bill 2003, largely endorsing what Senator Collins has already said, so there is little point in going over that again but I will clarify some things. The bill we are dealing with, as its name suggests, is an administrative bill dealing in an omnibus way with several areas of social security which go to the heart of further simplification. That has got to be a good thing, particularly in such an incredibly complex area of Commonwealth law. In particular, the bill consolidates legislation for rent assistance in one place in the act, whereas that is currently not the case; makes recoverable an allowance, such as the telephone allowance, should, for example, an income support recipient receive compensation; and provides the same definition of independence from parental testing for young disability support pensioners as there is for youth allowees. In that sense it is not a contentious bill; it is one which is overdue in terms of working towards the simplification of a very complex area of Commonwealth law, and on that basis we Democrats have no difficulty in supporting it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (FURTHER SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-10,"—I rise to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Further Simplification) Bill 2003, which deals with the issue of rent assistance. I want to talk specifically about the Australian Greens position, supported by others in this chamber as well, of extending access to rent assistance by Austudy recipients. This is an issue that I have talked about in this chamber previously, in relation to the higher education debate. We recently had 18 months of consultation, as part of the Crossroads review process, on the higher education sector and there was a unanimous view coming from students, communities and universities that something needs to be done to address the issue of student poverty. But in the higher education legislation that we debated at the end of last year there was nothing to address the issue of student poverty, and we have seen very little since from the government on this issue. 
What we saw was a bill looking at the issue of student poverty but not looking to improve the situation of student poverty; rather it was a bill that sought to take away the student financial supplement scheme, one of the last crutches available for students who were already studying on Austudy. When the government could not get support for that bill in the Senate, the minister moved administratively to end the scheme with absolutely no contingency plans to catch those who would fall out of the higher education system directly as a result of the government's move to take away the financial crutch that the student financial supplement scheme provided for students who were in poverty. That is the track record of this government. They did not achieve what they wanted to in being able to abolish the pension education supplement support scheme when backbenchers came up to the government and said, `That is not a proposal that is supported in our electorate. That isn't a proposal that we can go forward with.' Those are the measures we have seen from the Howard government; that is their track record on dealing with the issue of student poverty. So perhaps it is not all that surprising that in the bill that we are debating today, which deals with the issue of rent assistance, we are not seeing any moves by the government to increase the capacity for those on Austudy to access rent assistance.
It is clear that the government do not care about this issue of student poverty and what they can do through just one small measure to decrease the financial barriers for students at university—and the student poverty and poor student life that they experience—by extending to Austudy recipients access to rent assistance. It is clear that the government do not care that 10 per cent of students are currently dropping out of higher education directly as a result of financial pressures. They do not appear to care that on average students are working over 15 hours a week to get by. That is on average, so we can reasonably assume that those who are most financially vulnerable will be working many more than 15 hours a week, whilst being a full-time student at university, to pay their way through university.
This is coming from a government that have spent the best part of the last two years telling us that, on the one hand, they were interested in developing world-class students but, on the other hand, they were concerned with getting value for money for non university going taxpayers who were contributing to the costs. So why are we seeing the government wasting money in this area? Why would I say they are wasting money? The minister told us last year—in fact one of the government members told us this yesterday—that students contributed about 25 per cent of the cost of their education. We all know that is rubbish and that the figure is far closer to 40 per cent, but this still leaves the Commonwealth making a contribution to, an investment in, the education of students. But this money is wasted when so many of those students are working so hard to financially support themselves at university that they are unable to actually go to their lectures because they are too busy going to their part-time jobs to make up the money to pay for the course that they are studying at university.
So why is the government investing money—and the Greens would say it is not enough money—in the higher education system and then ensuring that students work an average of at least 15 hours a week so that they are not able to attend their university lecturers and they are not able to spend time studying for their exams and to be the quality higher education, the world-class students that this minister says he wants to see coming out of our higher education system? The government would do well to reflect on the point of investing in higher education. Surely it is an investment that society is keen to make to boost learning in our community so that we can grow intellectually and culturally as a country, to drive up economic vitality and skill up the work force of tomorrow. One would have thought that was a pretty significant and worthwhile investment that the government should be making, but that is not the way this government sees it. This government is an advocate of the luxury theory of higher education. It is a theory that sees students as rapacious qualification consumers hell-bent on feeding on the largesse of the public university system in order to primarily accrue what senators told us yesterday is a significant private benefit. 
This is the view the government has of our higher education system. That is why it has legislated for the user-pays system for higher education that is resulting in the massive fee increases that we are seeing at universities across the country and that we debated here in the chamber yesterday. This view cheapens and sells short the contribution of our higher education to the growth and vitality of Australian society. In the short term, it is a view that condemns thousands of students to a crippling poverty, preventing them from achieving their potential at university and cheating the community out of the extra benefits for all of the community that the higher education sector would provide.
As I said before, extending rent assistance to recipients of Austudy would not solve the whole problem of student poverty. It would be a significant step in the right direction. The minister would be well aware that rents in the major cities of Australia have risen sharply over the last decade and that rental costs as a proportion of income for students in the private rental market are running at around 50 per cent. Those in the lowest quintile of income are paying 58 per cent. Extending rent assistance to Austudy recipients would have a significant impact on the financial status of these students. And the cost of this measure would be far from astronomical. The Greens have costed the measure at around $25 million and the Labor Party, who share this approach, have costed it at around $70 million over the next three years. That is not a massive amount of money when you consider the willingness of this Treasurer to dig deep to fund the Australian Defence Force's ongoing transition to become the newest division of the United States Army. We are looking at $560 million for tanks that are bigger than we need, if you believe the defence think tanks that have been quoted in today's paper. Spending $25 million on the future of the poorest students pales in comparison with the spending of $560 million on tanks, which was announced today.
This is not the only measure that the government should support to address the issue of student poverty. The Greens have called in this place before for a thoroughgoing overhaul of all student financial support measures. We have called for a unification of Youth Allowance and Austudy in order that they be brought to a level that would, at the very least, raise benefits above the current Henderson poverty line. We have called for the age of independence to be reduced to 18 and we have called for the effective cuts to Abstudy that occurred in 1997 to be reduced. But just for today, and just for this bill, we are focusing on rent assistance being extended to those who are on Austudy. That relates directly to the content of the bill that we are debating today.
The Greens condemn the government's short-sighted approach to these issues. We particularly condemn the elitist policies that have raised fees and removed financial support. We look forward to a day when this parliament will be able to cherish the public education system in this country and take decisive steps to ensure that all Australians—not just the rich and privileged, but all Australians—have the opportunity to access a high-quality public education system and be empowered to succeed when they get there. I move the Greens' amendment: 
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate condemns the Government for failing to take the opportunity presented by this bill to amend the Social Security Act to extend rent assistance to recipients of Austudy.”",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (FURTHER SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-03-10,"—I thank senators for their contributions. I take quite significant issue with Senator Nettle about the student loans program. That program has been criticised strongly by the Australian university student union and I believe—I am advised—that the average debt was about $20,000. Money was being taken from people. The program was devised at a time when interest rates were incredibly high under Labor and students could not get loans. It was not delivering good outcomes for students. It is estimated that 56 per cent of the loans—more than $1 billion worth—will never be repaid to the government. What about other students who did not have one of those loans? They were not being treated in the same way in the same circumstances. Too many students accrued debt and it was costing an enormous amount of money to administer the program through the particular bank that had that system. Senator Nettle will never have to be responsible for making sure that the books in this country are balanced and that the next generation has something to actually look forward to rather than us borrowing continually from the next generation, as was happening under Labor.
But I want to talk about the Social Security Amendment (Further Simplification) Bill 2003 in particular; I do not want to be taken off the track by Senator Nettle and her wanderings across various aspects of social security. The bill consolidates the rent assistance provision in the Social Security Act 1991. It applies the definition of independence which currently applies to Youth Allowance customers to disability support pension youth customers, amends the definition of compensation affected payments to include certain supplementary payments and makes a number of other minor changes and some technical amendments.
The consolidation of the rules relating to rent assistance takes up the major part of the bill. It will put in place the rules for calculating rent assistance for all social security payments. The rent assistance provisions currently appear in many different places in the act, creating much unnecessary duplication of corresponding provisions. As a result of this bill, it will be easier for Centrelink staff to work out a customer's entitlement to rent assistance and explain the basis of the calculation to the clients. Centrelink clients will continue to receive the rent assistance that they currently receive under the existing provisions. I think Senator Collins asked a question about that. The consolidation of rent assistance measures contained in this bill is an important part of the measures being undertaken to give effect to the government's commitment to implementing a simpler and more coherent social security system.
I now turn to other measures contained in the bill. I am taking this early opportunity to inform the Senate of a decision handed down by Justice Stone in the Federal Court on 4 December 2003. Justice Stone's decision relates to the interpretation of legislation for which technical amendments have been proposed in the bill, namely in items 25 to 28 of schedule 2 of the bill. Justice Stone held that loans secured against listed shares should be used to reduce the value of the shares in calculating deemed income under the income test. This is contrary to government policy, which is that the gross value of the shares should have been used to calculate deemed income. I am advised that the department has lodged an appeal to the full Federal Court against Justice Stone's decision. 
The government's longstanding policy is that, when deemed income is calculated on the income test in relation to financial assets, the gross value of the financial assets is to be used, as income is derived from the full amount of the asset. On the other hand, when assets are valued under the assets test, the net value of assets is used where there is a charge or encumbrance in relation to an asset, as this is what would be received if the asset was realised. Items 25 to 28 of schedule 2 of the bill make the necessary amendments to ensure that the policy intention is stated unambiguously in the legislation.
In addition to a number of minor technical amendments, the bill contains two further measures. The bill will amend the definition of compensation. The affected payments include certain supplementary payments which are paid as a result of a person being eligible for a social security pension, allowance or benefit. These supplementary payments will be recoverable from people who receive an economic loss compensation payment. These changes will apply after 1 July 2004. However, they will only affect those customers who receive both social security supplementary payments and compensation payments from and after that date. Finally, the bill also applies to disability support pension youth customers the definition of independence which currently applies to youth allowance customers. As a result, a small number of customers will be entitled to a higher rate of disability support pension payments.
Senator Collins, you might have had a rush from the chamber, but my officers are having an even longer rush from Tuggeranong. I send greetings to them because I think they are listening to these proceedings on the radio in the car on their way in. With regard to the sale of someone's home and that not being assessed in the assets for a 12-month period, I am advised that we have been doing that with legislative authority. What we are doing is clarifying what has always been the intention of the legislation. We are not changing policy.
Let me take this opportunity to say that, by regulation, just after Christmas I extended that period for the money from the sale of a home to be assessed to two years for those people receiving a benefit whose homes had been destroyed during the Canberra fires. Because of the nature of Canberra and where it is—and because of the number of homes that were destroyed—there were some considerable delays in homes being reconstructed. We thought it would reduce the hardship of families who were in receipt of a benefit if we were to extend that. That was done by regulation—the minister has the authority to extend that by regulation in those sorts of circumstances. As I said, Senator Collins, I am advised that we have been doing it with legislative authority. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-10,"—I move Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet 4128: 
(1)	Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 4), before item 1, insert:
1A After section 2
Insert:
2A Objects
		The objects of this Act are to ensure that:
	(a)	all eligible persons have fair and equal access to medical benefits; and
	(b)	all eligible persons are able to claim Medicare benefits for professional services listed in the Medical Benefits Schedule; and
	(c)	the Medicare benefits for claimable professional services are based on the clinically relevant service provided for an eligible person, regardless of whether that person is a concessional beneficiary.
This amendment introduces an objects clause into the bill. The proposed new clause states that the object of the act is to ensure that all eligible persons have fair and equal access to medical benefits and are able to claim medical benefits for professional services listed in the medical benefits schedule. It also makes another object of the act to ensure that Medicare benefits for claimable professional services are based on a clinically relevant service being provided for an eligible person, regardless of whether that person is a concessional beneficiary or not. So this amendment would prohibit the government in future making the kind of regulation that we saw it make late last year to pay a higher medical benefit scheduled fee for the same service to some groups of people and not to other groups of people. The Greens strongly opposed the regulation to increase the rebate for bulk-billing by $5 for some patients and not for other patients which was made in December before parliament rose at the end of last year.
The parliament was unable to disallow that regulation before it took effect in February this year. The Greens moved to disallow the regulation, but the Senate did not support our move. We opposed that regulation because it marked the end of Medicare as a truly universal public health insurance scheme—something that the bill we are debating also does. Instead of using health need as the basis for determining the allocation of resources, the regulation introduced the concept of welfare status as the determinant for access to resources—that is, it said that some groups of people that the government classed as needy should be given particular resources and that others should not. What it did was say that a group of people the government deems to be needy should be bulk-billed and everyone else should forget it.
Never mind the fact that in that group of people the government deemed to be needy were self-funded retirees earning up to $50,000 a year as individuals or $80,000 a year as couples. The regulation broke down any sense of universality in our Medicare system. The government was saying: `Only these people need to the bulk-billed. Everyone else does not need to be bulk billed.' That was the direction it was giving to doctors in that regulation that was made at the end of last year.
The government wants Australians to believe that bulk-billing is not important. Indeed, its Medicare package that we are debating here today will do nothing to reverse the dramatic fall in the bulk-billing rate, which is now below 30 per cent in some parts of the country. The Greens and others know that bulk-billing is important. It is extremely important that cost not be a barrier when somebody needs to see a doctor, that a mother of a young child with a chronic illness is not prevented from being able to visit the doctor because of financial barriers being put in the way. It means that people do not have to make decisions about whether they buy the groceries or pay the rent or the electricity or gas bills or whether they take their sick child to the doctor. 
It is true that some Australians would feel little financial pain by paying growing fees for seeing a doctor, but we are all better off when we fund our health system collectively according to our capacity to pay and when we all have a stake in making sure that the health system is strong, well resourced and able to meet the demands on it. That is why the Greens support bulk-billing for all Australians. The government's focus on bulk-billing as a welfare measure, and a threadbare safety net for everyone else, is full of problems—and later in the debate we will go into the detail about the problems with the government's safety net. Suffice to say, this amendment by the Greens, inserting into the act an objects clause which ensures that medical services are provided on the basis of clinical need rather than on any other determination made by the government, is an important object to have in the act if we are to support a universal public health care system. It will be interesting to see which senators believe we should have a universal public health care system.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-03-10,"—We have been kept waiting around four weeks as the government sought to negotiate a deal on its health package and to bring amendments before this chamber. I understand the political imperatives that drive that but I would have thought, given that we deferred the debate because the government first asked us to consider it when we had not actually seen the amendments, that it would be reasonable we adjourn it until we at least have been extended the courtesy of being provided with the amendments—which, I am happy to say, I have received in the last few minutes. 
I also thought that the government would take the opportunity to inform Senate what it sought to do in terms of this package. From reading the minister's press release I understand that there have been quite substantial changes to the package and quite a substantial change in the funding arrangements. While this bill only deals with part of the package, I would have thought it a courtesy and good process for us to have some sort of introduction to that subject. It seems as though we are going to go on in this false world of the Senate immune to anything that is happening. I understood that Senator Ian Campbell was handling the matter—and he has not seen fit to join us again. Senator Patterson is here. I know she knows a lot about it but I suspect that she has not caught up with the latest deal, given that it has been done in the last little while. It just seems to me that the process is wrong when we are having this debate about amendments in the knowledge that there has been some deal done and it has not been introduced to the Senate. I thought I would raise the concern as to whether the Senate was going to be treated with a bit more respect in terms of this issue. At least then we could get on and deal in a real way with what apparently is not the bill before us but a revised bill that the government has, it seems, gained the support of other senators for.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-03-10,"—Senator Lees will obviously move her amendment in turn if that reflects some arrangement she has reached. But, as I understand it, the government have a very different view about this bill from when they introduced it and when they made their arguments in support of it. I understand it is a completely different package in many respects from that which was announced. It is very different from the amended package, in fact. But I am happy to proceed, if that is the way the government intends to treat the Senate. It is not Senator Lees's fault. If she is sponsoring an amendment, we will deal with that when we get to it. But it is a pretty shoddy way to treat the Senate and I think it is a pretty unreal situation. We are all sitting here pretending that the world has not changed when, as I understand it, the earth has moved for four Independent senators and they have had a change of heart. Anyway, we will go on as it is. I just thought it would be appropriate for the government to make some sort of statement but, if they are not prepared to, we will press on.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-03-10,"—I rise to endorse the remarks of Senator Evans. I think the way this is being conducted is an outrage. Senator Lightfoot throws his head back and laughs.
—You said it with such a straight face.
—It is an outrage. Let us just recap about what has happened here. The government came forward with a package last year when Senator Patterson was the Minister for Health and Ageing.
—Senator Lightfoot, maybe you should listen and learn. That package was considered by the Senate Select Committee on Medicare. I note that Senator Lees was a member of that committee, a very active participant in it, and gave a lot of consideration to what was in the so-called Medicare package at the time. I note that none of the other Independent senators participated in the inquiry.
—It was a select committee.
—That is true, it was a select committee, but I do not recall them ever having a lot to say about it, taking much interest in it. I am not saying that they are not interested in the issue, but there is very little on the record from other Independent senators about this—but there is certainly from Senator Lees. What happened was that the first report of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare came down in October last year. It was so persuasive to this government that its package, as it then was, was inadequate, wrongly directed and cumbersome and needed to be taken back to the drawing board, and that is what the government did. It scrapped it. The minister, who is the minister on duty at the moment, Senator Patterson, was moved to a different portfolio and we ended up with a new Minister for Health and Ageing and a second package called MedicarePlus.
That package was the subject of further inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on Medicare, which reported in February, and the overwhelming view of the members of that committee, other than the government members, was that the package was substantially inadequate and should be rejected. It is a complex issue. There is a range of issues that were considered by that committee, such as bulk-billing rates, safety nets, whether or not allied services should be covered under Medicare, what should happen in respect of dental care and so on. 
It was a very considered report. We have been waiting since February for this government to come forward with its position. It said that it insisted upon the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003 being passed in its then form, but it has been negotiating with the Independents to bring about some means whereby it can get a package through the parliament. The announcement has finally been made today—just a couple of hours ago—that there is an agreement, the bill has been brought back on and we are now expected to debate these amendments, as Senator Evans said, when they have literally been dropped on us at the last minute. It is inappropriate and it is discourteous, but it also fails to treat the issue seriously.
This is not simply a matter—and we will come to the debate in committee about the amendments that are going to be moved by Senator Lees—that can be resolved by tinkering with the thresholds that are provided for in the government's package. It appears agreement has been reached between the government and the Independents to change those threshold figures, to reduce them. That is clearly what the amendments that Senator Lees is going to move provide for, but I have some serious issues to raise about the whole package.
For instance, we are told that complex dental care is now going to be listed as a procedure that will be covered under Medicare, but we have not been given any real detail about how that is going to apply. And what is the interaction between the new provision where some dental services, as I understand, in complex serious dental cases would be covered by Medicare and the operation of the safety net? The safety net establishes thresholds which focus upon the gap payments between Medicare rebates and the scheduled fee up to a certain amount and then coverage of all out-of-pocket expenses over and above that threshold. But what this system will set up, as I comprehend it—and I will be interested to hear what arrangements have been entered into between the government and the Independents—is that some areas of dental care will be covered by the safety net, because it is proposed that they would be covered by Medicare, but a whole lot of other dental services will not be covered by the safety net. That is just one area of complexity.
There may be a straightforward answer, but I would have thought the responsible thing for the government to do would have been to provide us with the full details of this package, how it is going to work, and also details on these other elements that are clearly not part of this legislation but which are an integral part of this revised so-called MedicarePlus package. I am very concerned that this legislation is just going to be rushed through now, and I do not think it is treating the issue or the Senate with the seriousness that they deserve, given the amount of work that has been done by the Senate Select Committee on Medicare up to this point in time.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-03-10,"—This gives me the opportunity to say that Labor has dealt itself out of the game. It dealt itself out of the game when the first package came in. It dealt itself out right along the way. Every time this government puts up something to assist people, Labor opposes it. Ms Gillard was out there saying, `The safety net doesn't help enough people.' There was no safety net before. We had struggling families who paid for out-of-pocket out of hospital expenses themselves, and all Ms Gillard could say was: `This doesn't help enough people.' Nothing was done before for people who had high out-of-pocket out of hospital expenses. 
The government has agreed, with senators Harradine, Harris, Lees and Murphy, to further improve MedicarePlus. Australians will have a better health system, thanks to senators' insightful persistence. Senator Evans wants this, so I am going to tell him what we are doing. The MedicarePlus safety net is an important structural improvement to the Medicare system to help people cope with the costs of out of hospital procedures such as MRIs, CT scans, ultrasounds and specialist visits, which have never been widely bulk-billed. Under Labor nobody cared that some families with one or two people—sometimes only one person in the family—with quite a serious illness were facing quite high out-of-pocket expenses and were at the risk of not being able to pay their bills.
The Independents and minor party senators will move an amendment to the MedicarePlus safety net legislation to reduce the annual threshold to $300 for Commonwealth concession card holders and family tax beneficiaries and $700 for others. The new safety net will be available to everyone and will benefit about 450,000 individuals and families in any one year. For the people in the safety net, the rebate will be the standard rebate plus 80 per cent of any gap between the rebate and the charged fee. For instance, if someone in the safety net is charged $40 for a 15-minute GP consultation, the rebate will be $37—$25 plus 80 per cent of the $15 gap—rather than the standard $25. The new safety net benefits will be claimable from the day after the legislation receives royal assent, and the benefits will be automatic once people have registered and passed the threshold. The extended MedicarePlus safety net will cost an additional $174 million to 1 July 2007.
The government will introduce a $7.50 incentive for bulk-billed GP consultations for concession card holders and children under 16 in non-metropolitan areas in RRMAs 3-7 and Tasmania. This increased bulk-billing incentive, targeted to areas where bulk-billing rates of generally low, will replace the earlier $5 initiative in these areas and will be payable from 1 May. When we talk about Tasmania, I am reminded of the 257 extra places that were part of these changes to Medicare, a significant number of which—20 of them—went to the medical school in Tasmania which had only 60 students. Now I think it has a chance of being a viable medical school with 80 students. We need to look at this whole package to see that there has been a significant change in actually making sure that we not only deliver better Medicare but also make doctors more accessible. I am delighted with and look forward to seeing the changes that will occur to the Tasmanian medical school as a result of that significant input by increasing the places from 60 to, I think, 80 or 81.
Going back to bulk-billing, the additional non-metropolitan bulk-billing incentive will cost $131 million to 1 July 2007. The government will introduce a new MBS item for the services of allied health professionals such as psychologists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, dieticians and chiropractors, delivered for and on behalf of GPs under a multidisciplinary care plan. This should mean less prescription medicine and a more holistic primary health care system. Under the enhanced primary care program, introduced in 1999, GPs can involve at least two allied health professionals in developing a multidisciplinary care plan for people with chronic and complex health conditions. The new item will cover up to five allied health professional consultations, at $80 initially and $35 subsequently, delivered under a health care plan. 
Some chronic and complex conditions such as heart disease and diabetes can benefit from dental treatment. Where dental problems are significantly exacerbating chronic medical conditions treated under a multidisciplinary care plan, a further `for and on behalf of' MBS item will be available for up to three dental consultations at $220 for the program of the treatment. This is a health care measure not a dental care scheme and will only be available where dental treatment is required to treat a chronic medical condition. It is estimated that GPs will prepare 150,000 care plans a year involving 680,000 allied health consultations. In addition, dental services will be provided for up to 23,000 people under the multidisciplinary care plans. These allied health measures will cost $121 million to 1 July 2007.
The government will fund an additional 12 medical school places a year at James Cook University at a cost of $1.1 million to 1 July 2007. These places will provide James Cook University with a permanent increase in medical student numbers to help meet the needs of Queensland regional and rural communities.
In coordination with state governments, the government will commence statewide rollouts of HealthConnect integrated medical records system in Tasmania and South Australia from 1 July. Tasmania has the best broadband access and South Australia already has an integrated hospital information network. An integrated health records system should mean better patient care through fewer medical mistakes, and lower ultimate costs through less duplication. The government will spend $80 million on HealthConnect to 1 July 2007, which is already in the forward estimates.
The government will extend GP work force programs and the rural locum scheme to areas of consideration which are rural in character but are in the same statistical local area as a large town. This cost will be met out of existing program allocations. New MedicarePlus spending is $427.5 million, bringing the total cost of MedicarePlus to $2.85 million. The Howard government will invest what is needed to protect and strengthen the Medicare system.

Sadly, we are not all able to tap into www.health.gov.au and check out some of the questions that we might find answers to there, so this looks like as good an opportunity as any to raise those. I will start with a question about the costing figures. They are expressed in three-year terms. Is it a three-year program? Why is it three, not four?

If I were to say that it is exactly the same I think that would be wrong because it would have an inflationary effect in it. Why it is three years is that the MedicarePlus package is three years, so it fits with that. The budget papers will then give you the extension of all of MedicarePlus into the fourth year.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-03-10,"—Labor has focused only on gross bulk-billing rates of 80 per cent and does not care where those bulk-billing rates are. Apparently Tasmania has a very low overall bulk-billing rate. As I have said over and over again, one of the things is to try to ensure that you get equity into this system in the sense that people in similar circumstances have a greater opportunity of being able to visit a bulk-billing doctor.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-03-10,"—The minister referred to equity. That is why I am asking: why don't you treat families and children equitably? You have just said that you are going to introduce special conditions for children in Tasmania, an increased rebate. Why won't you do the same for families in Bendigo and Ballarat, which have bulk-billing rates lower than Tasmania and certainly lower than the major cities in Tasmania? You are talking about equity. There is clearly no equity in that proposition.

You might ask what is the difference between the children who live in Richmond or the children who live in Launceston and the children who live in poorer areas like Gagebrook. We felt that it was only proper that the $7.50 be paid totally for those people who are able to claim it in that bracket. It has been the view of governments, not only this government but also the previous government, to treat Tasmania as a whole, as a region. If it is good enough for the government in a number of areas it is good enough for them here. For example, the government's own document Stronger regions, a stronger Australia states that regional Australia is the Australia outside our major capital cities. I am sure Hobart will not mind not being called a major capital city if it is able to participate in the $7.50 instead of the $5.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-10,"—I thank the minister for reading to the Senate the content of the media release put out just this afternoon by Tony Abbott, the Minister for Health and Ageing, because that is what we have here in the chamber in terms of the position of the government. We have the minister's media release having been read out by the minister who happens to be here at the moment. We do not have the minister who is dealing with this piece of legislation, unless that changes. We are quite happy to have Senator Patterson dealing with this legislation. She has been the health minister before and can do all of this work. But we are just getting an indication of what commitment the government has to coming in here and selling its new package. We had the minister who happened to have been in here for the previous bill stand up and read out the media release from the health minister to make the announcement: `This is where we are going with public health. This is what we have decided.'
Children in Tasmania and some decisions about university places at James Cook University—this is the government's future planning for public health in this country. This is the government's commitment, saying: `We no longer want Medicare to be a universal public health care system. We are quite happy if Medicare, whittled down, becomes a safety net with holes all through it for those people whom the government deems to be needy. No worries about the fact that that includes self-funded retirees earning up to $80,000 or $50,000, depending on whether they are a couple. This is our vision for the future of public health care in this country. Do not worry about universality. Let us just say we brought in that regulation last year. A couple of people can get bulk-billed. For people who fall into this category, we encourage doctors to bulk-bill. For everyone else, here is a safety net with a whole lot of holes in it and a couple of extra bits thrown in for kids in Tasmania and medical students at JCU.' That is the government's vision for public health care in this country.
That is not good enough. For the money this government is putting into the additional amendments they have negotiated today—the $427.5 million—they could have increased the GP rebate by $5 for all Australians so that all Australians would have had that increase in bulk-billing that the government proposed at the outset with their revised Medicare package. `We want to increase bulk-billing. Let's give GPs $5 extra in the rebate.' That is the proposition the government put forward. For $400 million they could have increased that GP rebate for all Australians and said to all Australians: `We want to do something to increase bulk-billing for all of you. It's not going to be whole thing, but our measure is universality. Let's have a public health care system that covers, across the board, every Australian and treats them the same. That is the kind of public health care system we want.' 
That is what we could have got for less money than is being put forward by this deal between the government and the Independents. We could have had universality. But no, that is not the path that this government decided to take. This government decided to throw more money than that at four senators who were then prepared to accept a system that had extra incentives for children in Tasmania, a system that had extra places for medical students at James Cook University and a system that entrenches Medicare becoming a welfare measure, a safety net. There is no universality in the future vision of public health care in this package being brought to the Senate by the government and the Independents.
This is a safety net full of holes. This is a safety net that ensures that a working couple without children earning half as much as a self-funded retiree, who is treated differently in the safety net, will not have access to the safety net the government is proposing. This is a safety net that ensures that a couple with three children under 18 earning nearly $100,000 will qualify for the government's safety net but an individual working full-time earning $35,000—less than average weekly earnings—with a chronic medical condition will not qualify for the same safety net. They will have to pay another $400 before they get anything back from the government. It is a safety net that ensures that the 14,000 Australians living with HIV infection who are struggling to meet medical and pharmaceutical costs will not qualify for the lower safety net. No, they will have to spend the extra $400 before they get anything back from the government. This is the government's vision for public health care—that we should have a safety net for some people the government deems to be needy. That is their vision for Medicare. That is their vision for public health in this country.
That is not good enough, and the Greens will not be supporting this package put forward by the government. We believe in a universal public health care system—something that we could have had for less money than is being thrown at four senators to get them to support this package. We could have had that universal nature, encouraging all doctors to bulk-bill all Australians by putting an extra $5 into the GP rebate across the board, for less money than we are seeing here today in this package. It is not acceptable, it is not good enough and it is not a vision for public health care in this country. Throwing a bit of money at people who will agree to your deal is not the way to plan the future of the public health care system in this country. It is not acceptable.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-03-10,"—Can I just make the point to Senator Nettle-—and I am sure she is well aware of this—that we simply could not have had universality, because this government is absolutely determined not to have it.
—So why are you supporting it?
—Because, Senator Nettle, it has already gone through this chamber—the $5 you fuss about has been passed. Yes, the Greens opposed it. I am happy to make that point again: the Greens opposed it. But everybody else—the Labor Party, we, the Democrats—supported it. That is where we are at. We could have walked away from this package, which would have meant no revised safety net. That is fine. Obviously that would suit the Labor Party, because they could go to the election with Medicare in a greater mess than it is now as things deteriorate further, with specialists in particular continuing to charge large out-of-pocket expenses. I can talk about the safety net later when we move the amendments, but they are the people who are contributing to the safety net in that they are the ones charging Australians well above the schedule fees and rarely, if ever, bulk-billing in some cases. 
In response to Senator Nettle, it is very clear—because we have already passed the regulations through this chamber, last year—that we were not going to get universality. So the question for me was: how can we improve the health system? We actually have an opportunity to make a difference. We have an opportunity—and for me this was particularly important in this package—to put in allied health. Those very people that Senator Nettle is so concerned about who have HIV or AIDS can now access allied health professionals, because they are the ones that will fit the chronic health care plans—the definition being that you have an illness lasting more than six months. They can now access podiatry, physiotherapy, chiropractic services, dieticians and dentists if their doctor believes that that is an important part of their care plan.
Yes, Senator Nettle, we could have walked away from all of that, but we actually chose to make a difference. We could have also walked away from lowering the safety net. At $300 now we let some 12 million families in. But no, we chose to keep working with the government over what were quite stressful weeks to get the best possible outcome for the sickest members of this community. We could probably have chosen to set the bulk-billing targets up around 80 per cent for similar amounts of money. So what? All that was going to do, as we saw in the information from the department, was advantage those people that are already bulk-billed in the big capital cities with the bulk-billing clinics.
If you look at the information, Senator Nettle, and you look at where people are not being bulk-billed, it is in RRMAs 3, 4, 5 and 6. They are the areas we had to target if we actually wanted to make a difference in bulk-billing rates. We cannot move that through this place. The Senate has no power to get those regulations through; it is the government that is going to have to do that. We have taken a signed letter from the minister-. We are trusting the minister that that will be done with due haste so that we will be able to expand out and support further those doctors who are struggling in rural practice. Hopefully they will respond by bulk-billing vast numbers of their patients who have health care cards and the children who at the moment they are not bulk-billing.
If the Labor Party-, as I hope they do, come into the election campaign and say, `Just with a stroke of a pen, if we get into government, we're moving a regulation so that everybody gets bulk-billed at $7.50'-—or whatever they choose-—I am more than happy to support it. But we are taking the bird in the hand rather than sitting around waiting and seeing whether, some time down the track, somebody puts a better offer on the table.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-03-10,"—I want to clarify a point for, I think, Senator Evans. There are two initiatives here to do with RRMAs. One is about bulk-billing incentives. This initiative increases the bulk-billing incentive from $5 to $7.50 for services provided in areas classified as rural, remote and metropolitan areas-—RRMAs—3 to 7 in the whole of Tasmania where those services are bulk-billed and delivered to concession card holders and children under 16 years of age. 
The other initiative refers to RRMAs 4-7. I think I am going to send one of my former staff a copy of this with a gold signature on it because she was one of the ones who dealt with some of the difficult issues that related to incentives, or payments, for doctors in rural and remote RRMA classifications. GPs in rural areas where SLA boundaries have resulted in a lower RRMA classification are currently ineligible for incentives that are available to doctors in areas classified as rural or remote—that is, programs limited to RRMAs 4-7. As we looked through those it was obvious to me that there were some quite difficult situations to explain where geographically you fell in one RRMA but, because there was a bridge down the road and a little inlet, you did not end up in that category. Some of them were very difficult to argue. Areas where this seems to be the case will be considered for designation as areas of consideration to enable them to become eligible for RRMAs 4-7 programs.
I welcome that initiative. I think it is a tremendous initiative to deal with some of the very strange anomalies that occur when you have arbitrary lines drawn which mainly fit the situation but whereby there are examples which anybody who uses logic realises just do not fit. Emma Handyside, who used to work in my office and dealt with these sometimes, was always aware that there were some anomalies because of the lines not necessarily fitting geographically in a sensible and logical way.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2004-03-10,"—I would like to make some broad comments on some of the rather emotive statements that have been made in the chamber in relation to the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare) Bill 2003, such as `the safety nets are full of holes'. If that is the case then we need to have a look at where the structure of safety nets started. They were brought in by the Labor Party when it initially developed Medicare. They have been there from the start.
One of the things incumbent on each senator in this place is to ensure that the positive, proactive benefits that are achieved by this chamber are conveyed to the people that we represent. To do that, we need to have a brief look at the level of the previous safety net, which was $328.80 right across the board. We then need to have a look at what a person needed to do to get to that safety net. The safety net as it currently stands—and will until this legislation is passed—only accrues the difference between the schedule fee and 130 per cent of that figure. If we look at an MRI, for example, the average out-of-pocket cost for an Australian is in the vicinity of $75. Under the old safety net, only $11 and a few odd cents actually accrued to that safety net of $328.
What is proposed with the new program is that, on average, that entire $75 accrues to the $300 level if the person has a concession card or $700 if they are an individual not eligible for the $300 safety net level. There is a huge difference. The real out-of-pocket amount that a person currently needs to pay to get to the $328 safety net is far greater than it will be when this legislation is passed, because the entire out-of-pocket expenses accrue to that $300. We have a responsibility to ensure that the people we represent are aware of that. We also have a responsibility to ensure that the people we represent clearly understand that, as Senator Lees has indicated, there are now facilities to access allied health services that have not been there previously. 
If we look at a person who has diabetes, one of the biggest dangers for that person is poor lower limb circulation, which ultimately and very sadly could result in them having to have a limb amputation. The introduction of podiatrists, who would be able to assess that person on a regular basis, will now, in lots of cases, remove the necessity for that amputation because they will be monitoring that person's condition. These are the issues that each one of us has a responsibility to ensure people clearly understand.
If we look at elderly people with incontinence, we find it is proven without doubt that in 70 per cent of cases a physiotherapist can reverse incontinence by a program of seven courses of physiotherapy, teaching that person muscle control. That leads to a far better quality of life for that person and costs well under $1,000 to achieve. If that person only had the option of surgery to rectify that problem, the cost to the Australian population would be well over $4,000. Again, we have a situation where the person's quality of life is improved and there is a considerable saving to the government. These are the issues that we need to focus on. It is one thing to come in here and say that this is a bad policy. That may be your political point of view but the point I am making is that it is incumbent on every senator in this place to ensure that the people they represent know what the benefits are.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-10,"—I would like to return to the earlier line of questioning to do with the costings of this safety net measure. As senators will know, the Democrats had amendments which would have set the threshold at a single level of $500. You might ask why we did that when obviously $300 would be preferable. But, at the time we raised questions about the cost of the $300 and $700 model, we were told that it would be $454 million over four years. Whilst I acknowledge that there will be a lot of low-income people who will benefit from this measure, the fact that you have two thresholds does offend against the universality of Medicare, and that is another good reason for not doing it.
But, to come back to my first question, it was my understanding that the cost was over four years. I note that this press release from the minister talks about three years. What is the cost for that final year? It was my understanding that the costs rise pretty dramatically in that fourth year. Can that figure for the final year be confirmed? If $174 million is to be allocated over three years, what is the amount for that final year? If it is not a total figure of $454 million, why is it not and why was that the figure that was previously provided?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,"—I am informed that it is actually $440 million for three years and two months, and the net additional cost is $174 million. There is a slight discrepancy in the figures that were provided to Senator Allison in the early stages of discussions. I think she accurately referred to a figure of $454 million and it has come down to $440 million. The reason for that is that there were some savings and efficiencies in relation to the HIC Online initiative. They were figures that the Department of Finance and Administration came back with. I am advised that they were savings in administrative costs within the Health Insurance Commission, to be accurate. I think you were asking about figures for the final year, and we are still trying to get those. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-10,—It is amazing how quickly we can find savings in administration without having done something in the first place! It is extraordinary. Is it possible for me to ask at the same time about the inflationary assumptions that were built in for the $300 and $700 thresholds for GPs and specialists? How will that affect the number of people claiming for each year and for the fourth year? What is the cost the government will pay and how will that increase yearly for the $300 and $700 safety net?,SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,"—I did not understand the second part of the question and the officers certainly did not. The first half of the question related to inflationary assumptions. The assumptions that were made, broadly, were that bulk-billing rates will be maintained and that the gap will be maintained in broad and general terms. There is an issue that I know was raised at the press conference that the minister and some senators attended. It may not be what Senator Allison was asking about but I think it is a serious issue, so I will address it. It is the question of whether the new thresholds would encourage doctors to raise their fees. There has been a concern that doctors may know when people are over the thresholds and there may be an increase in the fee. The answer to that is that the support is for 80 per cent of the schedule fee, so there will still be a price there for the patient, so there will still be public pressure and market pressure to ensure that fee increases do not occur.
The structure of the MedicarePlus safety net has not changed as compared with the safety net that has been before the two Senate inquiries. It still requires the threshold to be reached. The doctor will not know when that threshold has been reached. It makes it difficult for doctors, therefore, to know when that situation occurs. The second report of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare said:
... the Committee finds no probable reason why practitioners would deliberately raise fees if and when they know a particular patient to be beyond the relevant threshold.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-10,"—Minister, I ask you to move aside from the behavioural question of safety nets and when people will reach them. I really asked about the assumptions behind the figures. Currently for GPs the average copayment or gap cost is close to $13 per consultation. In these assumptions have you built in just an inflationary increase in that figure or none at all? I am just asking about the assumptions. I am not challenging this or saying this is necessarily inflation. I am just asking what the assumptions are behind those figures.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,"—That is a fair question. There are a number of inflationary questions associated with the package and I have answered the wrong question. The answer to that one is that we are using figures from recent years—basically, the continuation of existing trends. I think that is the only fair measure. It is probably a conservative way to go, and that is what we have done.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-10,—I ask the minister about his previous answer to Senator Allison. He said that the assumption is that bulk-billing will not increase. Is that the assumption for the government's model of the future of public health in this country—Medicare and bulk-billing? Are we basing it on an assumption that there will be no increase in bulk-billing rates? ,SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,—The answer I have given remains accurate. We are making conservative assumptions. We are not jumping to some conclusion about it. We do hope that these measures will see rises in bulk-billing in some areas. That is clearly why the government are putting in some incentives. The $5 payment is already law. It is clearly why some senators have agreed to increase the bulk-billing payments by $7.50 in non-metropolitan areas. We hope that will have an impact but we have not counted on that in our assumptions. I think that is fair. That is the right way to make assumptions. It is a conservative way to estimate.,SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-10,"—To clarify, the assumption is that there will be no increase in bulk-billing. Does that mean that the minister and the government think it is appropriate that some parts of Australia currently have bulk-billing rates as low as 30 per cent and that we are currently at the lowest average rate of bulk-billing that we have seen in approximately 10 years? Is that a situation that the government is comfortable with at the moment?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,"—The senator is now putting words into my mouth. I answered a question about the cut-in rates of $300 and $700 for the safety nets and costings on the safety nets. I thought, and I think I thought correctly, that Senator Allison was talking to me about the inflationary assumptions in those costings. We have put in place a multibillion dollar package to assist in a range of ways to increase bulk-billing in the areas of highest need. We have a range of measures to get more doctors into those areas. We have incentives to increase bulk-billing, particularly in those areas. Senator Harradine made the point today that in Hobart, for example, there is a very low rate of bulk-billing. We have a package of measures to address that. I think the total is $2.8 billion of additional spending to address the issues of access to quality health care in Australia.
Today is in fact a historic day. We have announced that we are bringing in the allied health measures that Senator Lees has sponsored and the measures to bring in the $7.50 bulk-billing incentives in the areas that are defined in the press release. Broadly speaking, I think they are in non-metropolitan areas, with one exception. That shows that the government are committed to giving people much better health care than they are getting at the moment. There is a massive injection of Commonwealth assistance in that area. The only people who could say that we are not fair dinkum about improving people's access to health care and improving Medicare have some ideological perversion. We are underpinning the existing Medicare scheme in a way that needed to be done if it was to continue successfully. We have also added some fantastic new safety nets that will help millions of people across Australia get health care that many of them at the moment cannot afford.
Senator Harris, Senator Lees, Senator Murphy and Senator Harradine at the press conference today, which I attended because I was keen enough to learn about the historic achievements, gave examples of people who were suffering from chronic illnesses who would now get assistance from a physiotherapist, a dentist or a podiatrist—people who needed an integrated health care plan and who needed financial assistance to get it. Otherwise their lives would be shorter and more uncomfortable. I am very proud of being part of a government that has made that commitment and very honoured to be able to work with the Independent senators who have made this a reality. It is just ideologically driven claptrap to say that we do not care about these things. We have made the biggest improvements to health care in Australia. If we can get this passed before 10 to seven tonight we should all be very proud of the achievements here today. We should be able to do it. The only thing that is stopping us is someone's ideological perversions. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2004-03-10,"—I want to speak on a couple of the issues that are being discussed at the moment. One is in respect of the inflationary concern which I think was raised by Senator Allison and Senator Nettle. That was an issue that we discussed with the government at length. One of the problems that still exists for the government, which the government has indicated it will monitor, is that the real inflationary problem lies with specialist services. I trust that it will monitor that if it becomes a problem in terms of workplace measures—that is, in the supply of specialist services—because it is very important. With respect to visits to a normal GP, even if the GP had a long-term patient and was able to monitor the expenditure of that patient over a period of time, it would take a significant number of visits to the GP before they would actually hit the $300 threshold. There are some cost pressures. The inflationary pressures that can be driven by specialist services remain a worry for me.
Can I also say on my coming to a view to support this package that the issue of universality is a concern for me, and that is an issue that will remain after this package has passed in this place. One thing I looked at was whether, if you were to provide for a $5 payment across the board, that would have improved the delivery and the maintenance of and increased bulk-billing. It is hard to see that that would be the case, given that we know there is an average copayment being charged by doctors across the country of $14 or $15. It is hard to see that doctors would say: `Hurrah. We've been offered $5 and we will get rid of $15.' It is even the case that the $5 that has been passed by regulation for concessional groups and children under 16 years old has not increased the rate of bulk-billing. It will not increase the rate of bulk-billing, in my view—even at $7.50. I come from a state that has almost the worst bulk-billing rate in the country. That is why my learned colleague Senator Harradine and I pursued encompassing Tasmania under one classification.
It is important for this country in the long term that the two major parties, the government and the opposition, will be able to bring forward to the public at the general election later this year very significant proposals for the future of the health system of this country. What we were confronted with—at least what I was confronted with—was the question of whether we do something or we do nothing and wait and see. There are a significant number of people who are being affected by circumstances right now. I came to the conclusion that at this point in time it is better to do something, particularly on the allied health side of things, which I have to say we all pursued. I think that will demonstrate, from a health service provision point of view, that it is a very worthwhile exercise to help families.
Sure, I accept that there is some argument about creating a two-tiered system—a welfare system. There might be valid criticism in that. But, as I said, we have an election before the end of this year and it will enable the parties to put their cards on the table in respect of what they see as a long-term future, because $5 is not going to fix universality. It just is not going to fix it. It will take a lot more than that. Most senators would be aware of the various studies and reports that have been done for doctors. The relative value study demonstrated that a GP's fee ought to be around $50 per consultation. Until the $5 payment went in for concession groups and under-16s, you had a $25 or $26 schedule fee and $30 for the rebate, which is clearly inadequate. It is a matter that has to be addressed in the long term. I am a supporter of a universal health system. 
—Well, vote for one then.
—Chris, I will. At some point in time, I will.
—You were elected as a Labor senator, mate. Then you go and ask a Labor government to fix it up in the future! Fair dues. The hypocrisy is really too much.
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—Order!
—Senator Evans, you are entitled to your view about that in terms of where we are at in this debate and the outcomes that can be delivered. Of course, there is an outstanding issue for Tasmania, which I hope the minister will address very shortly. The reality is that $5 is not going to fix this. There are some aspects of the package that are very worth while and will deliver some very beneficial outcomes. I think that has been reflected in some of the commentary today.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-10,"—I agree with Senator Murphy that that $5 increase in the rebate will not fix it, because what you need is a commitment from the government of the day on universal public health care—and this government simply does not have that—so to jump into bed with a government that does not have that commitment to universality is not going to deliver the universality that you are looking for. I had questions previously about the assumptions on bulk-billing rates on which this package was based. Minister Abbott indicated on Lateline last year that the assumption for the package as a whole was that there would be no increase in bulk-billing, so I want to ask the minister whether it continues to be the assumption for the package as a whole that there will be no increase in bulk-billing rates.
I also wish to address some comments that the minister made in relation to this government's commitment to public health when he talked about the additional $427.5 million in this package that is going into safety net measures, and I would not necessarily put that as going into supporting our universal public health system. We will have the opportunity later to talk about the inflationary nature of those safety net measures. This is a government that is spending $2.4 billion just this year on the private health insurance rebate, so if we want to talk about the commitment that this government has to public health care I think we need to put that into context. We are talking here of an additional $475 million when this government spends $2.4 billion on private health insurance rebates—and that is before you add in the premium increases that have just been approved by this government. So when it comes to this—is this government committed to public health care or to the provision of private health care?—I think the $2.4 billion being spent every year on the private health insurance industry gives us a clear indication of where this government's commitments to health care truly lie.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-10,"—I want to go back to the costing of the safety net. I wonder if the minister can clarify the position as to specialists. It was my understanding that over four years the assumption was that the gap for specialists would at least double for a fifth, or 20 per cent, of concessional and ordinary patients with the $300 safety net. Can the minister clarify that? Has that assumption now been changed in the most recent figures or is that still the case? ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,"—Is Senator Allison referring to costings that she was provided during discussions with the government?
—Yes.
—There is no change to those. But I think Senator Murphy has made the very important point that this is obviously a stress. We want to monitor it and we are concerned about it but, equally, the government has been putting in place measures to try to reduce those pressures. One of those is in fact the very bill that we were talking about yesterday, the one to do with the medical indemnity issue, which has been a huge cost driver to specialists' expenses. I think the parliament actually passed that yesterday; that was good to see. So they are pressures and that is an issue that the government is faced with.
Senator Nettle asked a question about bulk-billing. The fact today is as it was when Dr Blewett brought in Medicare in 1984: the then government made it very clear—as I think Senator Evans and others would make the point now—that you cannot force doctors to bulk-bill. So that still remains the policy of both major parties, as I understand it—and it was the policy of Dr Blewett when he brought it in. So bulk-billing ultimately will be determined individually by doctors and who they bulk-bill will be a matter for them and then collectively—across the whole of Australia or electorate by electorate or suburb by suburb—you will end up with a rate that applies to that community. What we have sought to do here, and what the Independent senators have further sought to do, is to provide further incentives for bulk-billing, particularly in those areas of need. The $7.50 rate applies in RRMAs 3 and 7, areas where we would hope and expect that those incentives will see significant increases in bulk-billing. So that is our hope and that is our expectation, but we are not going to go out there and lash the doctors or tie them to a post in the middle of the town square if they do not; you cannot do that. We are hoping that will see increases in bulk-billing rates in those communities and we expect that those new incentives, as a result of today's decisions, will achieve that outcome.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-10,"—Just to clarify this, Minister, you did say you did not believe there was anything inflationary in this package. I make the point that the doubling in the gap for 20 per cent of patients is what is built into this factor, so we need to get it on the record that there is an element, at least with specialists' fees, of inflation that is beyond the trend lines that we have had so far. Minister, I wish to press you on a couple of assumptions about the number of GPs who will continue to bulk-bill at their existing rates or those in the RRMAs that will increase their bulk-billing rate. Can I assume from the answers you gave to Senator Nettle that you do not expect any increase in the bulk-billing rate in RRMAs 3-7?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,—I think Senator Allison may have misheard me. We are actually hopeful that these incentives will lead to increases in these areas. I said we hope that they will lead to increases in these areas.,SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-03-10,"—We all hope there will be increases in bulk-billing, particularly in those electorates that are poorly served by bulk-billing, but my question was: what were your assumptions about an increase or not and on what basis did they come? Presumably you did some talking with doctors in those areas about what $7.50, as opposed to $5 or $17 or some other figure, would do. There must be some rationale behind rewarding doctors with $7.50—or are they just going to put the $7.50 in their pocket and we will see no change? If that is the case, it would appear to be a quite expensive measure for no real gain. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-10,"—It is in the assumptions, to answer Senator Allison's questions. While I am on my feet, could I also—
—What is in the assumptions?
—You said we all hope that bulk-billing rates will go up in what you call electorates and we call RRMAs. You then said, `But was it in the assumptions?' My answer, which I did not have before me before, is that yes, it is in the assumptions. There are assumptions. In relation to the 30 per cent rebate that Senator Nettle referred to in saying that this money shows that we do not care about the public health system, the figures show that the private health fund rebate, or whatever it is technically called, has actually had a significant impact on—
—They show the opposite.
—I will provide the figures to you.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICARE) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2004-03-10,"—I would like to come back to some of the earlier discussions with Senator Nettle and Senator Allison regarding both inflation and bulk-billing rates and increases. As we look at the safety net, the vast bulk of it—the vast bulk of costs that are going to contribute to meeting people's safety net—is from specialists. We are not talking about any measures to get specialists to bulk-bill, unfortunately.
A raft of work force measures is needed. If I can just go off on a slight tangent here, some of those work force measures, I believe, are in this package. Instead of referring people straight to a surgeon for surgical procedures, now there is the opportunity to look at other options, such as physiotherapy, podiatry et cetera. Apparently podiatry can actually save the toes of diabetes patients before they get to the point where they need surgical operations to have amputations, which occurs at the severe end of diabetes. As the government said, they are not factoring a lot of this in. A lot of it really depends on the response of GPs and specialists. It is an extremely difficult issue.
Let me come back to that small part of the safety net—less than 10 per cent—which is contributed to from GP costs—the gaps that GPs are actually charging. I believe the incentive—the $5—is going to hold it only in the cities; I do not really think that we can suggest for a moment that there is going to be any blow-out there from GPs. I think the $5 is holding bulk-billing. I do not know; it will probably be another six months before we know for certain. However, the figures that we were given in the protracted discussions that we have had with the minister and the department show that the $7.50—and perhaps this answers Senator Allison's question as to why we think there may be some increases—for concession card holders and children who are bulk-billed will see an increase in doctors' incomes. Generally, the average amount charged for concession card holders in these rural areas is $7.50 or less—an extra $5. It will make economic sense for doctors to increase bulk-billing at $7.50 in RRMAs 3, 4, 5 and 6. RRMA 7 already has reasonably high bulk-billing rates. It is the hope of those of us who have worked with the government on this that, because $7.50 does make a financial difference to many of these GPs, and $5 really did not, we will see additional levels of bulk-billing in RRMAs 3, 4, 5, 6 and, hopefully, 7. 
But even given all of that, because we are talking about the inflation in the safety net, there is very little impact on the safety net from anything GPs are doing by way of gap fees. It is the extra $50, $80, $100 or $200 elsewhere in the system that is built into the safety net and there is really nothing in this package, other than perhaps those allied health measures, that is going to actually to do what is needed.
It is over to the government now to look at a raft of work force issues, including making sure we have more specialists in areas where there are significant gap problems and more allied health professionals on the ground. We are also going to face significant work force issues for allied health professionals, because often not enough of them are being trained either. There are still a lot of things to be dealt with, but those of us who have worked with the government believe that we have made a contribution to improving access to health services for the sickest members of our community.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-03-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
On behalf of my colleague Senator Aden Ridgeway, who is unable to be here tonight, I rise to speak on the tabling of two reports from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission: the Native title report and the Social justice report. These are the fifth set of reports from the outgoing Social Justice Commissioner, Dr Bill Jonas. I would like to take this opportunity to bring the Senate's attention to the outstanding work of Dr Jonas in the past five years and to wish him well in his future. The reports detail the lack of advancement for Indigenous Australians in the past year, though Dr Jonas does draw on his experience within the position in the past five years. 
It is the 259-page Social justice report that I will focus on tonight. While this report offers glimmers of hope, especially regarding some parts of the COAG trials, it is fundamentally a litany of underachievement on the part of the government and uncertainty for Indigenous peoples. The report now adds weight to findings of the Senate reconciliation inquiry, the Productivity Commission's report into Indigenous disadvantage and the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research report into practical reconciliation that life is getting worse for Indigenous people in Australia. It describes the government's commitment to reconciliation as `malleable'. My colleague Senator Ridgeway today described it as `shifty'. The government created the policy of so-called practical reconciliation in order to focus on improving health, housing and education for Indigenous peoples but, as they still have not developed any way of measuring results or action plans for achieving them, none of this can really be verified.
The report highlights this lack of accountability framework as needing urgent attention if there is to be any measurement of progress. It also highlights the acrimonious debate last November on Senator Ridgeway's private member's bill on reconciliation as a clear illustration of the lack of government engagement with reconciliation. The minister was not present for any of the debate and the government stacked the speakers to avoid a vote on that bill taking place. The Democrats again call on the government to give Dr Jonas the courtesy of responding to his report, as they have not yet responded to the three previous reports.
The position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner was created in 1992 with bipartisan support as a direct response to the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission National Inquiry into Racist Violence. The royal commission and national inquiry both highlighted the necessity for an ongoing independent monitoring mechanism for the human rights situation of Australian Indigenous peoples. At the time, the government explained that the position was created to provide `an annual state of the nation report' and provide `a national and independent perspective on the extent of the disadvantage and the action that needs to be taken'. It is times like this when the need for these important functions is greater than ever, and the Democrats will reject any attempt by the Attorney-General to assimilate the positions of the HREOC specialist commissioners, such as Dr Jonas, into generalist positions.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander   Social Justice Commission</title>,Documents,23,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-03-10,"—I rise to take note also of the Aboriginal and Tourist Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner's Native title report and Social justice report of 2003. I want to place on record again my appreciation of the work that is done by the Social Justice Commissioner. It is the one glimmer of hope that we look forward to each year in terms of being a signpost as to how we are travelling on the road to reconciliation. One can always guarantee that the report is thorough and comprehensive and that it provides a quite analytical, sometimes critical, statement—as it should—about how we are actually progressing when it comes to social justice and Indigenous people. I note that in this year's report there has been much comment about the debates we have had over the previous year and the reports prepared and inquiries conducted, not only by the Senate but also by research bodies in universities and by independent Indigenous academics who have been conducting research in this area. 
I particularly want to comment on what I think it is quite a commendable stance that has been taken by this commissioner in his reference to the Senate's inquiry into progress towards reconciliation. I was a member of the committee that conducted that inquiry. One of the recommendations of that inquiry was that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner actually be required by statute to report publicly on progress towards reconciliation and that the government be required by statute to respond to the reports of the commissioner. In the absence of a government response to the progress towards reconciliation report—and in the absence of being formally required or having a statutory requirement to do so—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner says, consistent with the Senate committee's recommendation on this matter:
This year's report also includes a progress report on reconciliation in chapters 2 and 3.
It is good to see that the commissioner has decided to take on, so to speak, that recommendation of the Senate report even though he is not required to do so under statute or by this government.
I also want to comment on this government's progress towards reconciliation. This report makes a comment that the government has in fact a highly controlled commitment to practical reconciliation. The Social Justice Commissioner says that there is no doubt people are committed to practical reconciliation but that the particular type and degree of commitment provided, particularly by this government, is under serious question. He says that there are concerns about the government's approach which may suggest that there is an absence of commitment to reconciliation. He says that they identify this commitment as being:
 ... to a particular type of reconciliation around which the boundaries are tightly proscribed—
that is, by the government. He also reports that the government's approach has been limited and confined to only what it sees as being relevant by way of reconciliation. He says that it also lacks a real monitoring framework. The report notes that reconciliation boundaries are tightly prescribed and that most Australians actually reject this approach.
This report shows that progress towards addressing Indigenous disadvantage is not good. The government's view is that employment and education have improved. With its use of raw numbers and percentages, the government claims this. But, all too often, what it does not do is compare the movement or improvement in Indigenous figures with non-Indigenous figures. As this report shows, when you do that you see that the gap has not narrowed and that there is still quite a disparity between the progress for non-Indigenous people and the progress for Indigenous people in this country. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander   Social Justice Commission</title>,Documents,23,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2004-03-10,"—Tonight I am going to speak once again about Telstra. I know I have had many occasions to speak about Telstra in the past, but tonight I stand here to accuse Telstra of misleading the Senate. I believe, and advice I have received suggests, that Telstra may have been in contempt of the Senate, and I have tonight written to the President of the Senate requesting that precedence be given to a motion to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee. Under the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, each house of the parliament possesses the power to declare an act to be in contempt and to punish such an act. I am advised that paragraph 12 of resolution 6 of the Senate's Privilege Resolutions, indicating matters which may be treated by the Senate as contempts, provides:
A witness before the Senate or a committee shall not—
inter alia—
give any evidence which the witness knows to be false or misleading in a material particular, or which the witness does not believe on reasonable grounds to be true or substantially true in every material particular.
Previous interpretations of this by the Privileges Committee have made it clear that evidence that leaves a committee with a misleading impression of the fact is misleading evidence within the meaning of this paragraph. The punishments for contempts which either house may apply are set by the 1987 act as fines of $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for corporations, and six months imprisonment for individuals.
To provide some background, on 16 February 2004 I raised with Telstra, in the estimates, the issue of their performance on faults. Mr Bill Scales, Group Managing Director, Regulatory, Corporate and Human Relations, advised me that:
The largest proportion of the faults, I think, over that period are as a result of the weather.
We had quite a lengthy discussion about the amount and quality of the rain received in Brisbane and Melbourne and why there was no way, according to Telstra officials, the network should be expect to cope with such extreme and exceptional weather conditions. Mr Anthony Rix, Head of Service Advantage, went on to tell the committee:
The claim that faults rise due to network neglect and the decline in staff numbers is a myth ...
Now today we have the confidential Telstra document, obtained by the shadow minister, Mr Lindsay Tanner, which says: 
Fault rate growth appears to be due to general network deterioration rather than a specific exceptional cause.
The answers given to me in estimates and the information in this Telstra memorandum, or documentation, are clearly in conflict. If the statement in the memorandum is true, the answers were clearly untrue. Further, the leaked memo says:
The current accelerating fault rate can be attributed to a reduced rehabilitation activity in the recent past coupled with an intense focus on providing quick fault restoration driven by performance imperatives and OPEX budget constraints.
That is rather garbled jargon, but I take it to mean that the increasing fault rate is because Telstra has not fixed the problems properly in the past and that cuts in staff have resulted in only quick fixes being applied. What this leaked memo to Mr Lindsay Tanner has shown the Labor Party is something that we have been alleging for years and years with respect to the state of the Telstra network.
Last October, shadow minister Lindsay Tanner, the Tasmanian state member for Denison, Graeme Sturges, the Communications Division of the CEPU and I exposed once and for all the appalling state of disrepair of the Telstra fixed line network in Tasmania alone. We showed the media graphic photographs of cables wrapped in plastic bags and held together with tape and of cables lying exposed in puddles, in uncovered pits and literally rotting in the ground. This is the dispiriting environment in which those remaining technical workers are having to operate, with insufficient time and resources to do the job they would like to be able to do and, having watched their colleagues put out of work, fearful of speaking out. To add insult to injury, it is these workers who, when doing the best they can, often bear the brunt of the public's dissatisfaction with Telstra's performance—to the point where we have seen some workers assaulted.
For as long as the government have been attempting to sell off Telstra, they have been trotting out the platitude that they will not do so until Telstra's services are up to scratch. Despite even the government's appointee, Dick Estens, admitting during the Telstra sale hearings that regional services were still not up to scratch, the government brought on the sale bill which, as we all know, was defeated in the Senate—although due to come back. People living in rural and regional Australia know that Telstra services are not good enough, those living in metropolitan areas know that their services are not good enough and Labor knows that their services are not good enough. Services are not good enough because, in an attempt to make Telstra more attractive for privatisation, capital expenditure funding has been slashed, as have staffing levels. Those who have lost their jobs, as I said before, have been the hard-working technicians—in many cases with decades of experience—whose job it was to keep the network in good repair.
But can anyone get Telstra or the government to admit that there are problems with the network? Can anyone get Telstra or the government to admit that capital expenditure cuts are to blame for the substandard state of the network? No way, Mr Deputy President. They refuse. Telstra and the government have consistently denied that there is a problem. Telstra consistently denies that there is any trend suggesting an increase in fault figures. Telstra is backed up in this by what I would suggest is a fairly toothless regulator—that is, the Australian Communications Authority. It is a regulator that admitted to me under questioning last October that its published figures on Telstra's faults were in fact misleading. It is a regulator that reports to the same minister who has the responsibility for those it is regulating. 
And now we have evidence today that Telstra also has been misleading—misleading the Senate through the Senate estimates processes and misleading the Australian people, therefore, through parliament. This is an appalling turn of events. If there was anyone left who believed that there was a case for selling Telstra, today's events should convince them otherwise. Liberal senators from my home state of Tasmania in particular but Liberal senators in general everywhere who sat silently and voted with the government should hang their heads in shame. The Nationals stand condemned for selling out rural and regional Australia.
The government must abandon once and for all its plans to sell Telstra and, instead, use its position as the majority shareholder to hold Telstra accountable and ensure that service standards are returned to an acceptable level. One of the most important things that would be lost if Telstra were to be sold is the capacity to scrutinise its activities. If Telstra were in private hands today, there is no way that this information would be known to the public of Australia; there is no way that we, the Senate, would know that Telstra had in fact misled us and therefore the people of Australia. That argument alone, I believe, is persuasive enough for Telstra not to be sold. In any event, I have now referred this matter to the Privileges Committee and, together with all senators, I await the results of that inquiry or the activities of that committee with interest.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Adjournment,24,1
