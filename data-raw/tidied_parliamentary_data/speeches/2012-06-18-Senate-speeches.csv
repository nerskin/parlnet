SHIPPING REFORM (TAX INCENTIVES) ACT 2012


The tax reforms are a major component of the government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy legislative reforms to revitalise the Australian shipping industry.  


The purpose of the government's tax reforms is to encourage and support capital investment.


Changes made in 1996 by the previous government have meant a lack of investment in Australia's fleet.


A consequence of this lack of investment, in addition to the slow decline in the number of registered vessels, is that our ships are getting older.


The average age of the Australian fleet now sits at almost 20 years which is around eight years older than those in the world fleet.


Ironically, this imbalance exists despite Australia being a country that prides itself on the safety and environmental outcomes of our shipping. 


In addition to being a brake on improving the productivity of our domestic shipping industry; newer vessels are safer, more energy efficient and better meet the needs of modern shipping.


Encouraging new investment is critical if we are to revitalise the industry. 


The tax reforms I am introducing today provide a platform for this investment.


The tax reforms comprise two bills:


This bill which provides the first step for companies seeking to access the various taxation concessions. 


The Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Bill 2012, which will give effect to the five tax concessions.   


This bill provides for the issue of certificates after the end of the financial year to companies who meet the requirements of the tax concession regime. 


It also provides companies applying for these concessions for the first time the opportunity to obtain a 'notice' during the first year of entry. 


This will give companies a degree of certainty that their proposed arrangements will meet the requirements of the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill 2012.


Additional requirements will apply to companies accessing the income tax exemption. 


Companies will need to demonstrate that they have a substantial proportion of commercial, technical or strategic operations as well as crew management based in Australia. 


Companies will also be required to comply with a mandatory training requirement. 


The details of this training requirement, which are currently being finalised by the Maritime Workforce Development Forum, will be contained in regulations. 


These provisions are aimed at ensuring beneficiaries of this best-in-class tax concessions have a tangible connection to Australia and are committed to building the local maritime industry. 


The bill also provides the power to collect and collate data in relation to these reforms. 


Powers to review decision are also provided for. 


SHIPPING REGISTRATION AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING REGISTER) BILL 2012


Australia's burgeoning commodity trade provides us with a once in a generation opportunity to become part of the international shipping trade. 


This bill, the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill 2012, will provide the vehicle to achieve this. 


Currently, we have only four Australian flagged vessels participating solely in the international trade. 


We need to move up the value chain – not only do we want to mine the iron ore for the world; we should be transporting it to the world as well. 


Over the last 20 years, international registers have been embraced by many advanced countries, which, like Australia, have seen a large portion of their fleet register off shore. 


International registers offer some of the benefits of open registers, such as the ability to use crew of different nationalities, while ensuring that the ship owner maintains a strong link to the country of registration.  


These are not flags of convenience. 


All companies with vessels on the international register will need to demonstrate strong links to Australia, ensuring that our maritime safety regulator, Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has the regulatory reach to ensure compliance with our high safety, environmental and occupational health and safety standards. 


Consistent with this, the primary objectives of this reform are to:


facilitate Australian participation in international trade;


provide an internationally competitive register to facilitate the long term growth of the Australian shipping industry; and


promote the enhancement and viability of the Australian maritime skills base and the Australian shipping industry.


The bill establishes two shipping registers—the general and international registers.  


Unlike the general register, AMSA will have the discretion to register a vessel on the international register and will have the power to cancel registration. 


The bill sets out a range of matters that the registrar may have regard to when making a decision to register a vessel. 


This decision is reviewable. 


This discretion is important to ensure that we maintain a quality flag. 


The crewing and labour provisions are a key element of this bill and go to the core of its competitiveness. 


Before I outline these provisions, I would like to thank those in the labour movement who have worked with us on these provisions. 


This reform package is not pro-union, it is not pro-business; it is pro-Australian.


Both employers and unions alike have worked constructively with the government to ensure that these reforms are world's best practice and offer the industry the best chance to compete on a level playing field with international shipping.




Mixed Crewing



The bill provides for mixed crews on Australian international register vessels. 


However, international register vessels will be required to employ a minimum of two Australian crew members; preferably the master and the chief engineer. 


One of the benefits of mixed crewing will be the employment opportunities for seafarers in the Pacific region and I know that the MUA is working hard on these regional partnerships. 




Employment Conditions



To ensure that the international register is competitive, crews will be employed on international terms and conditions while engaged in international trading. 


These employment conditions are in accordance with the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC). 


Minimum wages and a number of conditions are set out in the bill. 


Unless specifically amended in this bill, the provisions of chapter 2 in the Navigation Act 1912 will also apply to these seafarers. 


This creates a safety net.  


The bill provides for collective agreements to be negotiated through a seafarers' bargaining unit (SBU). 


A collective agreement agreed with the SBU will be required for registration in the international register. 


The bill also ensures that seafarers who suffer long term injury or death are adequately compensated. 


The bill requires that ship owners hold insurance cover that provides for the level of compensation set out in the International Transport Workers' Federation Uniform Total Crew Cost Collective Agreement. 


AMSA will have additional powers to ensure vessels comply with the working, living and crewing condition provisions contained in this bill. 


A civil penalty and infringement notice regime is also established under the bill. 


These measures are important to ensure there is no derogation of standards. 




Participation in the Coastal Trade



Greater involvement by Australian companies in international trade will provide the catalyst to reinvigorate our domestic trades. 


Consistent with this, vessels registered in the international register will have limited access to the coastal trade. 


Operating under temporary licences, these vessels can compete with foreign flagged vessels in the coastal trade. 


As I have already made clear, the Fair Work Act 2009 will apply to vessels operating under temporary licences.  


To ensure our ships are on a level playing field with foreign flagged vessels, the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 will not apply to international register vessels. 


I know there is some concern that some coastal trading vessels may seek to avoid their legal responsibilities by joining the international register. 


This will not happen. 


The bill includes a requirement that vessels must be predominantly engaged in international trading. 


Registration can be cancelled if this requirement ceases to be met. 


COASTAL TRADING (REVITALISING AUSTRALIAN SHIPPING) BILL 2012


It is with great pride that I introduce the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill 2012. 


We are in the middle of a once in a generation resources boom. 


Yet only one half of one per cent of that trade is carried by Australian flagged vessels. 


In the past decade the Australian fleet has gone from 55 ships to 21 with only four operating on international routes.


Our ports manage ten per cent of the world's entire sea trade.


$200 billion worth of cargo is moved annually.


In a country where 99.9 per cent of our trade is moved by ships, there will soon be no fleet to revitalise.


We need to act now or we won't have an industry left at all.


This is the first of five bills that comprise the government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy legislative reforms to revitalise the Australian shipping industry. 


This package is an integrated suite of reforms which address fiscal, regulatory and workforce aspects of our nation's shipping industry.


This is the most far reaching overhaul of the Australian shipping industry since 1912. 


These reforms level the playing field and provide the industry with a stable fiscal and regulatory regime to encourage investment and promote our international competitiveness. 


Like many industries, Australian shipping is at a critical juncture in its ability to continue to be viable. 


The irony of the industry's situation is that it is set against the backdrop of major global change, of which Australia is a major beneficiary. 


The double digit growth of China and India, as well as other developing economies has driven demand for our resources. 


The lack of an Australian shipping industry that can compete in the international marketplace is a lost national opportunity. 


There are a number of reasons why Australian shipping has been declining; most of them have directly resulted from policy decisions made by the previous government.


Due to being so far behind our international competitors in terms of fiscal incentives the last decade or more has seen almost no investment in Australian ships.


One of the consequences of this lack of investment is that the average age of the Australian fleet now sits at almost 20 years against the global average of 12 years. 


The age of our fleet has implications for the industry's productivity and environmental performance. 


Modern vessels incorporate new technology delivering greater efficiencies.


Without new investment in the fleet, Australian shipping will continue to lag behind world standards.  


Falling productivity when compared to other modes has seen shipping's participation in the domestic freight task continue to decline. 


But it is not just the age of the fleet that is holding us back.


Like many industries, the maritime sector is also feeling the pressures of an ageing workforce. 


We must attract new recruits; but we also need to have enough ships so that cadets can gain the required sea time to obtain their qualifications. 


In the absence of a domestic shipping capacity we will be unable to train our own seafarers and will be reliant on the international market place to provide us with our maritime safety and environmental regulators. 


This government believes that there are compelling economic, environmental and national security reasons to support revitalisation of the Australian shipping industry. 


This belief is at the heart of the Gillard government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy vision.   


Let me turn now to the main elements of the Coastal Trading (Revitalisation of Australian Shipping) Bill 2012.


The bill aims to: 


Promote a viable shipping industry that contributes to the broader Australian economy;


Facilitate the long term growth of the Australian shipping industry; 


Enhance the efficiency and reliability of the Australian shipping as part of the national transport system; and


Maximise the use of vessels registered in the Australian General Shipping Register


I previously stated that this bill is the most significant overhaul of our coastal trading arrangements since they were introduced early last century. 


Back in 1912 when those provisions were debated in the House the role of British-owned shipping companies in the Australian coastal trade was the subject of much discussion.     


100 years later, the debate has moved on. 


We have one of the most liberal coastal trading regimes in the world. 


Unlike America, Canada or various EU countries, Australia recognises that there is a legitimate role for foreign flagged vessels in our domestic shipping industry. 


Under the provisions of this bill this will not change. 


Nothing in this package of bills closes our coast. 


However, we are making transparent the decision making processes, which determine a foreign vessel's participation in Australian domestic shipping.  


In support of this, a new three tier licensing system will replace the antiquated system of licences and permits:  


General licence holders, who will be Australian flagged will have unrestricted access to the coastal trade. These vessels will also have access to the tax incentives, including the income tax exemption. This will address the cost disadvantages that Australian vessels experience when competing against subsidised foreign vessels. 


Temporary licence holders, who may be foreign flagged or registered in the Australian International Shipping Register will have restricted access to the coastal trade. This access will be provided through an open process, which enables general licensed operators and transitional general licence holders to nominate to carry this trade if they are able to meet the criteria. Third party comments will be accepted as part of the decision making process. 


Emergency licences will provide restricted access to the coastal trade in terms of major emergencies and natural disasters. 


In creating a temporary licence we are moving away from the current system where companies apply on a permit by permit basis 


However, we have maintained the flexibility provided by the permit system, through the creation of a licence variation process. 


Temporary licence holders will be able to vary their licence to increase the number of voyages that will be undertaken or to vary the details of those voyages that have already been authorised. 


General licence holders will have the opportunity to nominate for these voyages. 


Again, this will be an open and transparent decision making process. 


The bill provides for enhanced merits review of decisions, including recourse to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on a range of matters. 


It also provides enhanced penalty provisions that modernise and provide greater scope for action if there are attempts to undermine the objectives of the system. 


Transparency is a cornerstone of this new model and the bill provides for strengthened reporting and publishing arrangements, to enable all industry participants to better understand the shipping market and to support more informed decision making. 


Commercially sensitive information will not be released. 


There has been some debate regarding the industrial arrangements for vessels engaged in the domestic coastal trade. 


This government made the decision in 2009 that vessels operating in the coastal trade will be subject to the provisions of the Fair Work Act. 


This was implemented through the Fair Work Act Regulations 2010. 


It is this government's policy that this scope of coverage will not change. 


These vessels are operating in the domestic economy and these seafarers are entitled to be paid Australian wages. 


This bill is the key to the regulatory framework – a framework that supports Australian coastal shipping, while allowing for the participation of foreign vessels. 


It is a framework that will enhance our participation in international trade and underpin the Australian industry with generous tax concessions that level the playing field between Australian shipping and its international competitors.


However, a ship is only as good as its crew.


That is why a key element of the government's reform package is workforce development.


We must attract, train and retain a skilled seafaring workforce.


There will be no incentive to invest without the right people in the right jobs.


There are challenges of an ageing workforce, costly and complicated training systems and the consequent erosion of skills.


This was strongly identified by the parliamentary inquiry into coastal shipping.


The government has already been doing its bit in this area and I believe industry must also ramp up its efforts in resolving the skills lag.


To encourage this on 1 January 2012 I established the Maritime Workforce Development Forum with experienced people from industry, unions and the training sector.


It is chaired by the former Public Service Commissioner Ms Lynelle Briggs.


The forum is addressing areas that are fundamental to building our skills base.


These will include a workforce plan for the medium term to address issues including the ageing workforce and the most immediate skills gaps.


The forum will be in place for no more than five years and I will review its effectiveness within two years.


The final element of the reform package is labour productivity.


We are committed to aligning Australian productivity practices with the best in the world. 


To do this, we will need a compact between industry and unions.


This compact must include changes to work practices, a review of safe manning levels and the use of riding gangs on coastal vessels. 


This compact is essential to the reform agenda. 


Negotiations between industry and the unions are progressing.


Before I close, I would like to thank those in the industry who share our vision for a revitalised Australian shipping industry – the ship owners, unions and shippers who have worked constructively with the government since 2007 to develop this package. 


This package of legislation is the product of a long and thorough process of consultation and review.


Starting first with a comprehensive review by the House of Representatives committee, who delivered a bipartisan report recommending a policy framework to revitalise the shipping industry. 


In 2009, I convened the Shipping Policy Advisory Group comprising shippers, industry and unions to advise me on how best to implement these recommendations. 


In 2010, fulfilling our election commitment a discussion paper was released seeking public comment on the proposed reforms.


In 2011, I established three industry reference groups to work through the detail of the reforms. Again, these groups comprised a cross-section of industry.  


We involved representatives from across government, with Treasury chairing the fiscal group. 


Exposure drafts of all the bills were released for public comment and a further roundtable was held in February to enable industry to work through the details with officials. 


I thank those officials for their leadership and assistance in shaping the final tax package that is being introduced today. 


The commitment and cooperation demonstrated by those who participated in this process is a credit to the industry and I thank them for their efforts. 


COASTAL TRADING (REVITALISING AUSTRALIAN SHIPPING) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2012


The Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2012 will ensure that there is a smooth transition from the current coastal trading arrangements to the new regulatory regime. 


I would like to turn first to the proposed transitional general licence, which has been the subject of some public commentary.




Transitional General Licen
c
e



Under this bill, a transitional general licence will be created to enable foreign flagged vessels currently operating in the Australian coastal trade under a licence, to continue their operations. 


These vessels are currently licensed under part VI of the Navigation Act 1912. 


This provision recognises that operators of foreign flagged vessels may not be able to immediately transfer to the Australian register. 


This may be due to a range of financial, legal or other commercial constraints. 


These vessels are performing an important function in the domestic shipping industry.  


A transitional general licence will be valid for up to five years and may be renewed once for an additional five years. 


Inclusion of this power for an additional renewal was in response to stakeholder feedback that indicated that a number of these vessels are locked into commercial agreements that go beyond the initial five years and cannot be re-negotiated without considerable financial penalty.  


Proof of these commercial arrangements will be required to support an application for renewal of a transitional general licence.  


In the long term, if these operators wish to continue to have unrestricted access to the Australian coast, they have to register their vessels in the Australian General Shipping Register. 


Vessels operating under a transitional general licence will be required to pay wages consistent with the current obligations under the Fair Work Act for vessels operating under licences issued under the Navigation Act. 


There will be no increase in the wages payable. 


Foreign flagged vessels currently operating under permits will not be allowed to apply for transitional general licences. 




Four month transition period



To minimise disruption as we move from the old to the new system, this bill provides that permits or licences, which are valid immediately before commencement of this bill will continue to be in force until their expiry date or up to four months after 1 July 2012. 


Any application submitted on or before 30 June, which was not decided by 1 July 2012, will be assessed in accordance with the Navigation Act requirements. 


These will be valid for up to a maximum of three months. 


These arrangements will provide industry with a level of certainty as we move to the new system. 




Occupational Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation 



Consistent with current arrangements, the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993 will continue to apply to vessels operating under a general licence and foreign vessels operating under a transitional general licence.  


This act will also apply to all vessels registered in the Australian International Shipping Register (AISR) irrespective of where these vessels are located. 


This is to ensure that AISR vessels maintain high standards of safety.   


The Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 will not apply to vessels registered in the Australian International Shipping Register when these vessels are operating under a temporary licence. 


This will enable AISR vessels to operate on a competitive footing with foreign flagged vessels while engaging in the coastal trade.   


A number of consequential amendments are required to existing Commonwealth laws to prevent any potential gaps in these laws as we repeal certain parts of the Navigation Act.


Minor amendments will also be made to the Australian Maritime Safety Act 1990 to ensure that AMSA is able to share information with Department of Infrastructure and Transport for the administration and enforcement of the requirements of the new legislation on coastal trading. 


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SHIPPING REFORM) BILL 2012


The purpose of the government's tax reforms is to encourage and support capital investment.


The Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Bill 2012 delivers a best-in-class internationally competitive tax reform package. 


The tax concessions contained in this bill aim to address the cost disadvantages faced by Australian ship owners and encourage renewal of the ageing Australian fleet. 


The bill provides: 


a zero tax rate for Australian shipping companies;


provision for accelerated depreciation of vessels via a cap of 10 years to the effective life of those vessels;


rollover relief from income tax on the sale of a vessel; 


an employer refundable tax offset in relation to seafarers; and 


an exemption from royalty withholding tax for payments made for the lease of shipping vessels.


These concessions are available to companies that satisfy the qualifying conditions and hold a valid certificate, as set out in the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill 2012. 


Turning to each of these concessions:  




Exemption from income tax for ship operators  



International experience in Europe, Asia and South America shows that the introduction of financial support—usually in the form of a tonnage tax and personal tax breaks for seafarers working in the international trade—has had substantial and very positive effects.


The bill I introduce today goes a step further—the government is not introducing a new tax in the form of a tonnage tax—instead it exempts qualifying income from shipping from taxation.


The effect of this provision is that Australian resident companies with vessels registered in Australia, including those on the international register, will not pay company tax.


Furthermore, a generous approach is taken to defining these activities that generate eligible shipping income. 




Accelerated depreciation 



This bill provides ship owners with an accelerated rate of depreciation for their ships. 


When introducing the previous bill, I mentioned before Australia has an old fleet compared to international standards.


This is in part due to our depreciation rate for vessels being set at 20 years.


This bill cuts that rate in half.


The new depreciation rate will be 10 years.


This provision has multiple effects.


An economic benefit—the cost of operating a 20 year old large bulk carrier is at least 40 percent more than for a five year old ship.


A safety and environmental benefit—newer vessels incorporate new technology making them safer and more environmentally friendly.


An employment benefit as ship building is encouraged.




Roll
over relief



The rollover relief concession provides that if a ship is disposed of, ship owners will be able to defer tax due on a balancing adjustment amount by two years. 


If a replacement ship is purchased by the end of the two years, the balancing adjustment will be rolled over. 


Combined with the accelerated depreciation concession, ship owners will have a greater incentive to invest in more modern and efficient ships.  




Refundable Tax Offset



It makes no sense that an Australian seafarer working on a ship in the Port of London should pay Australian income tax while an Australian working as a bartender in a pub in London does not.


This creates a disincentive for hiring Australian seafarers.


Consequently, the bill provides for a refundable tax offset for employers of Australian resident seafarers. 


The seafarer tax offset provides an incentive for a company to employ Australian seafarers on overseas voyages. 


This will also provide Australian seafarers with the opportunity to develop their maritime skills on ships operating in international trade. 


For an employer to qualify for the offset, the seafarer must have served on overseas voyages for at least 91 days in the income year on an eligible vessel.




Royalty Withholding Tax



Finally, payments made for the lease of shipping vessels from foreign resident lessors will be exempt from royalty withholding tax. 


This exemption applies to payments made by Australian resident companies for the lease, on a bareboat basis, of qualifying vessels that are used commercially to ship cargo or passengers. 


This element is aimed at reducing the costs for Australian shipping operators of securing vessels from overseas.


Together, these tax arrangements ensure investment in Australian shipping will continue.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-06-18,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:05):  I rise to speak on a matter of immense importance to the Australian economy and in particular to the regional economy. Transport has always been crucial to Australia. We have the curse of being so far from many of the world's major markets—but maybe it is a blessing being so far from any of the world's major problems at the moment. However, this is an issue with transport, so if we want to compete on a global market then we must have globally competitive costs. 


Whilst the success of our agriculture, mining, manufacturing and tourism industries cannot be faulted without an efficient and effective transport system, all their efforts will be for nothing if we cannot get the product to the purchaser. There is no point in growing wheat, barley or triticale if we cannot transport it to a market. There is no point in exploring for new reserves of iron ore, coal, rare earths or bauxite if we cannot get the shipping to take it to the ports near markets in South-East Asia. The question before us is not one between no transport network or some transport network but one about getting the most effective transport in place so that Australian industry can be encouraged and invigilated—and I love that word—by access to the world's best transport infrastructure at a reasonable price. 


We have all seen the impact of the high Australian dollar on our exporting industries. We might be encouraged in some instances that the dollar is high because people are purchasing our products. It was a fortunate circumstance that we had South-East Asia to drag us through the global financial crisis with their purchase of coal and iron ore—obviously nothing to do with any crazy schemes of putting ceiling insulation in roofs or building school halls or absent-mindedly throwing out $900 cheques. But if we go to the actual structure of how we support our nation and to one of the fundamentals, which is transport cost, and start meddling in that in such way as to make our exports less competitive then we are really just having a shot at ourselves. It is the same as making our costs higher and less competitive. It makes it harder for Australian businesses to sell their products overseas. It is always a staple that we must understand that the only mechanism that really keeps the Australian economy going is those export based industries, predominantly based in regional Australia, that rely on the export of goods. In the whole GDP argument so often people misled by saying, 'Well, the majority of the GDP is in the crescent economy that exists between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.' That might be the case, but the source of that wealth comes from regional Australia. Somebody has to put something on the table to make the money spin around. That person who puts something on the table must be able to get it onto a ship and export it to get those dollars into our nation to support the standard of living we expect. 


   We are an island nation. Commodities rely on coastal shipping: 99 per cent of our exports travel by sea and only one per cent by air.  In fact, 75 per cent of the value of our exports travel by sea and a large proportion of our interstate transport travels by sea. So we are really dealing with something that is fundamentally important to the fluid movement in the Australian economy. 


We should apply this test to all transport bills that come before us: do these bills make it easier for our farmers, miners and manufacturers or do they make it harder for them and therefore increase the cost and their frustration? It is by this test that the coalition will oppose these bills. We oppose these bills because the government plans to introduce a complicated, convoluted and futile system which will frustrate the access to shipping for Australian business and thereby choke the business prospects of future opportunities. Because these bills do not meet our own objectives and are a threat to the competitiveness and vibrancy of our exporting industries, the coalition will move a second reading amendment that has been circulated in the chamber. This amendment says that we decline a second reading for these bills until the bills have been referred to the Productivity Commission for further consultation. 


Australia has the sixth longest coastline of any nation in the world despite being only the world's 13th largest economy. We have the fourth largest shipping task in the world and shipping takes a quarter of Australian freight between the states. It is therefore fundamentally true that Australian businesses need access to the most affordable shipping we can provide to make them competitive. These bills will put into question whether we can achieve such an increase in shipping. If we cannot, that will put more pressure on our roads and more pressure on our rail network. It is quite obvious that, if we are not moving things by sea, we are going to have to sit behind a truck going down the Pacific Highway. We have also failed in other major tasks in this nation such as getting alternate transport corridors going such as inland rail, which is something that the Labor Party is always talking about, always announcing, but never building. Already we have 3,000 trucks a day going through a place such as Moree because of inadequate rail services. Coal is being transported along the roads of western Queensland. Trains, whilst leaving Fallon, the second-biggest grain receival depot in Queensland, have a maximum speed of 40 kilometres an hour. These are all signs of a government that has lost its way and has not invested in infrastructure, that is failing to take account of the fact that the times of prosperity that are currently seen in the Asian economy may not be there for an eternity, but our debt will be. 


We see lately that the Indian economy is starting to plateau and we also see on the nightly news what is happening in Europe. We acknowledge that, if Europe falls out of bed, as the biggest economic bloc in the world and obviously the largest consumer of Chinese product, the Chinese demand for our commodities will peel off, and if the Chinese demand for our commodities peels off then the question we all have to ask ourselves is, how do we pay what is currently our $231 billion debt, how does Queensland pay what will be a $100 billion debt, how does New South Wales pay its debt, how does South Australia refloat its economy? All these questions are the realities of what is before us at the moment.


We have to be pragmatic and understand that we have to take the best advantages that are before us at the moment. We must take advantage of these global markets and we must make sure that we must remove whatever impediments exist between us getting that commodity out of the ground or off the paddock and into the market, not exacerbate them. This bill exacerbates them. I hear the Reserve Bank talking and the Prime Minister and the Treasurer talking about how we should have a spring in our step. I have been examining the spring in our step lately and I think it is Topy spring soles. We have at this point of time in our economy extreme concerns, especially in the commercial sectors, especially in small business, especially on the high street, where we are just not getting the trade we expected. The Labor Party's process of trying to fix this is to bring in a mining tax, that is find the person who is making some money and hit them over the head. What they should be doing is trying to make sure that a well-oiled economy gets that money flowing around by its own natural means. One of the ways to do that is by having an effective transport system, an efficient transport system. 


The Labor Party's logic is completely counterintuitive. They are creating another impediment on our coastal shipping, they have failed to invest in our internal transport corridors, they are creating unnecessary impediments in such things as development of the Galilee Basin by disappearing overnight a la the live cattle trade debacle approach and throwing sand in the wheels of trying to get another export market going and trying to take advantage of the prices that we are currently seeing in South-East Asia. We have seen the Labor Party stand up and all of a sudden turn most of the Coral Sea into a marine park. This is not a sign of a government that seems to be watching the news at night and trying to work out what on earth is happening around the world. This is a government that is completely distracted. We have Minister Burke crying in his beer because he cannot go to Rio tomorrow. There are probably other things at home you should be talking about, Minister Burke. You should be explaining to us what on earth you are doing shutting down large sections of the Queensland fishing industry, creating yet another impediment; why you are creating these impediments on the export of coal; why you are so negative. They always complain that we say no, but what they do is say no to future prosperity and completely ignore what is happening on the television at night. These bills will establish a second register of Australian ships, to be known as the Australian International Shipping Register. Ships will be able to join this register provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement to have two senior Australian officers on board. These bills will help respond to the critical skills shortage that exists in the Australian shipping industry.


Whilst the coalition supports these changes, the bills have some concerning flaws that may be the result of an inadequate consultation process. Despite these bills being very complex, the consultation period for the draft legislation was open for only a few weeks. Once the bills were introduced, they included new provisions not previously contemplated. Unfortunately, despite some positive changes in these bills, because of these flaws the coalition remains unconvinced that these changes will see a significant increase in the number of Australian flagged vessels operating on our coast. This is not just the position of the coalition; it is supported by industry as well. For example, Shipping Australia stated in its submission that some of the provisions, at least in the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill 2012, are confusing and 'in our view require substantial amendment to meet what we understand to be the objects of the bill'. Tom Pinder, from Australian Coastal Shipping said:


The proposed legislation, as it relates to coastal container shipping, can only exacerbate this situation and will not result in any Australian flagged/registered ships valiantly taking up the challenge of carrying containers on the principal coast route, namely, east coast to west coast.


A continuation down the path of a one size fits all [policy] will result eventually in all of the current east west freight task being diverted to the inadequate infrastructure of road and rail with hugely increased costs and a totally detrimental effect on the carbon footprint—


Which the Labor Party seems to bang on about all the time. You are going to have to explain to every family on holidays that has a truck sitting in front of them with a container on the back that it could have been going by sea. It is not going by sea because, in their wisdom, the Labor Party has decided to make moving stuff by sea harder. So where else will they go? They will go down an inadequate rail network. An adequate inland transport corridor has just never been built by the Labor Party, and the roads are chock-a-block and are being torn to pieces, especially after the floods. Or they will go down the Pacific Highway, in amongst mum and dad and the kids going on their holidays. It is peculiar, but you get used to that hanging around with this crowd.


Even the department of transport itself is not promising that these bills will lead to an increase in the number of ships. The Australian Logistics Council has raised questions about how many ships this package would actually see come onto the register. The department said in its reply that it is 'not appropriate to speculate on how many will take advantage of this new legislation'. So there is no guarantee that these bills will increase the number of Australian ships, and there is no doubt that these bills will increase red tape and costs for those using Australian shipping.


One bill in this set, the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill 2012 abolishes part VI of the Navigation Act 1912 and, hence, abolishes the current permit and licensing system. These bills will lace that system with a three tiered licensing system: (1) a general licence which provides unrestricted access for Australian registered vessels crewed by Australians, permanent residents or foreigners with appropriate work visas to engage in coastal trading in Australian waters for a maximum of five years; (2) a temporary licence which provides limited access to engage in coastal trading for foreign flagged vessels or Australian international second register vessels for a 12-month period for specifically identified voyages; and (3) an emergency licence which provides extremely limited access in identified emergency situations such as natural disasters.


This three tiered system will create obvious difficulties. The new temporary licence category will only be issued where, according to the explanatory memorandum, 'those voyages where the required information is known, including expected loading dates, loading and discharge ports and cargo types and volumes'.


Remember these temporary licences are issued for a 12-month period. How can a user of shipping provide information on their expected loading dates 12 months in advance? Let us do an experiment on this. How many people in this chamber could tell us exactly where they are going in the next 12 months? How many politicians would like to submit a register for the next 12 months of exactly what flights they are going to catch and, if they go beyond that, provide a licence? This is obviously another form of bureaucracy that has passed the backbench of the Labor Party and, no doubt, had good oversight from Senator Doug Cameron, but it obviously has not passed anything that has to do with a reasonable expectation or understanding of the requirements for fluid movement of transport or to try to remove some of the impediments and red tape.


By doing this, we want to keep Australians in jobs. Let us keep the economy going and not the idea that you think you are going to create jobs by making things impossible. It just seems bizarre. It is another extension of the mad carbon tax idea. With the carbon tax they are going to cool the planet. Somehow, by putting up the price of power, it will keep people in work. No it will not. If you put up the price of power it will put people out of work. That is the only logical thing. You are putting people out of work by putting up the price of power and making life a misery for everybody who has to turn on the lights in their house and by shutting down the economy even further and putting more waste in the economy by saying that, even if you do manage to get something to the port, you are going to have an uncompetitive weight placed on you so that people exporting from Indonesia will have greater access to the market for coal than people exporting from Australia.


We have to understand that the global market, from all observations, looks like it is heading into a very uncertain time. We in this country should be doing everything in our power to realise that and to make sure that the mechanisms of commerce and the movement of things are as fluid as possible. We can protect our interests, but we do not protect our interests by winding back the clock and creating unnecessary impediments on the movement of Australian products from Australian fields and Australian mines. That is basically what this will do: it is just going to create an unnecessary overhead in the movement of Australian product. Noting that our major export is coal and our major sector is mining and that it is all moved by ship, we have to understand that this economy works on export dollars, on what you put on the ship.


Look at what people are wearing. This gentleman in front of me is wearing a shirt from China or somewhere and a suit that is pretty nice and could come from Italy or somewhere like that. The shoes are not from around here; they are from overseas. I do not know where the chair he is sitting on was made. Everything around us—including the computers—is made overseas. We live by the benefaction of things that come off a boat to us. Our cars predominantly come from overseas. Our fuel comes from overseas. The hotplate we cook on at night comes from overseas. I do not know where the lights are made but you would probably find they come from overseas. So everything is coming off a ship. If you do not believe it, think of your own household and think of where the things come from: they have come off a ship. So, if you are going to increase the cost of shipping, quite obviously you are going to increase your cost of living.


The only way we survive—and they do not send this for charity—is by somebody somewhere sticking something on a ship and sending it in the other direction. Who are these people that stick something on a ship and send it in the other direction? Let us face it: we have a manufacturing sector but it is not a large one, so we are sticking coal on a ship, we are sticking iron ore on a ship, we are sticking wheat on a ship, we are sticking barley on a ship and we were sticking cattle on a ship until they closed down the live-cattle trade. 


All these things are the source of our wealth when that money turns. That is when that $20 turns up. That is when the five people at the table spin it and then the five people say, 'Well, the GDP of this table is now $100—five times $20.' But if that $20 had not turned up—so if that person who put the $20 on the table had not turned up—the GDP of that table would have been zero. And the person who puts that $20 on the table is regional Australia. Coal, iron ore, barley, sheep—that is where the money turns up from and then it spins around our nation's economy. But, if we are going to put in an impediment to that $20 turning up on the table, life for the rest of the people living off the table is going to become harder; it has to.


This is why we have to look at the practicalities of what these bills mean. We have got to make it as easy as possible for that 20 bucks to turn up at our table. We have got to make it as easy as possible for the exporting of coal so it makes it to its market and as easy as possible for the exporting of iron ore so it makes it to its market, and we have got to be time sensitive because these prices that we are getting at the market are peeling off and they are not going to stay up forever. If they peel off sufficiently enough our capacity to finance our debt and to finance the things that people have an expectation to receive—health services, education services, police services and defence services—will not be there.


When we look at these things and when we look at the legislation, we say at first glance, 'Oh well, it gets more Australians in the shipping industry jobs,' and I suppose it does, but that is very short term thinking because what it is going to do is make the system uncompetitive so everybody loses out. Caltex said in their submission that, given the variable nature of their operations, it was not possible—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Joyce, your time has expired. Can I invite you to move your second reading amendment?




Senator JOYCE:
  Yes. I move:


Omit all words after “That”, substitute:


the Senate declines to give this bill and related bills a second reading until the bills have been referred to the Productivity Commission to:


(a) assess the Government's proposed “shipping reform package” for both international and coastal trades with reference to the current and historical arrangements;


(b) measure and discuss the economic and environmental impacts of reducing or increasing regulation of Australia's coastal shipping services to Australian manufacturing and industry dependent on coastal shipping services, the wider economy and Australia's coastal trading fleet, including passenger services;


(c) provide recommendations on policy options that would achieve the Government's objective for a viable, competitive shipping service in Australia for both coastal and international shipping that is in the national interest, lead to productivity gains and will not disaffect Australian manufacturing, industry and tourism;


and report on or before 31 December 2012.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Joyce.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (10:25):  I rise to speak in support of this suite of reforms to the shipping and maritime legislation, reforms which have quite literally been about 100 years in the making. Australian shipping has been heading under over the past 10 years. Our merchant fleet has decreased by half, with the number of Australian-licensed trading vessels dropping from 55 in 1996 to 21 today. And only four of those vessels are operating on international routes. In a country where 99.9 per cent of our trade is moved by ships, there will soon be no fleet to revitalise. Australian seafarers' jobs are being lost as overseas flagged ships take more of our goods from producer to market. In a country that has the fourth largest shipping task in the world, this Labor government has never been prepared to sit back and wave bon voyage. 


This suite of bills provides the incentives to invest in shipping in Australia. It will get the Australian flag flying on ships again—ships carrying goods produced by Australian workers both to markets in Australia and to Singapore, Hong Kong and the other great ports of the world. It is simple: either we get on with the job of reforming the industry and of trying to find the right incentives to assist Australians in the shipping industry or the Australian shipping industry will disappear, and our producers will be left at the mercy of more overseas decision makers. This results in increased uncertainty for business owners and for the hardworking Australians they employ. There are no plans to restrict the number of foreign vessels in Australian waters; these reforms are about levelling the playing field for Australian ships so that they can better compete.


I begin with a quote from Teresa Lloyd, Executive Director of the Australian Shipowners Association, on the day this suite of bills passed the lower house:


""I just want to say that the shipowners are ready to invest and this is a great day in terms of a new era for Australian shipping.


It's been very difficult to compete for at least the last 15 years, and that's seen the industry shrink to an almost unsustainable level.


And today is a fantastic day and the shipowners are quite committed for their investment decisions and they're looking forward to expanding into new trades, into new international opportunities that have never been available to us before.


We think it's a fantastic thing and we thank the Minister for all his efforts to make it happen.""


This quote hits at the chord of the goodwill between the parties involved in negotiating this suite of bills, from a committee inquiry in 2008, the establishment of a shipping advisory group in 2009 and the release of a discussion paper that shaped the path taken to get to where we are today. Specific groups were then established, one on taxation, chaired by Treasury, one on regulatory reform and one on workforce development. Another inquiry was conducted when the suite of bills came to the House of Representatives. It was a process that the Labor Party, the labour movement and the shipping industry were committed to getting right. 


These groups took the opportunity—because, as I said earlier, this is the first time in 100 years that the Navigation Act 1912 has been comprehensively updated. They took their opportunity and were very flexible during negotiations, making sure that they did not put their own interests first, no doubt recognising that together we can rebuild the Australian shipping industry and that together we are stronger than if we are all fighting over the pieces of broken hull. It was a process that led to unanimous recommendations on this legislation from the bipartisan parliamentary committee, including its deputy chair, Nationals MP Paul Neville, which makes the amendment proposed by Senator Joyce unnecessary. The shipping industry thought that the conservatives in this place were onside. Unfortunately, the National Party is being forced by its big brother to ignore its very own policy statements and put politics and obstructionism ahead of the livelihoods of Australian seafarers and Australian shipowners. Labor is here to take the necessary steps to ensure that Australia has a sustainable shipping industry for the next 200 years and that young Australians who dream of a life at sea will be able to have one under Australian wages and conditions. It is about recognising what government can do to assist industry and working collaboratively to achieve it. We all want and deserve a strong shipping industry in this country. Just like we are exporting our minerals, we should be exporting our expertise in naval architecture, seafaring and engineering.


The Leader of the Nationals, Mr Truss, is on record opposing these changes out of a concocted fear that other industries would want the same concessions—as though no industry-specific policies were ever enacted by the Howard government. I am very proud to say that just a few months ago this Labor government, with the support of the Independents and the Greens, moved through both houses of this parliament to abolish what was one of the most disgusting Howard era industry-specific policies. While we on this side are about building capacity in Australia's workforce and providing incentives for Australian business, those opposite are fixated on stripping away working conditions, stripping away family payments and stripping away incentives to invest.


I will now step the Senate through four key points in the legislation that bring the internal battle of the National Party senators to the fore. The National Party policy platform seeks to 'introduce a tonnage tax to replace company tax on an opt-in basis'. This seems to be a reasonable step, without promising too much. One would suspect that, if the bills, on the recommendations from Treasury and industry, went further, the Nationals would be only too keen to lend their support. These bills before us today introduce a zero rate of taxation for Australian shipping companies to get the vessels sailing again.


The National Party platform also seeks to 'introduce a national system of training support' to 'replace the existing state based distribution of funds'. Well, guess what? The bipartisan committee supported this and it is reflected in the bills before us.


The platform continues by saying that the Nationals will:


Examine ways to reduce the income tax disadvantage suffered by Australian seafarers operating outside Australian waters, compared with seafarers from other nations.


The work has been done. The bipartisan committee supported the reforms, and the bills will remove the income tax burden on Australian seafarers operating internationally.


Finally, the suite of legislation provides for a second shipping register. This second register was, once again, a part of the Nationals Policy Platform 2011-12. I urge them to support it through supporting this legislation.


Labor recognise that at times we need special assistance for some industries of national significance. Today we are looking at the maritime industry. Just this year we have sought to create better conditions for truckies in the road transport industry, for outworkers in the textile industry and for all workers in the construction industry.


This legislation would not have come about without the tireless advocacy of the Maritime Union of Australia and its national secretary, Paddy Crumlin. I recognise all from the MUA for your work. As many of you are aware, I am based in Devonport, Tasmania, the home of the MUA's Tasmanian branch. Membership of the MUA in Tasmania centres on the key transport linking us with the mainland, the Spirit of Tasmania. The Spirit, as it is affectionately known in Devonport, employs around 200 seafarers based between Devonport and Melbourne, making it the biggest employer of seafarers in Australia. There were many cries of relief from members in Devonport, many of whom are third- or fourth-generation maritime workers.


Tasmanian exporters have been hit hard over the past year, with the closure of the only international shipping service out of the island. All freight now has to move through the Port of Melbourne, significantly increasing costs to exporters. Federal Labor has delivered a $20 million package to assist Tasmanian exporters and, importantly, to investigate freight logistics in the state. The funding package contains three key measures: direct and immediate assistance of $14.5 million to Tasmanian exporters through a one-off payment to help them stay competitive in the new shipping environment; investing $4 million in infrastructure improvements at the port of Burnie to increase container-handling capacity and enhance the movements within the port, thereby reducing the need for shunting and double-handling; and establishing a freight logistics coordination team with an industry leadership. These three practical measures address the complex issues facing Tasmanian exporters, as well as the shortcoming in the state's supply lines. Together, the measures support exporters in the short term through direct assistance and benefit the whole state in the long term through significant infrastructure upgrades.


Labor is committed to Tasmania's and Australia's maritime industry. We are a seafaring nation, and this suite of bills has used the experience of those in the industry to best target how we can rebuild our once-great Australian shipping industry, a process that has seen industry, unions and government work together in the national interest. It is a great display of how these parties recognise that it is in their interests to achieve a positive outcome in the nation's interest, rather than picking over the leftover hulls of our shipping fleet. I commend these bills to the house and urge all to vote in their favour and support maritime workers and shipowners.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:35):  These bills—the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill 2012, the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill 2012, the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill 2012, the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2012 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Bill 2012—have been a long time in the making. In March 2008 we had a House of Representatives committee inquiry into our maritime trade and the state of our shipping industry. Australia as an island continent, as Senator Joyce pointed out, has a deep interest in the health of its shipping industry, as its economy depends on imports and exports. That report was tabled in October 2008, and it set out the basic architecture of the package that we are debating today.


I live in a port city. I call Fremantle home. I note that, on the way in and out of the office every day, you see the vessels that are tied up loading cargo and unloading cargo, and very, very few of them are registered in Australia. That is because our shipping industry has been decimated in the last few decades through policy neglect—or, you could even say, through deliberate policy intention. When Senator Joyce talks about competitiveness and about how uncompetitive he believes these bills will make the Australian shipping industry, he is talking about being competitive with Monrovia, Liberia, and with some of the other ports of convenience that the world's shipping fleets are registered out of. I think these bills give quite substantial effect to the principle that as a maritime trading nation Australia needs a strong shipping industry. Subsequent to the report of the House of Representatives inquiry in October 2008, there was a round table set up that eventually produced a discussion paper in 2010 with the support of the department that effectively laid out the bones of the reforms that we are discussing today. Subsequent to that, there were three shipping reference groups that were established through 2011 and, subsequent to these bills being tabled, there was a Senate inquiry to which, I should note, there was no dissent. That was a report tabled by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee without dissent. In case the coalition were hoping otherwise, I should say at the outset that the Greens will not be supporting a proposition to refer this package to yet another inquiry—this time to the Productivity Commission. As the MUA note in their submission, this is one instance where you can say these bills have been well consulted on—they have been put through the wringer, as it were—and everybody has been given the opportunity to make their views known.


There are three major elements to the package comprising the bills that we are debating today. The ones that I will focus on are effectively around the need for reform to protect the Australian shipping industry, such as it is. I will focus my brief comments on the coastal trading bills, the international shipping register bill and the taxation incentives. Our shipping industry has been in decline for many years, even though it carries upwards of 20 per cent of the nation's freight, and the Australian Greens believe that there is room for a larger proportion of our freight task to be taken up by coastal shipping. At the same time, there are now only 22 Australian registered ships engaged in major trading, down from 55 in 1996. The House of Representatives inquiry of 2008 into rebuilding Australia's coastal shipping industry found a number of things: that we are trading in an intensively competitive global environment, with many nations using tax incentives to attract shipping tonnage; that Australian ships are at a disadvantage as they are subject to the standard corporate tax rate, while competitors enjoy lower rates of tax; and that Australian ships also face competitive disadvantage in relation to wages and conditions on foreign ships.


We have a highly liberalised coastal trading framework. Substantially, we are working with the legacy of Howard era reforms that allow foreign-flagged and -crewed vessels to operate around our coasts under a permit which allows the vessels to be exempt from certain Australian require­ments, including allowing lower-paid foreign workers. The basic principles were laid out in the introduction to the Senate committee report, which was tabled a short while ago and which is worth putting onto the Hansard record. The committee noted:


…revitalisation of the Australian coastal shipping sector begins with regulatory reform. Coastal shipping in this country is governed by a complex regulatory structure and the Committee has made several recommendations intended to harmonise shipping policy and regulation. Growth in the sector will be further enhanced by incentives such as the introduction of an optional tonnage tax and accelerated depreciation. Strong action on the part of all maritime stakeholders is required to abate the skills crisis, but government can assist and it is the Committee's recommendation that Australia's tonnage tax regime be linked to mandatory training requirements.


I congratulate the government on not taking a narrow approach but, for a change, taking a very broad, sector-wide approach to these reforms so that we are not seeing piecemeal reform. We are seeing a number of important measures being advanced at the same time so we can see quite clearly how the different elements of reform fit together. I am hoping that on my ride into work in a couple of years I will be able to see ships registered out of Fremantle or the Port of Melbourne or other Australian ports. There is no reason at all for a country like ours, which is so exposed to maritime trade, to not have a strong shipping industry.


The coastal trading bills provide the regulatory framework for access by vessels to coastal trading into Australia, so it is intended to support Australian vessels while still enabling access to foreign flagged vessels. The framework will replace the current permit system for access to Australia's coasts with a licensing regime and it will create three kinds of licence: general, temporary and emergency. The general licence for Australian vessels would be for unrestricted carriage of domestic cargo and passengers by vessels registered on the Australian General Shipping Register. They will be crewed by Australian citizens, permanent residents or people with work visas. In the instance of temporary licences, foreign-registered vessels can still apply for a licence, and a general licence holder must be informed and the applications are then subject to negotiations for carriage by general licence holders' ability to nominate for the trade. Making that area of the trade contestable is, I think, quite an important step forward. The bill then achieves basic standards for rates of pay and conditions on ships engaged on coastal trading. I note that this is similar to the airline pilot and cabin crew demands which are part of the disputes unfolding at the moment with Qantas in particular; they are simply asking for similar rates of pay in light of airlines basing crew overseas and paying lower rates. So I think that, in these reforms, there are some important flags raised for the aviation industry.


I want to acknowledge the trade union movement's support for their colleagues and comrades in other countries, because it is easy enough to accuse them of simply seeking to protect and cocoon Australian industry from foreign competition. But, as the MUA point out in their submission to these bills, in particular to the Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill:


The bills provide for the engagement of non-national seafarers for all but two positions on ships registered on the international register providing considerable scope for the engagement, training and employment of seafarers from regional nations, such as the islands of the south-west Pacific, including PNG, Timor Leste under structured arrangements, such as regional government-to-government partnership agreement, that we anticipate will dovetail into our international development assistance through AusAid programs for these nations.


There is in fact support here not only for Australian shipping but also for the training and the enabling of seafarers in other countries in our region to seek employment and to find themselves on these vessels. 


The last thing that I wanted to note in the Australian International Shipping Register is the regulation of vessels to ensure an international reputation for high-quality maritime safety standards, while allowing competitive alternatives. What is being attempted in this package is to balance competition with, for example, labour standards and safety standards. Many submitters to the Senate inquiry made that important point, in particular the MUA—the importance of not simply, as Senator Joyce did, emphasising the competitive arrangements but reminding the chamber that poor safety and labour workforce standards on these ships carry very serious local consequences, as we are seeing now on an almost annual basis. For example, the vessel that drifted towards the Great Barrier Reef only last month could have had absolutely devastating consequences for the environment of the Great Barrier Reef.


Finally, the incentives bill that provides tax concession to Australian shipowners, allowing greater competition with foreign vessels, is something that we had to take a very good look at. Ultimately, I think it is a commonsense application of competition principles. These are very difficult playing fields to level when we are competing with countries that leverage much greater economies of scale than we can. Nonetheless, I look forward to reviewing these bills in the future to establish whether or not they have had the desired impact of bringing Australian flagged vessels back into our ports and on to coastal trading routes. I congratulate the MUA and its supporters, many of whom are in the gallery this morning, for their steadfast advocacy of the bill—I say steadfast but there are probably stronger words I could use. They have been very strongly in support of this package, of their workforce and of rebuilding the Australian shipping industry. I look forward to the passage of these bills later in this session.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (10:46):  I rise to make my contribution to the debate on the five bills that make up the shipping reform package. I do so from the particular perspective of my home state of Tasmania, which relies intrinsically on shipping and transport for almost everything that happens in that state—for all manufacturing and for all the goods that come onto the island. Effectively, we rely on shipping for everything that we consume and everything that we manufacture, except for some high-value products which are flown in and out. The cost of shipping and the impact of that cost on our island state is manifest. It is one of the most important issues for Tasmania.


In her presentation, Senator Urquhart mentioned the $20 million contribution that the Commonwealth government has made towards the cost of export for export businesses in Tasmania. I have to say that the way it has managed that process, particularly through the estimates process during the last fortnight that we were here, has been nothing short of disgraceful. For the Department of Infrastructure and Transport to have told the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on the Wednesday evening that negotiations with the Tasmanian government had not yet been finalised and that final decisions were a couple of weeks away, while at the very same time the media had an embargoed media release from the minister indicating how some of the funding was to be spent, is nothing short of a disgrace, in my view. The committee clearly felt misled by the evidence that was given. The following morning I received a phone call from a witness to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into these bills. That person told me that the evidence I had been given at estimates was wrong, which indicates to me that the Senate should consider very closely the evidence that was given to it during those hearings, despite the denials that have come back in writing from the minister.


Industry in my state thought that the $20 million was going to assist them with exports. They were quite rightly disappointed to find that $4 million was being put into Tasmanian government-owned infrastructure. Mr Deputy President, I know that you as a Burnie boy would have some real interest in the investment that is being made in the port of Burnie. That investment is important; I will not deny it. That is an important investment that is being made. I live on the north-west coast, in Devonport, like Senator Urquhart. I spend time with my office looking out over the port, watching the port operations and understanding how vital it is to our home state. But that funding should have been given to the industry to do what the government told them it was going to do and what the government gave them the impression it was going to do: assist them with their export costs in the short term. The money being spent on the Burnie port is a medium- to long-term solution and should have been part of another funding package, if it was going to be spent in that area. It spent another $1.5 million setting up a committee, effectively doing work the Tasmanian government should have been doing in the past. There is no integrated transport plan for my home state of Tasmania and we still suffer from ad hoc decision making in Tasmania. There was $150 million allocated to the port of Bell Bay for upgrade work, yet progressively shipping companies have been pulling out of there.


The impact on Tasmanian exports is part of that problem but it is also part of a global change in the way that the shipping industry operates. Globally, export ships are getting larger; they need access to the larger airports and therefore Melbourne is becoming the regional export hub. That is one of the reasons that we are being affected, but it is also one of the reasons that we need to make sure that our shipping around the Australian coastline is globally cost competitive. We are not going to be able to compete in global markets unless we ensure a competitive industry here in Australia. We have heard expressed over the last couple of years significant concerns about our manufacturing sector and its cost competitiveness and its place in the global market.


One of the significant costs being felt by our manufacturers is the cost of shipping around Australia. I will give an example, again from my home state of Tasmania. A major food manufacturing plant, Simplot, estimates that the cost to it of the removal of continuing voyage permits is in the vicinity of $7 million a year. Coles will not give it that money, Kentucky Fried will not, McDonald's will not and Hungry Jacks will not. It means that it will lose markets—and it has lost markets. When we see potato farmers in Tasmania complaining that they have to leave their potatoes in the ground and McCain move all its vegetable processing to New Zealand because it is not cost competitive, we know that the cost of shipping is one of the elements that is affecting that. That is $7 million for the additional cost of shipping that is making an impact on the industry.


The carbon tax is another cost, of $8 million a year, imposed by this government on that plant. None of those companies is going to give Simplot any of that money. Woolworths has said that the cost of its carbon tax is something in the order of $64 million. It is going to absorb that, but it means it will not accept cost increases from the carbon tax from any of their suppliers, either, unless they can justify it. Coles has said the same sort of thing. So the cost of shipping, the cost of getting produce in and out of this country, and particularly on and off my home state of Tasmania, is absolutely vital. If you go back and look at history you will see that whenever there has been an increase in access to Tasmania and particularly a cost reduction in access to Tasmania there has been a blip up in the economy. That is a clear indicator that access and the cost of access is vital to my home state of Tasmania.


Shipping, as I have said, is a global industry. We need to ensure that we are cost competitive globally. We cannot be imposing artificial restrictions on our shipping sector if we are going to be competitive. We do not want, as the petroleum industry has said to us, the potential impacts from shortages of petroleum and fuel in Tasmania because they cannot be certain or they cannot predict 12 months in advance, as this legislation determines, the shipping movements that they will need to move the petroleum backwards and forwards and in and out of the state. We just cannot afford to be putting those artificial restrictions in place. Those artificial impositions add cost and uncertainty to the economy, particularly for an island state like mine, which relies so heavily on transport.


I acknowledge, though, that the government have accepted, as I understand it, an amendment from the opposition in the House of Representatives in relation to temporary licences and some of the movements around the countryside of Australia. I think it really important to acknowledge the fact that they are prepared to consider some of the elements that we are putting up. But I really urge the government to consider this. We have had in the last six or eight months significant issues in my home state. 


We have seen Western Australia and New South Wales complaining about the fact that they are having to prop us up with GST revenues because our economy is not going all that well. One of the reasons our economy is struggling is the impacts on companies like Simplot, because there is no global export shipping service coming into Tasmania since the AAA service pulled out in May last year. It has gone from costing something like $1,800 to get a container to Singapore to costing an additional $1,300 or $1,400 to get it to Melbourne and then the $1,800 to get it to Singapore. Those are the sorts of costs that we are talking about. Bass Strait is one of the most expensive stretches of water on the globe. We need to make sure that we are cost efficient in doing that if we want my home state—and I do want this—to be playing its part in the overall economy of this country. It is absolutely vital that we do that.


The objective of having a coastal Australian shipping industry is a noble one. I share Senator Ludlam's view. It is great to see the four ships that come in and out of my home town of Devonport and the two Australian owned ships that go into your home town of Burnie, Mr Deputy President, that are coastal ships and Australian owned. I acknowledge Senator Urquhart's comments about employment and the importance of those vessels to our local economy, but we have to be looking at this in the sense of a broader economy. 


We have just had the Commonwealth government come in and put $324 million into the Tasmanian health system. Because of the state of the Tasmanian economy, we cannot raise the funds to look after fundamental services in our home state. If we have a strong economy and vibrant manufacturing, export, agricultural, mining and tourism sectors in our home state, we will be able to raise the funds that we need. It will take the pressure off the other states and their GST revenues and allow us to play our part.


My view is that the Greens support these bills because they are all about imposing cost on a whole range of industries. They are about imposing cost on the mining sector, the forestry sector and the fishing sector. They do not want to see economies of scale. They want to make them globally uneconomic to operate so they can have them shut down at a local level. That is why the Greens are supporting these bills. It is not because of any love for the maritime workers of Australia or the Australian shipping industry. They want to see us move back towards cottage-style business and industry. They do not want to see us operating at a globally competitive level. They just want us to scale everything back, to shut everything down, to close off huge areas of Australia to Australians and lock Australians out of Australia. That is why they are supporting this legislation. The Greens are quite happy to see all those additional costs imposed on our industries to make them unsustainable and uneconomical on a global scale. They are not interested in global markets. They do not want global markets. They want to close everything back down to a local level. That is the fundamental reason behind their stance.


The government claims to support our manufacturing sector, our agricultural sector and our food-processing industry, but these are real impacts and there is not just one. This government has done a number of things. I have already mentioned some of them. They have taken away the capacity for continuing voyage permits, adding cost to our food-processing sector, and they are losing markets as a result.   We are losing jobs and volume. With that volume and those jobs comes economic viability. If you go below a certain level you will start looking at the viability of the entire business. We are seeing that with companies, as I said before, like McCain, who are leaving Tasmania and Australia with their vegetable processing.


Here we have a government who continue to impose all of these costs on our businesses and industries—red tape, regulatory burdens, labour costs and all of these things. We need to be considering how we remove costs and burdens from our businesses. Adding additional costs through unnecessary regulatory processes around our shipping is not the way to do it. As I said, the motive to have an Australian shipping industry is a noble one, but let us not do it at the cost of the rest of the economy. Let us not do it at the cost of my home state of Tasmania, because it is having that effect. There is no question that that is the case. There are examples of it on the record already. When I look at a company like Cement Australia, dry bulk goods shippers, I see that they are going to wear a significant cost because of the carbon tax. They are also going to wear a significant cost as a result of this legislation. I can tell you the workers at that plant are very, very concerned about their futures because they are having costs continually added to the business that they work in.


The government will tell us that the additional cost of the carbon tax is minimal. I can tell you that in Tasmania it is going to be felt more than the national average because we have the additional cost of shipping. I know it adds over one per cent to the additional cost of shipping that is going to be added in Tasmania because I have spoken to the businesses who are working out the costs. But it is not just those costs. Even TT-Line, the Tasmanian government owned business, have said that their shipping costs are going to go up in excess of 10 per cent as of 1 July, the carbon tax being one of the reasons.


So we continue to add and add costs to business. We then look at the economy and ask: why is the Tasmanian economy in such a terrible state? On the face of things, most people in Tasmania say it is because of the absolutely hopeless government we have down there that is in coalition with the Greens. It has just destroyed confidence. That, on the face of it, is true, but you have all of these other underlying effects. You have a government that is making ad hoc decisions without any plans, at the whim of the Greens, closing down industries and destroying the investment confidence in the state.


But you also have these other additional costs. The federal government never looks at them as a whole. They will use a national average to say the impact of the carbon tax on the cost of living, for example, is 0.7 per cent. But look at the Bass Strait islands, which also have important manufacturing industries. They are looking at significant costs to their businesses. King Island beef and King Island cheese are some of the best known brand names in Australia. The impact on them of the cost of shipping is going to be significant. It is already high because they are out in the middle of Bass Strait. They are 100 per cent reliant on shipping for the life of their businesses, yet here we have a government that continues to impose additional costs. Each time they say it is only an incremental cost, that it is only a small amount, but they do not add it all up.


So you put $7 million here as the cost on Simplot for the loss of continuing voyage permits and they lose one of their potato chip supply contracts in South Australia as a result. You put another $8 million on top of that for the cost of the carbon tax. How long before they are no longer sustainable? I have to say this company is being very proactive. It is working very hard cooperatively with its growers to ensure that it maintains contracts. It has taken the potatoes this year that it was contracted to take, but it does not have the capacity to take extra when the farmers have a good year. So when the farmers have a good year where is the payoff? There isn't one. Farmers are giving away potatoes with a bale of pea straw at the moment in Tasmania because they cannot sell them to the processors. That is the situation that is occurring. Those sorts of impacts are coming because this government continues to impose additional costs on industry. It might only be incremental each time the government does it, but it continues to add up.


The one thing that we need in this country is cost competitive transport. It is a large country. Huge amounts of our bulk goods, particularly our dry bulk goods, are shipped around the coastline and it is important that we do this in a globally competitive manner. We live in a global economy now. We are seeing the results of that. We are feeling the results of that in our economy. I am not saying they should pay Third World wages—I am not saying any of that, so do not accuse me of that—but we must not put in place artificial regulatory burdens that add additional costs. I have said a number of times that to have an Australian owned shipping industry is a noble idea, but it must be cost competitive so that the rest of our industries that rely on shipping—and my home state in particular is dependent on it—can thrive economically. Otherwise, you are going to have to continue to subsidise my home state. You are going to have to continue to pour money in there when you do not need to.


We need to change the government so we can get some decent decision making—that is granted. That has to occur and the sooner the better. The sooner we get rid of this absolutely hopeless Labor-Green government in Tasmania the better for all of us in my home state. But we do not need the Commonwealth government continuing to impose additional costs that make us unviable economically.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:06):  I am very pleased to support of these bills before the Senate today. I must say I nearly fell asleep during Senator Colbeck's presentation, but let me tell you, Senator Colbeck: we know what it is about. It is about trying to reduce the conditions of seafarers both here and internationally. I was on the committee and I could see what the business people were pushing for. They want to reduce the wages and conditions of seafarers in this country. They do not want to give seafarers a fair go. Your definition of 'globalisation' is exactly what you claim it is not; it is about trying to push the wages and conditions in this country down to the lowest level.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Absolute rubbish.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Macdonald, if you would stop—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Senator Cameron, please stop worrying about the interjections and please address your remarks to the chair.




Senator CAMERON:
  I am never worried about interjections; the more the merrier—certainly from Senator Macdonald and Senator Colbeck. That is fine. It is clear that the two people from the coalition who have contributed to the debate on the bill today really do not understand what it is about—and what would you expect from the coalition? This is a coalition with absolute economic incompetence, with only one argument about trying to improve productivity. We hear about productivity and costs. What was their approach, in the 11½ years of the Howard government? Their approach was to try to destroy the wages and conditions of workers in this country, to try to force them down to the bottom. That is the coalition, and they are waiting with Work Choices in their back pockets, waiting to come back, waiting to support big business and trying to drive wages and conditions down. We heard from Senator Joyce and Senator Colbeck. Let me give a bit of advice to Senator Colbeck: you should stop worrying about this bill, because this is a bill that will benefit Tasmania. What you should do—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Senator Cameron has been around long enough to know that he should not address senators across the table and that his remarks should be through the chair.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. I have brought this to Senator Cameron's attention.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thank you. Through the chair, I would ask Senator Colbeck to concentrate on the real issues for Tasmania. The real issues for Tasmania are to get an effective, efficient shipping fleet of long-term viability in this country, and that is what this bill is about. If the Tasmanian senators actually stood up here and fought for Tasmania, they would be fighting against the sycophantic approach by the Western Australian Liberal Party towards Twiggy Forrest, Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer, who are in there arguing that all the money should be in Western Australia or in Queensland and that Tasmania should be left to swing. That is the position. It is okay for Senator Colbeck to leave the chamber now, but I have a bit of advice for him, through the chair: if you want to stand up for Tasmania then stand up against the mining magnates who want to rip back any decent taxation from this country.


We are a nation that has been built on shipping. We need a viable, growing shipping industry. But that has to be done on decent wages and decent conditions. We hear, 'We're in a globalised economy,' but that is simply code for: 'We want overseas maritime workers to be plying their trade in this country on the lowest wages and conditions possible.' That is what the coalition want. That is what they have always been about. That is why the Howard government—and I see Senator Sinodinos has just walked in—was up to its neck in ripping away the conditions of maritime workers in this country. That is why Senator Sinodinos was sitting around the cabinet table advising John Howard to do something about the carbon price on one hand and then backflipping when he came in here. This is the absolute hypocrisy of the coalition. Their idea of improving productivity is to put dogs on the wharves, to get the thugs on the wharves with their balaclavas, to try to get rid of workers who are earning a decent wage and to put in lower wages and conditions. We all know what the coalition is about. But you have to understand that the MUA is here to stay. They are going to have decent conditions on the wharves and decent conditions in the industries they are involved in.


The arguments being put forward by Senator Joyce do not bear up under any analysis whatsoever. I do not often agree with Senator Joyce, but I do agree with him on the Productivity Commission—you have to take it with a big grain of salt, given its ideological bent to come after working people wherever it can. Senator Joyce's view of the Productivity Commission—on the public record—is that you should use Productivity Commission reports for toilet paper. That is his argument. Yet he comes in here today because the coalition has said, 'You've got to oppose this bill.' And what does he argue for? He argues for a Productivity Commission inquiry. What a disingenuous approach from Senator Joyce. On one hand, he says to use the Productivity Commission reports for toilet paper—even I do not say that!—and, on the other hand, he says, 'Let's have a Productivity Commission inquiry.' What a joke. What a load of rubbish from the coalition—a Productivity Commission inquiry about making sure we get decent wages and conditions and a decent industry in this country. Well, Senator Joyce just gave the game away.


I think Senator Urquhart outlined earlier the National Party's policy on shipping. What is the National Party's policy on shipping? The National Party's policy on shipping is, almost word for word, this bill—what the government is seeking to do. Senator Joyce needs some credibility. I know he does not have a lot of credibility on an economic basis. I know he got sacked because he could not cop his shadow portfolio in finance. But he has to have a little bit of credibility left, and he should support the National Party policy, which says, on page 65, that they would introduce a tonnage tax. I do not suppose that is a 'great big new tax', but they want to introduce a tonnage tax, and they said that if they were in power they would do that from 2011-12. That company tax would be on an opt-in basis, linked to mandatory training arrangements. So the National Party proposes mandatory training arrangements for the industry, and we support that view. But they would introduce a national system of training support under the supervision of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Again, we will cop to that. Also, they would examine ways to reduce the income tax disadvantage suffered by Australian seafarers operating outside Australian waters, compared with seafarers from other nations.


Well, now is the chance for the National Party, instead of getting up here making disingenuous speeches they do not actually believe in, as Senator Joyce did. He had to spend half his speech talking about a carbon price when he does not understand the industry and does not know the benefits that this will provide for the industry. The National Party could now stand up and actually support its policy, what it stands for. Stop flip-flopping around every time the Liberal Party tells you that you cannot support your own policy. Stand up for your own policy and support this bill. That is what you should be doing.


A tonnage tax is on the National Party platform. Ours is a zero tax rate, as recommended by the industry and the Treasury. So we can get some agreement on that. They want a national training system. The bipartisan committee supported that, and so does Labor's shipping bill. We want a tax exemption for Australian seafarers, and the National Party support that. We want to establish a second register, and so do the National Party. So, when this bill comes to the floor, I would expect the National Party to support their own policy by supporting this bill. That is the right thing to do. This is a good bill. It is about ensuring that we have an industry in this country that can help service the needs of Australia. We are a shipping nation and we should support our shipping industry and make sure that we do the right thing by the industry.


Clearly, there was political inference in the shipping industry under the Howard government. It was supported by Senator Sinodinos. So when Senator Sinodinos gets up on his feet here you will know that he was the guy who sat around with John Howard and Peter Reith saying, 'Crush the MUA. Put the dogs on the docks. Put the thugs on the docks. We will drive wages down.' That is Senator Sinodinos for you. The Australian said that, in Senator Sinodinos, a great new economic mind was coming into parliament. Well, Senator Sinodinos sat with John Howard and said, 'How do we fix our economic problems? We try to destroy the MUA. We try to drive wages and conditions down for workers all over this country.' Senator Sinodinos will continue that when he stands up here and opposes this bill.


This is about a sophisticated economic development position, taking this country forward. It is not about the lowest common denominator. It is not about trying to cut costs at the expense of maritime workers or at the expense of maritime workers' jobs. It is about training, about cooperation and a compact, and it is about sophisticated tax support for the industry. These are things that happen overseas, but in the 11½ years that the Howard government were in office they never once thought about it.


So we will have Senator Sinodinos, the so-called economic guru, railing against government interference—yet when he was sitting there with John Howard, working out how we should interfere in industry, what was his plan? His plan was to put the Alsatians on the docks. Put the Rottweilers on the docks. Put the thugs on the docks. That is what was done by the Howard government, supported in the Senate by Senator Macdonald.


They are all sitting there opposing this bill, a bill that is based on a sophisticated approach to industry development. It will bring our industry into line with what happens in about 40 other countries, which is to support our industry with a decent tax base. But what you will get is speeches like the ones we got from Senator Colbeck and from Senator Joyce. I suppose Senator Sinodinos will be a little bit more sophisticated than Senator Joyce, but that will not be very hard.


My view is that, in talking about the problems the country is facing, those problems are not with this bill. This bill is about improving the lot of the industry and the life of maritime workers. It is about improving every aspect of the industry through training and sophisticated tax approaches, to build our industry. It is not about artificial restrictions, as Senator Colbeck would have it. It is not about the cost of shipping, because this will be done in a cost-effective way, a sophisticated way, that means we will have a decent industry in this country. When Senator Sinodinos gets up to speak, that is what he should speak about. He should speak about getting a decent, sophisticated industry in this country that is about bringing Australia back to what it was: a strong maritime nation capable of moving some of our own goods, with workers getting decent wages and conditions. That is the problem.


Here you have to pay decent wages and provide decent conditions. I got a bit sick and tired of listening to some of the submissions at the Senate inquiry. Some of the dry goods people came in and said that they wanted to continue to exploit overseas maritime workers, by keeping them on wages as low as possible, to keep costs down in this country. That is not the way to do business. We have to be a bit more sophisticated than that.


After hearing the speeches from the other side this morning, senators would well know that those opposite have no capacity to deliver on that. They have no understanding of the real drivers of the industry. It is simply about cost. It is not about the tax base and making sure it helps that industry. It is not about the training in the industry. It is not about a compact in the industry, where the unions can sit down with the employers and improve the productive performance of the industry. It has nothing to do with that. They are simply responding, as they always do, to business saying, 'This will cost us a little bit extra.' They run behind their big business mates and will oppose anything that is in the interests of the workers in this country. They will oppose sophisticated approaches because they are all about taking the low road in industrial relations and the low road in productivity. That was borne out by the two speeches we heard this morning.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-06-18,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (11:22):  May I commend the previous speaker on his address, because it confirmed everything we would expect from Senator Cameron: no vision for the future, nothing positive, just an attack on the other side of politics—play the man, not the ball.


Let me begin by saying that as someone who was born in Newcastle, whose father was a seafarer and a member of the Seamen's Union, in the days when the general-secretary of that union was Eliot V Elliot, I have a long familiarity with the maritime trade and I respect the trade and the seafarers in it, because it is not always the safest or most comfortable of occupations. In the time that my father was a member of the Seamen's Union of Australia, I think he enjoyed the camaraderie on the ships, even though his English was not as good as it should have been. So it is good that there are members of the MUA here. My remarks are not addressed to them in the sense of saying, 'You are the problem; you are the villains.' That is not what this is about. What this country is about is how we bring people together; it is about how we create a sense of positivity and a vision for the future that is as accessible as possible to as many people as possible. The reason I say that is that, while there are elements of this bill that are understandable, in the sense of why we have gone down this road to seek to match some of the tax concessions and other benefits that are offered in the international sea trade, given the peculiar conditions that do apply in that trade, we do have to understand—and this is one of the obligations that we have as legislators—and acknowledge that whenever we make decisions, or confer 'benefits' in one sector, we have to make sure that those benefits are not at the cost of other sectors and that therefore the overall benefit to the national economy is not in fact a negative.


In saying that, I recognise, as I said before, the peculiar nature of the world's shipping industry. It is a very competitive industry. It is subject to a lot of volatility—there are times when shipping is in surplus, and that drives down rates and puts added competitive pressures on people, and they therefore seek to undercut each other; there are other times when there is a deficit of shipping and rates tend to go up. In recent times we have had pressure on rates to go up, as people realised they could not keep undercutting each other. So we recognise that volatility and we also recognise the nature of the international flags of convenience and all the other arrangements that operate in international shipping that create a capacity for shipowners to pay less tax in certain jurisdictions. That puts more pressure on other jurisdictions, such as ours, where we have, if you like, more of a First World tax regime.


I also recognise that around the world, starting with the US and the Jones act, there are a lot of First World countries that do restrict shipping with policies of cabotage, and that, in the context of international trade negotiations that are going on at the moment, there is not much progress being made on issues like removing cabotage—because, ultimately, if we are to have free trade and investment, that means all countries must take off their restrictions. So I recognise that we are playing on a very unlevel playing field.


But, in that context, we have before us a set of bills that do seek to create some very special conditions in the maritime industry. It would be fantastic if we could extend these conditions in Australia so that, in any industry in Australia where there was some potential competition and where there was some benefit conferred by foreign govern­ments, we would seek as a government to match that. But in a sense, looking at this from the national economy perspective, we cannot do that; so we have to look at the costs and benefits of what we do in one sector and the impact that has on other sectors.


In looking at the costs and benefits of this legislation, we therefore have to take—and this is why my colleague Senator Joyce was supporting a Productivity Commission inquiry—an economy-wide view of how this sort of legislation would work. We have to take into account the impact of any increased red tape or regulation. We have to take into account the potential impact of increased costs for shippers and users of imported products and the like. We have to take into account, in other words, what the economists like to call the general equilibrium effects of doing things in one sector as they cross over into other sectors.


One other point I would like to make is that in relation to anything that involves international trade there is a lot of literature around, but often there are benefits in moving unilaterally on trade restrictions. Often we keep restrictions back as bargaining chips in international trade negotiations, and we can certainly do that with cabotage. But my point is this: there are also a lot of benefits to be gained from unilaterally moving to take advantage of cheap foreign goods and services that are potentially available, including in the shipping area, if they have benefits for the broader economy. But, as I said before, today is not the day to go into that. My point is simply that I support what Senator Joyce has said in relation to a Productivity Commission inquiry. That is a canvas on which we can look at the costs and benefits of going down this route as a whole.


Let me—as someone who was also involved in the events of 1998 around the wharves—paint the context of that. That was a context where our cranage rates were seen as being very low, by international standards, for a First World country. The issue was that, during the Hawke-Keating era, despite various attempts to address that, we had not made sufficient progress. That is why there had to be some sort of breakthrough and, in concert with the industry, there was an attempt by the Howard government to break through on the wharves—yes, some of it was not particularly pretty, but it was a situation that seemed to have gone beyond the point of dialogue and something needed to be done to cut through, and reforms were made. But since then there has been slippage on those reforms. As John Howard once said, reform is one of those ever-receding finish lines: we need continuing reform. This package will aid the industry in a very short term sense. But, unless the productivity compact that the MUA and others are talking about delivers real, enduring, sustainable productivity change, we will not have the shipping industry we deserve. Make no mistake, with our freight task set to double and even treble by 2020 along the eastern seaboard, coastal shipping must play a bigger role. There is an opportunity there. The industry and the union have to be more entrepreneurial and more willing to take risks to get rid of some of the work practices of the past in order to do this. Some people may say, 'We'll never match the wage rates or costs of some jurisdictions overseas.' I think that is defeatist. Why can't we look at greater productivity and innovation? Why can't everything be on the table that potentially restricts our capacity to do better? We are great innovators in Australia. We have a capacity to do that in this sector as well. I am very concerned that we do not have a situation where the government gives away these benefits, in good faith saying that these are being put on the table, and in return the productivity compact does not deliver the change that we are looking for. This is not about reducing wages. That is unsustainable. We all know that. If we reduce wages in one sector that just encourages people to leave that sector and go somewhere else. That does not actually build up an industry. What builds up an industry is when you create incentives for greater productivity and wages go up off the back of that. That is what we are about. That is positivity. That is about being optimistic about the industry of the future. 


I suppose what I am saying is that in seeking to refer this matter to the Productivity Commission we also want to give time to see what will happen as a result of the productivity compact that the industry is putting together with the MUA and other stakeholders. We strongly support that process going forward because of all the evidence we have received from people within the industry. It is easy for someone like Senator Cameron to deride people in the industry and say that they have a vested interest. Of course they have got a vested interest. Their livelihoods are at stake as well. They want to know that they will be able to ship. 


We have had evidence from people within the industry that they are concerned about the potential impact of costs on them. So we need someone who is impartial, a third party, to weigh up that evidence. That is not to cast aspersions on the public servants who have put together the regulatory impact statement; but, by definition, they say that they were unable to take into account actual numbers around what the productivity compact could do, because they had to take at face value that there will be a productivity compact and assume that it would have the benefits and the positive effects that the government says it will. So we need a rigorous process to look at this. 


In that regard I have come across a number of comments from various people within the industry. Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics announced on 30 May that they could not commit to engaging the coastal shipping after 1 July, when the legislation takes effect. They stated: 


Based on these proposed changes and new requirements it may become very difficult for WWL to continue participating in the coastal trade. 


On 12 June, online marine publication Lloyd's List published an article entitled 'Coastal shipping reforms create contrary and adverse outcomes' highlights concerns with the shipping reform package. It states: 


Minister ... Albanese’s new licensing regime, designed to promote Australian participation in coastal shipping, appears to be in the process of creating unintended consequences and adverse results. 


Maritime executives argue that the system as a whole could also work to the disadvantage of domestic carriers. Shippers may end up moving large, heavy or unwieldy cargo by road rather than by ship. And Australian cargo shippers look likely to be put at a disadvantage as carriers reduce service offerings. Break bulk carriers, especially tramp operators, envisage that the requirements for being granted a one-year temporary licence, which involves notifying bureaucrats of an intended minimum of five voyages in advance, will likely result in them being unable to offer a service. 


Shipping Australia in its submission to the House committee inquiry states: 


The overall effectiveness of the Bills taken as a whole is, in our view, dependent on the productivity improvements that will arise from the proposed compact between the unions and employers.


That is why, as I say, it would be good to have time for the Productivity Commission to go through that process. I recognise in any negotiation that it is useful to be able to say, 'The government have delivered on their end; therefore, it is now up to us as unions and employers to get together.' My point is simply this: there needs to be an objective process to make sure that what is being put on the table as genuine cost reductions, productivity improvements and innovations will deliver the sorts of benefits that the government's own regulatory impact statement is suggesting should come forward out of this particular shipping industry reform program. 


I go back to an issue raised by Senator Cameron in his contribution about the low road versus the high road on productivity, and that is: whatever changes the coalition may ultimately make to industrial relations policy, shifting the balance more towards the centre, the point is that they are all aimed at promoting productivity. If you go back and look at the record of the Howard govern­ment, including in the period of the dreaded Work Choices—the industrial relations policy that dare not speak its name—real wages were going up, productivity was going up and the economy was going strongly ahead. It is possible to achieve that sort of win-win situation. Too often this government has taken the view that it has to intervene to protect people. The best way to protect people is to educate them and to help make them strong and dependent on their own capacity to find their way in the world. There is no way you can do this simply by the government always acting as the referee because in the long run you can never create really independent, capable people if they are always dependent on government propping them up. I fear that this is a sector where for too long governments have intervened in various ways and the results have not been what they should have been. 


In summary, I support Senator Joyce's comments and the comments of all of my colleagues, including Senator Colbeck, who spoke about the particular issues in Tasmania. On both sides of the house there is a commitment to having an internationally viable shipping industry and, as I said before, we recognise the unlevel playing field that has developed in this particular sector. But it is not a reason why we should necessarily put forward ideas in this sector which perhaps provide an advantage to this sector over other sectors and may not be providing a national net benefit. On that point, I finish my remarks.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (11:36):  I am pleased to speak in support of the Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill 2012 and related bills. They are vitally important to the ongoing sustainability of Australia's domestic shipping industry: setting the right conditions for operators to do business and maintain Australian flagships, restoring fairness to the architecture of the system of industrial relations that underpins Australian flagships, promoting health and safety in what is an inherently dangerous occupation and, importantly, providing incentives for the provision of training and the skilling of the workforce to ensure its long-term sustainability. We are an island nation and 99 per cent of Australia's international trade is conducted by ship. More than $200 billion worth of product is transported from our ports every year. This represents around 10 per cent of global sea-based trade. Australia has become the fourth largest carrier of sea trade on the planet. But despite the fact that 99 per cent of Australia's trade is conducted by ship, less than one-fifth of the trade is carried by an Australian merchant fleet. There are currently only 22 major trade ships carrying the Australian flag. This compares to 55 flagged Australian ships during the years of the Keating government in 1995. So over that period we have had a reduction by more than half in the number of Australian flagships and that slow decline has happened while Australian exports to the rest of the world have been growing. That is why these bills are so important and that is why the Senate must pass these bills. These bills mean that productivity and growth will be returned to the Australian shipping industry. They are a significant set of reforms that will revitalise an industry that was unfortunately forgotten during the Howard years. 


The Shipping Reform (Tax Incentives) Bill and the Tax Laws Amendment (Shipping Reform) Bill are the first pillars of the reform package and they are vital to Australian shipping operators. Our shipping companies are competing against foreign operators that do have competitive taxation regimes and regulation of employment arrangements. The reforms contained in these bills will ensure that Australian flagged ships are provided with the same incentives: a zero rate of tax, meaning income from Australian flagged passenger and cargo vessels will not attract company tax; accelerated depreciation arrangements, meaning that Australian flagged vessels can now depreciate ships over 10 years instead of the current 20-year period; rollover relief for selected capital assets, meaning that when a ship is sold for profit the tax liability can be deferred by replacing the sold vehicles; tax exemptions for seafarers working overseas on qualifying vessels, meaning that a refundable tax offset will be available to Australian employers of Australian resident seafarers engaged in international trade; and, a royalty withholding tax exemption where vessels are leased by an Australian company from foreign owners under a demise or bareboat charter. These are a fantastic new set of opportunities and set of conditions for a fair and reasonable shipping industry in Australia. 


The Shipping Registration Amendment (Australian International Shipping Register) Bill is the second part of the reform package. That will ensure that the Australian International Shipping Register will help our industry grow and take advantage of the enormous opportunities created by growth in the export shipping sector. Vessels on the international register will be Australian flagged. When international vessels undertake an overseas voyage, they must provide the crew with terms and conditions in line with the Maritime Labour Convention. This is the same practice used by major maritime nations that offer international registers. When Australian international shipping register vessels work domestic coastal routes, importantly all the crew, irrespective of nationality, will be covered by the Fair Work Act. This will remove that insidious practice that occurred under the Howard government of 'ships of shame' operating in Australian waters, employing foreign crew and giving them pay and conditions inferior to the basic standards provided by fair industrial relations laws in this country. Importantly, these bills will also promote safety. The crews will be covered by Australian domestic occupational health and safety laws and also Australian environmental laws.


This issue is close and dear to my heart. My grandfather was a wharfie. He worked at the Hungry Mile in Sydney for many years in the days when it was tough to work as a wharfie. He was quite badly injured on the job and hospitalised for a significant time. He broke his leg and fractured his pelvis and was in hospital for a couple of months. During his period of hospitalisation not once did anyone from the company that he worked for come to visit him or his family, with any concern for his welfare. These were the days before adequate occupational health and safety laws and adequate coverage of a person's income through workers compensation. 


Naturally his family were concerned about how they would survive. But they survived for one reason. That reason was that my father was a member of his union, the Waterside Workers Federation. During his period in hospital, at least once a week and sometimes two or three times a week the union organiser, a fellow by the name of Tas Bull, someone who went on to lead that union and become a great leader and promoter of workplace rights in this country, would visit. He made sure that our family never went without and that the family had the ability to survive. That is the tradition in which the union, now the MUA, has operated in this country. That is the reason why my grandmother always said to me in the wake of that accident, 'Always join the union and remember what the union did for our family. We wouldn't have survived without them.' No-one from the company ever came down to visit my grandfather in hospital and ensure that he was okay and that the family could survive. But his mates on the wharves, the wharfies, who were members of the union, regularly carried the hat around and ensured that there was an income for the family to survive. So it is important that we continue to promote occupational health and safety and adequate workers compensation laws for people working on our wharves and for those who are working in seafaring around our coast. These laws do that. They restore fairness and equity which, unfortunately, was diminished during the years of the Howard government. I find it somewhat remarkable that Senator Sinodinos would refer to what occurred on the wharves in 1998, when we saw those insidious images of dogs and people in balaclavas attacking Australian workers and their conditions, as a breakthrough. It was nothing less than a disaster. It was a disgrace and, in the end, was ultimately found to be illegal by the Australian courts.


This government does not promote those sorts of practices and will not allow them to occur on Australian wharves or in our domestic shipping industry. That is why these laws are important. We prefer to promote cooperation between seafarers and their employers and between wharfies and their employers as a means of promoting productivity and ensuring that we are dealing with the issues faced from international competition. These bills will promote cooperation.


The bills will provide for the introduction of the Maritime Workforce Development Forum. Our maritime industry currently employs around 14,000 people and one of the greatest challenges it faces, similar to the rest of Australian industry, is an ageing workforce. The current average age across the sector is almost 45. Skills, education and training must be at the heart of any industry to see it grow and prosper. The Maritime Workforce Development Forum, which is an important part of these reforms, will address areas that are fundamental to building our skills base. This will include a workforce plan for the medium term to address issues, including the ageing workforce and the most immediate skills gaps.


The bills are a product of an extensive period of consultation with industry, and amendments to the bills have been introduced in response to issues raised by stakeholders through the parliamentary inquiries. In February 2009, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport formed an advisory group to work together to implement the Rebuilding Australia's coastal shipping industry report recommendations. A discussion paper was released on 1 December 2010 and submissions from the industry provided a great amount of feedback on the proposed reforms that are before the Senate today.


I do take issue with some of the comments raised by Senator Sinodinos and other speakers in relation to Simplot's comments both to the parliamentary committee and publicly regarding these reforms. The comments made by others in respect of the comments by Simplot are quite simply misleading. Simplot's comments relate to increased costs for services at Bell Bay. They are not related to shipping reforms. Simplot denies the $7 million figure that has been put by others, so it is misleading for some senators to come into this place and use issues associated with other occurrences in the world economy as opposition to these reforms.


The feedback from many involved in the consultation period and from the parliamentary inquiries was positive. Many understand that these reforms are vital to Australian shipping. This is a sector of our economy that must be provided with the right tax incentives and conditions for investment and the right conditions to ensure fairness and reasonableness in the provision of wages, conditions and occupational health and safety laws to ensure that this industry can grow and flourish. The Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy package corrects the mistakes made by previous governments in an important industry for our economy. It replaces years of decline and sets our shipping industry on a steady course with an even keel towards growth and prosperity. I commend the bills to the Senate.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:49):  I remain nonplussed as to what we are doing in this place debating this particular legislation since it will in no way achieve the goals that have been set by the minister and the government. Since the Navigation Act 1912, coastal shipping permits have always protected Australian flagged vessels but, unfortunately, they have not been competitive internationally, they have not been viable and they are not viable now. I am pleased to see that there was one point of commonality with Senator Thistlethwaite, and that is that both of us in fact had grandfathers who were union members, in my case, of the Lumpers Union on the Fremantle wharves around the 1920s and 1930s. So I come to this particular argument with the same degree of enthusiasm but from a different perspective because mine is one of trying to encourage new business and trying to grow business.


Other speakers have mentioned the fact that we are a coastal nation and that 99 per cent of our export and import activity comes by sea. The other point to be made is that Asia is the growing region of the world. Europe is now closed. Europe is declining not only in terms of numbers but also economically and we are seeing the biggest shift in the world economy since the industrial revolution to Asia. We also know that to survive and to take our place in the Asian world we have to be internationally competitive with Asian suppliers, and this legislation is simply not going to do that.


We are aware that under the current legislation, as in the past and as will be in the future, Australian registered vessels already have priority in the movement of cargo within our coastal trade. So one must ask the question: why and how is it that we have seen such a decline in the number of coastal vessels under the Australian flag? It is now some 22 and going down.  Do we think that these incentives, as they are described in the legislation, are going to do anything to encourage Australian flagged ships to remain so or indeed to encourage overseas shipowners to have their vessels Australian flagged? The answer regrettably is no, they are not. Why? Because countries with which we compete, including Singapore and others, already offer the same sorts of incentives that are contained within this legislation. So, unfortunately, of themselves these are not going to be attractive to the owners of Australian flagged ships and, in particular, incoming overseas shipowners, and I want to go into that in more detail.


We know that if we are going to see an increase in the Australian flagged, owned and controlled coastal shipping industry it has got to be through overseas shipowners coming with their ships into our waters and wanting to have their vessels within our coastal passage trade. What is the particular impact of all this on my state of Western Australia? And, of course, Madam Deputy President Boyce, you would be well aware, as with your state of Queensland, of the importance to this national economy of the resources sector and the primary production sector in our states. Let me quote some figures just to put it into perspective for you. For Western Australia last year, 2010-11, overall production—and this is mainly from iron ore—in the Pilbara region was $57.4 billion of trade. For the offshore petroleum industry, and this is separate to the figures that I have just given you and principally out of the North West Shelf and the Pilbara, it was $23 billion last year and we know that that figure is increasing. If I look at the Goldfields-Esperance region, including gold but also other mineral commodities, I see it was $8½ billion last year. Those are all over vast distances within my state. If I look at the Midwest region based around Geraldton, I see a figure of $2.6 billion. But, with the construction of the Oakajee port and the opening up of the magnetite iron ore industry, the Midwest will be another Pilbara, so that figure of $2.6 billion will pale into insignificance as the magnetite industry gets underway. The only other figure to give you is from the Wheatbelt region. This is based principally on grain but there is also $1¼ billion of iron ore in the Wheatbelt region. That figure is $2.5 billion.


Why is all of this important? Because of the urgent need for us to have an efficient and competitive coastal shipping industry. We know at the moment of the congestion on the roads out of Perth because of the heavy haulage of massive sized equipment. The fact that, because of competition with other users of the road, these loads can only being shipped out of Perth at certain times adds immeasurably to the cost, reducing productivity and inducing delays. The weight of this sort of equipment—often 300 to 400 tonnes—moving on our roads causes damage to the rural road network. You can imagine the challenge associated with getting this equipment over bridges. In fact, it has to be jacked up and moved slowly over those bridges. We in WA, as with those in other states, have got a tremendous incentive to see a rebirth of our coastal shipping trade. Unfortunately, the legislation before the Senate falls far short of allowing us to achieve that.


Out of all this, what do we have? We have poor productivity and we have poor efficiency in the use of resources. So obviously we want to see, and we have the incentive for, so much of this go on to vessels at Fremantle or at Henderson or wherever they are assembled and to go by sea up to the Pilbara ports—or down to the port of Esperance—and to Geraldton et cetera. Unfortunately, we are not going to see it with this legislation because there are no incentives for overseas shipowners to bring their vessels into our waters.


It is my understanding that the legislation falls short particularly with regard to bulk cargoes. We know the circumstance that exists at the moment, that being the single-voyage permits that are available. Under this scheme they will be discontinued. When you have a look at what has occurred in recent times, the difficulty in being able to schedule cargoes further in advance is so obvious to everybody. Inaccurate vessel scheduling, port congestion, last-minute requirements for shipping, weather conditions—we all know the factors that are involved. What we need is legislation that accelerates and facilitates accommodation of the unnecessary or unexpected or unforeseen changes in vessel loadings, schedulings et cetera. The new legislation does not achieve this. It achieves something only on the basis of predicting well into the future what the demands are going to be. Then there is the associated administratively impossible task, from the shipowners', operators' or charterers' point of view, of actually making those changes. It is not obvious to me—and perhaps when the minister speaks he may be able to explain this to us—where the benefit comes of this bureaucracy and this inevitable added cost. I cannot see where it assists anybody.


It is certainly not going to assist an Australian coastal trader. Very often, if the type of vessel that is needed to be used—it might be a vessel for moving heavy haulage, so with a heavy crane, or whatever it is—is not available within our own coastal fleet, then of course an overseas-registered vessel will be necessary. So how it is going to be of benefit to have this long period of congestion and to have this bureaucracy is absolutely beyond me.


I know that the question of fuel—particularly the unavailability of fuel—has been addressed in some of the more recent negotiations. In the consultations that I understand are to come, I hope that matter will be addressed. If not, I hope it will be addressed through a MIM; but, again, we all know the difficulty associated with the on-time delivery of bulk fuel. I recall that, in running a fuel distribution business in Tasmania, more than once the so-called 'just in time' philosophy of delivery of bulk fuel into that state very nearly became 'just too late'. Certainly, trying to predict weeks or months in advance when they would need to schedule those cargoes would be fraught, I believe, with the associated administrative burdens.


I ask: what will the cost impact of this new legislation on customers be? Upon whom will the increased freight rates rest? Upon whom will the inefficiencies rest? And, of course, if there is a substantial move from road to sea transport—and I hope there is, if we can get it right—what will the cost impact on the trucking industry be? How will the trucking industry, drivers, TWU members and others relate? I cannot see how there will be anything other than an increased cost burden which will inevitably be passed on to customers.


The questions that I really want addressed are these. How does this legislation, as it is proposed, increase international competitive­ness? How does it attract overseas shipowners to bring their vessels into our waters and have them Australian flagged? What benefits or advantages are there for them over and above those that they currently enjoy? How does the legislation address the past concerns, existing at this time, which have led us to effectively a decimated coastal shipping fleet of 20 or 22 vessels? I cannot see how this legislation is going to change that situation and make it attractive in the first instance to overseas owners or indeed in the longer term to Australian shipowners.


How will this legislation contain costs? Where are the cost savings to the end customer? We are all aware of the significant cost that is freight in our economy. We know what the impact of the infamous carbon tax is going to be on the cost of freight, particularly in my state, where distances are so vast. I was in Kalgoorlie, Karratha and Geraldton in the last 10 days. At the top of everybody's list in those places remote from the capital city is: what is the impost, the increased cost of freight, caused by the carbon tax going to be? If we see this movement, it will not change it.


I ask: how does this legislation reduce red tape? How does it reduce regulation? This Labor government has increased it and introduced new legislation, new regulations. I think the figures I have seen are that, in the term of the combined Rudd and Gillard governments, there have been some 16,000 new regulations to which business is subjected, with the removal of only 76. I want to know on behalf of the Australian people: in this legislation, where do we see a reduction of red tape? I cannot see it.


I want to know how the temporary licence system, to which I have referred, in any way increases productivity. Australia is absolutely in neutral and probably going backwards in its national productivity at this time—a time when its international competitors are actually increasing their productivity. These are the concerns that we should all be addressing in this place.


I ask about the industrial compact between the unions and employers: can somebody from the other side explain to me how that is going to increase productivity? How is it going to protect jobs in the industry? It has been said that this is not about seeing a diminution of incomes, salaries and wages; it is, however, about protecting and growing employment. And yet the legislation, as I see it, will have the opposite effect.


We see linkage to the International Transport Workers Federation, and I think that is to be applauded. Why, for example, in the legislation, do we not see the wages pegged to ITF levels? ITF internationally has a very, very generous wage system, and that of course is to be applauded. It is my understanding that a Filipino able seaman actually earns a higher salary than a general practitioner does in the Philippines, so ITF levels are obviously appropriate. Let us see legislation in place that ties these wages to ITF levels so that the fear of a wages hike after this legislation comes into existence can be allayed and put to rest.


I concur with those of my colleagues who say that before this legislation is passed, before it is imposed on the Australian people, it should be the subject of a Productivity Commission review. I am of the view that if this legislation is going to further diminish the importance of the Australian flagged industry, as I suspect it will, if this legislation is not going to attract international shipowners to bring their vessels into our waters as Australian flagged vessels, if this legislation is going to drive up the cost of freight to the end customer and is not going to take freight off roads and onto coastal shipping, then it is a waste of everybody's legislative time. It is therefore my point of view that the legislation in its current form should not be passed. It should be referred to the Productivity Commission so that we can get the view of an independent umpire before we proceed further.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:06):  I rise also today to speak on the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill 2012 and associated bills. The coalition recognises that the coastal shipping trade plays a vital role in Australia's freight task. For a variety of reasons, most related to the lack of cost competitiveness of Australian shipping, the number of Australian-registered vessels has declined over the last few years, and there are only 22 Australian flagged ships operating today. The coalition is supportive of constructive measures to increase the number of Australian vessels internationally and the number used for coastal shipping. However, these bills carry a number of Labor trademarks that make it impossible to support the proposed measures. 


As we on this side have come to expect from Labor, these bills have been poorly drafted, with minimal or no consultation with key stakeholders and, where consultation has occurred, with a lack of regard for the advice that has been put forward. These bills have a short implementation frame and they defy common sense. They will serve only to increase red tape and the regulatory burden for industry and the cost of freight. We are not convinced that the five bills that comprise the shipping reform package will stimulate growth in the number of Australian ships on our coast or maximise the use of Australian flagged vessels.


One of the primary concerns amongst witnesses to the Economics Legislation Committee's inquiry into these bills was the lack of consultation with key stakeholders in relation to the impacts they will have on industry. The first draft of the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill was released for public comment just before Christmas last year; however, a major redraft was required, and a second version of the bill was released in February, together with the other bills comprising the package. This meant that consultation was undertaken for only a few weeks. Shortly thereafter, the minister introduced the package to the parliament—on 22 March 2012. The package that was introduced included new provisions that had not been contemplated in the initial consultation process. Despite this, Labor did not even see fit to complete another regulatory impact statement with department officials at the Senate inquiry. It was adamant that none of the many alterations arising from the redraft would impact the original RIS, but the evidence, both at the hearing and from the submissions, suggested otherwise.


The bills were referred to the House of Reps Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications and the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for consideration, but the House committee was given an extremely limited time frame to examine the bills and the Senate report, only tabled late last week, means that the House did not benefit from the Senate's advice prior to voting on the bills. A number of witnesses to the inquiry put on the public record their disappointment with this lack of consultation. Many witnesses said that they raised their issues and concerns directly with the department and the minister's officers, only to receive stony silence in response. Ms Margie Thompson, a member of the Australian Dry Bulk Shipping Users Group, which collectively accounts for 60 per cent of the coastal shipping task, told the committee that when her group tried to raise their concerns—and their concerns, certainly on their face, seem valid and substantial—they were simply told that the minister had set the policy direction and the department was trying to work the legislation around that. Apparently the minister knows better than Australia's primary users of coastal shipping! It is extraordinary to think that Labor would shut the door on the biggest users of coastal shipping in this country when devising a package of bills that will have such a dramatic impact on the industry. It is valid to ask: what is the purpose of the shipping industry? It is a service industry; it is not an industry that is there for itself; it is there to move freight and to do so as efficiently as possible. Efficiency and timeliness in moving freight have to be the primary concerns when looking at legislation that impacts on coastal shipping. Sure, there are other considerations, but ultimately the industry exists for the reason of moving freight, and that has to be the primary concern.


The lack of consultation is a common characteristic of this government and it is not the first time that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee has heard from witnesses about such concerns. 'The minister knows best' appears to be this government's default response when drafting legislation—until the eleventh hour, when we so often see those opposite scrambling to amend the unworkable as a consequence of their inability to listen to stakeholders and take on board the valid objections and concerns that were raised with them early in the process.


Another major issue raised by witnesses to this inquiry is that the bills are unlikely to meet their objective. To give some perspective on the issue, let me outline the size of the coastal shipping industry. The current market supports 17 Australian vessels that move Australian product around the coast—which is about 70 per cent of the total coastal trading market. Foreign vessels make up the remaining 30 per cent of the market, which is around eight ships. So we are talking about measures designed to foster a greater degree of Australian shipping activity in a market that already has 70 per cent. If it were possible to convert the remaining 30 per cent into Australian flagged vessels, that would work out to around a further eight ships. That is what we are talking about. We are dealing with a very small industry in terms of coastal trading task, which, in the most wildly optimistic of predictions, could only expect to 'revitalise' the industry to the extent of an additional half a dozen to eight vessels.


It is also of particular concern to me that, when I asked officials from the department of infrastructure and transport at the economics committee inquiry about the effectiveness of the bills, they were reluctant to commit to any guarantees that the bills would actually revitalise Australia's coastal shipping industry. Department officials said it was difficult for them to assess exactly how many vessels would be added to the Australian register or how many companies would take up the incentives to boost the numbers of Australian flagged vessels. Officials would only say that in their opinion this suite of bills 'provide an investment platform and strong regulatory basis for access to the coast'. This is hardly a satisfactory justification for the implementation of a rushed and sweeping reform package, and I am not the only one who thinks that—even the Labor senators in attendance at the inquiry were questioning the effectiveness and necessity of these bills. I am also disappointed that Hansard does not pick up pauses, because the long pause from department officials in response to my question, 'Are you confident that it'—that is, the number of Australian flagged vessels—'will increase?' would be better described as a deafening silence. That question was finally answered with a repetition of the default position of the department that the package will provide a 'strong investment platform'. In the absence of department officials jumping up and down and telling me how wonderful this reform package is, I can only take it to mean that, no, they are not confident that this suite of bills will increase investment in Australian coastal shipping.


These bills will also increase red tape and the regulatory burden for both users of coastal shipping and industry participants. The bills abolish part VI of the Navigation Act 1912 and, in doing so, abolish the current permit and licensing system. Many companies have identified deficiencies in the temporary licence system established under the proposed act. The proposed scheme will require users seeking a temporary licence to carry out a minimum of five voyages per year, the details of which must be provided at the commencement of each year. According to the explanatory memorandum to the Coastal Trading Bill, a temporary licence will be issued for 'only those voyages where the required information is known, including expected loading and discharge ports and cargo type and volume'. This is a significant variation from our current situation under which two voyages a year are determined as being incidental and not requiring a licence. Of course, this determination was made by our current Prime Minister when she was 'minister for fair work'. How can the government possibly expect industry to provide such detailed information for an entire 12-month period in advance? The answer is that it cannot. Many submitters and witnesses to both the House and Senate inquiries said that it is simply impossible to forecast the movement of such cargoes over a 12-month period.


At the inquiry, Caltex argued that the minimum voyage requirement is not practical or reasonable and even went so far as to suggest that this could reduce transparency within the industry, because it would encourage shippers to include bogus voyages in their applications to meet the licensing requirements. But, as we all know, transparency is not of importance to this Labor government. Caltex and BP submitted to the inquiry that the changes to the licensing regime will also jeopardise Australia's fuel supply security by eliminating the flexibility to divert supply to meet emergency demand. It is incredible to think that, under these proposed bills, a fuel carrier could be forced to remain stationary for up to two days whilst bureaucrats decide whether it is permitted to change course to meet emergency supply of shortages to aviation fuel or petrol supplies.


Fuel companies have also highlighted that the proposed changes to licensing, which will see legs of journeys up for 'bid', will create safety risks in the transportation of flammable and dangerous goods. Sucrogen, a producer of sugar and molasses, also raised concerns in relation to the changes to the licensing regime because they could prevent it and other companies in Australia carrying their own cargo on their own ships. The transport of molasses, a product whose end use often results in consumption by humans, requires strict quality control and specific requirements. Sucrogen is currently able to ensure this quality control by using its own internationally flagged vessel, which it uses on the coastal trade, but may not be able to continue this practice under the proposed legislation. Not only does this defy all logic and common sense but also it could force such companies to cease coastal trading and instead export their goods to avoid this requirement. For example, instead of sending its molasses from Queensland to Victoria for processing, Sucrogen's evidence was that it might well find that, depending on how far around the coast it went, it would be marginal to continue the process of sending the molasses to other Australian areas for processing. It might become cheaper to send molasses overseas to be processed and to bring sugar directly from overseas into Australia—so there goes Australian industry and Australian downstream processing. The coastal shipping task would also be lowered, which is counterproductive to the overall purpose of these bills. The changes to the temporary licensing requirements can only be described as illogical and protectionist.


In addition to a significant increase in the regulatory burden, a number of submitters raised concerns about increased costs for coastal shipping and resultant job losses across manufacturing and industry. At a time when manufacturing and industry are struggling with a two-speed economy, a high Australian dollar and weak global demand and are facing the carbon tax, this Labor government wants to place further costs on the way manufacturing and industry transport their goods around Australia. The Australian Dry Bulk Shipping Users Group, who, as I have mentioned, carry 60 per cent of the current coastal shipping task, are so concerned by the impact these bills will have on their transport costs that they commissioned an independent report by Deloitte Access Economics, which confirmed that these bills would result in an increase to transport costs of at least 16 per cent. Shipping costs currently are around 30 per cent of the group's outgoings; now, just in time for the implementation of the carbon tax, this government is going to introduce legislation that will increase those costs further.


Already we have seen one global shipping operator announce its intentions to exit the coastal shipping market in Australia, with WWL announcing in May that it could not commit to engaging in coastal shipping after 1 July 2012. Like so many pieces of legislation, Labor is attempting to rush through the coastal shipping reform package without adequate consultation or consideration of the impact it will have on industry.


If we really want to work out how to revitalise coastal shipping in Australia and increase the number of Australian flagged vessels the logical path is to commission a Productivity Commission inquiry. Such an inquiry would investigate and address stakeholders' concerns and determine what impact these complex proposed regulatory changes would have on the Australian coastal shipping industry, the cost of freight and the cost to coastal shipping customers. It would also determine how best to proceed to ensure that we get an efficient and cost-competitive shipping industry based out of Australian which fosters increased activity. These bills should be rejected and the issue of the future of Australian flagged shipping should be sent to the Productivity Commission for further consideration.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:20):  I have listened with some interest to the debate on the shipping reform package. My colleagues on this side have gone forensically through the details of the bills and have explained in the clearest of terms why these bills in their present form are not in the best interests of either the shipping industry or Australia generally. I note that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry report into these bills, which was tabled this morning, contained a recommendation by the committee's coalition members that the bill not be passed, contrary to what Senator Ludlam said earlier. I am not quite sure where Senator Ludlam was, in view of his comment earlier that the bills went through the Senate committee inquiry without any concerns being expressed—unanimously, I think is what he said. Clearly, almost half of the Senate committee was unhappy with the bills as they stood.


My interest in these bills relates to two industries in my home state of Queensland and to the workers who rely on those industries for their living. Senator Cameron made an impassioned speech earlier, no doubt more for the gallery than for the chamber, in which he said that everything the coalition does is with the intent of forcing down workers' wages and reducing their employment opportunities. Clearly, Senator Cameron's definition of working people is 'working people who vote for the Labor Party'—one of the 21 per cent of Australians who do vote for the Labor Party these days—'and who live in Labor Party electorates'. Clearly, Senator Cameron's concern for working families and jobs for workers does not extend to the state of Queensland or, in particular, to the sugar industry or the industries around the Gladstone area of Queensland. Curiously, both of those electorates do not have Labor members and are never likely to because the workers in those areas understand that the Labor Party is no longer interested in their future and in their employment prospects. I might say that the same applies to nearly every federal seat in Queensland, where the Labor Party has very few seats these days apart from a couple in inner-city Brisbane. Clearly workers in rural and regional Queensland—and I suggest in rural and regional Australia more generally—are concerned at Labor's approach to their employment and their future.


Two of the industries affected by this legislation—because it will add to their costs—are the cement industry out of Gladstone and the sugar industry of the Queensland eastern seaboard. It might be appropriate just to mention that Australia is the third-largest exporter of sugar in the world. There are some 6,000 canegrowers in Australia, with more than 4,000 farms growing sugar along the eastern seaboard of the country. The sugar industry directly or indirectly supports 40,000 jobs in Australia and underpins the economic stability of many coastal communities. In fact, it is a part of the social fabric that has woven itself through the development of coastal towns up and down the coast of Queensland.


As Senator Bushby just said, and as the evidence to the committee demonstrated, there is every prospect that with additional costs on the industry it will be incumbent upon the industry perhaps with a view to its long-term economic future to send molasses overseas for processing rather than using Australian workers in Australian mills, which it currently supports by coastal shipping around the coast of Australia to where the molasses is further processed. If the costs are the straw that breaks the camel's back, so to speak, of the sugar industry then not only workers in the coastal shipping industry but also those workers in the few manufacturing areas that still operate in Australia will be disadvantaged. There is the prospect—and evidence of this was given at the inquiry—of sugar being imported from Asia into Australia. You can imagine what that might do to this wonderful, very significant and longstanding industry, which employs, I repeat, over 40,000 people indirectly and directly along the east coast of Australia. While Senator Cameron says, 'Oh, yes, we have to look after the seafarers'—and we all want to do that—he also has to expand his horizons to see what might happen to the jobs of other workers in Australia. They will be put in jeopardy by the continual incremental increase in the cost of doing business in Australia.


Evidence was given to the Senate inquiry, I understand, by the cement industry. I do not have the figures—I was not actually at the committee—but I have been approached by those involved in the cement industry. Rather than manufacturing cement in Gladstone and shipping it to Townsville, just 600 or 800 kilometres up the road, using coastal shipping, it will become more economic across the board to use cement made in South-East Asia and trans-ship it to Townsville. The cost of shipping will be cheaper doing that. So again you put in jeopardy all of those hundreds of workers in the Gladstone cement industry. I just use that as an example. The same would apply in other cement factories around Australia.


In the fertiliser industry there is a concern that this legislation will increase red tape and, because of that, increase the cost of shipping around the Australian coastline, thereby putting to the margin those industries which still exist in Australia. I see Senator Kim Carr in the chamber representing the government at the present time. He more than most understands how Australian manufacturing industries are in peril at this present time. They are in peril because every increase in the cost of manufacturing in Australia puts those industries in danger of shutting down. We have already seen so many Australian industries move overseas. Many have moved because of the lack of productivity in the Australian workforce over many years. But, more importantly, they are now moving in droves because they understand that with the introduction of a carbon tax their costs are going to skyrocket, particularly when compared to the costs of manufacturing industries in our competitor countries.


This government looks after small groups of people. I understand that to stay in government Ms Gillard needed the support of the Australian Greens and therefore she continues to pander to their every wish. But where is her concern for the manufacturing workers that Senator Cameron spoke about so passionately—allegedly—with her introduction of a carbon tax, which she, Senator Carr and Senator Ludlam know will destroy what is left of Australia's manufacturing industries? That is apparently fine because it panders to the Greens' shut-everything-down philosophy on the Australian economy and it allows Ms Gillard to swan around the world—where is the latest conference being held, Rio?—and say she is introducing the world's largest carbon tax. She will go there and say, 'We are better than everyone else. We have a bigger tax than all the rest of you, so aren't we good?'


But why isn't she concerned about the jobs of Australians, or the jobs that used to be Australian jobs, which are rapidly and increasingly going overseas? 


   This carbon tax, when it comes in in a few days time, will again add to the costs of Australian industry. Where is Ms Gillard's concern? Where is Senator Cameron's concern for the workers in the Bowen Basin and the proposed Galilee Basin coalmines? Are they concerned about that? They would answer by saying there are a lot of future investments on the drawing board in the mining industry and they are not worried about the carbon tax. I ask Senator Cameron, who brought up that ridiculous argument, to realise that mining executives can read opinion polls too, and any interest still being shown in investment in Australia by the mining industry is from those companies who are looking at the opinion polls. You do not have to be Einstein these days to read an opinion poll. They know there will be a change of government and the new government will as its first obligation on day one start the process of abolishing the carbon tax. Day two will be to remove the investment-negative minerals resource rent tax. The interest that there is in Australia's mining industry at the present time is from those international mining executives who can read and understand an opinion poll.


But, should the opinion polls be wrong and should this government continue after the next election, the jobs of so many miners in such a vast part of northern and remote Australia in particular will be put at real risk. That is why I am concerned about these bills before the parliament at the present time. The costs may not be a lot. I saw figures of costs going up 16 per cent. That was someone's estimate. It may not be correct. It may be more than that; it may be less than that. But any increase in the cost of doing business in Australia puts in great jeopardy those industries which have in the past made Australia so great and which have provided employment prospects for so many Australians.


My concern is for those industries that have in the past made Queensland so great—industries like the sugar industry, the mining industry and more recent industries like the cement industry out of Gladstone that currently contribute significantly not only to the economy of Central Queensland but to the economy of Australia as a whole. If these bills add to their costs and make them even more marginal, then their future is bleak and the future of the jobs of those workers is put in jeopardy.


This is why the second reading amendment moved by Senator Joyce is one that should be seriously considered. I know Senator Ludlam dismissed that and said, 'Don't not rely on our vote for that—it's not going to happen.' Perhaps he was as well informed on that as he was on the committee report when he said it was a unanimously supported report. I would ask Senator Ludlam to consider: what is the harm in asking the Productivity Commission to have a look at it? Perhaps what I have said about the sugar industry and the cement industry will not come to pass. Perhaps the calculations done for those industries are not precise. Perhaps in some areas they have worked on the basis of the wrong parameters. But certainly there was a wealth of evidence before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that suggested there would be an increase in costs from the red tape and from the uncertainty that will follow the adoption of this bill. If there is anything that puts the sugar industry, the cement industry, the mining industry or other industries at risk, then it should be carefully considered. That is why Senator Joyce's amendment for the referral of this matter to the Productivity Commission makes a lot of sense. What harm can it do?


These bills, as other speakers have said, were a long time coming. They were supposed to be 'reform'. I use that word in inverted commas because, as Senator Bushby well said, after the departmental officials were asked about the extent of the reform or the rapidity of the reform there was an embarrassing silence. So these bills are not going to 'reform' the industry overnight. Why not send the bills to the Productivity Commission? These are people who are well skilled, honest, independent and who do not stand to gain or lose one way or the other. They are people whose ability and skill is in looking at this type of legislation.


I do give the government credit for these bills in that I think they were trying to do something positive. I think they were trying to improve the situation across the board. But again, as I said in relation to Senator Cameron's contribution, it is no good just looking after one small part of the workforce if in doing that you are going to put in jeopardy the jobs, the employment and the future prospects of an even greater number of workers and industries whose livelihoods depend on these industries keeping going. These industries, as we have seen so much in recent times, will not be able to continue to compete against those of our neighbours. The carbon tax—and I do not think any sane person can disagree with this—will send more and more Australian jobs offshore. Our manufacturing industries, as Senator Kim Carr knows better than anyone else, have been faltering for decades now. The increased cost of power with the new carbon tax—the increased cost of doing absolutely anything—will exacerbate the move for Australia's manufacturing industries overseas.


I just plead with senators not to let this bill and the Australian coastal shipping trade in all of its forms add to those cost pressures which will send Australian jobs offshore. It seems to me perfectly reasonable for the Senate or indeed the parliament to ask the Productivity Commission to have a look at this legislation, to see whether this bill as it stands would 'reform' Australia's shipping industry or whether it perhaps would not do such reforming but would destroy other Australian industries and jobs. That is why I urge the Senate to oppose the bill as it presently stands and to support Senator Joyce's second reading amendment to let the Productivity Commission have a good look at this and give us some really professional, independent advice on the right way to go.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (12:38):  I take this opportunity to thank senators for their comments and their contributions to this debate on the five bills that are before the chamber, comprising the government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy legislative package. These bills represent the most significant reform of the Australian shipping industry in nearly 100 years. These reforms are designed to address the 40 per cent decline in the Australian fleet over the last decade by providing Australian companies with an internationally competitive fiscal and regulatory regime to encourage investment in the Australian shipping industry. In short, this is a package of measures designed for the modernisation of the Australian industry by concentrating on the economic fundamentals of the industry and ensuring that we concentrate on productivity, innovation and the develop­ment of high-skill, high-wage jobs for Australians in the industry.


It stands in sharp contrast to the position taken by those opposite, which is to take the low road, to race to the bottom, to see the whole issue of competitiveness in terms of the reduction of wages and conditions for working people. This measure provides for Australian vessels paying Australian wages and conditions. It provides for jobs for Australians to be given preference. However, these new licensing arrangements do not close the coast to foreign ships. The government recognises the legitimate role of foreign-registered vessels in our domestic shipping industry and they will continue to have access to the coast, subject to Australian vessels being given the opportunity to determine whether they are available to undertake the trade.


The bills provide for open and transparent decision-making processes. They provide for flexibility in terms of variations in existing licences. Based on a collaborative approach with industry, the bills provide opportunities both for major companies and for workers to enjoy the benefits of ensuring that Australian industry is competitive while based on proper wages and conditions.


There is of course a matter of national interest here. Ninety per cent of Australian exports by volume are carried by sea. We are the fourth largest sea transport mission in the world. Incredibly, however, Australia has only four vessels participating solely in the international trade. So now is the time to take action to increase Australian participation in the international trade, and that is what this package of measures does.


Time is short, and I think there has already been very lengthy discussion on these bills. I will not delay the Senate other than to say that we would like to thank the Economics Legislation Committee for its consideration of these measures. We would like to acknowledge the fact that the committee has made recommendations that have led to a compact between employers and unions being finalised last month. These are bold reforms. They are consistent with the committee's recommendations, and the government is very proud of these achievements to ensure the protection of Australia's vital interests.


As to the second reading amendment being proposed by Senator Joyce, the government does not support such a measure. It is the same amendment as that proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. It is quite a disingenuous approach. It is not a question of having yet another inquiry; it is a device to delay, at a time when the industry needs certainty and needs to be able to move forward with confidence. This amendment is being proposed by the conservative forces in this parliament, continuing the status quo of an unlevel playing field for Australians and for Australian shipping vessels. We want to ensure that the industry has the confidence to proceed, that new investment is attracted and that we are able to proceed on the basis of innovative processes to ensure that high-skill, high-wage jobs are provided. If Senator Joyce had been confident of the Productivity Commission's bona fides, perhaps he would not have advised us to use its reports in the manner in which he has in recent times. Perhaps they are a bit rough for that purpose as well! His is clearly a view that we can hardly take as being a sincere and genuine approach, given that he suggested these reports be used as toilet paper.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Joyce be agreed to.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:52):  by leave—I move amendments (1) to (7) on sheet 7235 together:


(1)   Clause 28, page 23 (line 10), after “specify”, insert “, to the extent known,”.


(2)   Clause 28, page 23 (line 11), omit “, which must be 5 or more,”.


(3)   Clause 28, page 23 (line 17), omit “(if known)”.


(4)   Clause 28, page 23 (line 18), omit “(if known)”.


(5)   Clause 51, page 35 (line 1), after “specify”, insert “, to the extent known,”.


(6)   Clause 51, page 35 (line 2), omit “, which must be 5 or more,”.


(7)   Clause 51, page 35 (line 8), omit “(if known)”.


Obviously, what we wish to do with these amendments to the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill 2012 is make sure that we are more expedient in how the licensing provisions are dealt with. The current schedule 3 licensing arrangements, we feel, are cumbersome and are going to create a range of problems and impediments that have been spelt out. Some of those impediments can be seen in areas, for instance, where people have to have five voyages in 12 months. We are going to have people who basically say, 'I only need two; I need to get to five, so I'm going to have to try and work out how to get around that,' so we will have the contriving of ways to get up to a certain limit. The amendments omit the five-voyage minimum requirement. The amendment is to the fact that an application for a temporary licence must include at least five voyages in a 12-month period. One of the exposure drafts of the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Bill 2012 set the minimum number of voyages at 10 in a 12-month period. As noted in the explanatory memorandum:


There was broad consensus from industry that many operators could not provide sufficient detail for ten voyages and that five voyages was more practical.


However, the same objections from industry that applied to the 10-voyage minimum threshold apply to the five-voyage threshold. Whist it is true that most industry participants that would be applying for a temporary licence to engage in five or more voyages per year is not the case for everyone, the bill in its present form would see that the smaller operators would be unable to comply with the new regulatory arrangements. There is almost universal agreement in the industry that this requirement should be removed. As Caltex notes in its submission to the House committee inquiry:


Implementing a minimum voyage requirement on TL—


that is, a temporary licence—


applications is not practical or reasonable. The requirement places unnecessary restrictions on shippers who undertake less than five voyages in a 12 month period and disadvantages these stakeholders whose trade is not likely to encourage investment on the coast due to their variable needs and low demand.


The prospect of temporary licence holders making up fictitious or spurious voyages to meet the five-voyage minimum is discussed in many of the submissions to the House and Senate inquiries into the legislation. The regulatory system is obviously deficient and clearly does not meet its objectives if, in order to comply, applicants are forced to make up fictitious voyages—which is what I mentioned at the start. Not only would this undermine the integrity of the system; it would waste industry and department time and resources in processing applications for voyages that will never occur.


Additionally, general licence holders who are given the option of objecting to a particular voyage listed in a temporary licence, if they are believed to be unable to take the cargo or passengers, may needlessly spend time objecting to voyages that a temporary licence holder has no intention of undertaking but is just using to make up the numbers and reach their five-voyage limit. Shipping Australia comments on the five-voyage limit in its submission, stating:


… the minimum of five voyages, which in our view, discriminates against the smaller coastal shipper who may, for example, have two or three voyages per year …


The department states in its supplementary submission to the House committee inquiry, in response to the industry's concerns about the five-voyage limit, that the vast majority of shippers undertake in excess of five voyages per year and so would qualify under the new temporary licence. However, they acknowledge:


For the small number of operators requiring fewer than five voyages, the new arrangements may require some reconsideration of their operating arrangements.


These small operators will no longer be able to operate in the Australian coastal trade without significantly changing their operations. Additionally, the five-voyage minimum will stifle the ability of start-up routes by new entrants into the market who are not on the Australian register. You will not be able to test a market and see whether there is a demand for a particular route if you are unable to commit to five voyages in a 12-month period. One such example of this is raised by Sucrogen in their submission to the House committee inquiry. They explain in their submission:


The bioethanol business was recently re-structured to provide only fuel grade ethanol into the Queensland market with industrial markets served by product imported to the Port of Melbourne.


Under recently changed market conditions, Sucrogen BioEthanol intends to restart closer to the transfers of ethanol from North Queensland to Melbourne rather than important it from overseas. One would suggest that this would probably be very good for the ethanol industry of North Queensland—and I am glad to see Senator Bernardi and Senator Cash are here to listen to this, because I know they have an intense interest in the good people of North Queensland; it is a shame that at the moment they are not sitting on our side of the chamber!




Senator Bernardi:
  We will be when it comes to a vote, Senator!




Senator JOYCE:
  I will take opposition wherever I can find it! However, Sucrogen believe this is made more difficult because of the bill. They say:


It might be that from time to time depending on the market situation the business needs to only move one cargo. It may be that it needs to move four and this cannot be predicted over a 12 month period.


That applies to the businesses beholden to this bill. This shows the impediments that happen when we have to, in some way, predict the next 12-month period. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate this morning, it is very hard to predict with market based things precisely what product you are going to be moving and when.


In summary, what we are trying to do with these amendments is remove some of the cumbersome items that are so obvious in this legislation. We have got to try and get the wheels of commerce turning in some form that deals with the issues that are before us in this nation. It is absurd to think that this is happening at a time when Europe is going through the obvious dilemmas that we see on the television every hour of every day, in every news brief. When we see the issues that have been brought up lately in Queensland—with its debt about to go past $1 billion, thanks to the Labor government and the parlous financial state it left its Treasury in; when places such as South Australia are losing their credit rating; when we find the debt of New South Wales going through the roof; and when we find that our own nation’s debt is at $231 billion and heading north, we have to try and do everything we can to make sure that we can export product at a rate which makes it competitive on the global market so that we can basically pay our way in the future. We always seem to be coming up with impediments in this chamber. In the next couple of weeks, we will have the lunacy of the carbon tax coming in. Everyone is going to have to pick up the tab for that. Why? Who knows why. It is because we do not like having people employed in Australia, apparently. This legislation is yet another addendum to that. It is another mechanism that basically makes it harder for our industry to compete. On the back of this, we have to try and do something to streamline this legislation in such a way that it keeps Australia in the ballpark, that keeps Australia competitive. This amendment is part of a process of trying to deal with the legislation and in some form to streamline it.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (13:01):  These are the same amendments that were proposed in the House by the Leader of the Opposition. We did not support them during that debate and we do not support them now. I repeat: the industry wants certainty and these amendments would undermine that. They create ambiguity. Senator Joyce's specific concern is about temporary licences being valid for 12 months. He suggests that applicants will not know in advance the number of voyages they require for an entire 12-month period. The temporary licence is valid—he is right—for 12 months. The bill provides that the applicant only applies for those voyages which they know the details of. For example, if a company's planning horizon is for three months, they can submit an application with the detail of those voyages for this period, with a minimum of five voyages of course. The applicant then applies for the next package of voyages when they are known. This issue was raised during the exposure draft consultation, and the government amended the bill to provide this flexibility. 


Where the general licence holder does not have sufficient knowledge to know whether to nominate to undertake voyages, as is being proposed by the opposition, these amendments would serve, if accepted by this chamber, to maintain the current situation whereby there is a lack of transparency in the coastal trading arrangements. This would continue the status quo, as I said in my previous contribution, of an unlevel playing field for Australian vessels. Australian goods carried by ships with an Australian flag and crewed by Australian workers on the Australian coast is what we are seeking to achieve, and we would ask the opposition to reconsider their position. We certainly call on the chamber to reject these amendments.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:03):  It is always interesting to hear the Labor government talk about a level playing field. I suppose that is why we are about to get ourselves a $23-a-tonne carbon tax when the vast majority of the world does not have one at all. That is an awfully level playing field! I can understand why they talk about a level playing field when even those who are trading in carbon as a product are basically doing their dough—the carbon price is about six or seven bucks. These people who talk about a level playing field like to talk about it, but they are not too good at delivering it. They do not even consider delivering it to our own people. The reality is that we are talking about products where many of them, especially agricultural products, do not deal on a level playing field. We are having to deal, for instance, with grain markets that are some of the most corrupt markets in the world. The National Party believes in the orderly marketing of grain because of the discrepancies that are abundant there. 


However, if you believe in a level playing field then you have to also believe that other people are just going to take advantage of our cost structure when it is in excess of theirs. They will just buy products from somewhere else. We are basically putting ourselves out of our own markets. Why this is so important is that there is no railway line to Indonesia and there is no bridge to China—there is coastal shipping. If we want to put ourselves out of a market or create a distinct disadvantage between us and the markets we need to get to, we will never find a better way than by creating a disadvantage in our coastal shipping areas. 


Far from reconsidering our position, I would like the government to answer some of the issues. The government's justification for this package was uncompetitive labour laws on the international stage. That was part of the minister's justification. So I ask the minister: what are the trade exposed industries that the government is considering exempting from Australian labour laws and what impact have Australian labour laws had on the shipping sector?

To help the minister out, let us ask him the question again—and this time, Minister, face the front. Given that part of the government's justification for this package was uncompetitive labour laws on an international stage—that was part of your justification, Minister; over here, eyes front—what other trade exposed industries is the government considering exempting from the Australian labour laws and what impact have Australian labour laws had on the shipping sector?

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (13:06):  Senator Joyce, it is pretty clear that this government strongly supports Australian wages and conditions. You may not agree with that approach, and I presume that is the basis on which you are seeking to gut this bill, but that is not going to be the position this government adopts. We are allowing international shipping companies to participate in the trade but we are saying that preference has to be given to Australian ships and Australian crews. We see no reason to move away from that proposition.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:07):  The sections of my question were, first, what other trade exposed industries the government is considering exempting from Australian labour laws—and it appears there was no answer to that—and, next, what impact Australian labour laws have had on the shipping sector. There was no answer to that either. Maybe if the minister has a bit more time he might be able to find an answer. While he is considering that, he might consider another issue. You say you want to protect Australian labour and their jobs on the factory floor or in the agricultural sector or the mining sector, but that philosophy you are laying down here about protecting Australian jobs seems completely incongruous with the philosophy behind your introduction, in two weeks time, of a $23-a-tonne tax on Australians competing in these markets, which is putting Australian workers at a complete and utter disadvantage. Minister, are you saying that there are no other trade exposed industries the government is considering exempting from Australian labour laws?

Do you believe that, as your bill is currently structured, there is scope for this to be manipulated—with people contriving voyages or being put in a position where they have to make the number five? What is so impressive about the number five that is not impressive about the number six, the number four, the number seven or the number three? How did you come to the number five?

You will be aware, Senator, that this is not a new requirement. The voyage notification process is to meet customs requirements and merely codifies an activity that currently occurs automatically when an SVP is applied for. The information will be provided directly to Customs and applicants for temporary licences only need to identify voyages, not ships, to enable Customs to undertake its legislative and operational responsibility. Customs also needs to be advised of movements of all non-imported vessels.

I am advised that these are matters such as publishing requirements, voyage notification—a whole range of other issues. The current practice had not previously been articulated in legislation. So this bill actually makes things clearer and more transparent. The decision to incorporate these measures into legislation was in response to longstanding industry concerns that the reliance on ministerial guidelines for decision making has resulted in a lack of transparency and a lack of certainty for industry and has contributed to the decline of the industry. These were key findings of various parliamentary com­mittees, including House of Representatives committees, as far back as 2008.

Where will this information come from for the next 12 months? Is it through divine inspiration in the quieter moments of the darkest night that this information will come to them? Since we have such perfect knowledge of the next 12 months, do we also have perfect knowledge of the next 12 years? Can we plan that far out knowing the uncertainties, given the fact that in the current economic climate it is a surprise from week to week where we are?

I am surprised that you were not able to pay attention to the previous answer I gave you. In regard to the temporary licences: while they are valid for 12 months, the bill provides that the applicant need only apply for those voyages that they know the details of. For example, if a company's planning horizon is three months, they can submit an application with the detail of these voyages for this period. Of course, there must be a minimum of five voyages. Senator, you are making presumptions about people that run these companies and you talk as if they do not know their business. You are talking as if they have no idea about what is actually going on within the trade. These are applications that allow for people to make licensing arrangements for voyages when they are known. I would suggest that we get on with the bill rather than trying to waste the Senate's time.

If you do not know where that reference is then just say, 'I am unaware of where that reference is; I will take it on notice and get back to you.' That is a much more simple and polite way to go about it rather than to yack-ai on. The rationale for the 12-month period as explained by the department is as follows:


Extension to a 12 month period—


for a temporary licence as opposed to a continuing voyage permit, which lasts for three months—


will provide holders of these licences with greater certainty regarding their shipping arrangements. 


How does this take into account the commercial reality in many parts of the shipping industry, where a 12-month schedule is not possible to predict?

Item 5.10 is interesting. It says:


… Applicants who genuinely require fewer voyages than the minimum set will be forced to provide spurious information to make up the set number required. This is not in the interests of the applicant, GL holders who may wish to nominate or the Department—who will be processing the application. This is an example of red tape which must be avoided.


This is their recommendation:


… It is recommended that a sensible solution be found to deal with situations where fewer than 5 voyages are required …


Minister, why did you just tell me that it was the Australian Shipowners Association's submission which suggested five? You have put it on the record of the Hansard. Do you now wish to correct the record or would you like me to send Ms Findlay over to work for you?

Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




Senator JOYCE:
  I want to go to another thing. Shipping Australia says in its submission to the House committee's inquiry: 


It is impossible to forecast the movement of such cargoes over a twelve month period in terms of expected loading dates, kinds and volume of cargo, type of vessel and the ports of loading and unloading of the cargo.


This will be a particular problem for break-bulk and bulk industries. How do you see them dealing with the issues of assessment of the cargoes they have in the bulk industries? What is the process that the department has gone through for assessment, which is going to be an obvious dilemma for bulk industries? In the collection of this data, did we do any analysis of what the possible upstream effects would be for those supplying those bulk commodities? Have we done an assessment as to the sensitivities in the coal industry and the grain industry and how this will affect them? Was this decision made in light of what the effects on the industries involved would be or was it made with the exclusion of what the effects on the industries involved would be?

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:26):  Minister, obviously this has a cost effect on the transportation of goods. In light of this legislation was any study done into what the effect will be on the competitiveness of the industry? Transport is a major component of the cost of some of these items. Have we done any assessment of what the effects will be and what the sensitivities will be with this legislation vis-a-vis competition, for instance, in coal as to Indonesia? As you know, the Indonesians are coming into our coal markets. I think they are now a bigger exporter of coal than we are. So have we done any assessment of that and of grains? Have we done any assessment of whether this affects our competitiveness in the grain market and whether the costs will then be taken back to growers, especially those in the grain market? These people do not have the capacity to absorb costs. That is especially so given that regionally based monopolies are now predominantly involved in the exporting of grain. So will they just therefore put the costs back onto the grower? By reason of this legislation will there be a reduction in return to wheat growers and barley growers and to the coal industry?

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:28):  Minister, I want to quote to you something that Caltex said:


Given the variable nature of our operations it is not possible for Caltex to nominate its coastal trade for the coming 12 months because this is not known nor planned more than three months in advance. This has been the normal operating practice of Caltex, which will be adversely impacted by the requirements of the TL—


temporary licence—


regime.


Shell backed this assertion. It said:


Overall the Temporary Licence system appears more complicated and burdensome to both the oil industry and the Department than the existing Permit system, and in our opinion, will fail to deliver any of the objectives of the Act in respect to the oil tanker segment of the Australian shipping industry. 


Seeing that we currently have immense pressures that are currently being put on the refining industry and seeing that we are talking about the most effective large-scale movement of their product between major capitals—given that we are probably going back to one or two refining capacities on the eastern coast so this is about bulk movement and refining capacity—do you see that the pressures from this could be part and parcel of a cost position that means ultimately we start to put out of business our own refining capacity, to be replaced with the importation of refined fuel, and as such more Australian workers will lose their jobs?

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (13:31):  Senator, I think you have misrepresented what I actually said. I was asked about a specific matter. I incorrectly, on advice, provided that information to the Senate. I have corrected the record in that regard and indicated to you the process by which the government sought to ensure that there was appropriate industry consultation.


On the general issue of consultation, this is a package of measures which has had a long and thorough process of consultation and review through this parliament, starting back in 2007. There was, of course, a House of Representatives committee. There was bipartisan support through a bipartisan report in October 2008 recommending a policy framework to revitalise the shipping industry. In 2009, the government convened the Shipping Policy Advisory Group, comprising shippers, industry and unions, to advise on the best means to implement those recommendations. In 2010, there were election commitments for a discussion paper, which was released and there were public comments on the proposed reforms. In 2011, the government established three industry reference groups to work through the details of these reforms. These included two roundtables which were attended by Minister Albanese. Again, these groups comprised a cross-section of the industry. In 2011 and early 2012, exposure drafts of the bill were released for public comment and a further roundtable was held in February to enable industry to work through the details with officials. That is hardly what I would say would reflect a lack of consultation with the industry.


These amendments—and the proposal which we have already seen defeated in this chamber for further delays in the introduction of these measures—in my view, are not a genuine reflection on these questions but in fact are a means by which to maintain the existing uneven arrangements, unfair arrangements, within the industry.


The government's view is that these issues are urgent. Despite the amazing amounts of consultation that have been engaged in, there is always going to be someone who will say, 'Give us more time to delay these measures.' That is not the position the government holds. We are seeking to have these measures introduced as quickly as possible.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:33):  There is always a vast difference between consultation and dictation. What people believe is that, when you enter into consultation, their views, which they have given, will be incorporated in the outcome that you propose in some way, shape or form. But, when there is a discussion but it is a waste of time because you end up in the position that the government wants rather than the position that industry wants, that is not consultation. That is a process that is rhetorical but it is not consultation. Consultation somehow works on the premise that the other person gets heard and not only heard—and I have no doubt you did hear them—but actually responded to in such a way that the outcome is seen in the legislation provided.


Minister, in a submission to the House Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications inquiry, Shipping Australia said, of the five-voyage minimum limit to the variation process:


This simply does not make sense. If an applicant does expect to have five voyages over the twelve month period—


of a temporary licence—


but then finds he has seven voyages he can’t seek a variation to the temporary licence?


Is that correct?

They get to September and a big wheat crop is coming in, and they say, 'Hang on, we had better book a couple more boats. We'll need seven.' Can they then go back and get a temporary licence?

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:38):  As I stated before, we have talked about the extensive consultation and we have already quoted back the Australian Shipowners submission. We have already got a correction from the minister on an issue, because the proposal was not a clear reflection of the consultation with or the recommendation of the association he quoted. What we are trying to do now is delve into the issue—just to show you how Kafkaesque and ridiculous this is—of an organisation which honestly says they only need three voyages. They are not trying to be spurious or ridiculous; they tell the truth by saying they only need three and so they cannot get a temporary licence. Then a massive wheat crop comes in and they say, 'We have a chance to make some money here. We have a chance to go from that three per cent of shipping into a big shipper.' No-one ever becomes a big shipper without starting as a small shipper. We have to remember that. They say three per cent, but it is a wonder that three per cent exists, when you have something as cumbersome as this. This is probably why there is only three per cent, because you are not allowing people the capacity to grow. You are saying, 'You're a five or you're zero'. 


Let us put this on the record. They start in July and they say they only need three. They find out later on they need seven, and if they had put that information in at the start they would have got themselves a temporary licence. But they are stuck in September without a temporary licence. Can they go back and say, 'Look, we said three. We now realise that it is seven. Therefore we need a temporary licence.' Can they get that temporary licence or is it no go and they have to wait for the next period? And when is that next period?

Companies can make applications throughout the year to meet their operational requirements. The bill aims to encourage greater planning in the industry and to provide greater visibility of the trades around the coast. By setting a minimum number of voyages, both the shippers and operators can enter into commercial negotiations based on longer-term business arrangements, which of course provides greater certainty for both parties. The policy intent of these measures, after consultation with the industry, is to provide a better operating basis for the industry as a whole. Senator, you are obviously concerned about very small numbers of people in, given all the advice that has been put to me, very unusual circumstances.

It changes things for that coastal shipping operator who starts their 12-month period only needing three, but gets to a point where they say, 'Hang on, that's changed. We need seven.' I asked the question—I am sure the people in the gallery will remember this—does that mean that they can go back and get a temporary licence in September to deal with the seven? The answer came back, 'Yes, they can'. We are on the record now. That is now the position of the government. The minister must realise that. He has answered the question and the answer is yes. That changes things a bit, doesn't it? This was the position: if, for example, an applicant wanted to add two new voyages to their temporary licence in a 12-month period, they were unable to do so. If no other vessel was available, the goods would have to travel by road or rail or not at all. Now the case has changed. So, we have been very successful in the chamber today, because we have now changed a position of government. Thank you, Minister, for that. I appreciate that. It is a big win.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:46):  If you do not change it then the position stands. If you have three voyages planned and you find out through circumstances that come before you that you need seven—I asked the question, 'Could you change it?' and you answered yes. That is the position you have. You have now confirmed that you are not changing that position, so that is the position of the government. That is where we are. That is why we have a committee stage. It is now clearly on the record that this is the position. You have reaffirmed it. We needed five. Then we did not need five because we had three and needed seven. You can apply for it. The answer was yes. 


Then you went back to a generic statement about five. Now you have gone back and confirmed your agreement to the statement 'yes'. Now we have four positions in 15 minutes. This is why you have to keep the committee stage going—because who would know your position? How is it that you are running the country? This is a simple piece of legislation. It is not that complicated. We are looking for a simple answer to a simple question. In 15 minutes we have had four different positions. It goes beyond comprehension. When are we going to get some competency? You now have two different positions before you. You have given them both. You have the position of, 'Yes, you can change to seven voyages through the middle of the year and that is all right'—even though you knew at the start that it was only three. Then you said, 'No.' Then you were back to yes. Which is it, Minister?

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:48):  It is not Phil or Buster who is going to help you here. The issue is this. It may be that you do not want to answer—after the issue of having to retract your statement on the position of the Australian Shipowners Association after it was quoted back to you. That is thanks to Ms Finlay who managed to dig it out. She is obviously a very capable lady. You have five staff here in the chamber. We have one. Now we have a position where you are accusing us of filibustering when really the way to get yourself out of this hole is to answer the question.


To answer the question is quite simple. We set down clear criteria at the start. We gave a little story to go with it so that there was no way you could be confused. We asked quite clearly, 'If they started the year and they needed three ships and then the wheat harvest came in and they needed seven and it was in the 12-month period, could they apply for a temporary licence?' You stood—looked straight across—and said the answer was yes. I was happy because we had just changed government policy. It took 20 minutes. You started off by saying, 'No, you could not,' and then you gave me the answer yes. I thought: 'Beauty. We'll go to the vote. That's it. Locked in. Job done.' Then there was panic, and in panic he said 'We'll go back and give the generic ""Let's talk about the number five""'. Just like Sesame Street. This really was not an answer or a non-answer; it was a nothing.


Then you confirmed, Senator Carr, that the answer you gave was the right answer. And so we are happy again. It means that we can apply for a temporary licence midway through the year. We are happy again. But we are oscillating around—that was the fourth change in position. Now we are back to the statement about it having to be five. So now we are unhappy. We do not know whether we are happy or unhappy. We are totally and utterly confused. You really need to go back to the question that we asked you—that is clearly on the record—and give an answer to the scenario that we laid down. That encapsulates the question. It was quite clear. They start the year and only need three. They find out later it is going to be a busy year. The wheat harvest comes in. They are going to need seven and will therefore need a temporary licence. Can they get one: yes or no? The answer you gave was on the Hansard: 'Yes'. In fact, you said it again. 


Now we have the position of the government saying yes. In answer No. 5, you confirmed that the answer is yes. Now we are in a position where we really do not know the position. This is important. I bet you there are people listening to this trying to work out what on earth the government's position will be next. 




Senator Marshall:

Senator JOYCE:
  We are only too happy to cease the debate when we get some sort of answer out of the minister that is comprehendible. What we have had today is complete absurdity. If we can get a straight answer, we can bring things to a conclusion. Just go back to the scenario and answer the question. You might want to say, Minister, that when you answered with the word 'yes' you actually meant to say the word 'no'. You made a little mistake—you said yes and you should have said no. But you are trying to get around it by not actually answering the question. Do you want to reflect on your answer now and say, 'Excuse me; when I said yes, I actually meant to say no'?

  Are you unclear about that?




Senator JOYCE:
  That is a lot clearer now! Was that a yes or a no? Apparently, the problem is that I am wrapping myself in the Australian flag—why didn't I think of that? That was obviously the answer we were looking for, Ms Finlay!


The problem is that it is not about an answer of yes or no, it is not about the fact that we cannot get a straight answer; it is about some clandestine plot, personally orchestrated by me, to bring down the nation! I knew that that was what we were looking for! This is absurd. This is a senior member of the government of Australia. What a joke. What a ridiculous state of affairs. They are so utterly incompetent, so totally bereft of any capability whatsoever that they cannot read their own submission. Their own quotes are handed back to them and proved to be wrong. They end up with four, five and then six positions between five and 20 minutes. They are supposed to represent the government.


They get frustrated. They cannot answer the question. The minister cannot even correct himself and say, 'No, I made a mistake'—I am sure there is a less genteel way to put it—'I made a big boo-boo and I really should correct the record.' Does he correct the record? No. He goes into some diatribe about wrapping people in the Australian flag, traitors, Prince Philip, a one-world government and who knows what else, but he cannot actually give an answer. The thing about this is that it is such a classic exemplar of what this government is. These are the people who, in a couple of weeks, are going to cool the planet. Honestly, it is Pythonesque.


What exactly was that about me wrapping myself in the Australian flag and being the servant of foreign interests? Where does that sort of tripe come from? Why don't you just brief yourself on the legislation that is before you? Can't you understand how totally and utterly foolish saying that makes you look? Do you even comprehend how absolutely ridiculous you looked then? Does it make any sense to you? Do you care? Why don't you just go back to the record and correct your position? I am going to hold you to it. You have said the word 'yes'.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Moore
):  Senator, through the chair.




Senator JOYCE:
  Madam Chair, I am going to hold him to it. His position is on the Hansard. He is a minister representing the government. He was given a direct question. He was asked to elucidate and he was given a framework in which to give a position, to answer the question. We even gave him a little story so he would not get confused. He gave the answer that, yes, people can get a temporary licence. It is on the Hansard; the answer is yes. That is the position he has given. That is now the position of the government. He was given the opportunity to retract it. He refused to retract it. Instead of retracting it, he told a story about me, by myself, somehow orchestrating from this side of the chamber a plan to bring down Australia, about me being the servant of foreign interests. And of course that is so logical!


Now we are sitting around waiting for an answer from the minister representing the Crown, the Hon. Kim Carr, who has accused me of being an agent of foreign governments and disguising it by seeking the refuge of a rogue, wrapping myself in the Australian flag. All I am really looking for is an explanation of the answer he gave, when he said yes. That was it, a monosyllabic 'yes', which was supposed to be a monosyllabic 'no', and he just does not have the capacity to go back to his position and correct the record.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:08):  As the Senate would know, the government's position is the same as that of the opposition, which is a five per cent reduction by 2020 of 2000 levels. The legislation the government has put forward will ensure that caps are set over the period out to 2020 beyond the fixed price period in order to achieve that outcome.


I would make the point that, just as the government has a commitment to a five per cent reduction by 2020, so do the opposition. Of course, the difference is that the government's policy will cost Australians less. It will cost Australian households less, Australian taxpayers less and Australian business less. The reality is that, should the opposition ever be in a position to implement their so-called 'Direct Action' policy, the economy would be far worse off than under a carbon price, which economists have told both sides of politics, including Prime Minister Howard, is the most efficient way to reduce emissions. In terms of the actual abatement outcome for the first three years, I will take that part of the question on notice and I will see if I can assist the cackling Senator Abetz with that information in the near future.

 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:10):  The senator verballed me in the second question, which is not unusual for him—when the facts do not give rise to a scare campaign, let's just make the facts up. The reality is that we have always made clear, as have the opposition, our objective in terms of reduction by 2020. That has been the basis on which the discussion has proceeded. In fact, it is the same basis on which the opposition's policy is predicated: five per cent by 2020. I am sure the opposition would not be able to tell anybody how much abatement each year will occur, and what they certainly do not want to do is tell people how much it will cost them under their system—$1,300 per year per household. That is what the opposition are going to impose—$1,300 more in tax that would have to be paid by Australian households to reach the outcome that they also have signed up to. They do not like to tell people that.


This question fundamentally goes to whether or not we should have a carbon price. The government believes we should. (Time expired)

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


Mr Deputy President, you would be aware that we are now in the final countdown, the final 14 days, before the introduction of the world's largest carbon tax—a carbon tax that you know, sir, is a tax on Australia, its businesses, its industries, its working families and its way of life. It is a tax that is being imposed on an economy that is open, that is competitive, that is energy rich and that of course is resource-intensive—a country that will suffer when this carbon tax comes in. That is what will happen in two weeks time. But I have noticed a funny little swerve in very recent times from the government. They now argue that there are other political parties, other governments, as stupid as this one.




Senator Boswell:
  No!




Senator MASON:
  They do! They argue that there are other countries that are imposing a tax of this extent right throughout the world. And they hide behind the coat-tails, of course, of Nicholas Stern—now Lord Stern—who last week was quoted in the Australian as saying:


… there was evidence the Australian carbon price—$23 a tonne from July 1—was not excessive compared with prices in Norway, Britain and Switzerland.


That is right: Norway, Britain and Switzerland. You can imagine the sort of resource powerhouses that Norway, Britain and Switzerland are. You can imagine the carbon emissions from the chocolate, or the cuckoo clocks, or the watches, or the yodelling coming from Switzerland! They are missing the point, as is Lord Stern: the only thing that matters is what our competitor countries are doing—what are the other comparable economies doing; what are the other energy-rich, open, exposed economies doing? Well, who are they? What are the Chinese doing? The Scientific American, that famous scientific journal, says that, other than understating their carbon emissions, they are doing very little. Russia: very little. India: very little. Canada: very, very little. Also the United States. They are the comparable competitor countries that, just like Australia, want to sell resources, coal and gas overseas. They are not suffering. Their governments are not so stupid as to unilaterally place a carbon tax on their most efficient industries. This government does that. But the Russians, the Indians, the Chinese, the Americans and the Canadians are not that stupid. What happens in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein or Monaco does not really matter. So the government saying that there are other comparable countries doing this is absolute and utter rubbish. 


I have often spoken in this parliament about the great lie. My friends often talk about it being the lie of the Prime Minister when she said that there would not be a carbon tax under the government she led. That is not the greatest lie. The greatest lie is that this tax, the unilateral imposition of a carbon tax on an economy like Australia's, is in our national interest. The greatest lie this government has ever perpetrated in its five years in government is to stand up before the Australian people and say, 'It is in your interest that we pay this tax,' when the Canadians, the Americans, the Indians, the Russians and the Chinese will not do it. 


Our economy is more exposed than that of any other country on earth. In two weeks time our economy will start to suffer; it will start to suffer from the word go. We now know following question time what the government's result will be at the end of all this—that is, how much our emissions will go down—



Opposition senators interjecting—They will go up!




Senator MASON:
  They will actually go up. They will rise slowly. They will apparently rise more slowly than they otherwise would. This, in the end, is social democratic churn dressed up as environmentalism. It is pathetic. (Time expired)

Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:16):  I too rise to take note of answers to questions asked today. If we are to believe Senator Mason, then the sky is falling and we are all Chicken Littles running around, waiting to see civilisation as we know it cease in two weeks time. However, what we need to understand and what we on this side of the chamber and this government recognise is that of course it is in Australia's national interest to continue to work to achieve the international goal of limiting global warming. Everything that has been shaped in the clean energy package is about doing exactly that. It is a critical imperative for us. It is a critical imperative for Australian domestic and international commitments on climate change and clean energy that we stand firm, drive hard change and lead in this debate where others would prefer us to be following along like sheep. 


It does not matter who you go to—whether it is the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Australian Academy of Science or any of the science academies around the world—everyone is agreed that climate change is real and action has to be taken to deal with it. The carbon price, despite the nonsense that you have just heard from Senator Mason, is a very realistic carbon price. It is one that, as we heard today in question time, provides the incentives to industry to move to clean energy technologies and it gives signals to industry about where to move. I do not think you can be clearer than that about the purpose and the direction of the clean energy package and the carbon price. 


The challenge we have had, and the way we have dealt with the package, has been to ensure that those people who are least able to meet the needs of the carbon price are compensated. An extensive carbon compensation package has been outlined and we have heard about it incessantly, week after week, in this place and in the public debate. However, we have seen that there are those who are prepared to use sleight of hand. While the federal government compensates, governments like that of New South Wales are very keen to see what they can do to claw back some of that money for their own purposes. We saw that last week in the announcement by the New South Wales government to take some of that money from New South Wales pensioners living in public housing and add it to the public housing rents. This is just a blatant cash grab by the New South Wales government. It is quite a shameful exercise. The New South Wales government says, 'We need this money to repair and support public housing,' when in fact the Treasury model shows us that the cost of house repairs as a result of the carbon price is less than one per cent, which is around a third of what the New South Wales government is claiming. 


So let us be quite honest and realistic about this nonsense debate that we have been having: it is a stunt. It is the continuing circus routine that we have seen about fear and misrepresentation. As the date gets closer, the rhetoric gets more and more ridiculous, because the opposition will say anything and do anything. They just will not accept the facts. 



The Rio 20 summit, which is being held this week, is all about our environment. Everywhere around the world people are talking about climate change, environmental damage and how we can take action on that. On the other side, we still have the debate about whether climate change is real. So that is the nonsense basis on which we have to have a debate here today. Nevertheless, we will continue to see this debate carried on—because on 1 July the sky will not fall. People will move to the clean carbon economy. People will start to understand that it is in everyone's interests, and I will be very glad for it to be here. (Time expired)

Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (15:21):  If I were the Manager of Government Business, the last person I would put up to defend the carbon tax would be Senator Ursula Stephens. She is held in high regard on this side of parliament because we know she would not lie. You saw that today when she was trying to defend something that she did not have her heart in. She knows that the impact is going to be on the people that can least afford it. To ask Senator Stephens to get up and defend the carbon tax is picking the wrong horse for the wrong course.


But today I want to talk about the announcement about marine reserves, which will now circle right around Australia, creating 1.3 million square miles of marine parks—between 50 and 70 per cent of the world's marine parks around Australia. We are a country of 20 million people and we now have 70 per cent of the marine parks. How did we get there? We got there because Pew, an international green group, came here and decided to fund a campaign right across Australia, spending millions of dollars of American money, putting out propaganda that it would be good to have this wonderful world marine park—70 per cent of the world's marine parks. 


But it is going to lock out commercial fishermen, it is going to lock out amateur fishermen. 'Oh, but Ron Boswell is a scare merchant.' They say it all the time. So today I quoted Mr Allan Hansard, who is the director of the Australian Recreational Fishing Foundation. Mr Hansard says that mums, dads and the kids will be banned from trying to catch fish. It is not Ron Boswell who is saying that, it is the man who represents five million amateur fishermen. Mr Deputy President, you are a fisherman yourself and you know that the majority of the people who go out there in their 16-foot boats with their 60-horsepower motors are not office workers or solicitors or brain surgeons; they are blue-collar workers that rely on the Labor Party that has so badly let them down. When the Labor Party come to voting for the blue-collar worker, when they come to deciding whether to look after the blue-collar worker or the environmentalists and the soft green groups, it is the poor old blue-collar worker that always cops it in the neck. 


They have copped it in the neck this time. They have had their fishing areas reduced. It is not Ron Boswell, it is not Barnaby Joyce, it is not Senator Brandis saying that; it is these guys that represent the recreational fishermen. Recreational anglers have been locked out of vast tracts of Australian ocean and a number of inshore iconic fishing spots such as Osprey Reef, Geographe Bay, the Perth trench and Dampier. What is the point of them saying it if it is not true? Why don't you listen to the blue-collar workers? Why have you let them down so badly time and time again? When Pew comes out here and tells the Greens what a wonderful idea it would be to take 70 per cent of the marine parks of the world and put them in Australian, locking out the commercial fishermen, locking out the amateur fishermen and locking out the charter boats that take fishing people out, why do you follow them? They lead you around by the nose and you do not ever learn. If you never learn you are always going to end up in the same spot. Why do you think the Queensland election was an absolute wipeout for the Labor Party? I will tell you why it was a wipeout. You could see, as you went out further into the working class areas, that the vote had left the Labor Party. I will tell you why. The blue-collar worker has worked out that the Greens-Labor alliance has nothing in it for them. It may look after the progressives of the Labor Party but it does not look after the blue-collar worker and they have worked it out. (Time expired)

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:26):  Before I talk about the issue of carbon pricing, I would like to again echo the words of Senator Conroy in his response to the question on marine bioregions, and that is that the government is committed to delivering a national network of marine reserves, as we have indicated, to protect our marine environment for future generations. As Senator Conroy also said in question time today in relation to recreational fishing, these reserves will not impact recreational fishers, who love to fish, and they will preserve our marine life so that future generations can continue to enjoy this pastime. As someone who comes from a family that enjoys a spot of recreational fishing, I know there will be no impact on recreational fishers, as Senator Conroy has said today.


On the issue of carbon pricing, let us again be clear that a carbon price is the most effective and efficient way to cut greenhouse gas emissions. That is what our clean energy future package will do. It will implement a carbon price that will cut carbon emissions and will also drive investment in clean technologies such as solar and wind. Our carbon price will ensure that big polluters pay the carbon price and not all ordinary Australians, as would happen under Mr Abbott's plan. The carbon price is about making the biggest polluters pay so that millions of Australians can pay less tax. The money raised from the carbon price will go to supporting jobs, encouraging investment in clean technologies and helping households. This is in stark contrast to Mr Abbott's plan, which would ensure that families are worse off. In fact, under Mr Abbott's plan, Australian families would have to pay more money in taxes and he would give that money to the big polluters. Mr Abbott is focused on mindless negativity and opposition. We have seen that here today in question time and again in Senator Mason's response in taking note. It was yet another attempt to scare people into believing falsehoods about the impact of the carbon price. We have had to deal with these falsehoods for the last 16 months. The prime speaker of these falsehoods is Mr Abbott himself and of course he is joined by his frontbench and also his backbench. 


Just last week Mr Billson came across to Tasmania. We always like to see visitors to Tasmania. Currently, we have the Save a Mainlander tourism campaign, which Mr Deputy President Parry would know all about—that is, encouraging mainlanders to come to the most beautiful state in Australia. But I digress. Mr Billson came down to Tasmania, but unfortunately he talked about the carbon price and launched into his own scare campaign and repeated falsehoods that have been repeated again and again by Mr Abbott. For the last 16 to 18 months we have seen Mr Abbott telling small businesses that they will face extraordinary impacts, particularly electricity price rises of 25 to 30 per cent. 


But Rod Sims of the ACCC came out and said that he could not see any circumstances where an average small business would have a carbon related price of anything like 25 per cent. He just does not see how that could be possible. Mr Abbott has been running around with many falsehoods. But just in the last few weeks we saw Mr Abbott changing his rhetoric a bit—although still on the biggest scare campaign that we have seen in this country for a very long time—from 'It's going to be a wrecking ball' to a slow— (Time expired)

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:31):  It is quite interesting that Senator Carol Brown chose to speak on the topic of falsehoods. The largest falsehood of the lot is the slippery, slimy, shonky sideshow that we had over on the other side when asked for some truthful answers to some truthful questions. It is all razzamattaz—they are going to be the biggest and the best of everything: 'We're going to have the biggest carbon price.' I use the term 'carbon price'; I note that Senator Ludlam during question time referred to it as a 'carbon tax.' He clearly did not get the memo from his Labor coalition partners that they do not want to talk about a carbon tax anymore; they want to call it a price, because clearly a tax sounds like a much nastier thing than a carbon price. But whether it is a price or a tax it will, in the end, be paid by Australian consumers. It will be the biggest carbon tax in the world.


We also have the other big thing on offer from the Labor government—that is, the biggest national marine park in the world. Wow! Aren't they great at offering us big things. Of course, we have all these things courtesy of, apparently, the world's best Treasurer. Some of the other things that the Labor government are offering us include the biggest number of failures by construction companies—going into either liquidation or administration. The government are also very good at that. They have also given us the world's most unnecessary deficit. That has also been great. When you watch the world's best Treasurer Mr Swan primping and prancing around, excited at the GDP growth he has, it makes you very sick. He is using whatever he can of the mining resources to, once again, mask some of the other world-class problems we have in Australia—and they are that every industry that is not related to mining is in big trouble. You will have all noticed the retail sales going on. Senator Brandis mentioned the 1,900 jobs going from Fairfax. Reed Construction, St Hilliers and many other large construction companies are going into liquidation, courtesy of the government. Part of the whole package is the tsunami of great big taxes, great big problems that the government have brought on.


It was amusing to listen to Minister Carr. He was allegedly chiding the opposition when he said, 'It's easy to prescribe harsh medicine if you don't have to take it yourself.' Senator Carr needs to listen to what he said. That is what this government is doing; it is making industry sick and it is making consumers sick. And the whole country is going to be very sick. It tries to pretend, as it currently is, that there will not be a slow and long rise in the cost of living, which starts from 1 July, when its little package has already been rolled out—the $300 that is supposed to compensate. How long will it compensate for?


The government cannot even tell us what sort of emissions reduction they are expecting to get by 2020. Bizarrely, Senator Wong claims that we cannot really expect her to give us an annual year by year estimate. How does she know we are going to get to a five per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 if she cannot tell us how much we are likely to have per year or what we are going to average per year? How on earth could she possibly know? 


How on earth can Senator Conroy say that there will be no damage done to the recreational and commercial fishers of Australia, when he has not consulted with them in any way on this matter, except to announce, 'Whoopee, once again, we've got the world's biggest whatever it is'—but at what cost to Australian industry and at what cost to Australian consumers? But of course the government do not take the medicine; they just dish it out.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:42): by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 12 June 2012, of the Honourable Francis (Frank) John Walker, QC, former minister and member for Robertson, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


It is my privilege today to lead this condolence motion to mark the very significant contribution of our Labor colleague who served as a senior minister at both the state and federal level. Frank Walker was a member of the Australian House of Representatives for nearly six years, from 1990 to 1996, and was a minister in the Keating government. I had the honour of serving with him in the last three-year period of the Keating government and was always very impressed by his ability and his passion for the labour cause and for social justice. He was a very impressive contributor to the Labor caucus and to the ministry of that time. Prior to entering federal politics Frank served in Neville Wran's government and made history as the state of New South Wales' youngest Attorney-General and as the first minister in New South Wales to hold the Aboriginal affairs portfolio. His contribution to public life was remarkable and spanned more than four decades. He was a determined and fearless campaigner with strong convictions whose reputation as a reformer and a passionate advocate for the underdog was well known. The unorthodox upbringing that coloured Frank's early years was perhaps less well known. The first born of two sons, Frank was born on 7 July 1942 in Sydney. The family lived in a Housing Commission home in Coogee until 1948, when they were forced to move overseas because Frank's father, a member of the Communist Party of Australia, was blacklisted and unable to work in Australia. Frank and his brother spent their formative years in Papua New Guinea, living and learning alongside indigenous children in coastal villages while their father supported the family, salvaging and melting metals and alloys from World War II aircraft he found in the surrounding jungle. The boys were raised as Catholic. While their mother took care of their religious upbringing, their father taught them how to read and also broadened their education to include the world of politics.


Frank was 12 when the family returned to Australia and settled on the New South Wales mid-North coast. It was here, in 1950s Australia, at the age of 13, that he staged his first political act. He sat with segregated Aboriginals at the Sawtell picture theatre, in the process drawing the attention of the local constabulary and making himself an outcast in the community.


He attended Coffs Harbour High School before studying law part time at the University of Sydney. He completed a law degree in 1964 and a Master of Laws in 1969. He married his first wife, Marilyn Duff, an accountant, in 1963, and the marriage ended in 1992. Through his university years, Frank continued to speak out against racial segregation. He joined Charles Perkins on the Freedom Ride to Moree in 1965 and five years later was propelled into politics on the back of his engagement in Indigenous issues. He was an articled clerk from 1960 to 1965, a solicitor from 1965 to 1976, a barrister from 1976 to 1988 and appointed as Queen's Counsel in 1981.


Frank joined the Australian Labor Party in 1960 at 18 years of age and held various branch and electorate positions, including as president of the Canterbury-Bankstown and Barton Young Labor associations. Frank was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for nearly 18 years from 1970 to 1988 and was quick to carve out a career as a vocal backbencher. As the member for Georges River during the Wran and Unsworth New South Wales state governments, he held several key ministerial positions. At 34 years of age, as I said earlier, he was the youngest person to be appointed as the New South Wales Attorney-General, a position he held for seven years. He was also Minister for Youth and Community Services, Minister for Justice, Minister for Housing, Minister for the Arts and the first New South Wales minister appointed to the new ministry of Aboriginal affairs.


Following that long state career, Frank entered federal politics in 1990. In March 1993 he became both Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council. He was promoted to Minister for Administrative Services in March 1994, a position that he held until the 1996 federal election. Frank Walker was an active participant in the affairs of the parliament. He attended the 85th Inter-Parliamentary Conference in the Republic of Korea in 1991 and undertook official visits to Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the United States. He served on a number of committees.


In 1996 he married Pamela Buchanan, a public servant. After politics, Frank continued a distinguished career by serving as a judge on the Compensation Court of New South Wales from 1997 to 2003, and from 2004 to 2006 he was a judge of the Dust Diseases Tribunal and of the District Court of New South Wales.


Having had two sons who suffered from schizophrenia, Frank had a long association with the Schizophrenia Fellowship of New South Wales and served as president of the fellowship from 1998. Sadly, Frank's two sons, Michael and Sean, took their own lives within two years of each other. Frank stepped down last December from his role as President of the Schizophrenia Fellowship but remained a member of the fellowship until his death. I met with Frank last November when he wanted to speak to me about issues of disability employment and mental health. He retained a very strong commitment to assisting people with mental health issues in seeking employment and broader support. He brought a passion to that subject even in his last days.


From the time Frank joined the Labor Party at age 18, he worked tirelessly for those who struggled, whether in the early movements in support of Indigenous rights, in the cause for law reform or in promoting housing and social justice. On top of this, he was a leader who worked to support people with mental illness. His own battle with cancer saw his passing on 12 June this year. He is a great loss to the Australian Labor Party but had a remarkable Labor career. On behalf of the government, I offer my condolences to his wife, Pamela, his family and his friends.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:50):  The coalition joins with the Leader of the Government in the Senate in supporting the condolence motion for the Hon. Francis Walker QC. His was a life devoted to public service, with 18 years in the state parliament and six years in the federal parliament, and he served as a minister in both jurisdictions.


After his parliamentary life he became a judge and involved himself in issues of mental health after his departure from representative public service. I will briefly quote from a foreword that the Hon. Frank Walker QC wrote for a publication by the Mental Illness Fellowship of Australia. He said:


Life is full of turning points and I have experienced a few of them personally and politically.


One of the very special turning points is the birth of a child, a child of your very own to nurture and love. Here is the future so full of promise and possibility.


For some, another turning point comes when you are told that your child has a mental illness. This can be a place of fear, uncertainty and confusion. It can be the beginning of a long and difficult journey for both you as a parent and your child. Yet there is and should be hope. All mental illnesses are treatable.


The Hon. Frank Walker QC was well able to speak personally and with great authority because of the personal tragedies that he confronted and that the Leader of the Government referred to in his contribution. It is often forgotten that those in public life also have personal and private lives and there is no doubt that the Hon. Frank Walker was greatly impacted by the issues faced by his two sons. I am sure that Senator Faulkner will provide a longer and more personal account of the life and times of the Hon. Francis Walker QC, who can be rightly seen as a Labor luminary. The coalition simply yet sincerely salutes the Hon. Francis Walker QC's contribution to public life. We extend our condolences to his widow Pam, extended family and friends within the Labor movement.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (15:53):  On behalf of the Australian Greens I extend our condolences to Frank Walker's family and colleagues. I learnt much about Frank's life from the speakers we just heard and I would like to add a few of my own reflections. Frank's public life was very much about people and about righting wrongs, no matter how entrenched they had become in our society. He took on many of the tough issues. In the 1970s, when the people of New South Wales started to become acquainted with Frank Walker as the Attorney-General in Neville Wran's government, Australia was just emerging from a time of stultifying conservatism. New South Wales needed Frank Walker's vision and commitment. Frank worked to ensure all people had dignity in their day-to-day lives. 


A standout in Frank's work was that he successfully repealed offensive discriminatory laws. The Summary Offences Act for too long had allowed New South Wales police to legally abuse the disadvantaged and homeless in New South Wales. Frank moved quickly to repeal this law. I had the opportunity to witness these developments at close quarters as a member of the New South Wales Women's Advisory Council in the early 1980s. We worked with the Attorney-General, Mr Walker, closely on what were then called the rape laws. The issues we grappled with were sensitive and challenging. Frank's understanding of women's rights informed his excellent advice which contributed to the new sexual laws Jocelynne Scutt and others worked so hard to achieve. Entrenched discrimination was the only casualty when Frank took this work on. 


Frank Walker also brought law reform to what was then a largely hidden issue—domestic violence. The Attorney-General introduced provocation into murder trials. While this may be controversial in some circles to this day, Frank Walker's work brought immediate relief in some individual cases and greater understanding to the plight of the victims of domestic violence. The case of Bruce and Violet Roberts, who had been convicted of murder, was the catalyst for Frank's groundbreaking work in this area. Bruce and Violet had suffered years of abuse from their father and husband, but the defence of provocation was not available. They were found guilty and jailed. Frank changed the law so the victims of domestic violence in such tragic situations could use provocation as part of their defence. 


With such an active and fruitful life we need to be wary of nominating Frank's most significant achievements, but his work for state-based land rights legislation, a first in any state in Australia, would have to vie for that top spot. Frank continued his work for the disadvantaged and Labor causes when he was elected to the House of Representatives. I do note that there were times when Frank suffered because of the stand he had taken. Disgruntled police officers, annoyed with the end of the Summary Offences Act, and some corporate interests gave him a hard time, but Frank always bounced back. Frank pursued a career that did bring him public standing, but it was always in the context of serving others. We saw this commitment continue when Frank left parliament, after losing his seat at the 1996 election. He then threw himself into working on compensation rights and schizophrenia issues. The Australian Greens recognise Frank Walker's contribution to Australian public life. It is fairer and more decent for his actions. His loved ones—Pamela, family and friends—can feel very proud of Frank's life.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:57):  I rise to associate myself with the comments that have been made about the life and times of the Hon. Frank Walker QC. I would also like to recognise the contribution to progressive politics and the law that Frank Walker has made over many years and express my condolences to his wife Pamela, family and friends. I first met Frank at a Wran community cabinet at Muswellbrook, when I was a delegate at Liddell power station. Frank was in Muswellbrook for a cabinet meeting with Labor luminaries like Neville Wran, Jack Ferguson and Bob Debus. I found Frank from day one to be extremely confident, competent and an impressive politician and person. He was an engaging and effective communicator. 


The important thing about Frank was his vision for social justice. He was a leading advocate for civil rights, and Bob Debus recently described him as 'one of the great civil libertarians of our time' in New South Wales with reforms to the criminal law, reforms to child welfare, reforms to anti-discrimination legislation and the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983. Dealing with issues of poverty and discrimination were some of the keynote issues that Frank Walker dealt with during his illustrious political career. He also, as has been indicated, pioneered rights for victims of domestic violence. As Attorney-General, Frank was targeted by corrupt police; he was subject to bomb threats; and there were attempts to smear and frame him in relation to the Nugan Hand bank. But he came through all of that and continued to participate in progressive political agendas until his death. The Dust Diseases Tribunal was an area that he as a judge would have found extremely interesting and important. Looking after workers who had been smitten by asbestos related diseases was extremely important for Frank, and I could not think of a better job or a better person to help victims of this disease than Frank Walker. He then became a District Court judge and an eminent jurist, and as always brought that great energy, confidence and competence to that position.


Frank Walker will be missed by the Labor Party. He will be missed by the progressive side of politics in this country. Forty years of fighting for the underdog with courage and determination marks the life of Frank Walker. I again offer my condolences to his family and friends.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (16:00):  Frank Walker was an unforgettable and inescapable feature of the New South Wales Labor landscape for those of us whose political involvement began in the 1970s. He was widely known in the party as a prominent left winger whose youth and energy were a real contribution to the Wran government's air of freshness; whose advocacy of the causes of environmental protection, civil liberties and Indigenous rights appealed to the growing community concern of the time on those issues; whose enthusiastic reform agenda changed much about the state of New South Wales and whose skill and drive as a campaigner shored up marginal seats at a state and federal level. Frank was driven by his ideals—ideals first shaped in childhood by watching his father hold steadfastly to his political convictions, no matter the cost. He found his home in the left wing of the Australian Labor Party, where he found people who shared a commitment to the causes he cared about.


Since his death, Frank has frequently been described as a factional warrior, closely involved in the internal struggles of his party and his faction no matter where he was—from state backbencher to federal minister. Internal politics in New South Wales Labor was played hard. Frank Walker fought hard to promote the values and causes important to him and to protect his interests and the interests of those close to him—as did we all. More than once Frank challenged the leadership of the Left in New South Wales. In 1971, as a member of a small dissident left factional grouping, he nominated against Arthur Gietzelt for the then federal executive of the ALP. In the early 1980s he moved to formalise the Left in the New South Wales state parliamentary Labor Party where the Labor Right had a natural majority. In the late 1980s he was instrumental in the New South Wales left faction, the old Combined Unions' and Branches' Steering Committee, rebadging itself as the Socialist Left. And in 1993 he was suspended from the Left for 12 months after nominating against the Left's ticket for the first Keating ministry—and winning.


It was not always so. Many of Frank's interventions in internal party matters did not end in triumph. Whether in the party or in the public arena, Frank Walker played his politics hard. He played to win and he did have wins to his name as well as losses. At the end of his career he could point to a long list of significant legislative achievements, from the repeal of the Summary Offences Act, as Neville Wran's Attorney General at the beginning of his ministerial career, to his groundbreaking work on implementing Mabo. Repealing then Liberal Party Premier Askin's 1970 Summary Offences Act—the act that made it literally a crime to be poor, to have less than $15 in your pocket, the act that made it a crime for two or more people to assemble without the authorisation of the Commissioner of Police—earned him the hostility of the New South Wales Police Force. His work on native title, in the Keating government, earned him the hostility of Liberal state premiers and plenty of mining magnates. I think he would have seen both as a sign that he was doing his job.


Frank was considered by many to be abrasive and combative. The stories of many of his successes are inevitably the stories of triumph over the implacable opposition of enemies, some within his own faction, in part because Frank did have a knack of making enemies. He pursued his goals single-mindedly. The dedication that made him an excellent campaigner in a preselection or a marginal seat led to more than a few ruffled feathers among those who dealt with him. But he would not be swayed from what he thought was the right course of action—not by threats, not by hostility, and not, as I found on the odd occasion, by persuasion or logic either. But none of us in the Labor Party should ever forget Frank's heroic by-election victory in 1970. The seat of Georges River had been a safe Liberal seat where the ALP was given virtually no chance of winning. Frank's victory changed politics in New South Wales. He was a breath of fresh air. He knew it was a very difficult seat to hold.


Frank gave a lot of attention to why Labor continually lost postal votes in election after election, state and federal. He broke new ground for the Labor Party by developing a postal vote register. This might not seem like much now but at the time it was revolutionary. It transformed Labor's performance in campaigning and postal voting. He and his campaign team would keep a record of those who had asked to be assisted with postal voting, for whatever reason, be they ill, infirm, disabled, housebound, travelling or overseas. And those electors did not have to ask for a postal vote application again; Frank's campaign team would always offer the service and the service was appreciated.


In 1976, when Labor won the seats of Gosford and Hurstville by literally just a handful of votes—and hence the 1976 state election which installed Neville Wran as premier—the postal vote campaign techniques that Frank developed made the difference. Labor would not have won the 1976 New South Wales state election without the campaign techniques developed by Frank Walker. Before Frank Walker, Labor lost the close results; after Frank Walker, Labor won the close ones. This will always be a lasting legacy.


Frank and I were not close, but we did have a cordial and professional relationship. We served together in the Keating ministry from 1993 to 1996. But I will never forget one great act of solidarity from Frank. In 1981, when I was persona non grata and sent to Coventry as the then left wing Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the ALP, I was uninvited to the head office staff Christmas party. In fact, I was not invited to anything. So the leadership of the Left at the time held its own Christmas party for me—in my office! The then New South Wales Attorney-General, Minister of Justice and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Frank Walker, arrived in my office at Sussex Street with his Christmas present—a New South Wales branch ALP rule book with every page blank because, as Frank's annotation read, the Sussex Street machine just ignored the party rules anyway! I appreciated his gift and his solidarity, and I have lodged Frank's Christmas present in the National Archives of Australia.


Frank Walker carried a terrible burden with his tragic family circumstances and, typically, was driven by his own tragedy to fight to make the circumstances of others better. His work as the Vice-President of the Mental Illness Fellowship of Australia, the Deputy President of the New South Wales Mental Health Review Tribunal and the President of the Schizophrenia Fellowship of New South Wales was characterised by the same determination and dedication that he had brought to the state and federal parliaments. He remained, to the end of his life, in his own words, 'committed to democracy, human rights, civil liberties and a tolerant and inclusive society'. And he continued to work until the end of his life for those causes. I join with other senators in extending my sincere sympathy to Frank's family and friends.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (16:33):  In speaking to this motion on the government's determination to exacerbate cost-of-living pressures for Australian households through the introduction of the world's biggest carbon tax on 1 July, there are a number of points that I think are well worth making. I will start by referring to an old political aphorism that would be known to those who have been hanging around the game of politics for some time. It is about what politicians usually need to do to get a message out—that is, talk to the people. It is along the lines of: just when you become bored with saying it, they probably have not even started listening so you should keep saying it. Those of us who have worked in campaigns over many years would have heard this, used it and hopefully listened to it.


What is intriguing in this instance is that we have to reverse it. We have a government that is not listening to what the people are saying, even though the people keep repeating the message that they do not like the carbon tax and they do not want it to be introduced. It seems to me that, although people are probably quite bored with saying it—but they will keep on, I suspect—the government simply is not listening to them So even the aphorism in reverse is not working for this government.


It does not matter where you are in Australia, what you are doing or what you are engaged in: in the forums that members of the coalition have been holding all over the country to discuss issues that are predicated on the carbon tax, people are raising their concerns about it before the member raises the subject. It is raised when you are in shopping centres. In fact, the piece de resistance was someone raising concerns about the carbon tax with me last week while I was at the State of Origin football game at ANZ Stadium in New South Wales. I was proudly wearing blue for the Blues—who, I might note for the record, won. A gentleman sitting a couple of rows in front of me and my Queensland colleague Senator Barnaby Joyce made his views very clearly known. As a political representative you cannot go anywhere in this country without being stopped to hear concerns about the carbon tax raised with you.


In regard to exacerbating the pain that Australian households are feeling, this government is going to win a gold medal. You would have thought that they had already caused enough pain with their particular spending habits, but, no, Australian families will be hit again on 1 July.


The Prime Minister and other members of the cabinet can try to use nice, benign language like 'putting a price on carbon', but let us not make any error about this. This carbon tax is going to hit the hip pockets of all Australians. It will affect the price of everything, and many Australians are very concerned about its impact. It does not matter whether we are speaking about housing, electricity, health, education or something as simple as council rates. Every time Australians open their mail at the moment there is a new piece of correspondence from a utility company or from their local council or from another agency in their community saying, 'As of 1 July we will be forced to pursue a price rise.' It makes for sad and sorry reading at the end of a busy working day. It will penalise, for example, in one of my shadow portfolio areas, new-home builders, for cutting emissions by building homes that are more energy efficient than existing homes—because, frankly, the carbon tax will increase the cost of building the average new home by $5,200, even after compensation, according to the estimates of the Housing Industry Association. And the Housing Industry Association have been at great pains, and gone to great lengths, to raise their concerns with government representatives and within the community as to the impact that this will have on new home construction in this country. New-home builders already have to comply with state based energy efficiency schemes, so how on earth will penalising builders of energy-efficient homes save the environment and reduce the national housing shortage that has increased to 228,000 homes, as at 1 July, according to the latest National Housing Supply Council key indicators 2012 report? The answer is pretty simple: it won't. And those numbers are not getting any better. We waited a very long time for the National Housing Supply Council to be reconstituted by this government, all the while concerned about where the figures were going in relation to the building of new homes vis-a-vis the demand. What is clear to us is that increasing the cost of building new homes is only going to impact even more negatively on those figures.


We have subcontractors all over Australia, in all aspects of the construction industry, who are very concerned about actually losing their own businesses, about being driven to the wall. Independent subbies do not receive any compensation for the increased costs that are going to result from the carbon tax. The scarcity of subcontractors is already a challenge for home builders—and, as they become more scarce, it will increase the cost for home builders. In growing parts of Australia, particularly like Western Sydney, where many areas are being opened up for development, this is a very significant challenge. But what about the challenge it presents to the subcontractors themselves, to their families and to their businesses? It appears to be something that the government has absolutely no regard for.


So building is discouraged through higher costs. We have a carbon tax coming in on 1 July which will only exacerbate the housing shortage and hurt even tenants, who are already facing rents that are rising well above inflation. That puts very significant pressure on marginal renters on low incomes, on those in accommodation like caravan parks, and increases the pressure on homelessness services. Those of us who have, in our own capital cities and communities, seen the recent business and CEO sleep-outs that either have happened or are going to happen, will know only too clearly how difficult that environment is.


The cash handouts that are supposed to compensate for this tax are not going to fool homeowners, they are not going to fool investors, and frankly they are not going to fool poor tenants who are struggling on a daily basis. We are seeing the government insulting the intelligence of the Australian community by trying to make a calculation of how much better off or worse off individuals will be, but the thing that we do know for certain is that, no matter what the calculations are, the carbon tax will keep prices and costs going up. It will cause electricity prices to skyrocket. In my own area of Western Sydney, IPART in New South Wales has indicated that electricity prices will increase by 11.8 per cent by 1 July. There is not a single household or a single small business that will not be impacted by those rises. They will be paying on average an extra $208 a year in electricity prices for households and an extra $270 a year for businesses.


I talk to people, as I know all my colleagues do, who are struggling to meet their staff payments, let alone their rental payments, let alone their utilities payments, and struggling to keep Australians employed. How they are expected to continue to do that after 1 July is probably the greatest mystery of 2012 at this point. We have increases in gas bills, and we will find ourselves paying the world's highest electricity prices for the world's largest carbon tax, and the government will not even tell us what it will do for the environment ultimately.


The happy reminder—and I use the word 'happy' with great irony—is that, every time families turn on the light switch, they will be asking, 'How can I afford to pay this bill?' And in some cases they are not turning on the light switches or the heating, in parts of Australia that are very cold and very lonely places if you are fighting these sorts of challenges.


Our message is that there is absolutely nothing right about this carbon tax and the electricity price increases it will cause—for example, talk to a local hospital. I noticed that recently in Sydney the Daily Telegraph ran a few headlines, 'Even schools and hospitals feel the carbon tax' and 'Carbon tax bill $46 million for hospitals and schools'. I was at Westmead hospital last October, with the shadow minister for health, the Hon. Peter Dutton, a member of the other place, talking to locals about the impact on that hospital—which, based on the assessments that they have made, could face up to $728,000 a year in electricity costs, putting extra burdens on local suppliers. It is inconceivable that a hospital struggling to meet its budgets now has to be asked to re-manage its allocations to incorporate those sorts of costs. Think about the number of staff they could have on the floor for that. Think about the sorts of impacts it is having on local families. Think about the communities that are looking at this challenge from 1 July, looking at the impact it will have on their lives, on their children, on their aged parents—on whatever part of the community you care to look at. You hear it every single day. (Time expired)

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:43):  Here we have it again: yet another piece of misinformation, another missive from the Orwellian motion-writing department of the Liberal Party of Australia. In that great tradition of anti-reform, anti-change, do-nothing conserva­tives, here they are again, dishing up in the Senate the same old scaremongering, the same old attempts to terrify the Australian public into believing their scare campaign around the important public initiative of pricing carbon in our economy. Those on that side are well and truly glass-half-empty people—to borrow a phrase used by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens last week—because here they go again with their scare campaign around the important policy of pricing carbon.


Let us get to a few of the facts about carbon pricing in Australia. The first fact is that both the coalition and the Labor Party have the same target for emission reductions in our economy: five per cent by 2020. We have the exact same target. With that in mind, the question then becomes: what is the most efficient, effective and, importantly, the cheapest way of reducing emissions in our economy over time? There has been a lot work undertaken to answer this question. In fact, no fewer than 37 parliamentary inquiries on that question have been undertaken in this place since 1992. They include the Shergold report, which was established by none other than former Prime Minister John Howard. John Howard asked Professor Shergold to inquire into that exact question—the most efficient and effective and the cheapest way of reducing carbon emissions in the Australian economy. All 37 of them, including the Shergold review, recommend a market based mechanism as being the cheapest, most efficient and effective method of reducing emissions in our economy—the same scheme that Labor is implementing with its clean energy future package. 


Another fact is that not all Australians will directly pay the carbon price. The 500 biggest polluting companies in our economy will bear the direct liability for paying a cost associated with their carbon emissions. Initially, it will be $23 per tonne before we move to a market or floating price in three years time. There will be indirect costs; we know that. We have been upfront with the Australian people about that. Some of the 500 biggest companies will pass on their costs and that will result in an increase in electricity costs and other expenses for households and small businesses. But what we have done is asked the Treasury to undertake a modelling exercise to estimate what those costs will be for families and for small businesses in our economy—and they have done exactly that. It is the biggest economic modelling exercise in this country's history. It is even bigger than the GST modelling that was undertaken in 1998. 


Let us put this into context. The GST was modelled by the same people in Treasury in 1998. They said that the price effect from the introduction of the goods and services tax would be 2.49 per cent on the consumer price index—in other words, prices in our economy would rise by 2.49 per cent. Guess what the figure came in at when the GST was introduced? The price effect, the CPI, rose by 2.5 per cent. They were spot on then and they will be spot on now. What they have said this time, after undertaking the modelling, is that the price effect of the government's clean energy future package will be 0.7 of one per cent on the consumer price index—in other words, prices will rise by less than one per cent. That is one fifth of the effect of the goods and services tax when it was introduced in 1998.  


Another fact is that if companies try to price gouge, if they do try to increase prices, we have given additional powers to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate and prosecute those organisations. Let me tell you: it is working. I had a mate of mine who works for a construction company ring me a few weeks ago. He said, 'Mate, this doesn't sound right. A contractor that we use has attempted to push their prices up and to use the carbon price as an excuse.' I said to him, 'Mate, go back and ask them to put it in writing and tell them that, if they are not comfortable with it, you will refer them to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and get them to check whether or not this particular company is taking the mickey, so to speak.' He did that. He rang back a couple of days later and said, 'You know what, mate, thanks for that advice because it worked. They've changed their tune. They wouldn't put it in writing and they've reduced their prices.' They know that they will be prosecuted if they seek to price gouge under the new scheme. 


We know that there will be price effects, but we believe that the economic decision that is being made by this country is in the best interests of our country. We are transitioning from an industrial economy to a clean energy future. It is the equivalent of the economic transformation that occurred in our economy over 100 years ago, when we moved from an agricultural society to an industrial society. During that period it was a difficult transition, but we supported families and we got through it. In the end, it was better for our economy. It resulted in changes in capital flows and it also resulted in increased investment in new technology, new industries, jobs growth and wealth creation for this country. We are about to enter the next phase of our economic development and again there will be new investment, research and development, jobs growths and growth for our economy. 


We are providing assistance to households to make the transition. This is what peeves me about the opposition's motion. We are doing all we can to support households and families with cost-of-living pressures. There are elements of the household assistance package which support most Australian households in this country. If you are a single pensioner, you will get a $250 increase in your pension on an annual basis. There will be $380 for couples to help them make the transition to a clean energy future. If you are a student, you will get $190 per year in assistance to help you make the transition to a clean energy future. If you are a job seeker, you will get $180 as a single and $300 as a couple in assistance from the government to help you meet those cost-of-living pressures. We are providing tax cuts for most Australians. Anyone who is earning less than $80,000 a year will get on average a $300 a year tax cut. We are tripling the tax free threshold from $6,000 to $18,000 to ensure that it is a massive tax break for low-income people in this country. In the recent budget, we announced a schoolkids bonus because we understand the cost-of-living pressures that families are facing with sending kids to school—the cost of school uniforms, shoes, books, bags and all those sorts of things. There is $410 for each primary school student and $820 for each high school student. This is support for families in their bank accounts to help them meet these cost-of-living pressures. We are increasing the family tax benefit, up to an extra $600 for families under this government to provide support to help meet cost-of-living pressures. 


   We live in the real world. We know that people are facing cost-of-living pressures associated with increasing electricity and gas prices, but people have to be conscious—and this is why the opposition's motion is a complete fabrication—that the carbon price has not started yet. You cannot possibly blame the carbon price for the increases in electricity costs which have been imposed on families to date. We all know that the reality behind increases in electricity costs is state governments upgrading the network infrastructure, particularly the high-voltage transmission wires that transport electricity from a power station to a substation in the local area. These wires have been upgraded in New South Wales. State governments have undertaken the process of upgrading the network and there have been quite high increases in electricity costs associated with that.


   In New South Wales over the last 12 months there has been an 18 per cent increase in electricity costs, all due to network upgrades. If you read the decisions of the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal, IPART, they point to the fact that network upgrades have been associated with increasing costs. In the coming year there will be a 20 per cent increase in electricity prices in New South Wales. Some of that is because of the carbon price but, guess what? We said that the cost effect would be 10 per cent. We were upfront with the Australian people: a 10 per cent increase in electricity costs because of the carbon price. The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal confirmed the Treasury's figures. In their most recent decision to increase electricity prices by 20 per cent they admitted that the cost of the carbon price will be 10 per cent or lower, not greater, consistent with the Treasury modelling. Yet here we have the opposition again coming into this place trying to blame the carbon price solely for increases in electricity costs. Most increases have been due to network upgrades undertaken by state governments. 


What has been the response of the New South Wales state government? Bear in mind what I said earlier about the fact that the federal government is conscious that there are cost pressures associated with electricity and gas prices. Our response in the recent federal budget was to introduce a supplementary payment to assist families to meet costs associated with electricity and gas prices. It is $210 for singles and $350 for couples, to help them meet increasing electricity prices. Compare that to the New South Wales Liberal government. Its response to electricity price increases, solely the result of network upgrades undertaken by that particular government, has been a $75 rebate—a measly $75 announced in their recent budget, compared to $350 support from the Australian government. That is a stark reminder of the difference between our parties when it comes to supporting families with meeting cost-of-living pressures in our economy.


What is the response of those opposite to some of these issues? How are they going to support families into the future? The answer is simple: we do not know. The Australian public would not have a clue, because those opposite will not announce any of their policies; they will not come clean with the Australian public about what plans and services they intend to cut. As usual, we have had some leaks from those opposite, from their shadow cabinet. They indicate that those opposite are planning $70 billion worth of cuts to services when they come to government. That will be their welcome present to the Australian public if they get elected in this country—$70 billion worth of cuts to services. 


What will those cuts to services do to cost-of-living pressures and support for households and families? When we came to government we increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent—a great support for families to help meet the cost of sending small kids to childcare and getting an important start on education. Is that on the chopping block? Who knows? It possibly is. Medicare, support for universal health care, something that families rely on to ensure they make ends meet, is that on the chopping block? Perhaps it is. They will not tell us. We have programmed increases in the pension. During the 11 years of the Howard government they did not increase the pension once but since we have come to government we have done it twice. What is the prospect for increases for pensioners? We have already seen Joe Hockey begin to back away from the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which will provide a lot of support for people who are living with disabilities and their carers to meet their cost-of-living pressures.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2012-06-18,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (16:58):  In supporting this matter of public importance I want to begin by looking at where the government is on this. This Australian Labor Party, with its long history, is travelling with a primary vote of less than 30 per cent. In Western Australia it is about 26 per cent and I think it is about 25 or 26 per cent in Queensland. Why is that? Many Labor senators say it is because the coalition is running a scare campaign. It is pretty scary when you are confronting a cold, hungry, penniless winter, when you cannot afford electricity, you cannot afford to travel, you cannot afford water. In Western Australia the biggest on-grid user of electricity is the Water Corporation. It is pretty scary. Yet I hear senators on the other side say, 'The government's been upfront with the Australian people.' When was it upfront? 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'—that is very upfront. The Treasurer, 'This is a hysterical allegation.' That is right upfront. This crazy government is embarking upon economic suicide for this country.


They will not mention this tax, they dare not mention its name: the carbon tax, putting a price on carbon. Who thinks the Australian people are that dumb? Putting a price on carbon—it is a carbon tax; call it a carbon tax. Have a modicum of decency and honesty: you are going to tax the living daylights out of industry and business and you are going to send the cost of living through the roof like a skyrocket. But you do not care, because you want the money. You have spent every cent you had; you want more. This is the Labor Party in action. It is pretty scary. And people are scared. They are scared of the cold, hungry, penniless winters they have to confront with a carbon tax.


Why did the Prime Minister deny there would be a carbon tax—'There will be no carbon tax'—instead of saying, 'A carbon tax will provide a clean energy future for all of us and we will all be better off'? No. She did not say that. She said, 'There will be no carbon tax.' And the Treasurer said, 'This is a hysterical allegation. We're not doing it.' Why not? Could it be that the cost of living will go through the roof like a skyrocket? Business, especially small business, will be under siege in terms of cost inputs. There will be a devastated economy. People will not spend, because they will be paying so much more for electricity. The price of petrol will be up by 6.5c a litre; the price of gas, 10 per cent a year; the price of groceries, particularly in regional Australia, will go through the roof because, in 2014, the cost of transport will be brought in, depending on where you live; and there will be electricity price hikes of $300 to $400 a year. But a carbon tax is a hysterical allegation; it was never going to happen. Within months we have a carbon tax. And the Labor Party are wondering why people do not believe them when they say, 'We've been upfront with the Australian people.' They have been everything but upfront with the Australian people. They have misled the Australian people and they know it. The Australian people have woken up to the sad sorry dawn of these misrepresenters—these fakes—who will say anything if they think the front page will keep their posteriors covered.


We in Western Australia have massive freight infrastructure costs coming with this carbon tax. Thousands of kilometres are travelled by transport companies to deliver basic staples—groceries, bread and milk. The prices of these things will go through the roof. A little town where I spent a lot of my younger days, Kalgoorlie, depends entirely upon Perth for its water, 600 kilometres away. How does the water get there? By electricity. You do not think people in Kalgoorlie are going to pay a hell of a lot more for their water? Our energy is generated by coal at Collie. I cannot believe I have to give a lesson like this. We have a desal plant providing water for Western Australia. Where does the energy come from? Electricity.


The biggest on-grid user of electricity in the Perth metropolitan area for the movement of potable water and sewage is the Water Corporation. People in Perth will be hit with their electricity bills and then their water bills.


But what about the economy generally? Victoria's manufacturing base, the heartland of manufacturing in Australia, has been built upon low cents per kilowatt hour from Gippsland. That has been our massive economic advantage. What are we doing to it? We are going to chop it off at the knees.


This crazy government does not understand anything about economics. This carbon tax will be ruinous. By 2020, $3.5 billion will have been spent each year on foreign carbon credits. It will rise by 2050 to $57 billion—that is, money offshore, to Upper Volta and Niger. That is the equivalent of 1.5 per cent of GDP. That is what we are currently spending on defence. This will take the defence portfolio out of our GDP. That is what it amounts to.


Do you think the government care about pensioners and people sitting in homes, in cold climates such as Tasmania and Victoria, desperate to be heated, desperate to cook their food where the price of electricity goes up and up, because they cannot make their sums add up? We only had to see the defence minister four days before the budget rip $5 billion out of the defence budget like an ATM because the calculator would not come up with the right number. This is the worst piece of public administration. Labor senators do not care. In New South Wales, we have seen electricity prices going through the roof. The carbon tax will come in and they will have to pay it, so they are trying to get some capital on the table so that they have the money to pay this tax. Electricity prices in South Australia are going up 18 per cent and 24 local government councils have received 'please explain' letters: 'We're naming and shaming you; we want you to pay the tax.' People who receive their rates in 2012-13 will wonder why on earth they have gone through the roof. Landfill sites, the collecting of rubbish—all of these things—are in the frame. But Labor just does not care about people's standard of living.


This carbon tax will be one of the greatest underminers of Australia's economic capability. And guess what? China is not having a bar of it. Canada is not touching it. The miners of Canada do not have to do anything, so their nickel, copper, lead and zinc will be a lot cheaper than ours. Japan and the United States are not touching it.


So here we are trying to compete, exporting everything we produce, with countries that do not have this massive carbon tax eating away like a cancer at their economic base. Towards the end of my time to speak, I say that, frankly, the minister has not said very much in her time, to my knowledge, but one thing she did say in 2009, about a carbon tax, a carbon price, was this. She said:


The introduction of a carbon price ahead of effective international action can lead to perverse incentives for such industries to relocate or source production offshore. There is no point in imposing a carbon price domestically which results in emissions and production transferring internationally for no environmental gain.


There, in her own words, she has told us exactly what the Labor Party is doing. Let us look at those words again. She said:


The introduction of a carbon price ahead of effective international action can lead to perverse incentives for such industries to relocate or source production offshore. There is no point in imposing a carbon price domestically which results in emissions and production transferring internationally for no environmental gain.


We know that without those other countries doing anything there is zero environmental gain, and here were the Labor Party being upfront with the Australian people and telling us what they are not going to do. Yet then they went right ahead, as they like and as clear as day, and imposed exactly what they said they would not. So they were telling us how bad it would be but they were still doing it.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:08):  We have really heard it all now in relation to the opposition's position on climate change and their terrible opposition towards pricing carbon, which they really cannot cope with because they are so divided on whether or not they even believe in doing something in relation to climate change—so much so, of course, that the hardliners, the sceptics like Senator Eric Abetz, and perhaps Senator Johnston falls into that category as well, continued to deny the facts right up until the time that they decided to roll their leader at the time, Malcolm Turnbull, on the subject because they simply could not live with the fact that pricing carbon was something he wanted to do, because they could not believe in it. That was despite the overwhelming science. We know how much science is out there and we also know that for decades in this parliament—and this goes for other parliaments across the world—we have been in conversation about the need to tackle climate change. Even their own former Prime Minister, John Howard, was willing to tackle climate change. He actually said an ETS was the least-cost option for families, that pricing carbon was a major reform and that you could not reduce emissions without a carbon price. That was their leader, their Prime Minister, but now that he has left the other place they are happy to walk away from coalition policy which was, in fact, addressing climate change—and addressing it with an ETS. Why are we doing the ETS? Because we know it is the most cost-effective option, as opposed to the opposition's so-called direct action policy. The ETS is the most efficient way to reduce emissions as well, with targets to meet our obligation to reducing carbon dioxide by five per cent by 2020 levels.


Senator Johnston talked—like he was some expert in the field—about how the rest of the globe are not introducing an ETS and how nothing is going on in relation to climate change. His comments could not be further from the truth. In fact, he has misled this place by stating that China, for example, is not having a bar of it. That is absolutely incorrect and I urge Senator Johnston to correct the record and to actually look at exactly what China is doing. He can go online and see very easily that, in their new, 12th five-year plan, from 2011 to 2015, China have launched an energy saving and emissions reduction plan, establishing carbon-trading pilot schemes across seven provinces and cities to start in 2013. Why are they doing that? They are doing that in order to establish whether they will then introduce a national ETS, to be ready by 2016. We are talking about the biggest polluting country on the globe taking action on climate change in the form of none other than an emissions trading scheme. So we have an emissions trading scheme on which action is being taken by a developing country that has recognised that it needs to improve its image, that it is the largest polluter now, that it has overtaken the US as being the largest polluter with its rising economic growth, that it does not want to continue on a path of growth at any cost and that it wants to look at growth at a sustainable level—sustainable so that it is meeting its economic development plans in a sustainable way. In doing so, it has allowed the emergence of NGOs and the media to monitor compliance with its ETS and other schemes.


This is the world's largest emitter of carbon, China, taking action—let alone the European Union, who have been active for a long time. The reason why China has delayed doing so up until now is that there is a belief in those countries of the developing world that we are in this global pollution situation because of the activities in earlier decades by the developed world—by Australia, by the US, by the EU nations—and that it is actually our responsibility to lead the way. That is exactly what Australia is doing, as we should. We should show those developing countries that, while we did do a lot of polluting in the past, not knowing the effects on our environment that those emissions were causing, now that we do know we are righting those wrongs of the past. We are leading by example and we are taking care of that responsibility in introducing an emissions trading scheme. In doing so, we encourage the developing world—which we need to be on board with us if we are going to reduce our carbon emissions and that is especially so with nations like China, who are the biggest polluter through their economic growth—to ensure that they do something about it too. So they are watching us to see what action we are taking.


Now, if the coalition had their way, China would not act. Some of those other developing nations would not act if developed countries did not do so themselves. So it is absolutely a furphy for Senator Johnston to come in here and say China is not having a bar of it. I ask him to do his homework and understand exactly what is going on in other countries, both developed and developing, in the world. Of course, the opposition want to roll back the numerous tax cuts that we are introducing through this package. Let us make it very clear, just in case the opposition senators have completely forgotten the way in which this package works. We will be taking the revenue that we receive from the biggest polluters and providing half of that revenue in assistance to households right across the country, including, as Senator Johnston alluded to, those Tasmanians who may be cold at night—including Tasmanians who need our support. In ensuring that we do so, how are we doing it? We are introducing a higher rate of family tax benefit. We are introducing an increase on pensions. We are introducing the tripling of the tax-free threshold. We are introducing other benefits and allowances to help households with the modest cost-of-living impact of the carbon price.


If, as Senator Thistlethwaite said earlier, there are power prices that are increasing right now, that is because the companies increasing them need to do so because of their ageing infrastructure requirements. We do not have a price on carbon yet. It is not 1 July yet. But we are ensuring that, come that time, we can provide the necessary benefits and requirements to support those households in meeting that cost so it will be offset. It is really a no-brainer. It is a simple policy of providing support to those people who will need it, through offsetting the increase on their electricity through the carbon tax.


Why are we doing all this? We are doing all this because we know that it is the right thing to do for not just this generation but future generations. We believe in taking responsibility for our future and for our children's prosperity, and that is why we introduced the clean energy future bills. Once we are gone from this place, we will have done our bit to ensure that our nation's contribution to our planet has ensured that it is there for many, many, many millennia to come. The science tells us that our own increased emission of carbon into the atmosphere is having an impact. It is having an impact on our oceans. It is having an impact on our atmosphere. It is having an impact on our way of living. We need to ensure that we amend those mistakes of the past by introducing a price on carbon which will result in an emissions trading scheme which will change behaviour for companies, for business, for the way in which we live. It is something that we are already doing every day in the way we live to reduce our carbon footprint on this planet as much as we possibly can. Through our assistance, households will receive that increase of $9.90 a week, while the average assistance will be $10.10 per week, all assisting us to introduce this incredible reform policy by 1 July. It will ensure that we very much improve our standing globally and our standing as a nation, for us and our children, in relation to carbon pricing and climate change as we go forward into the future.

 (South Australia) (17:18):  I rise to address this matter of public importance because the public are concerned about things that work or do not work, and this carbon tax—let us call it what it is, not necessarily a 'clean energy future' or any of the other names that have been given to it—does not work. It stops work and it is a work of false testimony, for which this government and all of its members and its coalition partners in the Greens need to be held to account.


Why doesn't it work? One place where it has been tried, for example, is the European Union. The European Union has an ETS of a limited nature, but it is an ETS and it is one that the Gillard government has frequently called our attention to as an exemplar of why Australia should go down this path. One of the largest banks in Switzerland and one of the world's most respected banks released a report last year on the carbon price. Its very title gives us most of the information we need to know. The report was titled 'Carbon price to collapse: €210 billion wasted'. They highlighted that the carbon price has had 'limited benefits and embarrassing consequences, including billions of euros of windfall profits and fraud'. They highlighted that the carbon price in Europe has been responsible for creating double-digit increases in electricity prices and yet has done nothing—I repeat, nothing—for the environment. It has had zero or 'almost zero' impact on emissions. However, if the money had been used on direct action—that is, replacing their dirtiest plants—emissions could have dropped by nearly 43 per cent.


That goes to the heart of some of the coalition's beef with the government over this, in that people who care for the environment also want action that is effective. As UBS has shown, carbon pricing does not work. Labor actually are aware of that, because Penny Wong, when she was the Minister for Climate Change and Water, said:


A carbon tax does not guarantee emissions reductions.


So, even a couple of portfolios ago, Senator Wong—and the government—knew that a carbon tax did not necessarily guarantee that it would have the desired effect on the environment.


Families know that it does not work. In South Australia at the moment, we are heading towards the most expensive electricity prices in the world. The Energy Users Association, which compares household prices across 92 countries, showed earlier this year that South Australia had the third highest prices; and it is saying that, when the carbon tax comes in, increasing the average residential power bill by more than $150 in its first year, South Australia will have the highest power prices in the world. So families know it will not work. Logic tells you that it will not work in the long term. It will not work for the environment and it will not work for our nation. When it becomes an emissions trading scheme, the price will float according to the market. One of the factors that the UBS report highlighted is that the carbon price in Europe has had, in their words, 'a dramatic decline' of about 40 per cent and they anticipate that it will crash. If 40 per cent is just a reduction, a crash will be dramatic—and we are talking in the order of $4 per tonne, rather than the $23. So, if the subsidies that Senator Singh and the members opposite have been highlighting are going to be paid to Australian factories and families to compensate for this government's carbon tax and yet the price is dropping from $23 down to $4, that is a long-term structural problem for our economy. Conversely, if the prices increase to the levels that have been forecast, which are into the hundreds of dollars—according to those who say that the carbon tax is a good idea—then clearly the compensation that is being paid will be woefully inadequate to shelter those people and those businesses that are exposed. In the long term it does not work, which is possibly part of the reason that most of the people from the government who are speaking about the carbon tax, although they will not use that word, are not talking about its environmental impacts, but are talking about the money.


Our Prime Minister, on Twitter with the hashtag 'cashforyou', is more concerned about highlighting the bribes, the payments to people, than the long-term impacts of this tax on our economy. Nor are the government highlighting the fact that it will do nothing for the environment. So it does not work. It also stops work. The Nyrstar smelter in South Australia came out quite strongly against the carbon tax when it was announced, highlighting that it stood to cause some 1,500 people to lose jobs. They said: 


If our competitors in Asia do not have a price on carbon in exactly the same way then the proposed policy makes us non competitive. It is sufficient not only to make those businesses unviable, it will be the cause of the exit for our Australian operation.


As we have talked about this lack of competitiveness with other manufacturing industries, many people have emphasised things like, 'Well, we've got a strong dollar,' or, 'Demand is low at the moment.' Anyone who has spent any time in the business world knows that factors vary: demand does go up and down, and our currency goes up and down. Business will factor those things in; they will take a considered risk. But what the carbon tax does is put in a structural impediment to competitiveness. That is the tipping point. As companies look forward—and they are used to dealing with the other things that go up and down—they go, 'We've now got low demand and a high dollar and a structural thing that we cannot cope with into the future.' That is why people are now starting to baulk at investing in the future of their infrastructure in Australia. That is why some people are moving already and that is why many are concerned about the viability of their sectors. 


This government has made much of the global supply chain, particularly in the defence sector, and all the opportunities that are there for small to medium enterprises to link into global supply chains. What it does not mention is that each of those opportunities is a competition based opportunity and so our companies have to be able to compete with people overseas if they are to win that. This government has the lowest level of spending on defence after this budget since 1938, and that comes on top of a long period of deferring approvals, which means that small to medium enterprises are cash strapped because we are not seeing procurement activity occurring in Australia. On top of that, the government is now putting in a structural impediment to the competitiveness for these people to link into the very markets that the government is saying should ensure their future. Not only does it not work; it also stops other people working and it is a work of false testimony.


This is a tax that this Prime Minister said would not occur. 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' It is not just the Prime Minister. Every member sitting opposite and every member of the lower house went to that election, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Prime Minister and saying 'there will be no carbon tax'. When we look at the voting record, we see that every Labor and Greens member and senator voted for the carbon tax. In South Australia, when people are looking at the future of Nyrstar or other industries, they need to be asking questions of the member for Makin, Mr Zappia; the member for Kingston, Ms Rishworth; the member for Wakefield, Mr Champion; the member for Port Adelaide, Mr Butler; the member for Adelaide, Ms Ellis; or the member for Hindmarsh, Mr Georganas. They need to hold them to account, because they are the people who stood shoulder to shoulder with the Prime Minister and said, 'There will be no carbon tax. Trust us.' Yet they turned around and voted for a tax that UBS has shown does not work. It stops work and it is work based on false testimony, for which the Labor Party and the Greens should be held to account.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (17:28):  I would like to spend a few moments talking about what is happening out there in voter land. It is important to understand what people are saying out in the electorates. On Friday I was in Longman, talking to the parents of schoolchildren who are about to receive about $410 each under the schoolkids bonus, and out in Forde in the afternoon, talking to another lot of parents who were interested in what the government is doing with the carbon price household assistance. For example, out of the 54,000 taxpayers in Longman, 48,000 of them will receive assistance. At least 40,000 out of those 48,000 will receive a tax cut of at least $300. In the seat of Forde, out of 62,000 taxpayers, around 54,000 will receive a tax cut and, of those 54,000, 46,000 will receive a tax benefit of at least $300 as well. Let us cut to the chase; let us get to the hypocrisy surrounding this motion. We have just heard from Senator Fawcett. I am pleased that he raised the point of people baulking in investments. The hypocrisy of that statement is that there are people opposite and people in the other house who are investing in shares in the mining and resource industries. At least 30 per cent of those opposite are buying shares in those industries. Do not come into this chamber and cry, 'Doom and gloom! The earth is going to fall in! The ships are going to sail off the end of the world!' What a load of rot. What a disgrace you mob are.


Let us have a look at those opposite. Senator Gary Humphries, for a start, added a number of companies to his portfolio, including Matrix Composites and Engineering, which manufactures products for the offshore oil and gas and the iron ore industries. He also added Origin Energy. Let us look at Senator Sean Edwards, who in 2011 added Fortescue Metals Group to his interests and then, on 11 November 2011, added BHP Billiton and Newcrest Mining. However, in March this year he deleted Fortescue metals and BHP from his interests and in April deleted Newcrest Mining. There is the hypocrisy, Mr President. Those opposite come in here, saying, 'Doom and gloom: the earth is coming to end and jobs are going to be at risk,' yet they are investing so much in mining and resource sector shares. What a joke!


Let us have a look at what is happening in the House of Representatives. NineMSN reported that six coalition members of the House of Representatives purchased shares between 24 November 2011 and 21 March 2012. Out of that six, the member for Bennelong, John Alexander, bought shares in AGL; Paula Hunt, the wife of the member for Flinders, Greg Hunt, bought shares in Rio Tinto, Tiger Resources and Fortescue Metals Group; the member for Stirling, Michael Keenan, bought into Resource and Investment NL; the member for Flynn, Ken O'Dowd—a true blue Queenslander and National Party member—bought shares in Regis Resources and Hastings Fund Management Ltd; and the member for Fadden, Stuart Robert, invested in Evolution Mining and Oceanagold shares. Even Malcolm Turnbull—let us not forget the godfather of the opposition, who was so keen to introduce an ETS until he was stabbed in the back by Tony Abbott—has been making investments, in Veolia, Multiplex, Santos Finance and Renewable Energy Corporation.


As can be seen, it is clear; it is out there in the marketplace: people know what the legitimate circumstances are in this place. You lot over there are joke. You are hypocrites.




The PRESIDENT:
  Senator Furner, you need to withdraw that.




Senator FURNER:
  I withdraw that comment. The information speaks for itself. Those opposite cannot come into this chamber claiming that the world is going to end when there are people in the opposition actively investing in the mining and resource sectors. It is just not a fair go when people out there are being led to believe that the world is going to end. That is not the case. We will sustain— (Time expired)

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:01):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


Several years ago the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee conducted an inquiry into Australia's future oil supply and alternative transport fuels, with the following terms of reference:


1. projections of oil production and demand in Australia and globally and the implications for availability and pricing of transport fuels in Australia; 


2. potential of new sources of oil and alternative transport fuels to meet a significant share of Australia’s fuel demands, taking into account technological developments and environmental and economic costs; 


3. flow-on economic and social impacts in Australia from continuing rises in the price of transport fuel and potential reductions in oil supply; and 


4. options for reducing Australia’s transport fuel demands.


By any examination this was a very worthy inquiry. We spent a lot of time investigating all of those issues and we realised, cross-party, how very significant and important it was that the inquiry did investigate those issues. We put forward 10 recommendations in total. It was supported cross-party by the committee, and the committee appreciated the gravity of the issue and the serious nature of what we were inquiring into.


I rise today to make the point that, given we tabled this report in 2007, it has taken the Labor government nearly five years to respond. Admittedly, the coalition was still in government for the first few months after we tabled the report. But since that time the government has had these recommendations and it has done absolutely nothing to respond to the Senate committee and to the recom­mendations. For a government to take over four years to respond to recommendations from a Senate committee on an extremely important inquiry is completely unaccept­able. We are standing here today receiving a response from the government.


It is, quite frankly, shameful that this government could not respond in a timely manner to the recommendations that were put forward by the Senate committee. It is indicative—and I know my colleague Senator Back will agree—of the shambolic nature of this government. They simply cannot apply proper process to the running of the nation and the government. I know that Senator Back and the rest of my colleagues would be interested to know the reasons that this government took over four years to respond to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee's recommendations on this very important issue.


The responses—having waited over four years to receive them—are flimsy at best and contain no real detail or any kind of substantive response from the government. The committee has been sent 4½ pages, after over four years—we basically have a page a year. The responses are flimsy, not substan­tive and show that the government clearly has not treated this inquiry or its recom­mendations, or the committee itself, with the respect they deserve. The committee des­erves respect for the amount of work, cross-party work, that went into this inquiry. We find the length of time the government has taken to respond to be entirely unacceptable.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-06-18,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:05):  I have some comments to add to those of Senator Nash and I find myself in complete agreement. This inquiry was initiated by Senator Christine Milne. It took three referrals through this chamber before that important piece of work was actually accepted for an inquiry. Senators Milne and Siewert and the other members of the committee then spent a long period of time working on this important question.


This is an issue that I have since taken up, and I look forward to getting the government's response in detail. It goes very much to Australia's vulnerability as a country to supply shocks in transport fuels. When we get into the detail of this government response, what I suspect we will find—




Senator Nash:
  Is that there is no detail?




Senator LUDLAM:
  that's quite correct, Senator Nash—is that there will be no detail whatsoever, just as there has been no detail in successive budget estimates sessions when I and other senators have taken up the following issues. Who is in charge of looking after Australia's transport vulner­ability? Who is in charge of looking after where our oil is going to come from in an age of peak oil? The climate debate in this place, shambolic as it is, is at least occurring, and at least there is a cross-party acknow­ledgement—or there was until recently—that there is a serious public policy to address here.


On the issue of oil depletion, supply shocks, price shocks and peak oil, and what that actually means, there is virtually no debate whatsoever. There is no lead portfolio minister; there is no cross-portfolio response; there is no whole-of-government task force. With the noble exception of Queensland, which actually did some quite serious work on this a number of years ago—principally due to the work of one particular MP who took an interest in oil supply issues—the rest of the states are simply a policy vacuum. People are looking to the Commonwealth for leadership, and they are not getting it. Treasury has done no modelling. The infrastructure department and Infrastructure Australia will not show what models they use to model peak oil and oil depletion, or what future price models they incorporate into their models when they are choosing, for example, whether to build a new urban freeway or an urban freight line. There is simply no thinking going on at senior levels, apart from denial.


There is one very interesting report by BITRE, as it was known then, into oil depletion—the rather notorious report 117—which was deleted, which was never published, because it showed some spark of interest and recognition at a very senior level that in fact we will have severe supply constraints. The date that was nominated in that report was 2017. I suspect it may be sooner than that, but at least there was an acknowledgement that we need to transition into alternative sources of supply.

There is widespread policy blindness at the highest levels. Perhaps the minister has come in here to explain exactly why that is. Perhaps there are some extraordinary revelations in this response by the government to the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee report. Somehow, I doubt it. I support Senator Nash's comments and her question as to why it took such a long time for the government to respond on this issue and why it is that at senior levels of the government, state and federal, we can find no interest at all in the balance of payments wreckage that is going to occur—and, in fact, no serious questioning as to who our supplier nations are going to be when we become even more dependant on foreign sources of oil supply than we are now. Our communities are exquisitely vulnerable to oil price shocks, and this is about to become a very serious political problem. We in the Greens will continue to raise it. We will continue to work in cross-party fora like the Senate committee system to raise these issues, but the issues need urgent attention from the Australian government and from state and territory governments so that we are not dealing with this issue in retrospect. I thank the chamber and I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:01):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


Several years ago the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee conducted an inquiry into Australia's future oil supply and alternative transport fuels, with the following terms of reference:


1. projections of oil production and demand in Australia and globally and the implications for availability and pricing of transport fuels in Australia; 


2. potential of new sources of oil and alternative transport fuels to meet a significant share of Australia’s fuel demands, taking into account technological developments and environmental and economic costs; 


3. flow-on economic and social impacts in Australia from continuing rises in the price of transport fuel and potential reductions in oil supply; and 


4. options for reducing Australia’s transport fuel demands.


By any examination this was a very worthy inquiry. We spent a lot of time investigating all of those issues and we realised, cross-party, how very significant and important it was that the inquiry did investigate those issues. We put forward 10 recommendations in total. It was supported cross-party by the committee, and the committee appreciated the gravity of the issue and the serious nature of what we were inquiring into.


I rise today to make the point that, given we tabled this report in 2007, it has taken the Labor government nearly five years to respond. Admittedly, the coalition was still in government for the first few months after we tabled the report. But since that time the government has had these recommendations and it has done absolutely nothing to respond to the Senate committee and to the recom­mendations. For a government to take over four years to respond to recommendations from a Senate committee on an extremely important inquiry is completely unaccept­able. We are standing here today receiving a response from the government.


It is, quite frankly, shameful that this government could not respond in a timely manner to the recommendations that were put forward by the Senate committee. It is indicative—and I know my colleague Senator Back will agree—of the shambolic nature of this government. They simply cannot apply proper process to the running of the nation and the government. I know that Senator Back and the rest of my colleagues would be interested to know the reasons that this government took over four years to respond to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee's recommendations on this very important issue.


The responses—having waited over four years to receive them—are flimsy at best and contain no real detail or any kind of substantive response from the government. The committee has been sent 4½ pages, after over four years—we basically have a page a year. The responses are flimsy, not substan­tive and show that the government clearly has not treated this inquiry or its recom­mendations, or the committee itself, with the respect they deserve. The committee des­erves respect for the amount of work, cross-party work, that went into this inquiry. We find the length of time the government has taken to respond to be entirely unacceptable.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-06-18,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:05):  I have some comments to add to those of Senator Nash and I find myself in complete agreement. This inquiry was initiated by Senator Christine Milne. It took three referrals through this chamber before that important piece of work was actually accepted for an inquiry. Senators Milne and Siewert and the other members of the committee then spent a long period of time working on this important question.


This is an issue that I have since taken up, and I look forward to getting the government's response in detail. It goes very much to Australia's vulnerability as a country to supply shocks in transport fuels. When we get into the detail of this government response, what I suspect we will find—




Senator Nash:
  Is that there is no detail?




Senator LUDLAM:
  that's quite correct, Senator Nash—is that there will be no detail whatsoever, just as there has been no detail in successive budget estimates sessions when I and other senators have taken up the following issues. Who is in charge of looking after Australia's transport vulner­ability? Who is in charge of looking after where our oil is going to come from in an age of peak oil? The climate debate in this place, shambolic as it is, is at least occurring, and at least there is a cross-party acknow­ledgement—or there was until recently—that there is a serious public policy to address here.


On the issue of oil depletion, supply shocks, price shocks and peak oil, and what that actually means, there is virtually no debate whatsoever. There is no lead portfolio minister; there is no cross-portfolio response; there is no whole-of-government task force. With the noble exception of Queensland, which actually did some quite serious work on this a number of years ago—principally due to the work of one particular MP who took an interest in oil supply issues—the rest of the states are simply a policy vacuum. People are looking to the Commonwealth for leadership, and they are not getting it. Treasury has done no modelling. The infrastructure department and Infrastructure Australia will not show what models they use to model peak oil and oil depletion, or what future price models they incorporate into their models when they are choosing, for example, whether to build a new urban freeway or an urban freight line. There is simply no thinking going on at senior levels, apart from denial.


There is one very interesting report by BITRE, as it was known then, into oil depletion—the rather notorious report 117—which was deleted, which was never published, because it showed some spark of interest and recognition at a very senior level that in fact we will have severe supply constraints. The date that was nominated in that report was 2017. I suspect it may be sooner than that, but at least there was an acknowledgement that we need to transition into alternative sources of supply. That report was shredded. It was buried. We only know of its existence because it turned up on somebody's blog. The report 117 that was eventually published turned out to be on the bright future of aviation and how aviation was going to double over the next decade.


There is widespread policy blindness at the highest levels. Perhaps the minister has come in here to explain exactly why that is.

 (New South Wales) (18:13):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the report entitled Review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Islam, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi as terrorist organisations. 


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator FAULKNER:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I can inform the Senate that the current regulations were signed by the Governor-General on 8 March 2012. They were tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate on 13 March 2012. The disallowance period of 15 sitting days for the committee's review of the listing began from the date of the tabling. Therefore, the committee was required to report to the parliament by today. In fact, it was perhaps by earlier than today. When one starts to do the mathematics, it may well have been 29 May 2012. Nevertheless, I am speaking today. 


For the benefit of the Senate, I take this opportunity to outline some information very briefly on each of these organisations. I will also report to the Senate on the findings of the committee in relation to the four organisations. 


In relation to Ansar al-Islam, or AAI, as it is known, it plans and conducts attacks against foreign forces, Shiah, Kurdish and Iraqi government interests. AAI's attacks most commonly target US and Iraqi security forces in Iraq using improvised explosive devices, or IEDs as we know them in the Senate, and indirect fire attacks. 


The statement of reasons lists over 50 attacks for which AAI has indicated responsibility by posting a video or media statement in the period since the last review. Their methods have included assassinations, the use of small arms, thermal grenades and IED and mortar attacks against Iraqi police and military personnel and also against US military patrols bases and vehicles. 


The committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to Ansar al-Islam. 


The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, is a militant Islamic group based and operating in Central and South Asia. The group established relations with the Taliban and al-Qaeda and allegedly became extensively involved in narcotics trafficking. One of its founders, Namangani, was killed during the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and the remnants of the IMU fled across the border to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. Although its capabilities were severely degraded, the following years saw the IMU regroup in the south of Waziristan area of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where it established close links to a number of Pakistani Taliban groups and reportedly participated in cross-border attacks on the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. 


Notwithstanding increased pressure from ISAF and Pakistani security forces, reports throughout 2010 indicated that the IMU had re-established an operational presence in northern Afghanistan, and the group also claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in Tajikistan. The committee again does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to the IMU. 


In relation to Jaish-e-Mohammad, the statement of reasons indicates that that organisation is based in Pakistan and operates primarily in Indian Administered Kashmir. Jaish-e-Mohammad operatives have been involved in attacks against civilian and military targets in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. The organisation's attacks have included suicide bombings in 2001 and 2003, with most attacks since that time involving grenades and firearms. Jaish-e-Mohammad continues to concentrate its efforts against Indian security forces, both military and police, and also against government installations and civilians in the disputed territory of Indian Administered Kashmir. In addition, Jaish-e-Mohammad has broadened its operational focus to join the Afghan Taliban in attacks against government and coalition forces in Afghanistan. Again, the committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to Jaish-e-Mohammad. 


With Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre states that its activities have been curbed following the arrest of key leaders and the particular focus of the military and police authorities on the group, resulting in the arrest of hundreds of activists. Following the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in May of last year, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi vowed to conduct a series of retaliatory attacks. To this end, a spokesman for the organisation, identifying himself as Ali Sher Haidri, released a statement in mid-May 2011 threatening to avenge bin Laden's death by targeting not only government ministers and security force personnel but also Shia Muslims from the ethnic Hazara community in Pakistan. The Lashkar-e-Jhangvi followed through with these threats with a series of significant attacks in and around Quetta between May and July 2011. The statement of reasons lists 12 acts of terrorism attributed to or suspected of being perpetrated by the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. Again the committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.


I take, as we always do, the opportunity of speaking to these matters briefly to thank the chair, deputy chair and members of the committee for their work in reviewing these and other terrorist organisations. And as is traditionally the case, I thank the committee secretariat, the secretary of the committee and the staff of the committee, for their work. Finally, I commend this report to the Senate.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2012-06-18,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (19:31):  In many ways this bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Bill 2012, is technical legislation. The coalition will not be opposing it and indeed has agreed to expedite the passage of this legislation. It is similar to a bill that was introduced into the last parliament. 


This bill addresses a number of issues, including a number of court decisions, one of which was Daniel v the Health Insurance Commission and Others, a decision of the Federal Court of Australia, of 28 July 2003. That case looked at the conduct of the Director of the PSR and at various legislation involving the definition of 'inappropriate practice' and various other matters.


The legislation before us also seeks to implement certain recommendations of the review of the PSR Scheme, which are in the report of the steering committee of 2007. It also makes minor administrative changes to the scheme and, further to the bill that was presented in the last parliament, it introduces amendments in response to the decision of the full Federal Court in the case of Kutlu v Director of Professional Services Review, a decision of the full Federal Court of 28 July 2011. It looks at some technical matters there.


Senator Back is here and he will no doubt be speaking on this legislation as well. I commend the work of senators in the recent inquiry of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. I am sure Senator Back will be speaking to the additional comments made by coalition senators in relation to that inquiry. I will pick up on some of those comments. The coalition senators did want to acknowledge those of the medical profession who were sufficiently courageous to expose some of the limitations of the PSR process. It was certainly clear from the work done by coalition senators that the processes were deficient and led to unjust outcomes. In turn, one of the obvious consequences of that will be to discourage people from joining or remaining in a medical profession at a time when there are real shortages. 


As coalition senators stated, in relation to the genuine deep concerns of many in the medical profession, whether some of those concerns were exaggerated or were adequately expressed is a matter of judgment. The PSR is a peer review process and, as we know, it was established in the early 1990s. Importantly, it is charged with protecting the integrity of the Medicare system and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The scheme currently covers medical practitioners, dentists, optometrists, midwives, nurse practitioners, chiropractors, physiotherapists, podiatrists and osteopaths who use both the Medicare system and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is an important process, the intention of which is to protect the public from inappropriate practice by ensuring that Commonwealth funded services, which are delivered by practitioners, are medically necessary and clinically relevant. The intention is also to ensure that the public are protected from the consequences of inappropriate practice by ensuring that payments to claimants are made in accordance with the relevant Medicare regulations and the relevant regulations under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule, and most especially that the service that has been provided is adequate in the light of the associated requirements for which that payment may be claimed. The Medicare Participation Review Committee, or the MPRC, is the independent statutory body that decides whether or not practitioners who have engaged in the conduct retain the right to practise under Medicare as a consequence of that conduct. The Commonwealth currently spends nearly $18 billion on Medicare services and $10 billion on pharmaceutical benefits per annum. I place on record that the coalition does support processes which ensure the integrity of the expenditure and the appropriateness of the clinical services and does support having a process which ensures that integrity is maintained.


The explanatory memorandum states that the amendments proposed by this bill will not alter the PSR or the Medicare Participation Review Committee processes. Those amendments are intended to improve administration, to clarify issues that have been raised in recent court decisions that I made reference to and to address certain evidentiary matters. This was a point that was reiterated by the minister in her second reading speech. As I indicated earlier, the bill addresses the issues that were particularly raised by the full Federal Court in the decision in Kutlu v Director of Professional Services Review, where the court held that there was a technical problem with the appointment of PSR panel members. This bill will ensure that those appointments are treated as valid and effective and, accordingly, the coalition will not be opposing this bill.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-06-18,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:39):  As my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells quite correctly noted in her speech on this bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Bill 2012, professional services review was the subject of a Senate inquiry and I thank my colleagues, led by Senator Rachel Siewert, for the Senate allowing us to undertake an investigation. I am pleased to record that the legislation we are considering this evening picks up on many of the issues which were the subject of concern to the committee and which appear in the report and, to some extent, in the coalition senators' report.


It is an absolute undertaking that the expenditure of public moneys, on this occasion through the Medicare system and through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, should be the subject of the highest level of audit and probity and that, if there is an occasion when a member of the medical profession or kindred professions is in default under this scheme and has been in some way defrauding the taxpayers of Australia, they should be dealt with in the harshest possible way. However, the representations made to me and other Senate colleagues which led to the PSR review and inquiry being undertaken illustrated that there were deficiencies and that there clearly was unfairness occurring. I will reflect on those issues for a couple of moments.


The first point I would make relates particularly to doctors in rural and regional areas of Australia, where their workloads are often very high, where they often do not have the support of colleagues and where they are therefore placed in a position of having no option but to have high caseloads. It was of concern that too many instances were occurring in which doctors who appeared out on the right-hand end of the normal or bell curve—in other words, that end of the curve where there would appear to have been a high degree of client consultation and therefore overcharging—were being unfairly discriminated against or were being unfairly targeted. I have been assured, as a result of the inquiry we held and as a result of questions asked in Senate estimates only in the last month, that if that practice occurred in the past then it has certainly ceased. In fairness to the then director, he would argue that that had not been the case. But the evidence before the committee was that those who were very high in their caseloads, those who were perhaps in positions where they had no option but to see large numbers of patients, did appear to actually attract the attention of, firstly, the Medicare officers responsible in this area and, subsequently, the Director of Professional Services Review. That is an area that I believe this place needs to continue to examine to ensure that doctors who are legitimate as to the workloads they undertake—and therefore as to the incomes they generate under the Medicare system and subsequently under the PBS—have adequate opportunity to explain that situation before they find themselves either the subjects of allegation or indeed in default.


The second area I want to alert the Senate to is the process of panel membership—those who will judge doctors or allied health professionals in this area. It is absolutely essential that, firstly, they are competent to assess their peers on whom they are sitting in judgment. They would argue perhaps that they are not sitting in judgment and that they are only putting advice to the director, but it is one and the same to somebody who is the subject of such investigation. The panel members must be drawn from a wide group of professionals who, first of all, are actively practising—I would suggest actively practising full-time—and who can assess the doctors on the capacities for which they are before the panel.


I can recall an instance in which a doctor who was not a cardiac specialist and who had a very prolonged series of interviews with a patient in consideration of some psychological affairs became cognisant of the fact that this person appeared to have a cardiac condition. They immediately referred that person to a cardiologist, who in fact undertook treatment and was able to save the life of that person. The psychologist was then the subject of an adverse inquiry by the PSR because they had not undertaken an electrocardiogram of that patient. That is unconscionable and should never, ever have gone to a full assessment by a panel. In fact, in his evidence, that doctor produced documentation from the cardiologist supporting the argument that his excellence as a clinician probably saved the life of the patient. I know that is only one isolated case, but it did seem to keep coming up in our inquiry.


The points I would make are these. Panel members (a) have to be drawn from a wide background and (b) have to be themselves engaged in the profession actively—and, I would say, professionally—full time. If I could just advert back for one moment to those from rural and regional areas, I would plead that those panel members should at least, if not currently in rural and regional practice, have had experience themselves in rural and regional practice so that they understand the constraints and the pressures on their peers whom they might be judging.


Coming back to my support of Senator Fierravanti-Wells and the legislation: where there is corruption or fraud, it must obviously be rooted out. The other point I would make relates to specialties—an area that we identified in the inquiry. With the evolution of medicine, there are new specialties emerging. Once again, it comes back to panel membership.


I make this point in conclusion about the whole question of the past—and I believe it is picked up in the legislation—in which somebody who had been the subject of an adverse report could only appeal on the legalities of the mechanism of which they were the subject but they could not appeal based on the medical facts. As a person who has been a member of a somewhat kindred profession, I believe that is medically nonsense. It is incompetence. In fact, should there be a challenge, it should be possible for the person who has been the subject of an adverse report, with their solicitor and through their solicitor, to challenge not only the legality of the process which has led them to where they are but also the medical facts upon which decisions have been made.


In conclusion, I have to say to you that the current and newly appointed Director of the Professional Services Review is, I believe, a person of enormous integrity—not that I reflect on those of the past, but I do understand and know this person. I for one believe that we will see in his stewardship of this new legislation a complete change—hopefully very, very harsh on those who genuinely are in default but at the same time understanding of those whose case should be the subject of meritorious study before it goes on to the more harsh legal constraints.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2012-06-18,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (19:31):  In many ways this bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Bill 2012, is technical legislation. The coalition will not be opposing it and indeed has agreed to expedite the passage of this legislation. It is similar to a bill that was introduced into the last parliament. 


This bill addresses a number of issues, including a number of court decisions, one of which was Daniel v the Health Insurance Commission and Others, a decision of the Federal Court of Australia, of 28 July 2003. That case looked at the conduct of the Director of the PSR and at various legislation involving the definition of 'inappropriate practice' and various other matters.


The legislation before us also seeks to implement certain recommendations of the review of the PSR Scheme, which are in the report of the steering committee of 2007. It also makes minor administrative changes to the scheme and, further to the bill that was presented in the last parliament, it introduces amendments in response to the decision of the full Federal Court in the case of Kutlu v Director of Professional Services Review, a decision of the full Federal Court of 28 July 2011. It looks at some technical matters there.


Senator Back is here and he will no doubt be speaking on this legislation as well. I commend the work of senators in the recent inquiry of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. I am sure Senator Back will be speaking to the additional comments made by coalition senators in relation to that inquiry. I will pick up on some of those comments. The coalition senators did want to acknowledge those of the medical profession who were sufficiently courageous to expose some of the limitations of the PSR process. It was certainly clear from the work done by coalition senators that the processes were deficient and led to unjust outcomes. In turn, one of the obvious consequences of that will be to discourage people from joining or remaining in a medical profession at a time when there are real shortages. 


As coalition senators stated, in relation to the genuine deep concerns of many in the medical profession, whether some of those concerns were exaggerated or were adequately expressed is a matter of judgment. The PSR is a peer review process and, as we know, it was established in the early 1990s. Importantly, it is charged with protecting the integrity of the Medicare system and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The scheme currently covers medical practitioners, dentists, optometrists, midwives, nurse practitioners, chiropractors, physiotherapists, podiatrists and osteopaths who use both the Medicare system and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is an important process, the intention of which is to protect the public from inappropriate practice by ensuring that Commonwealth funded services, which are delivered by practitioners, are medically necessary and clinically relevant. The intention is also to ensure that the public are protected from the consequences of inappropriate practice by ensuring that payments to claimants are made in accordance with the relevant Medicare regulations and the relevant regulations under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule, and most especially that the service that has been provided is adequate in the light of the associated requirements for which that payment may be claimed. The Medicare Participation Review Committee, or the MPRC, is the independent statutory body that decides whether or not practitioners who have engaged in the conduct retain the right to practise under Medicare as a consequence of that conduct. The Commonwealth currently spends nearly $18 billion on Medicare services and $10 billion on pharmaceutical benefits per annum. I place on record that the coalition does support processes which ensure the integrity of the expenditure and the appropriateness of the clinical services and does support having a process which ensures that integrity is maintained.


The explanatory memorandum states that the amendments proposed by this bill will not alter the PSR or the Medicare Participation Review Committee processes. Those amendments are intended to improve administration, to clarify issues that have been raised in recent court decisions that I made reference to and to address certain evidentiary matters. This was a point that was reiterated by the minister in her second reading speech. As I indicated earlier, the bill addresses the issues that were particularly raised by the full Federal Court in the decision in Kutlu v Director of Professional Services Review, where the court held that there was a technical problem with the appointment of PSR panel members. This bill will ensure that those appointments are treated as valid and effective and, accordingly, the coalition will not be opposing this bill.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-06-18,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:39):  As my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells quite correctly noted in her speech on this bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Bill 2012, professional services review was the subject of a Senate inquiry and I thank my colleagues, led by Senator Rachel Siewert, for the Senate allowing us to undertake an investigation. I am pleased to record that the legislation we are considering this evening picks up on many of the issues which were the subject of concern to the committee and which appear in the report and, to some extent, in the coalition senators' report.


It is an absolute undertaking that the expenditure of public moneys, on this occasion through the Medicare system and through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, should be the subject of the highest level of audit and probity and that, if there is an occasion when a member of the medical profession or kindred professions is in default under this scheme and has been in some way defrauding the taxpayers of Australia, they should be dealt with in the harshest possible way. However, the representations made to me and other Senate colleagues which led to the PSR review and inquiry being undertaken illustrated that there were deficiencies and that there clearly was unfairness occurring. I will reflect on those issues for a couple of moments.


The first point I would make relates particularly to doctors in rural and regional areas of Australia, where their workloads are often very high, where they often do not have the support of colleagues and where they are therefore placed in a position of having no option but to have high caseloads. It was of concern that too many instances were occurring in which doctors who appeared out on the right-hand end of the normal or bell curve—in other words, that end of the curve where there would appear to have been a high degree of client consultation and therefore overcharging—were being unfairly discriminated against or were being unfairly targeted. I have been assured, as a result of the inquiry we held and as a result of questions asked in Senate estimates only in the last month, that if that practice occurred in the past then it has certainly ceased. In fairness to the then director, he would argue that that had not been the case. But the evidence before the committee was that those who were very high in their caseloads, those who were perhaps in positions where they had no option but to see large numbers of patients, did appear to actually attract the attention of, firstly, the Medicare officers responsible in this area and, subsequently, the Director of Professional Services Review. That is an area that I believe this place needs to continue to examine to ensure that doctors who are legitimate as to the workloads they undertake—and therefore as to the incomes they generate under the Medicare system and subsequently under the PBS—have adequate opportunity to explain that situation before they find themselves either the subjects of allegation or indeed in default.


The second area I want to alert the Senate to is the process of panel membership—those who will judge doctors or allied health professionals in this area. It is absolutely essential that, firstly, they are competent to assess their peers on whom they are sitting in judgment. They would argue perhaps that they are not sitting in judgment and that they are only putting advice to the director, but it is one and the same to somebody who is the subject of such investigation. The panel members must be drawn from a wide group of professionals who, first of all, are actively practising—I would suggest actively practising full-time—and who can assess the doctors on the capacities for which they are before the panel.


I can recall an instance in which a doctor who was not a cardiac specialist and who had a very prolonged series of interviews with a patient in consideration of some psychological affairs became cognisant of the fact that this person appeared to have a cardiac condition. They immediately referred that person to a cardiologist, who in fact undertook treatment and was able to save the life of that person. The psychologist was then the subject of an adverse inquiry by the PSR because they had not undertaken an electrocardiogram of that patient.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (21:49):  Let me share a few facts with you about cancer. One in two Australians will be diagnosed with cancer by the age of 85. Cancer is the leading cause of death in Australia. More than 43,000 people were estimated to have died from cancer in 2010. Nearly 15,000 more people die each year from cancer than 30 years ago, and this is due mainly to population growth and ageing.


While these statistics are sobering, there is also a great deal of positive news about cancer in Australia. For example, while the overall number of deaths from cancer has increased, the death rate—measured in numbers of deaths per 100,000 people—has actually fallen by 16 per cent. More than 60 per cent of cancer patients will survive more than five years after diagnosis, and for many common cancers the survival rate has increased by 30 per cent over the last two decades.


For much of the good news we have the Cancer Council of Australia to thank. As Australia's peak national non-government cancer organisation, the Cancer Council of Australia advises the Australian government and other bodies on practices and policies to help prevent, detect and treat cancer. The Cancer Council also advocates for the rights of cancer patients to get the best treatment and supportive care.


I know about the fear and uncertainty that comes from being told that you have been diagnosed with cancer. I know what it is like to hear that dreaded word 'cancer' and I am testament to the fact that cancer is not necessarily a death sentence. I know, as I said earlier, survival rates for cancer continue to improve over time. I was fortunate that when I was diagnosed I was treated early and able to make a full recovery.


My personal experience with cancer has been a powerful motivator for me to join the fight against this disease.  Among other things, I am now a regular participant in the Cancer Council's major fundraiser, Relay for Life. Relay for Life involves teams of participants walking or jogging around a track for about 20 hours. The event is held overnight, and each team has a baton which they are encouraged to keep moving for the whole event. This means that team members must work in shifts to make sure their baton stays on the track throughout the night and the early hours of the morning. The reason for the overnight effort is to promote understanding that, for many people suffering from cancer, there is little respite from the disease.


In the lead-up to the event, team members seek sponsorship for their efforts or the teams hold fundraising events such as barbecues or quiz nights. Relay for Life is held at various locations around Australia, and only last year—2011—started being held at the PCYC oval in Huonville in Southern Tasmania. I entered a team, Catryna's Crusaders, in the Huon Valley event last year, and it was a pleasure to do so again this year. In our first year my team managed to raise $1,700 for the Cancer Council. We have improved on that fundraising in 2012 and have raised $2,500.


One of the things I like most about Relay for Life is the atmosphere of the event and the way everyone is working towards the one goal. There is a stage with music performances, a tug of war, a three-legged race competition and a series of ceremonies, including the opening and closing ceremonies, the luminary ceremony and the survivors' lap. The luminary ceremony is particularly moving. Late in the evening, the teams stop walking and running around the track for a short while. Candles are lit and placed around the edge of the track in memory of family and loved ones who have died of cancer. A minute's silence is observed, and helium balloons with lights inside them are released into the night sky. It is quite an emotional experience watching those balloons fly off into the darkness. The organisers encourage participants to really get into the spirit of the event and offer prizes for the best team site, the best baton and the most laps. There are also prizes for the highest team and individual fundraising totals.


For those who have not yet participated in Relay for Life, it is important to understand that it is not just a fundraiser. Relay for Life symbolises the fight against cancer. It recognises and celebrates survivors as well as the lives of sufferers who have lost the battle. It is a great family and community event. I participate in Relay for Life for all these reasons and more.


I would like to thank the members of my team, who worked together tirelessly to keep our baton going through the early hours of the morning. They include my husband, Robert; Dan; Scott; Colleen; Anna; Jackson; Laura; Octavia; Jeffrey; and the youngest member of my team, Caleb, who recently celebrated his ninth birthday. As well as participating for the weekend they also did an excellent job supporting the fundraising effort. I would also like to thank the organising committee for the Huon Valley Relay, and also the Lions Club of Huon and the Huon Valley branch of Rural Youth for their support of the event.


I also wish to thank sincerely the many people who sponsored Catryna's Crusaders. Among the sponsors of my team were several of my parliamentary colleagues, including, in this place, Senator Carol Brown, Senator Furner, Senator McEwen, Senator Singh, Senator Moore and Senator Faulkner. I also have some sponsors in the other place, including the member for Franklin, Julie Collins; the member for McEwen, Rob Mitchell; the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd; the Member for Deakin, Mark Symon; and the member for Fraser, Andrew Leigh. I would also like to acknowledge a donation from my state colleague and Premier of Tasmania, Lara Giddings. All of these donations, and the others, have contributed to a team total of $2,500 for Catryna's Crusaders.


While the number of teams in the Huon Valley event was down on the previous year, from 16 to 12, there were still over 300 participants. This year and last year the Huon Valley event raised around $60,000. This is quite significant. Australia wide, Relay for Life each year raises roughly $1 for every Australian. However, my home state of Tasmania punches above its weight—yet  again—and each year raises nearly $1 million, or almost $2 for every Tasmanian. The Huon Valley's fundraising effort equates roughly to $4 for each resident of the Huon Valley. It just goes to show what an incredible commitment this small but dedicated community has to fighting cancer, and I am very proud to be part of that effort.


While I understand that the Huon Valley Relay for Life may be taking a break in 2013, I will be ready to participate whenever they have their next event. However, I do look forward to the day when my team and Relay for Life as a whole are unnecessary. That will be the day when advances in medical technology have delivered us a world that is free of cancer. The steps that we take in Relay for Life symbolise the steps towards that vision. Every dollar we raise brings us closer to achieving it. I am confident that the goal of a cancer-free world can be achieved within my lifetime, and I encourage all senators in this place to join me on this journey.


While Relay for Life comes around once a year, the Cancer Council has a variety of other fundraisers, including Australia's Biggest Morning Tea. Australia's Biggest Morning Tea has been held every year since 1994 and in that time has raised over $70 million. On 6 June this year I held a morning tea in my office in Kingston as part of this national fundraiser, and I had about 20 local guests attend. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my staff for their work in helping to organise the morning tea, and I would also like to acknowledge the generous support of two local businesses south of Hobart in Tasmania, and they are Snuggle Down and Flynn's Café, who both donated prizes. The morning tea in my office raised another $260 to support the Cancer Council and their fantastic work.


I would like to conclude this contribution by taking the opportunity to pay my respects to the late Senator Judith Adams. Ironically, Senator Adams lost her battle with cancer on the same weekend that I was participating in Relay for Life. Perhaps senators would like to reflect on this when their local Relay for Life events, or other Cancer Council fundraisers, come up. In memory of Senator Adams, and everyone else who has lost their battle with cancer, I encourage you all to make a donation to the Cancer Council, to join or start up a team in your local Relay next year or to host a morning tea. I believe that together we can help make cancer a thing of the past.
