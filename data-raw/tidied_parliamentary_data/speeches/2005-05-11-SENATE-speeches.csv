"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-05-11,"—On behalf of the Labor opposition, I would like to support the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill on the death of Al Grassby, former member of the House of Representatives and Labor Minister for Immigration. It is unfortunate that Australian television stations did not move into colour until 1975, the year after Al Grassby left parliament. Our TV images of Australia before that time are generally black and white, and black and white would never do justice to Al Grassby. In the time since his death, he has been almost universally described as colourful. I ran into him at an airport only a few months ago and he had not changed over the years. His choice of tie was still even more outrageous than that of former senator Jim McKiernan, and that is a big claim. We attribute many meanings to the word ‘colourful’ these days, and I think most of them have been applied to Al in the various reports and obituaries that have followed his death.
Al Grassby entered parliament in 1969 as the member for Riverina. He became a minister upon the election of the Whitlam government in 1972 and lost his seat in 1974. In that short time, however, Al Grassby became the face of multiculturalism. He was also emblematic of a broader social change that had found widespread expression in the 1960s but that did not overtake the musty halls of Old Parliament House until the Whitlam ministry took office in 1972. He was part of a government of ideas and action which implemented a raft of changes across policy areas. Postwar Australia, with its focus on reconstruction and recovery from the trauma of depression and war, had been dominated by 23 years of uninterrupted conservative rule.
The politics of the fifties and sixties emphasised the middle-class ideal—that is, high levels of employment, traditional families and a house in the suburbs. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, cracks had begun to appear in this model of Australian life and had become more and more distinct. Responses to Australia’s involvement in the Vietnam War caused widespread friction. The women’s movement and other programs of social change were gathering pace and the economies of developed nations were floundering. In that environment, the 1972 Labor campaign theme ‘It’s Time’ had a powerful resonance. The Whitlam government was elected to implement its progressive platform. Al Grassby was a prominent figure in that fresh new government and, in some ways, he symbolised the Australia that had emerged from the upheavals of the late 1960s. Reading about him, you get the sense of his friction with the Australian Anglo-Saxon establishment. He was a colourful, cosmopolitan character, and he certainly left a much stronger impression on me as a young man than most of the ministers of the time did.
Born in 1926, he had an incredibly worldly childhood and early life. His family moved to Sydney, where his father worked on the Harbour Bridge. During the Depression, the family moved around the world to Sudan, Italy, France, Spain and England. Talking to Robert Drewe in the Bulletin in 1981, Al Grassby described this phase of his life:
In my first 15 years I went to 13 different schools in six countries and we never lived anywhere longer than two years. First the Depression, then the war, the constant moving from place to place, learning new languages and attitudes all the time ...
It was an ideal upbringing, perhaps, for the man who would lead the Whitlam government’s immigration and multicultural reforms.
During the Second World War, Grassby served in the infantry in an intelligence unit of the British army. He later attended the University of South West England and trained as a journalist before returning to Australia in 1948. Despite his Australian parentage and birth, Grassby had to be sponsored as a migrant in order to return to Australia. These were the days before the birth of an Australian passport, a travel document that Grassby himself would introduce in 1973. Back home again, Grassby fell in love with rural Australia. He settled in Griffith and was employed at the New South Wales department of agriculture and the CSIRO and made his career in agriculture and communications.
In 1965 he entered the New South Wales parliament as the Labor member for Murrumbidgee. In 1969 he entered the federal parliament as member for Riverina on a massive 22 per cent swing. In the three years to 1972, he became one of the opposition’s most high-profile members. Former Hawke government minister Barry Cohen, who also entered parliament in 1969, shared an office with Grassby. Recently, in the Australian, Barry Cohen recalled Grassby’s personal working style:
When he was in the office there was an endless parade of visitors, from Catholic priests to indigent farmers replete with copious quantities of wine they always spilled on my desk. Sans company, Al would bash away on his ancient typewriter while screaming into his phone in Spanish, Italian or, occasionally, English.
On the election of the Whitlam government, Grassby was a likely candidate for the primary industries portfolio. However, it was felt that he might not be the ideal candidate to negotiate with the rural community and Whitlam instead gave him the immigration portfolio.
In his two years as a federal minister Grassby oversaw a radical shake-up of Australia’s immigration system, doing away with the last vestiges of the White Australia Policy. As such he not only made Australia a more attractive destination for migrants but also ensured that migrants who came here were more likely to remain. He introduced non-discriminatory practices in migration and citizenship policy. He changed the system whereby migrants from outside the UK were subjected to harsher tests than their British counterparts. Similarly, he introduced the Australian Citizenship Bill into parliament in 1973. This legislation set out uniform laws for migrants seeking citizenship; previously, there had been different rules for citizenship depending on ethnic background. Grassby made it easier for overseas students to remain in Australia after their studies if they were able to find work and he made it easier for parents of Australian born children to remain here.
In his time as minister, Grassby set out broad parameters for a new approach to racial discrimination in this country. He banned racially selected sports teams from playing in Australia and he made it possible for Indigenous people to leave the country without having to seek special permission. Grassby’s policies were influenced by a progressive idea of what it meant to be Australian. During his short time in office, he laid out a vision of Australia as a thriving multi-ethnic and multicultural society. I think that much of what we see in contemporary Australian society is testament to the timeliness of his vision.
Grassby’s role as standard-bearer for a multicultural Australia, his high media profile and his distinctive style made him a target for conservative forces in the 1974 election. That year he lost the seat he had originally won in 1969. But after federal parliament Grassby continued in public life. He was Commissioner for Community Relations until 1982. At other times he served as a community relations advisor to New South Wales Premier Barrie Unsworth and as a chairman of the National Consultative Committee on Peace and Disarmament.
In later years Al Grassby was at times surrounded by controversy. That controversy has obviously again been highlighted following his death. I do not intend to comment on those matters. But, however history eventually remembers him, it will be in large part for the contribution he made to Australian government and society in the early 1970s. He certainly made his mark. He was an integral member of a government which radically changed this country, a government which embraced a more complex and diverse story of who we are and what this country is about. Through his outlook, the policies he implemented and his own inimitable style, he will be remembered for his service to the parliament and for the multicultural society we enjoy today. I think there are very few people who have served the parliament and been a minister for only two years who are as well known or as recognisable in Australian society as Al Grassby. To his family and friends and all those who were close to him, on behalf of the opposition I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Albert (Al) Jaime Grassby AM</title>,CONDOLENCES,2,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-05-11,"—I would like to support the condolence motion for Al Grassby on behalf of the Democrats as well as on a personal level. I did not realise until I was at his funeral in Canberra a week or two ago that he was actually born in Brisbane, in New Farm, just down the road from my office. But he did not stay there long; he moved around to many parts of Australia. During the war years, as a very young man, he was in the UK. He then came back to Australia, to the areas of New South Wales whose people he subsequently represented in both the state parliament and the federal parliament.
As was apparent in the contribution I made to the condolence motion yesterday, I think that in motions like this it is preferable to be honest about people’s failings and not be gratuitous. When you are reviewing people’s lives, if you get too focused on the positives in a glowing way it can be excessive, to the point where it almost becomes dishonest, so it is important to acknowledge the failings and limitations in Al Grassby’s approach. Obviously, there was controversy and there were allegations about his alleged links to and support for criminal figures. I honestly do not know enough about those to pass judgment on how true or otherwise they were, beyond noting a comment that I saw yesterday about how blown out of proportion some of those things can become in smaller communities with antagonisms at the local level. I would also comment that, whilst it is appropriate to have public debate about any actions or failings in those areas, I fail to see why it is of any relevance at all to go blowing people’s private lives all over the front pages of newspapers as soon as they die. I cannot see any public interest or merit in that type of thing.
It is also important to acknowledge in motions like this the totality of people’s legacy. Those aspects of Al Grassby I have mentioned will be part of that and people can debate those—those who know more about them than I do. But I am qualified to talk about the aspects of Al Grassby that I am aware of. He is somebody that I met a number of times in the later part of his life, from the earlier parts of my parliamentary career right through to quite recently, because I have been involved reasonably heavily in immigration and multiculturalism issues on behalf of the Democrats and out of personal interest.
I came across Al Grassby in many different forums, and there is no doubt that his commitment to multiculturalism and to the principles of opposing racism and discrimination were as passionate as ever right throughout his life and that he did have a very positive, direct impact on people’s lives. I have had direct feedback from people since Al Grassby’s death with regard to comments I have made about his impact. They have specifically spoken about the positive impact that he as an individual had on their lives and those of their families, particularly people who came here as migrants and who felt for the first time that Australia was welcoming them, even though they had already lived here for 10 years. That is not to say that they felt Australians were all nasty, racist and horrible; it was more that it was the first time they had been given a strong, unambiguous, positive message about the value of their own heritage and what that brought to Australia—rather than just coming here and leaving all that behind them, fitting in and eating their sausage rolls and meat pies.
It is that value adding that I believe is the biggest asset of multiculturalism, and it is what Al Grassby brought to Australia and to the lives of many individual people and families. It is that value adding, through his continual promotion of and support for multiculturalism, that will be his biggest legacy.
It is important to emphasise how much direct personal benefit can be derived when people in leadership positions, in government or in other positions in the community, send clear, unequivocal signals about key issues. In that respect, his support for and promotion of multiculturalism and his strong opposition to racial discrimination were a major, positive benefit for many people who felt subjected to racism or who felt vulnerable to discrimination in various ways. It is important not to underestimate how significant a benefit can be derived when people feel supported positively, proactively and unequivocally by people in key leadership positions regarding some of those fundamental issues. Rather than ignoring them, leaving them to one side or seeing them as not being important, or saying, ‘We don’t want to talk about it because we don’t want to make people think that Australians are racists,’ I think it is quite possible to strongly promote the importance of opposing racial discrimination without in any way implying that there is some major level of racism in the Australian community, because you are supporting a principle that needs to be positively espoused; you are not just trying to oppose something that is already there.
The same principle applies to multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is a concept that has been a matter of some political controversy—not so much now, thankfully, but it was the case five to 10 years ago, and in part because it was misunderstood or misinterpreted. This is not the time to have a long debate about multiculturalism per se; however, I point out that Al Grassby played a key role—although he was not the only one—in the crystallisation of the concept of multiculturalism and its active promotion, and has left behind an enormous legacy. As Senator Evans said, it is very impressive that someone who was immigration minister for only about 18 months has left such a mark. He reinforced his activities in that role with his activities in subsequent roles, both in government appointments and at the community level.
I reinforce the point that most of my contact with him took place 25 years after he left the parliament, when he continued to strongly, tirelessly and enthusiastically promote those principles. Some of this occurred at a time when those principles were under severe attack, at the peak of the Hanson hysteria, when it was important to have people strongly and unequivocally supporting the value of multiculturalism and what that meant for the inherent value of people. The negative element of the Hanson debates related to how it made people feel. It made many Australians feel worse—it made them feel more vulnerable, less welcome and less positive about their country. Feeling positive about our country is not something to which you can necessarily attribute a dollar and cents value, but it is undoubtedly a massive positive net contributor to our quality of life and to what makes our country fantastic.
If one were to put a dollars and cents value on it, I note that it does help our economic situation as well, particularly in a globalised economy, where we are interacting with people from so many different cultures, ethnicities and religions. For our nation to be so successful in comparison to most others in working as part of a group of people from such a diverse range of backgrounds, and to do that, on the whole, very harmoniously, is a massive advantage for us as we engage with other countries. Al Grassby can take credit for making some of that a reality, and I believe that is a core part of his legacy.
I am not a total expert on everything he put forward in his time as a minister, but I have had cause to look at it to a certain extent during my day-to-day tasks of looking at immigration issues. I note that some of his policy prescriptions and legislative proposals were not workable, but that in itself shows that you can still have a positive impact with your overall message, with the principles that you espouse, and it shows that, even if your policy mechanisms might not always work, that should not cause you to throw out the principles and ideals in their entirety. I do not know whether any of the legislative aspects from his time as minister remain, but certainly the philosophy and ideals from his time as minister not only remain but also are ingrained in Australia’s culture, as well as in our polity to a fair degree. That is an amazing tribute to him.
I was not aware, until I looked at various issues after his death, of his involvement in removing from the law the requirement that Aboriginal Australians had to get permission to leave the country. I do not think it was being enforced anymore at that time, but it was extraordinary to still have it on the statutes. That has been removed, and it represents an important symbolic act. I am sure that that will never be reintroduced. There are bound to be other measures—as everyone here knows, there are many things that we pass and which become law which have a significant impact but which do not get recognised because they meld with the overall fabric of the legal framework. But the changes are made at the time for good reason, and that means they will continue into the future, even though we might forget who was responsible for them.
So, whilst not trying to whitewash some of the controversies that surrounded aspects of Al Grassby’s life, from my point of view, from my contact with him, I found him to be a person who continued to be an inspiration for many people. In a very cynical society, when people feel disconnected from the political process, we need as many inspirational figures as we can get. I know he provided such inspiration to many people, as was shown by the turnout at his funeral here in Canberra.
He was of course, in his later years, an active member of the community here in Canberra. I am sure subsequent speakers will speak on him from that perspective. I speak in terms of his overall long-term legacy and what it meant for Australia and the lives of individual people. Again, the thing that has struck me even in the short period since his death is the number of times I have seen comments on web sites and have received comments from people that Al Grassby, more than anyone else, was the one that made them feel good about being Australian, that made them feel properly welcome for the first time and that made them feel they had made the right choice in coming to Australia. That is an immensely valuable legacy to leave in economic terms—if you want to reduce things to that level—and obviously in human and social terms, and for the future of our nation. That is a pretty good legacy to leave and I think his family should be justly proud. It was quite clear from his funeral that he was widely loved by many people and that his immediate family loved him enormously. I pass on my condolences to them. It was also clear from the eulogies at the funeral that his family were a key part of the work that Al Grassby did, and to that end they should also bear some of the credit for the legacy he leaves.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Albert (Al) Jaime Grassby AM</title>,CONDOLENCES,2,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-05-11,"—I do not believe I can let Al Grassby’s passing go by without making a brief contribution to this debate. I got to know Al Grassby fairly well in recent years. He was, for most of the last 16 years or so, a constituent of mine. In fact, he became a constituent of mine 16 years ago today. I also got to know his wife reasonably well. Ellnor Grassby served in the ACT Legislative Assembly with me for something like six years, and I got to know Al reasonably well through that avenue as well. He certainly remained, until the very end, a figure for whom there was great affection, even reverence, among many in the ACT community, certainly among the members of ethnic communities in the ACT. That is not surprising, because he remained a person with great affection for Canberra, and the ACT remains one of the most multicultural communities in Australia. I think we still have the highest number of people from a non-English-speaking background of any jurisdiction in Australia. The various communities in Canberra are very active and Al Grassby was certainly familiar to all of those communities. He moved among them and was well regarded by all of them, without exception.
Others in the debate today, particularly Senator Evans, have described Al Grassby’s career as a journalist, as immigration minister and as the first Australian Commissioner for Community Relations. I do not particularly want to touch on those areas. I want to make a short contribution on Al Grassby’s legacy to Australian multiculturalism, which is an extremely significant part of what he leaves all of us. It is true to say that Al Grassby did not, as is sometimes suggested, abolish the White Australia Policy. That was the legacy of Harold Holt. He did, however, promote what I think was the real corollary of the abolition of the White Australia Policy, and that was the policy of promoting multiracialism in Australia, which in turn became multiculturalism. That is a policy which has had a profound impact on Australian public and private life. Multiculturalism acknowledges the various strands that are made up by the cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds of people from different parts of the world who come to live in this country and who enrich and strengthen the fabric of Australian society. Those strands add vibrancy and colour to the Australian experience and have greatly changed, and changed for the better, Australian society in the last 50 or 60 years, particularly since the great waves of immigration following the Second World War. They have changed Australian society very much even in the last 30 or so years since Al Grassby was a public figure. There is now a much greater awareness of the nature of the world.
The Australia of 30 or 40 years ago was a very Anglocentric community. We can see that from the way people talked, the fact that very few Australians who were not born overseas spoke foreign languages and the fact that we ate very English food. We had very little awareness of the cultures, traditions and histories of countries other than Australia and perhaps the United States via television. That has changed enormously in the last few decades and that transition to an outward looking society, to a cosmopolitan society, has been the product of a number of factors and forces. But if any one person could be said to have played a significant role in that transition, more than anybody else it would have to be Al Grassby. His personality naturally led to an eclecticism on his part towards different cultural experiences, and the enthusiastic approach he took towards what was going on in Australian society was quite infectious. It did not take long of hearing him talk about how what he called polyethnicism or polyethnicity contributed to Australian society before one also took up that point of view. Many people have had their eyes opened to the potential and the strength of multiculturalism by virtue of that process. Politicians especially fall into that category. I dare say there is no member of this chamber who does not engage regularly with constituents who come to them as members of particular ethnic groups.
That experience was not happening in Australia 30 or 40 years ago. People were expected to blend in; they were expected to be Australians and forget about being Poles, Vietnamese, Lithuanians or Chileans. Their identity was, in many ways, submerged into the broader Australian culture. The fact that people could be proud of their ethnic origins, backgrounds, and cultural and religious traditions was a feature which very much went with multiculturalism. Al Grassby did not invent multiculturalism, but he took it into the mainstream of Australian public policy. He gave it a voice which has not, since then, grown quiet. On the subject of his contribution to multiculturalism, an article written by Mungo McCallum states:
Grassby was not responsible for the policy itself, which had, in a sense, been introduced by stealth—a stealth which some older Australians still resented. But he was its greatest propagandist and proselytiser, and by and large he was successful.
Indeed that is true. He was a controversial figure, and not all aspects of his legacy are as easy to defend as his contribution to multiculturalism. Despite the fact that his period as a minister in the Australian government was exceptionally short, he unquestionably—through that role and through other contributions to Australian public life—changed Australian public life profoundly and forever. In looking at his life and his contribution, I think we can say that, if any of us were able to leave this place saying that we had made a contribution, a policy or a way of thinking which was to outlast our departure from this place, we would have done well. Unquestionably, Al Grassby achieved that distinction. He was a person whom you looked at and spoke to, and you knew where he stood. You knew what he believed in. In everything he said and did, he imparted a sense of where he was coming from. We would all do well to be as recognisable on the political radar as Al Grassby.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Albert (Al) Jaime Grassby AM</title>,CONDOLENCES,2,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-05-11,"—It is with sadness that I, too, offer my condolences to the family and friends of Al Grassby. I was afforded the honour of speaking at Al’s funeral, at the request of his wife, Ellnor, and daughter, Gabriella. Today’s condolence motion provides an opportunity to convey at least some of my thoughts and memories of Al.
The funeral was held in St Christopher’s here in Canberra on 29 April 2005. Father Tony Frey conducted the service and it was, predictably, a very full church. Reflecting on Al’s life was an experience in itself, and there were many kind thoughts, hilarious anecdotes and moving tributes written in the week following his death. These, combined with first-hand insights into Al and Ellnor’s amazing life, provided plenty of inspiration.
Al was born in Brisbane in 1926. His paternal grandfather was a fisherman from Spain, and his father and Irish mother spent many years travelling abroad when Al was young. Their travels took in Sydney and Newcastle here in Australia, and Sudan, Italy, France, Spain and Chile. But it was England where Al grew up, studying at the University of South-West England. Economic necessity after the death of his father in a London air raid in World War II led Al to support his mother, Margaret, by enlisting as a private in the British army. I am advised that his military career was short-lived and he later worked as a cadet journalist. He had been asked to join the Labour Party in the UK and to stand for a seat in the south, but he advised them that he was returning to the land of his birth.
It was on returning to Australia in 1948 that he found that his home was not the land he thought it was and, with a dream of changing Australia for the better, he joined the Australian Labor Party at age 21. After a brief stint at the Hobart Mercury, Al moved to Griffith in New South Wales. His later insights into the lives of migrants were, in part, a product of his experiences of this time, including his work as an agricultural adviser with the CSIRO. This job brought him into contact with many Italian farmers in south-west New South Wales. In 1962, Al married Ellnor—the love of his life—and beloved daughter Gabriella was born precisely 10 months later. After becoming active in the local ALP, Al was elected the state member for Murrumbidgee in 1965. He was appointed the shadow minister for agriculture and conservation in 1968. Never shy of a stunt, he brought into the parliament a box of oranges to complain about the impact of fruit imports on his constituents. Much to the Speaker’s surprise, he put them on the table and asked, at question time, what the government was going to do to solve this problem. Labor member Kevin Stewart, a close mate of Al’s and a sharp wit, called out, ‘Mr Speaker, I hope the honourable member does not have pigs in his electorate!’
Back in the electorate, not only Ellnor but her family were in active service supporting Al’s obsessive work. Ellnor’s brother, George, with his pilot’s licence, flew the newly-elected federal member around his electorate, and Al would invariably insist that they visit just one more farm before dark. Later, once Al had firmly established himself as an effective and very vocal local member, he was approached to consider running for the federal seat of Riverina. In Gough Whitlam, Al saw a strong leader with a vision for a more socially just Australia. He was encouraged to make the change, and he won the seat in 1969 with a 26½ per cent swing—the biggest in the country. This ushered in another intense period for the Grassbys. The workload was heavy and Al was tireless. Even a very young Gabriella could be found on election day handing out how-to-votes—an important task, as Labor Party members know only too well. Gabriella would ask people as they came along, ‘Will you vote for my daddy?’
In 1972, Al became Minister for Immigration but, as might be expected, he took a wider rather than a narrower interpretation of his portfolio interests. As befitted a revolutionary, Al had been a big supporter of Eureka and had always wanted it celebrated in a grand way. Three days into government, Al had the bold idea to take a platoon of troops to Ballarat for the big day. He walked into Lance Barnard’s office, who was then the minister for the Army. Al asked Lance for a platoon of troops to take to Ballarat. Lance looked at Al with horror and said, ‘Good God, Al, we have been in government for only three days and we are already under attack!’ Nonetheless, he was very happy to hear why Al wanted the troops, and he granted his wish. That was the start of the great Eureka celebrations, and it was a moving tribute to Al Grassby that the city of Ballarat, upon hearing of his passing, presented a Eureka flag to Al’s family in his honour. It was draped over Al’s portrait at his funeral and, as a mark of the esteem with which Al was held, the surviving relatives of those who fought at the Eureka Stockade had all signed it.
As a harbinger of the great multicultural revolution he was later to be credited with inspiring, Al took an interest in the wellbeing of not just migrants, through his portfolio, but also Indigenous Australians. As a member of the federal parliament, Al attained the position of immigration minister in the Whitlam Labor government from 1972 to 1974. During this time he introduced a variety of wide-ranging reforms in citizenship, immigration, services for people from non-English-speaking backgrounds and Indigenous affairs. This included introducing community radio in a range of languages for the first time. He banned racially selected sporting teams from playing in Australia and also applied new non-discriminatory procedures for the selection of migrants and the issue of tourist visas.
The government in 1974 was forced to an election and Al lost the seat, but he still had a lifetime to devote to removing discrimination and promoting multiculturalism. Following the passage of the Racial Discrimination Act, Al Grassby was appointed the Commissioner for Community Relations. With two staff, he set about putting it into action. At the launch of the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations, Gough Whitlam said:
The Racial Discrimination Act wrote it firmly into the legislation that Australia is in reality a multicultural nation, in which the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Aboriginal people and of peoples from all parts of the world can find an honoured place. ... For the first time Australia affirmed its opposition to all forms of racial discrimination ...
Following this appointment, Al continued his lifelong commitment to humanitarian causes. He would go anywhere in Australia, speaking at a dinner or function at his expense—not asking for a fee. If there was a good cause, he would be there, applying himself to many diverse challenges over the years. He was the Director of International Operations for Australian INFO International, which included a special assignment for UNESCO with the international schools program in seven countries. He reviewed the multicultural information services of New South Wales health services and examined Aboriginal Australian experience of land management in Northern Australia, which included drafting land management curriculum for Charles Sturt University.
In 1985 Al was awarded an Order of Australia in recognition of his work in immigration. In 1986 he was recognised by the United Nations when he was awarded the UN peace medal. He had changed Australia significantly. He had made a commitment at a very personal level to work to create an Australia free from intolerance and racial prejudice. Time has shown what a precious gift this was and how much it is worth fighting to preserve. I would like to quote his daughter, Gabriella, who I think summed him up very eloquently. She is quoted as saying:
… her father’s legacy was opening Australia up to being a rich, blended and tolerant society. He was the instigator of “so many powerful things we take for granted now” ...
For the rest of his life, Al continued to change Australia and have a positive impact through his participation in many public debates. He wrote and co-wrote a number of books with Marji Hill and Alex Barlow, and he applied considerable energy to personally helping people solve seemingly intractable problems. After making Canberra his home, he became active in the local ALP and held office in the Belconnen sub-branch for many years. He became a life member of the ACT branch of the Australian Labor Party in 1997.
Al also supported his wife, Ellnor, in every endeavour and encouraged Ellnor to stand successfully for the ACT assembly in which she later became a minister. He worked as hard for her as she had for him over the years. As recently as 2001, Al took on yet another challenge when he became the founding director of the Multicultural Business Council. Many people will always be grateful for the ongoing support Al gave to local entrepreneurial endeavours in the community, arts and business sectors.
Al’s commitment to Open Family, a charity devoted to keeping kids off the street, led to another Grassby institution here in Canberra—the monthly lunches held at the Press Club with up to 200 people attending were a legend. Being such a marvellous raconteur, Al would meticulously record and announce the comings and goings of members of the diplomatic corps; community, business and arts initiatives; and the births, deaths and marriages and other noteworthy events in the extraordinarily wide circle of friends that he had. It is testimony to his energy that these lunches continued right up to his death, albeit quarterly rather than monthly.
The Grassbys have faced many challenges together over the years and constituted a couple with personality to spare. I was privileged to gain a personal insight when I attended their 43rd wedding anniversary party at their home earlier this year. It was a typical large, warm, diverse crowd and Al, although his health was suffering, gave a lovely speech in which he paid tribute to his wife, Ellnor. Today my thoughts are with Ellnor, Gabriella and her husband Lionel, and Al’s grandson, Khedra. The Grassby family acknowledge and thank the Prime Minister for granting Al the honour of a state funeral. I would like to take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt condolences to them once again.
Question agreed to, honourable senators standing in their places.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Albert (Al) Jaime Grassby AM</title>,CONDOLENCES,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-11,"—The bill in question today, the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005, is very similar to an earlier bill that was introduced in the last parliament. That bill was examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which took the opportunity of hearing evidence from various submitters and produced a report that made a number of recommendations. That was not in respect of this bill but it did make a series of very useful recommendations in respect of the previous bill in the parliament which are still germane to this bill. Labor is pleased to see that the government has clearly taken on board many of those recommendations in the preparation of this bill. It gave the opportunity for the government to take a look at the committee report in respect of the previous bill, provide input into the preparation of the new bill and take on board many of the recommendations, suggestions and issues that were canvassed during that report process in the last parliament.
One of the examples of the effectiveness of the Senate committee process is how a Senate committee itself can facilitate constructive work, particularly bipartisan work, on important policy matters. This is but one example of that. As with the last bill, Labor welcomes this bill as a positive contribution to improving the existing Family Law Act and, more particularly, acknowledges the ways in which it can help Australian families in the unfortunate position of having to use the Family Court. All of us in this place would know of the anguish faced by many of our constituents going through the process of family separation who, for a whole range of reasons, have not been able to work through the situation in a more amicable way and are forced to rely on going through the process of contesting the matter in court.
This particular bill is an omnibus bill dealing with amendments in 16 parts. Minister Ellison outlined in his second reading speech when the bill was tabled some of the key provisions of the bill and the ways in which the amendments would improve the act. It is not my intention to go through all 16 parts in the time I have available today. Many are technical changes that will ease practical difficulties faced by the courts and court users. Part 10 deals with such things as terminology. This may seem trite but in fact it is very important that the Family Law Act makes use of plain English. This is, after all, an area of law that touches more people than almost any other. It is also an area with many self-represented litigants. If ever there were a case for making an effort to clean up arcane language, I think this stands out as one of those areas in our statutes. It is always helpful for parliamentary counsel and the minister to ensure that their staff take a good look at such legislation to ensure that it is in plain English where possible, for the very reason that there are in many instances self-represented litigants who use this legislation.
Part 5 would extend the range of matters that can be dealt with through private arbitration. This creates a welcome new pathway for certain cases that do not require the expense and delay of litigation but cannot be resolved through mediation alone. Part 16 clears up a gap in the recently passed Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005 to ensure that the Family Court of Western Australia has the same jurisdiction as the Family Court of Australia in the areas of crossover between family law and bankruptcy law.
However, there are some parts of this bill which are controversial. The most controversial part of the bill in Labor’s view is part 14, which would allow a claim for the retrospective recovery of maintenance by a person who later finds out that they are not the child’s biological parent. Labor support the intention of this provision but we have serious reservations about the sorts of outcomes it could produce if applied too rigidly. In most instances we are talking about cases where a mistake has been made: one person was thought to be the father and a maintenance order was made requiring them to pay maintenance to the mother to support the child. Everyone has shared in the mistake—the mother, the father and even the court in that instance. The question is really about who should bear the cost of the mistake, and a good argument can be made out, I suspect, from both sides.
The male can rightly say that the maintenance order should never have been made and he should never have been required to pay for a child that is not his. I suspect that the mother could also argue, convincingly, that she is incapable of paying all the money back while continuing to support herself and her child or children, and that it was a mistake that was unknown to her at the time. There could also be a time in the future where it becomes difficult to sort out what happened. The Family Court of all institutions cannot be required to force a mother and her children into poverty to correct an honest mistake. That would seem a logical place to start.
Labor thinks there is only one fair way to deal with this dilemma, and that is judicial discretion. Every case could be different. The scenario I have outlined could be a rare one, and there might be others which are more pressing and more telling. In some cases, mothers might be doing it and can be doing it tough, and recovery of the full amount could be disastrous for both them and their kids. In other cases, the mother might have fared well and the man may have battled. So in some cases it could be a mistake and in others it could be indeterminate as to what in fact had happened.
In some cases, the man will have acted quickly upon finding out that he is not the biological father. In others, the situation may have been left for years and sometimes it will be difficult, at least from this side, to examine why—the reasons for it. That is why, sitting in the chamber, it is very difficult to predict all the permutations that will arise and devise a formula that is fair in all the circumstances. Therefore, it is one of those areas where we are best placed to trust the courts to closely examine each case and make an appropriate order. For this reason, Labor have been very keen to ensure this bill provides the courts with adequate discretion over the amount that is recovered and how it is to be paid. We will be supporting an amendment to that end.
Labor has also been keen to ensure that, where a mother has been required to repay maintenance under these provisions, she is able in turn to recover maintenance from the actual father of the child. It would hardly be fair that mothers could be liable to retrospectively repay maintenance where biological fathers cannot. Moreover, in many cases, the mother will have forgone other income from reliance on the maintenance. In particular, she will have received different benefits from those that would have been available to her under social security, and over time other benefits may have been forgone as a consequence. Unless the government is prepared to pay back social security benefits in these cases and review those lost or forgone opportunities, which I suspect it is not, it becomes a difficult issue to work through. But, more importantly, the mother should then have the right to retrospectively claim maintenance from the biological father.
Labor raised these concerns with the Attorney-General’s office and we were advised that the Family Law Act already provides the court with the power to award backdated maintenance. The correspondence we received from the Attorney-General’s adviser says:
I am advised by the Department that a right for the mother to claim maintenance from the biological father already exists under division 7, part VII of the Family Law Act in respect of children, to which the new section 66X would apply. Under section 66G of the act, the court has a wide discretion to make any child maintenance order it considers appropriate against the parent of a child. The period covered and the amount of that ordered would be a matter for the court—
I stress that: it would be a matter for the court—
considering the principal object in division 7 to ensure that children receive a proper level of financial support from their parent.
Both of those issues are important—that the court has the discretion and that that is to ensure children receive a proper level of financial support. Labor is satisfied with this explanation. I think it is plain within the legislation. It is the case that section 66G provides a wide discretion for the court to make orders for maintenance, and nothing seems to prevent them from making backdated or retrospective orders if that is appropriate. This goes a long way to allaying some of the concerns Labor had with that particular provision.
The remaining part of the bill that might be controversial is part 1, concerning the parenting compliance regime. Provisions in this part would do two things: firstly, provide that the court can order parents to participate in paid counselling or parenting programs before making orders in enforcement proceedings; and, secondly, provide the court with the power to amend the parenting orders where enforcement proceedings have been brought but either no contravention was found or there was a reasonable excuse for the contravention.
With respect to the first of these provisions, it is already possible for the court to order a couple to participate in counselling or parenting programs and other types of proceedings. This change is extending that power to enforcement proceedings. This is, in Labor’s view, a positive move, as counselling and parenting programs have proven very successful at getting to and solving the issues at the heart of noncompliance. Counselling is not appropriate in all cases, especially where there has been a history of violence. We are satisfied that the protections that already exist in the Family Law Act provide sufficient guidance to the court as to when these orders should and should not be made.
The second change in this part allows the court to vary parenting orders in enforcement proceedings, even if no contravention is found or there was a reasonable excuse for the contravention. This will allow the court to iron out the practical or other problems in parenting orders that gave rise to the compliance or noncompliance. In some cases, it will also allow a reasonable excuse for noncompliance, such as an apprehension of violence, to form the basis of a substantive change to the orders. Currently these changes require separate proceedings for variations of orders. It makes a lot of practical sense for the courts to be given the power to deal with variation at the same time as hearing enforcement proceedings. I note that the National Women’s Network of Legal Services has recommended that this new power be limited to certain cases such as those where violence is an issue.
This was pursued in the Senate committee inquiry into the 2004 bill—not this particular bill but the same provision that arose in the last parliament in that bill. The Attorney-General’s Department advised the committee that the court’s power would be effectively limited by the considerations the court must always have when making parenting orders: that the best interests of the child and the factors set out in section 68F(2) of the Family Law Act would apply. Labor, having understood and being familiar with that provision, is comfortable with that response.
This is a useful bill containing several practical reforms to the working of the family law system. Labor’s only remaining concerns are with part 14. Though we support the intention of that part, we are concerned that it fails to provide sufficient discretion to the court in dealing with the complex issue of deciding who should bear the costs of a mistake. We will be foreshadowing today that, in the committee stage, we will be moving a provision that goes to this part. I expect the government to carefully examine this provision and to accept the amendment so that the bill can pass as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-05-11,"—The Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 makes a range of recommendations to substantive and procedural aspects of the family law regime. Many of the changes proposed in the bill were previously contained in the Family Law Amendment Bill 2004 but then lapsed with the proroguing of the 40th Parliament. That bill was the subject of an inquiry undertaken by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which made a number of quite constructive recommendations.
The Democrats are pleased to see that the government has taken up some of those recommendations and removed a number of the more controversial aspects of the bill. In particular, we welcome the decision not to proceed with the proposed changes to costs rules which would have required one party to bear the costs of another party in proceedings under the act. These amendments represented a departure from the principle that each party bears their own costs, which is one of the underlying principles of the Family Law Act. Many stakeholders at that time expressed understandable concern regarding these amendments and the committee further recommended that they not proceed.
The fact that the changes are not in the bill before us is a testament to the value of the Senate committee system and its role in facilitating community participation in the legislative process. Making sure that we get feedback from stakeholders and from those with strong interests is invaluable to us as legislators. These people and organisations are often at the coalface of the issues we are debating and they are therefore able to provide incredibly helpful information about the very likely impact of proposed legislation. While the government does not always implement the recommendations of Senate committees, it has in this case, and the Democrats welcome that decision very much.
I turn now to what remains in the bill before us. Given the length of the bill and the non-controversial nature of most of the amendments, I propose to touch briefly on the effect of each part. Part 1 of the bill deals with the parenting compliance regime and empowers the Family Court to vary the terms of an unworkable parenting order during contravention proceedings. This amendment addresses the reality that many parenting orders made by consent run into practical problems and that this may result in one of the parties initiating a contravention application when in fact it may be more appropriate to simply vary the original order. Part 2 makes relatively non-controversial amendments to provisions concerning costs and offers of settlement.
Part 3 enables the court to suspend a sentence of imprisonment in cases where a person has breached a court order and to revoke the suspension of that sentence. These changes will, I hope, give the court broader discretion to determine an appropriate penalty for a breach of a court order and give the offender the opportunity to avoid imprisonment if he or she maintains good behaviour. Part 4 of this bill makes changes to the procedures for enforcing community service orders or bonds where a person has failed to comply with a parenting order.
Part 5 expands the range of matters which may be amenable to private arbitration. Part 6 invests with the court a discretionary power to change the venue for family law proceedings or a part of those proceedings. Part 7 expands the definition of ‘disposition’ and inserts a comprehensive definition of ‘interest’ into the act. Part 8 extends the situations where a single judge may hear an appeal regarding a procedural matter. Part 9 enables property proceedings commenced in a state magistrates court to be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Service. Currently it is only possible for such matters to be transferred to the Family Court or state supreme courts.
Part 10 makes numerous amendments to the act with the object of replacing outdated terms such as ‘dissolution of marriage’, ‘decree nisi’ and ‘decree absolute’ with the terms ‘divorce’ and ‘divorce order’. Part 11 simply sets out in table form the existing requirements for leave to appeal. Part 12 enables the court to stay or dismiss an appeal if the notice of an appeal does not disclose proper grounds for an appeal. Part 13 provides that appeals from the full court of the Family Court to the High Court will require the special leave of the High Court. This amendment implements one of the recommendations from the Australian Law Reform Commission, with the agreement of the High Court and the Family Court.
Part 14 is unquestionably the most controversial aspect of the bill. It will enable a person who discovers that they are not the parent of a child for whom they have made child maintenance payments to apply to the court to recover those payments. I will return to the Democrats’ concerns with aspects of that in a moment. Part 15 enables judicial registrars to vary parenting orders in contravention proceedings where contravention without reasonable excuse is not proved. Finally, part 16 amends the Bankruptcy Act to provide that certain provisions which currently apply to the Family Court apply equally to the Family Court of Western Australia. This is because of the unique situation of the Family Court of Australia having no jurisdiction in WA, my home state. All family law matters there are dealt with by the Family Court of Western Australia.
It is clear then that many of the changes proposed by this bill are non-controversial and indeed welcome. This was reflected very much in the evidence of various organisations and individuals who made submissions to the committee inquiry into the provisions of the bill in 2004. The committee’s report indicates that no opposition was expressed in relation to a majority of the provisions in the bill. Serious concerns, however, were expressed in relation to the power to order the repayment of child maintenance to a person who has wrongfully paid such maintenance believing that they are a parent of the child when in fact they are not. We Democrats have some deep concerns about these changes. While we are not saying that people who have been mistaken, or perhaps in some cases misled, about being a parent of the child ought not to have an entitlement to recover moneys that they have wrongfully been asked to pay through child maintenance, we are nonetheless concerned about the potential adverse financial impact this may have on the child concerned.
The New South Wales Commission for Children and Young People expressed concern about the significant financial burden that such a repayment order might have on the parent and the family and argued that there was a need for the court to ensure that the best interests of the child are safeguarded. The National Network of Women’s Legal Services made this point:
… it seems unfair to bring in this provision when women cannot claim back payments of retrospective child support. Therefore, while a woman could be made to pay back a wrongly identified man who is not the biological father she cannot then make a retrospective claim against the real father.
The National Council of Single Mothers and their Children recommended:
… that this provision should only apply where it can be established, on the balance of probabilities, that the misidentification of the paying parent has knowingly and without duress involved a deliberate course of deception for the purpose of claiming child support. 
As I spoke of, and detailed in my minority report to this bill, I am not satisfied that this recommendation would address the issues we are concerned about. Clearly there is a distinction in the minds of many between situations in which the mother of a child has been deceptive about the child’s father and situations where there is a genuine mistake. Nevertheless, I think there are compelling reasons not to enshrine any such distinction in the legislation. For example, I note that there is already scope for a person who is not a parent of the child to recover financial loss and damages if they have paid child maintenance in circumstances involving deception.
The Australian Law Reform Commission quite expressly addressed this in its report entitled Essentially yours: the protection of human genetic information in Australia. It documented the case of a Victorian man who successfully sued his ex-wife for fraud after discovering that two of the children born during their marriage were not his biological children. In that case, the Victorian County Court awarded the man $70,000 for general damages and economic loss. In other words, in cases involving fraud there is scope to seek more than just repayment of child maintenance. This suggests that the government’s proposed changes are directed more at situations involving mistaken paternity than at situations involving deception.
A second and particular concern we have is that it will often, I think, be incredibly difficult to establish deliberate deception and this could generate volumes of litigation. Let us not forget that this is litigation which is likely to be very distressing for the child, even if the child is not directly involved in the proceedings in the sense of providing evidence for the court.
Finally, and most importantly, whether or not deception is involved is really quite irrelevant when we are considering the financial impact on a child of an order to repay a significant amount of child maintenance. That is the primary concern that we have. The vital issue for the chamber to consider here and to remember when we are dealing with this legislation is that we are talking about child maintenance. This money has been paid for the express purpose of maintaining a child, and any repayment is likely to have an impact on that child. For this reason, the Democrats take the view that the court must—and I stress ‘must’—be required to consider the likely impact that its order will have on the maintenance of the child. In fact this must be the primary consideration. We find it quite extraordinary that there is no such requirement in the bill. If the court is not required to put the interests of the child first, there is a risk that the changes proposed in this bill will simply fuel divisive litigation between the parent and the mistaken parent of the child, with no consideration of the impact that that might have on the child concerned.
We are very concerned by the prescriptive language used in the bill, which I note the government is seeking to further tighten by way of fresh amendments. This leaves some confusion about whether the court has any discretion to decide not to make an order for repayment in circumstances where that would be the most just and equitable outcome. We note that the court is already empowered to make retrospective child maintenance orders against a person who is a parent of the child. We Democrats believe that the court should be required to turn its mind to the potential for such an order against the biological father if it proposes to make an order for repayment of maintenance to the mistaken father. Clearly this is a relevant consideration which will impact on the court’s determination of what is just and equitable in the circumstances. Of course that will vary on a case-by-case basis. For example, it may be considered manifestly unjust for the court to make an order for repayment of a large sum of child maintenance by a low-income mother. However, if the court is aware of the identity of the biological father and there is scope for recovering the sum of money from him, this will no doubt affect the court’s position as to whether a repayment order should be made. In these circumstances the court could even adjourn the mistaken father’s application for repayment pending the outcome of the application for a child maintenance order against the biological father. For those reasons the Democrats believe it is very important for the court to consider the possibility of a child maintenance order against the biological father before making an order for repayment under the new provisions.
We do acknowledge that this is not an easy issue to grapple with. It is a difficult area of law and there is a need for the court to have power to order the repayment of child maintenance to mistaken parents in cases where this would be just and equitable and there would be no significant adverse impact on the child. However, fundamentally, we believe it is essential that such a power be accompanied by appropriate safeguards. Those safeguards are absent from the current bill. Our amendments quite specifically are aimed at rectifying that. We find it very disappointing that a bill which makes so many constructive improvements to the Family Law Act is marred by provisions which have the potential to significantly threaten the maintenance of the wellbeing of some Australian children. I ask the Senate to give serious consideration to these issues and to work constructively in the committee stage to try and bring about the reforms that I have spoken of.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-05-11,"—I wish to speak on the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005 that is before the Senate today. I will not reiterate the comments and concerns that have been outlined by my colleague Senator Brian Greig. He has done so on behalf of the Australian Democrats. I acknowledge that this is an emotional area of the law and a particularly complex one. Let us be honest: it is a fraught area. It is, at the best of times, an emotionally charged area of legislation, policy and indeed reality. Those of us in this chamber who have had dealings with the Family Court, whether as adults or as children, can recall and know very well just how hard this area of law is. I say that specifically in relation to the amendments that we are talking about today in part 14 of this legislation—that is, the area relating to the recovery of maintenance payments. I wish to put on the record very briefly, before going on to discuss another issue, my concerns about some of the aspects of that provision.
While I acknowledge Senator Ludwig’s comment that it is difficult to predict, for example, the permutations of how this particular provision will be played out and what it will result in—and I also acknowledge that it is very important that the law and the courts in particular have the power of discretion in order to make the right judgments—I do think this is a provision that may have unintended consequences. Some of those consequences will be emotionally charged. I hope some of them will not indeed be vexatious. I hope they will not be devastating, particularly for the single mothers in our community—single mothers who seem to be finding it particularly difficult in recent days as a consequence of policy changes.
Today I wish to talk about the science involved in this legislation—that is, the scientific issues around parentage testing: the very issue that underpins part 14 of this bill. When we are talking about cases that will involve recovery of maintenance payments as a consequence of parentage testing, we must ensure that the tests used to determine parentage are as accurate as they can be. We do this through strict technical regulation and it has to be conducted in an appropriate manner under strict ethical guidelines. My concern is that some of these guidelines and regulatory mechanisms are missing. That is an area of our law that the ALRC have pointed out, and it is an area of law with which I hope most of my colleagues in this chamber have some familiarity.
We know that the Family Law Regulations 1984 currently provide guidance for parentage tests conducted as a result of a court order under section 69W(1) of the Family Law Act 1975. The government updated these regulations late last year to require a recent photo of a donor of a bodily sample to be provided and to establish new consent forms. These changes were positive and they addressed some of the concerns raised in Australian Law Reform Commission report No. 96, Essentially yours: the protection of human genetic information in Australia. It specifically responded to recommendation 35-6 of that report. I talk about this report with some fondness because my work in relation to genetic privacy and discrimination helped to initiate and bring about that ALRC and AHEC investigation and report. I commend the report to senators in this chamber. It is a comprehensive, world-class—and very big—report surrounding the issues of genetic testing.
Despite this first positive step by the government, the government has only implemented one of the seven recommendations on parentage testing contained in that report since the report was tabled in May 2003. That is two years ago now and time is getting on, not to mention that technology is advancing at a rapid rate. One particular recommendation in that report, 35-3, calls on the government to review part IIA of the Family Law Regulations 1984 to:
 ... ensure that the requirements for parentage testing meet the highest technical and ethical standards, particularly in relation to consent to testing, protecting the integrity of genetic samples, and providing information as to counselling.
It is my understanding that this has not happened as yet. Madam Acting Deputy President, through you, I ask questions of the government to the minister on duty about this, particularly about the government’s time line in relation to the implementation of these ALRC recommendations. Has the government considered the recommendations? Will the government be reporting on these recommendations? Why hasn’t the government considered the recommendations within the context of this bill? If ever there was a bill that raised some ethical issues in relation to genetic testing generally and parentage testing specifically, this is it.
At the moment, the Therapeutic Goods Administration does not regulate DNA identification kits used for parentage testing. There is no legislative requirement for DNA parentage testing to be conducted only through NATA—that is, the National Association of Testing Authorities—accredited laboratories in this country. We do have accredited labs in this country, but there is no legislative requirement that DNA parentage testing in Australia be performed only through those NATA-accredited laboratories. The consent of mature age children aged 12 and over is not required under legislation for genetic testing in this country and, perhaps most concerning of all, there is no provision for parentage tests which do not comply with the relevant Family Law Regulations 1984 to be inadmissible in proceedings under the Family Law Act 1975.
I do not know how my colleagues respond to this, but these seem to me to be quite grave matters. They raise issues about how we acquire a sample of a person’s DNA for the purpose of testing—and for DNA parentage testing in particular. Are we seriously talking about going up to children—and we have reports of this happening—and taking a saliva sample, a strand of hair or whatever it may be, sending it off to a non-accredited lab and using it to determine whether or not a particular person is the father, as in the case of the legislation being dealt with today? That is admissible in court. Do we want to regulate this? Isn’t it important that we consider this now, in the context of this bill?
We have seen the high-profile cases on 60 Minutes and other programs, but when it gets down to it I am terrified in some respects that this legislation will open the floodgates in a way that does not protect ethical and other issues. But I am so concerned about the science because I think, as my colleague has pointed out generally and publicly, if not in this place, you may be able to determine who is not the father but it is incredibly difficult to determine who is the father. Yes, these are legal issues, but they also have huge emotional, personal and familial consequences. I really wish that this were being considered in the context of this legislation.
Some people have considered this. ALRC report No. 96 does consider these issues, and has done so with a wide range of submissions, consulting the best authorities not just in Australia but in the world. They have done the work that we have longed for them to do, and now it is time for us and the government specifically to take account of those recommendations. Those recommendations are referred to in my second reading amendment, which I put to this chamber in the hope that the government will at least respond to, if not implement, six of the seven recommendations relating to parentage testing in the ALRC report. One of those seven has been implemented, and I commend the government for that. There are six to go. Let us at least look at them, if not implement them. I hate to foreshadow the response of other parties, but I understand from the opposition that that amendment is not supported. I thank the opposition for outlining their reasons.
However, I put on notice to the government, the opposition and other members in this place that we are dealing with legislation which, as we have all said today, is emotionally charged, complex and fraught with difficulties. Yet there are some simple things we could do to ensure that there are regulatory mechanisms in place that deal with some of the complex issues. There is nothing more complex than science when it comes to legislation keeping up with some of the technological advances that have taken place. So I urge my colleagues to at least consider the recommendations and to consider my amendment, which is in a second reading form today. ALRC report No. 96 notes that parentage testing:
... is not an area in which it is especially useful to draw on the language of ‘rights’—whether that be a child’s ‘right’ to know his or her biological parentage, or a man’s ‘right’ to know who are his biological offspring. This is an area that requires a careful balancing of interests of mothers, fathers and children in different biological and social relationships with each other. To privilege the interest of one party by accepting a claim to an absolute right fails to give adequate regard to the interests of others involved in the equation.
That is from section 35-13 of the report. I agree wholeheartedly with those comments. I hope the courts—and I am sure that they will—will take those issues, those so-called rights and that debate into account in a discretionary manner through the power that we have just ascribed to them in this area. But we could provide some guidance in the legislation before us here today. Certainly one of Senator Greig’s amendments, which urges, compels or at least asks the court to take into account the interests of the child, would surely provide further guidance and further security in the complex web of issues, both scientific and legal, with which we are dealing today.
One of the reasons I initiated the ALRC’s inquiry into human genetic privacy was to address the difficult issues that we find are arising when genetic technology is utilised in certain situations and in particular in its interaction with the law. The reality is that this is the tip of the iceberg. These issues will keep on appearing in various areas of our law and society. If the government had implemented or at least considered and reported on all the recommendations in ALRC report No. 96 in a timely fashion—two years after the report was tabled in parliament we are still waiting on the government’s response; that is how far we are lagging behind—we would be well on the way to addressing many of these complex issues. It would not be all, because the consequences of science and tech-nological change are going to keep throwing up new, complex ethical and other issues. But I think we would be well on the way by now if we had responded to that report two years ago.
I should welcome one aspect of the government’s commitment to the issue of genetic technology. I notice that in last night’s budget the government finally announced $7.6 million over four years for the establishment of a human genetics advisory committee under the auspices of the NHMRC. I am quite over the moon about this announcement by the government, because it is something I have been campaigning for for a long time. Recommendation No. 1 of the ALRC report is the establishment of a human genetics commission. This is a belated response but a good one. I thank the government for implementing this important advisory committee. I would have liked a statutory independent body, but I will take whatever we can get. This is a really important implementation. I hope people are conscious of this recommendation. I do not think it is quite as sparkly as the tax cuts and other things that seemed to capture attention last night, but it is a really important step.
But are we really going to wait for that advisory committee to make a judgment and recommendations on the kinds of issues we are dealing with today, or are we going to proceed with these changes in law first? I can read the numbers in the Senate, so I real-ise that these changes will go through. I think we are all mindful, if not wary, of the consequences of the element of part 14 of this bill before us in relation to parentage testing and the recovery of maintenance payments. I can envisage some very unpretty scenarios, and I hope they do not come to fruition.
But, in the meantime, there is no reason today for us not to consider and pass a second reading amendment that puts very clearly on the record those six remaining ALRC recommendations in relation to parentage testing. I think it is irresponsible not to do it at a time when genetics is racing ahead of law. We are failing to catch up, but this legislation shows that the consequences can be incredibly hurtful, quite devastating and, I have no doubt, very expensive. I move the second reading amendment on sheet 4578 standing in my name, on behalf of the Australian Democrats:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate:
         (a)     calls on the Government to implement the remaining six (of the seven) Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) recommendations relating to parentage testing, and specific to the Government, in the ALRC report, Essentially Yours: The Protection of Human Genetic Information in Australia (ALRC 96) (tabled in May 2003); and,
        (b)     urges the Government to implement, as a matter of urgency, the ALRC report recommendations relating to:
                    (i)    amending the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and its regulations to enable Therapeutic Goods Administration regulation of DNA identification test kits (recommendation no. 11-6);
                   (ii)    enacting legislation to provide for DNA parentage testing to be conducted only by laboratories accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities (recommendation no. 35-1);
                  (iii)    reviewing Part IIA of the Family Law Regulations 1984 to ensure parentage testing meets the highest technical and ethical standards (recommendation no. 35‑3);

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-05-11,"—Firstly, I thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005. It is a very important bill which will affect many Australians. I thank those senators for their support for the bill, although a number of amendments have been foreshadowed by the opposition and the Democrats. We had best deal with those during the committee stage. I will deal first with the second reading amendment proposed by the Democrats. I will not go through that in detail, but it does call upon the government to implement the remaining recommendations of an ALRC report entitled Essentially yours: the protection of human genetic information in Australia and also urges the government to implement as a matter of urgency the ALRC report recommendations relating to the Therapeutic Goods Act and a number of other matters dealing with family law regulations, genetic testing and the like.
At the outset, I say that the report that is mentioned in the second reading amendment of the Democrats is complex. It addresses many issues of great substance. The government share the community’s concerns that genetic information should be treated with sensitivity. That is why the ALRC and AHEC inquiries were initiated. Wide-ranging recommendations covering privacy, protection against unfair discrimination in employment and insurance, the use of genetic information in forensic investigations and parentage testing were made. The recommendations are directed at the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, as well as statutory authorities, and legal and professional associations. That gives you some idea as to the broad aspect of the issue at hand and also its complexity. The recommendations in the report that are directed at the states and territories are being considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. That is the appropriate body to be dealing with it. I can say that the government hope to finalise their response to the report shortly. We do not believe that now is the appropriate time to deal with these issues. We are dealing with the Family Law Amendment Bill. The reports mentioned cover a wider range of very sensitive issues, and we do not believe that the second reading amendment proposed by the Democrats is appropriate. We are going to respond to these recommendations; however, this is simply not the time to do it, and I have outlined the reasons for that.
The Every picture tells a story report was quite rightly described by the Attorney as one which could deal with generational change in family law and with issues which cover many, if not all, Australians indirectly. We all know someone who has been touched by family law in some shape or form. This bill is more confined. It contains a number of technical amendments that are designed to streamline and strengthen many areas in the Family Law Act. Included within those areas are some that are quite familiar. We are changing the term ‘dissolution of marriage’ to ‘divorce’ and we are doing away with the terms ‘decree nisi’ and ‘decree absolute’. They were longstanding terms that I became quite familiar with in my family law practice many years ago and have been around for a very long time. I think that the change of this terminology is in keeping with today’s thinking. I think that it is a step forward which demonstrates that this bill is about progress and addressing issues in family law. I think that is a good thing.
In addition, the bill will provide a court with the power to vary a parenting order on its own motion without there needing to be another application. Often, parties apply to enforce an order, such as a contact order, even when the problem is that the order itself simply does not work for a whole range of reasons. There have been many who have experienced that. Many of these orders are actually made by consent without the full ramifications of the orders being appreciated by the parents and are sometimes done in the heat of the moment or with other pressures being exercised. This bill will allow the court to change that order without the need for a party to go back and apply for a variation separately, which has caused a great deal of frustration for many parents and, I might add, a good deal of cost as well.
The bill also overcomes a problem that has led to unnecessary delays whereby a matter is transferred from a state or territory magistrates court to the Family Court only for that court to then transfer the matter to the federal Magistrates Court. I think that that is a good thing to be addressed. This bill allows for transfers directly between those lower level courts. It is a very good initiative indeed. This bill also contains a range of what might be called minor and technical amendments that deal with the powers of the Family Court in relation to areas such as the effect of offers of settlement on possible cost orders, change of venue once proceedings have been commenced, powers to dismiss appeals and the power of judicial registrars of the court.
The bill also closes a major loophole in the Family Law Act by making it clear that a person who is not a parent or a step-parent of the child can recover amounts paid by them from the person who received those payments. An earlier version of this bill was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which made some recommendations for change. The government has responded to those recommendations by removing two of the original schedules to the bill and making changes to the provisions in part 14, dealing with recovery of amounts paid under maintenance orders.
In addition to that summary of the bill, I would like to foreshadow three government amendments that will be moved during the committee stage. One of those amendments will reinsert a provision designed to limit the right of third-party creditors to be parties to family law proceedings where a bankrupt’s trustee is already a party. The other amendments relate to proposed section 66X in part 14 of the bill, dealing with recovery of child maintenance, where a person is found not to be a parent or step-parent of a child. The first will allow a court to recognise that in exceptional circumstances it might be appropriate to reduce the amount to be repaid. The second is designed to make it clear that, where the provision talks about a person to whom child maintenance has been paid, this does not relate to the Child Support Agency.
This bill will address the anomalies we have seen to date in family law. It will progress it and I think there are many aspects of it which will serve the Australian community well. I appreciate that there are some areas of contention in relation to the payment of maintenance moneys and the question of parentage. The government, I can foreshadow, cannot see its way clear to support the amendments which I understand are being proposed by the opposition and by the Democrats—but, as I say, it is best that we deal with those in the committee stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-11,"—I wanted to speak briefly on the second reading amendment to the Family Law Amendment Bill 2005. I spoke to Senator Stott Despoja briefly, but it is worth reiterating Labor’s position. We do not support the second reading amendment, not because of its content but because of our inability to address it in detail in the short time we have had to deal with it. In addition, we wanted the government’s response to the matter to have fuller consultation through SCAG and we wanted the government to provide the full report—hopefully that will be this year. The minister might want to respond to that during the committee stage. In these circumstances, we do not propose to support the second reading amendment, notwithstanding its content.

"Senator SANTORO,",LP,2005-05-11,"—Today I want to speak about Anzac Day and the place that gave it birth, the Turkish peninsula of Gallipoli. Gallipoli truly holds an iconic position in Australia’s national life. It is a wellspring of national sentiment. It defines us in so many separate ways: as unwilling, larrikin warriors who, nonetheless, will seize the day; as mates who will do anything except let someone down; and as a people of tenacious vision and sure purpose.
It would hold no meaning for us, or for our cousins across the Tasman, if it were not for the exigencies of war and the demands of strategy that placed Australians there on Turkey’s European shore in 1915. The Australians and New Zealanders of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps who first went to Gallipoli had thought, when they left home some short months before, that they were headed first for England and thence the battlefields of the Western Front. Instead they were sent on a military misadventure that grew out of Turkey’s entry into the Great War on the side of Germany. At Gallipoli, the men of ANZAC—the acronym is said to have been invented by an overworked army clerk in Cairo, fed up with typing out the whole phrase—became a legend and altered our way of thinking, and arguably our future, forever.
I dare say every Australian knows something about the legend of ANZAC and Gallipoli. Those young men who went off to war more than 90 years ago—and, as the Prime Minister so memorably said at this year’s ceremonies at Gallipoli on Anzac Day, they are all gone now so once again they are young men—wrote a glorious page in our history. That history is a living thing. It is as evocative today as it must have been to Gallipoli correspondent CEW Bean when he was writing his frontline diary. Incidentally, I recognise in this speech Mr Ray Perry, the hardworking and effective head of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, who so kindly lent me his copy of the book as an aide-memoire for my trip.
History was heavy in the air on 25 April this year, when I had the great privilege and the immense honour to be present at the dawn service on that fatal shore. It gets into your very being; its grip is visceral. It is certainly not to be missed. Anzac Cove is a place of ghosts: ghosts of daring and brave Australians and New Zealanders, and equally of daring and brave Turks who so tenaciously and at such huge cost defended their homeland. They say to us today:
We have a covenant, we and you: we gave our tomorrows so you could have today in freedom and in peace: honour us and pay homage to our spirit.
We do honour them; we do pay homage; and we always will. At Anzac Cove this year, I carried with me some words reported by the Bulletin magazine’s national affairs editor, Tony Wright. They came from a young Turkish man named Korcan, with whom Tony was having a beer some years ago. Wright reported Korcan thus:
You know why you go to Gallipoli, don’t you. That’s where your people learnt they were different from the English. You found your soul there, so you have to keep coming back to pay your respects. Your country started there, and so did our country.
Korcan went on to say:
You know about Attaturk? If he hadn’t fought your grandfathers at Gallipoli, he wouldn’t have become the man to save Turkey and make it a new independent country. That’s why we like each other so much, the Aussies and the Turks. We made our own futures in the same place. Cheers mate.
There is indeed a special relationship between Australians and Turks, one that grew out of the Gallipoli experience. At Anzac Cove on 25 April, I was very moved by the sincerity of the young Australians—overwhelmingly the crowd was Australian—who waited through the night for the dawn service. As the Prime Minister said at the time, and afterwards, these young people do us proud. It is very pleasing from a national point of view—and comforting, too, for our future nationhood—that so many young Australians have made Gallipoli their own.
From conversations I had with many of them there at the end of last month, it seems that the great Australia Remembers program was an impetus in getting more and more young people to consider paying homage at Gallipoli. That very creditable program was ably administered by the then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Con Sciacca, a fine Queenslander—and I pay tribute to him today and to the program he oversaw.
As honourable senators well know, there was a bit of a row about rubbish at Anzac Cove this year. The Prime Minister said some sensible words about that, too, in relation to the fact that, wherever modern crowds go—Australian or not—rubbish is the inevitable travelling companion. It is difficult to dispose of rubbish when there are big crowds and a very small place in which those crowds can be accommodated. An additional factor at Anzac Cove was that there were very few bins. I am told that bins were not abundantly provided for security reasons. But I feel bound to say this: when I returned to Anzac Cove later on the afternoon of Anzac Day, the rubbish was well and truly on the way to being cleared away by Turkish clean-up crews.
There was also some adverse comment about people sleeping or lying on graves while waiting overnight for the dawn service. I reiterate that it was a very crowded place. You cannot travel to Anzac Cove just for the dawn service. You often need to leave the afternoon before from a major city or town in Turkey and then camp and wait for the dawn service. Perhaps a camping ground nearby would be a good idea to accommodate people, who would then be handily placed to attend the dawn service. While I was at Gallipoli I also attended the Lone Pine service where, along with my esteemed colleagues from the other place the members for Mackellar and Braddon, I had the privilege of placing a wreath as a personal tribute.
One thing that did cast a shadow over the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing was the wholly artificial row about the road the Turkish authorities have upgraded to ensure better access for visitors to Anzac Cove on Anzac Day and throughout the year. As I said in this place yesterday while we were dealing with more Labor whinges—and, dare I say, whingers—after question time, I spoke to many Turks while I was in their country and found that no-one had any problems with the road or, for that matter, with Australia’s internal politics on that account. It seems to me that the Turks have an equal amount of reverence for Gallipoli as do we Australians, and I do not believe the road disturbs our ghosts or theirs or the feelings we share about that old place of death.
The issue of ongoing archaeological work to ensure that the undiscovered dead of both sides are properly honoured is something I know concerns Australians deeply, and Turks too. There is a very effective Office of Australian War Graves in Canakkale, where such matters are dealt with as a matter of course. In fact, the director of this office was honoured by the Prime Minister with an Order of Australia—a ceremony which my colleagues and I had the privilege of witnessing while we stood in one of the cemeteries overlooking Anzac Cove on Anzac Day.
To be at Anzac Cove for the dawn service this year was a tremendous honour and the experience of a lifetime. I do, however, have this to say: I was displeased—in fact, I was distressed—to hear what the New Zealand Chief of Defence, Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, said in his address at the dawn service. The views that he and later his Prime Minister, Helen Clark, expressed publicly on that occasion were inappropriate. They were political. They were revisionist. They were rude and, in my view, they were plain wrong. Regrettably, the New Zealanders made a political event of a solemn 90th anniversary, and that is so inappropriate on the special day that Australians and New Zealanders share and on which, uniquely, they honour all who have fallen in war, all who have been wounded in the service of their country and all who have served in war.
The most offensive of Air Marshal Ferguson’s remarks at the dawn service—and I have thought long and hard before applying the strength of the language used on this topic in this speech—was:
As today progresses, all of us will learn something more of our heritage. By simply being here we are already doing that. This land is sacred to all nations who fought here. Australia and New Zealand realised the high water mark of imperial subservience; we learned that we must shake off the shackles of colonial dependence; we must stand for what we believe in; and we must be prepared to defend our ideals whatever the cost.
That is what Air Marshal Ferguson said. I would not presume to speak for New Zealand, but I feel bound to say that historical revisionism of this sort is very unhelpful to understanding our past, is destructive of the heritage that has made us what we are today, and in the circumstances, is downright rude.
I read with interest an article by the writer Frank Devine in the Australian just after Anzac Day. He wrote that Air Marshal Ferguson’s speech was one of the finest speeches for an occasion that he had heard on any occasion. As will be clear, I fundamentally disagree with Mr Devine’s assessment. In Mr Devine’s view, Air Marshal Ferguson:
... peopled Australia and New Zealand with the noble ghosts whose presence one senses in modern societies with deeper pasts: samurai and sorcerers, scholars and maharajas, princes and pathfinders, courtesans and revolutionaries.
So he did, and all credit to Mr Devine for writing those fine words. But the fund-amental error in the air marshal’s argument—beyond the crassness of its delivery to an audience containing people, the British, whom he deliberately set out to insult—is that he revealed himself to be a willing victim of the modern fad of reinventing history. This pernicious practice is not nurturing of our society or even of our myths. It is, indeed, destructive of them. Great events from the past must be judged and understood from a perspective drawn through time. Unless they are popular movies fictionalising historic events like, say, the Australian film Gallipoli or the British movie Gandhi, it is invidious to rescript actual drama as if, but for the uniforms, it happened only yesterday and involved people whose responses to events would be the responses of those of our time.
New Zealand might have been at the height of its imperial subservience in 1915—although I seriously doubt that presumption, or that the New Zealand nation of 90 years ago even thought about whether it was in that predicament—but Australia certainly was not. War is a desperate and tragic business whether large or small and by whomever it is organised. Air Marshal Ferguson also said, and he was absolutely right in this instance, that there was no glory 90 years ago. In fact, there is no glory on any field of death. But portraying one’s country as an unthinking self-victim of someone else’s war is a cop-out. Australians and New Zealanders, Newfoundlanders—we should remember that they were not Canadians until 1949—Britons, Indians, the French, Africans from French territories on that continent and, overwhelmingly, Turks and other subjects of the Ottoman Empire fell at Gallipoli. It is their sacrifice we honour, not the fortunes of war or the failures of diplomacy that led them there.
I was at Gallipoli this year as a very temporary member of the ship’s company of HMAS Anzac while taking part in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program 2005. I want to tell the Senate about the benefits of that program and of participating in it aboard this fine ship, and will do so in far greater detail at a later date. I also want to talk about the great diplomatic work that results from the activities of the captain and his crew during such tours of duty. But today I want to briefly pay tribute to the commanding officer of HMAS Anzac, Captain Richard Mehinick, and all the officers, non-commissioned officers and sailors of his ship. They are a fine body of people and they are absolutely dedicated to working as a team and to doing their jobs. They are a credit to the service and to the country. They made me and my two colleagues also on board, the members for Mackellar and Braddon in the other place, extremely welcome. It cannot have been easy in a crowded and busy ship to find space, either physically or mentally, for three rookie parliamentary sailors who were there to watch and learn—that is, to watch their step and to learn to keep out of the way.
From Gallipoli, aboard HMAS Anzac, I had the opportunity to observe the ship’s company at work on exercises with foreign navy vessels and in port at Marmaris, on Turkey’s coast just above the island of Rhodes, where an international maritime festival was being held. Again, those fine people did an exemplary job for their ship and for our country. From Marmaris we sailed to Malta, another place where Australians and New Zealanders served with distinction in past conflicts. The island, which won the unique honour of being awarded the George Cross in World War II, has a strong Anzac link. In World War I, as a British colony, it was the ‘nurse of the Mediterranean’, the place to which many Gallipoli wounded were evacuated.
There are 228 Australian service cas-ualties whose last resting place is Malta, the earliest a Salvage Corps member from 1906 and the last a Royal Australian Air Force member killed in a flying accident in 1954 during the 1952-55 deployment there of No. 78 Wing with Meteor and Vampire fighters. Anzac Day has been marked in Malta since 1916. From last year, in addition to the remembrance service, a dawn service has been added to the annual observance. I am grateful to our High Commissioner in Malta, Richard Palk—who as well as being His Excellency is also a lieutenant colonel, retired—for his interest and energy in explaining to me this additional link between Malta and Australia. I also wish to recognise the very fine work that His Excellency performs on behalf our nation in the very special and historic place called Malta.
It would be remiss to talk about Anzac Day this year without making reference to ongoing reviews into the level of recognition of service awarded to Australian troops who served in Korea from the armistice in 1953 until 1957. There were around 5,000 of them. The review panel is investigating whether it is appropriate to award these veterans the Australian Active Service Medal 1945-75 with the clasp ‘Korea’ and the Returned from Active Service Badge for the period 1953‑57. I believe, and I go on the record as saying, that it would be entirely appropriate to recognise service in a war zone under armistice in a military environment in which immediate risk of hostilities was present as warranting such an award. I commend the government of which I am a member for initiating such a review.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Anzac Day</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,6,1

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-05-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked today relating to the Budget 2005-06.
I want to focus on the unbalanced and unfair tax cuts that were announced in the budget last night, on which there were some questions in question time today that Senator Minchin responded to.
What is fundamental to the tax package that was announced last night is its unfairness. A person earning up to approximately $63,000 a year receives a tax cut of just $6 a week. We are talking here about 80 per cent of Australians. The overwhelming majority of Australians earn up to this income level. In contrast, an income-earner earning approximately $130,000 per year will receive a tax cut of $65 a week. The Labor Party argues that this is not a fair and balanced tax package. It is not fair, and it is not balanced.
—Are you going to vote against it?
—We are, as a matter of fact. Of course, the figures I have just given you about a high-income earner on $130,000 a year receiving a tax cut of $65 per week do not include the very significant tax cut to high-income earners’ superannuation. In fact, if a person on $130,000 a year is receiving, let us say, 15 per cent in superannuation contributions from their employer, they will receive a further tax cut of approximately another $40 to $50 a week. These are very exclusive tax cuts. That amounts to a $6 a week tax cut for your battler and a $65 a week tax cut for a person on $130,000 a year. It does not stop there, however.
There are further tax cuts in the government’s package for 2006-07 but there are no further tax cuts for a person earning less than approximately $60,000 a year. We have two stages of tax cuts. The first stage is manifestly unfair and the second stage in 2006-07 delivers a further tax cut to high-income earners earning more than approximately $60,000 a year. The imbalance and unfairness in the tax package that was announced last night is extended and made even more unfair in the next financial year. It is battling low- and middle-income earning Australians who, with their $6 a week tax cut, are having to pay the price for this government’s broken election promises in a range of areas like child-care rebates, family tax and the Medicare safety net—that one is well remembered. Private health insurance costs are going up and, of course, interest rates have been increasing since the last election when the Liberal government promised that interest rates would not go up. They face a combination of significant increases in costs as a direct result of broken election promises and they are expected to cover these significant costs with a $6 a week tax cut. Contrary to what Senator Minchin and those interjecting on the other side have been saying, it is not just about the effect of progressivity and percentage cuts; it is a fundamental issue about caring for battlers and their capacity to pay for what have been very significant increases in costs. Just go and ask the average battling family. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-05-11,"—Dear, oh dear, Senator Sherry! Let us take you through it. You say these are very exclusive tax cuts—I do not think so, Senator Sherry. Everybody gets them; every Australian taxpayer gets a tax cut as a result of last night’s budget. That is the first point. Then Senator Sherry says, ‘Well, high-income earners get a bigger tax cut than low-income earners.’ Senator Sherry, yes, they do. Do you know why? Because high-income earners pay more tax than low-income earners, so of course in dollar terms a person earning $130,000 a year is going to get a larger tax cut than a person earning, let us say, $20,000 a year. The important point is that, as a proportion of income tax paid, the low-income earner gets the biggest percentage tax cut as a result of this budget. The largest percentage tax saving as a result of yesterday’s budget is in the lowest tax bracket, where the tax cut is from 17c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar.
Then Senator Sherry puts on a grave face and says, ‘Well, Mr Deputy President, it’s also unfair because the tax cuts to the high-income earners are being phased in in two phases, so not only do they get a tax cut this year’—that is true—‘but they get a tax cut next year.’ That is also true. What do you want? Do you want the tax cut for low-income earners—the people who, as a proportion of the tax they pay, will save the most—phased in over two years, delayed by another year; or do you want the low-income earners, the battlers, the people most in need of the extra dollars, to get their tax cut at once? Of course you want the latter. You do not want the tax cut for low-income earners to be phased in over two budgets; you want them to get their tax cut straightaway on 1 July. That is what the budget provides, but that all depends on the willingness of the Australian Labor Party to pass the tax cuts. Will the Australian Labor Party pass the tax cuts?
As you know, Mr Deputy President, there are nine sitting days of this Senate between now and 30 June. After today, there are nine more sitting days. In those nine sitting days that remain while the Senate is controlled by the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats and the Greens, the Labor Party will be put to the proof. Will you pass the budget? Will you pass the tax cuts? Will you enable the low-income earners of this country to get their tax cut from 17c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar, the biggest proportionate impact on any income group in the budget, on 1 July? Will you enable the tax thresholds to be increased so that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers are paying no more than 30c in the dollar after 1 July? Will you enable the legislation to be passed so that 97 per cent of Australians are paying tax at less than the top marginal rate on 1 July? Will you let the tax cuts through? What will you do, Senator Conroy—through you, Mr Deputy President? What will your party do? Will you give Australians the tax cuts or will you deny them the tax cuts on 1 July 2005? That is the question for you.
I believe that the decision of the Treasurer to cut taxes for every Australian taxpayer, to lift the thresholds, to introduce a tax system in which 80 per cent of taxpayers pay 30c in the dollar or less, and to reduce the lowest tax scale so that the lowest income earners receive—proportionate to their income—the greatest benefit has been overwhelmingly well received by the Australian people. The only body of men and women in this country now standing in the way of every Australian taxpayer getting their tax cut is the Australian Labor Party. When you stand up in a moment, Senator Conroy, let me invite you to tell us and tell the Australian people on the broadcast: will you let them have their tax cut on 1 July or will you not?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget 2005-06</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,13,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-05-11,"—I always like to measure how the Treasurer is feeling about his hopes of becoming Prime Minister by what I call the ‘Brandis-ometer’: how perky is George today? Well, he is pretty perky today, so they must be feeling pretty good in the Costello camp.
—Senator Conroy, you should refer to senators in the chamber by their correct names.
—I accept your admonishment. What today’s debate is about is Senator Minchin’s responses, because if you look at independent commentary, as opposed to the propaganda that we have just heard and that we heard earlier today from Senator Minchin, we have a view of the budget that does not quite gel with some of the headlines and some of the boasts. Let us look at the Australian Financial Review’s editorial today. I want to read from it because it goes to the heart of the policy failure, the policy laziness, of this government. It starts:
Framing a good news budget while standing in a blizzard of revenue dollars isn’t all that hard. Taking tough decisions to make the economy more productive, resilient and able to deal with the future challenges of an ageing population amid fierce global competition for talent and capital is much harder. Treasurer Peter Costello seems to have been doing more of the former than the latter.
It goes on to say:
But when one looks for evidence that that Howard government is taking the opportunity to institute fundamental reform of the economy, it is scarce. The budget papers indicate $17 billion—before new spending and tax cuts—was added to estimates of tax revenues for fiscal 2006 between the last budget and this one. Most of this was whipped up by the boom in commodity prices, which boosted the forecast growth in nominal GDP to 7.5 per cent, more than twice the rate of real growth, and was reflected in booming company tax receipts.
The editorial continues:
The ad hoc nature of the budget, and the lack of unifying theme of structural reform, are consequences of its design being driven by the availability of money, and perhaps by the need to buff the Treasurer’s image before a leadership contest, rather than by the need for a long-term boost to productivity and economic participation.
Further on, it says:
Even so, after almost a decade in power the government still struggles to match the reform record of its Labor predecessors under Paul Keating and Bob Hawke.
How true a statement that is. For all the hype you are seeing today and the self-congratulating smirks from the Treasurer and from Minister Hill, it is clear. The editorial goes on to say:
The slowing world economy, yawning current account deficit and capacity constraints in the domestic economy, which have the Reserve Bank ready to raise interest rates again at any sign of inflation, strengthen the case for action. A budget which set out a coherent menu of tough supply-side reforms would enhance the legacy of Prime Minister John Howard and bolster the Treasurer’s credentials to succeed him.
Measured against that benchmark, this budget is another missed opportunity.
The editorial concludes by saying:
What’s missing is a broader reform agenda to reward hard work and innovation, encourage private capital and superannuation investment in infrastructure and unleash a burst of skills and productivity growth.
How true that is. What we have seen here is an internal contest and a government paralysed by its incapacity to actually stand up and make some tough decisions, to stand up and do something for the national interest—not for the Prime Minister’s interests and certainly not for the Treasurer’s interests.

Senator Ferris interjecting—

—Senator Ferris knows what some of this was really about, and she is very aware of the Treasurer’s desire to boost his stock in his attempts to undermine and knock off the Prime Minister. I know Senator Ferris will be standing side by side with the Prime Minister to repel the boarders when the Treasurer comes leaping out of the trenches. She will be there; she knows what the game is.
—Are you still with Latham?

This budget represents a failed opportunity to make progress on skills, training, productivity growth and lifting those infrastructure constraints identified by the OECD and the Reserve Bank.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2005-05-11,"—Now we have heard everything: Senator Conroy accusing the government of policy laziness!
—Paralysis as well.
—Paralysis, or whatever term you want to use, Senator Conroy. This is after the Labor Party’s last decade as a policy-free zone, reinforced only in the last week or two by his new leader, Mr Beazley, in his major address to the Sustaining Prosperity conference, when he said that he had had enough of reform and that he was not going to foster further reform within the Australian economy and the Australian community, completely ignored the fact, of course, that reform in Australia must be a continuous and ongoing process if we are to retain the very hard won international competitiveness that this country has achieved as a result of the Howard government’s policies and reform initiatives over the last nine years.
What the Labor Party are really smarting about today is the excellent reception that the Howard government’s 10th budget has received. This has completely wrong-footed them. In a knee-jerk reaction today, they have resorted to their old politics of envy, talking about the fact that higher income earners will gain greater tax cuts than lower income earners. The fact is that, as a consequence of nearly a decade of positive economic management by the Howard government and responsible policies which have enabled the government to deliver eight budget surpluses during that period, the economy has grown strongly and we now have the lowest unemployment rate that we have had in 28 years—a rate of about 5.1 per cent.
It is these factors that have laid the solid foundation for this budget’s key elements, which, importantly, are lower taxation, incentives for even more people to join the work force, and ensuring the long-term future sustainability of the economy despite Australia’s ageing population. The key to this is the strength of the Australian economy that has been generated under the Howard government’s policies, which have put more people in work. With more people in work, every person can pay lower taxes but still provide overall more sustainable revenue for the government to meet its programs than would be the case with fewer people in work paying higher taxes. As I say, that is the key feature of this budget.
Labor comes in here and says that the tax benefits are greater for higher income earners. As has already been said, it simply fails to understand the mathematics of a progressive tax system. People on higher incomes pay more tax, and they pay tax at a higher rate. Therefore, quite simply, if you are going to have any reduction in taxation, people on higher incomes are going to get a greater reduction in absolute dollar terms than people on lower incomes. But the important point to remember, as Senator Brandis said a few moments ago and as the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, said during question time, is that in overall terms higher income earners will continue to pay more tax, they will continue to pay it at a higher rate and, indeed, the percentage that they have received in terms of tax cuts will be much lower than the percentage that has been received by lower income earners. Low-income earners, over the life of this government, have had tax cuts of the order of 40 to 50 per cent; middle-income earners have had cuts of 20 per cent; and now higher income earners, in total, over the period of this government, have received tax cuts amounting to about 20 per cent.
The other important point to remember is that if you are a traditional two-parent, two-child family you do not actually pay, in net terms, any tax up to an income of $45,000 because the benefits that you receive from the government total more than the income tax that you will pay. So a family with two children on an income of up to $45,000 are net recipients of government benefits. Again, that is of particular assistance to low-income people.
Under the new tax regime, people with an income of $100,000 a year will still be paying about 30 per cent of their income in tax whereas those with an income of $50,000 will be paying 20 per cent, and those with an income of $30,000 will pay less than 16 per cent. In the other direction, if you have an income of $150,000 you will be paying 35 per cent of your income in tax. So that clearly demonstrates the way in which a progressive tax system has been retained under this system while giving tax cuts to provide greater incentives to make our economy more internationally competitive and to retain our young, talented people in Australia.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-05-11,"—I rise in particular to take note of the answer Senator Abetz gave to Senator Lees, who raised a very important issue in her question: what kind of support women, particularly single parents, were going to have in terms of being forced back into work when there are such shortages of child-care places. Of course, the minister then went on to explain the commitment to additional child-care places that were in the budget, but he refused to really confront the issues that Senator Lees raised. They were important issues. She asked about the skills shortages that we have in the child-care industry and the desperate shortage of workers who can actually take up and resource the additional child-care places to be provided. She talked about the places themselves. She asked about where and how child-care places could be created out of the ether. She asked about the infrastructure and she tried to raise, importantly, the issue of access and how single parents being asked to return to work and find jobs could be guaranteed additional child-care places in after school care when the kinds of part-time work available—if there is any available anywhere—do not provide flexibility.
Senator Abetz then derided Senator Lees’s comments and suggested that she was perpetuating some stereotypes about employers. But employers are trying to run their businesses too, and part of the issue about flexibility in child care and in balancing work and family is about the government providing, and acknowledging, the structures that are required to enable single parents to get back into the workplace. There is a need for flexibility and for child care that is offered over and above the traditional nine to five before and after school care—or seven to seven, because, if you are lucky, in some cases you can get after school care like that.
Senator Lees also tried to raise the serious issue of where the jobs are for working single parents. Many of those jobs are in unskilled areas. These are the women who will be going back to pack supermarket shelves. That does not happen between seven and seven. People like you, Mr Deputy President, who understand the retail industry know that those kinds of things happen in the wee small hours of the morning and late into the night. There did not seem to be any kind of understanding by the minister about what the real pressures are when women are being forced back into the workplace.
I move on to the whole issue of the budget. Mr Costello did have a great opportunity in this budget last night. He could have, and he should have, introduced real taxation reform. He had the opportunity to do that in 2004 as well but he wasted it, preferring to hand out tax cuts as a sweetener to win the election. Now we have seen that he has done it again. If the tax cuts from last year’s budget were added to the tax cuts that he announced last night, we could easily have $100 billion over four years. What an opportunity for real reform that would have afforded this country. Yet the Howard government has taken an easy approach, just pushing the top tax threshold out to $125,000 and giving an effective top rate of 43.5 per cent to most taxpayers. It was, despite Senator Chapman’s protestations, a very policy lazy approach. It really was such a disappointing budget. It was a lost opportunity for Australia. It had no vision and no strategy. There was nothing in the budget about capacity building or nation building. There were lots of sticks and not too many carrots to enable us to move beyond the next election. Many of the commentators have said that this budget was really about Mr Costello’s next election as the Prime Minister in waiting—he hopes—with Treasurer Downer there beside him. But the Australian people are left with something that goes nowhere near addressing record current account deficits and foreign debt—nothing that actually looks at our infrastructure needs, nothing that looks at the future of this country.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-05-11,"—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Nettle moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 128.
The Greens believe that the Senate has no choice today but to censure Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, as the Australian public demand that some responsibility be taken for the series of scandals that have surfaced from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the government’s and the minister’s disgraceful handling of these scandals. The Australian public have been truly shocked by the revelations about our detention and deportation regime. They are horrified that an Australian government could treat any human being like Cornelia Rau or Vivian Alvarez, let alone that it would treat fellow Australians in this way.
The inhumanity and the incompetence that these scandals reveal must be dealt with in a way that gives the Australian public confidence that they know the truth about what happened and that they can have confidence that these scandals will not be repeated. The minister has failed to meet this public need. The minister tries instead to hide her responsibilities behind the private closed-door Palmer inquiry. She has repeatedly said that what the public are interested in and what is in the public interest are two different things. The minister is wrong. The public have a right to know whether the department of immigration is operating within the law and by acceptable standards and whether it is respecting human rights and dignity.
On 9 February the Senate passed a motion calling for a full, open and transparent judicial inquiry to investigate the Cornelia Rau scandal. The minister failed to heed this call, instead establishing the private Palmer inquiry. Since then, scandal after scandal has been revealed, and these snowballing events indicate systemic and institutional problems and failures with the government’s policy and the minister’s department. The Palmer inquiry does not have the powers and the resources to be able to conduct an adequate investigation. A royal commission is a necessity, and everyone but the government is calling for a royal commission. Malcolm Fraser recently said that the minister’s head would have rolled in his day. He said that the immigration minister would have had to resign. However, this government is notorious for failing to be held accountable. Its leader has made an art form of denying responsibility for his government’s actions and even his own words.
This censure motion should put the minister and the government on notice that the Australian public is quickly losing its patience. Hiding behind the Palmer inquiry rather than providing answers to the public is cowardly and results in a further loss of credibility. It is not acceptable for the minister to palm off her ministerial responsibilities to an inquiry that is closed to the public. The minister’s answers to questions during a recent Lateline interview make you wonder whether she is either unaware of what is going on in her department or avoiding giving answers to the public in order to avoid taking responsibility.
The more that Australians find out about what is going on inside our detention centres and how asylum seekers are being treated, the more they are appalled. They are not only appalled at the inhumanity and cruelty of mandatory detention but also appalled at their interactions with the department and the obstinate and unresponsive attitude that they find within the department of immigration. My office consistently receives more correspondence from Australians concerned about the practices of the department of immigration than any other issue. The more they learn about the operations of the department and the minister, the more enraged they become. Those who know the system well go further than to just be appalled; they consider the behaviour of this government as criminal. In February last year Julian Burnside QC said:
If moral arguments have no purchase, it remains the fact that our government is engaged in a continuing crime against humanity when assessed against its own legislative standards. I accuse Mr Howard and Mr Ruddock of that crime. I accuse Senator Vanstone of that crime. I expect that they will ignore this accusation, since the only person who can bring charges is the Attorney General of the Commonwealth.
Julian Burnside has been proven correct. The government is today continuing to ignore accusations that have been made against the government and the clear prima facie case of the scandals in which the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has been engaged. But today the Senate has an opportunity to censure the minister responsible, and I urge my fellow senators to take this course of action.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-05-11,"—On behalf of the government, I indicate that we oppose this motion that Senator Nettle has put forward. Having previously been Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for three years, I, more than many in this chamber, know of the challenges that face all of the officers working within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The vast majority of those officers go beyond the call of duty in serving the Australian public when doing their work within the immigration department.
Senator Vanstone has indicated to me that she is determined to get to the bottom of this issue by getting the facts. She has advised me that the facts will be made public. She has also indicated that she will not be making judgments on culpability until the facts are there. With regard to the two cases that have attracted significant public attention, I have been advised that neither of these people were asylum seekers. As I said before, the immigration department, in the vast majority of cases, does a very good job. But you heard Senator Vanstone say here in this chamber in an answer to a question yesterday that she is not happy with what has happened and she wants to get to the bottom of the facts. But there are some facts that are clear: the events happened in 2001 when Senator Vanstone was not the minister and the results of a judicial inquiry will not be available for a considerable time.
I believe that Senator Nettle’s motion is a travesty of the process. Without any key facts being determined, you are casting blame. I think it is appropriate to wait. We have a very senior former public servant inquiring into this issue. He has indicated to Senator Vanstone that he has had all the cooperation he has required in undertaking this inquiry, and Senator Vanstone has indicated publicly that he has been offered any assistance and any resources he needs in undertaking the inquiry. I think the Senate deserves better than this. You could at least wait until Mr Palmer has completed the inquiry.
Statistics give lie to a claim that Senator Nettle makes in paragraph (b) of the censure motion. The 9,000 unauthorised boat arrivals released from detention, on average, received visas within 18 weeks of applying for protection. Processing has been timely, urgent and with the full awareness of Australia’s international obligations under the 1951 treaty. I am advised that there is no international obligation to monitor the safety of people who are removed from Australia. The obligation to check whether they face persecution is before they are removed. The obligation is there and the government adheres to that obligation.
I am very much of the opinion that this censure motion is premature. I think it is appropriate to wait until we get the results of the Palmer inquiry and consider Senator Vanstone’s response. This motion is not only premature but also totally inappropriate. I think you will be found to have acted prematurely. You will never have the opportunity to be a minister in a very difficult portfolio. Having been, as I said, parliamentary secretary to Minister Ruddock, I believe that the immigration portfolio would have to be one of the most difficult portfolios, particularly in ensuring that everyone is treated appropriately. In a couple of these cases people have given false information. They have not given their real name and have indicated that they have no family. They have given information which is not true with regard to their particular circumstance, and it is very difficult for officers to second-guess the truth.
If you had been in the position of seeing the incredibly difficult decisions that have to be made, you would realise that this motion is incredibly premature—and, as I said, it will be found to be totally inappropriate. The coalition do not support the motion. We do not agree with it. We believe it is appropriate to wait until Mr Palmer’s report is here. Senator Vanstone has indicated that she will make the facts available. The Senate should give Senator Vanstone credit until the report is here. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-11,"—We are not debating the censure motion proper at this time; we are debating whether we should suspend standing orders in order to deal with the motion. Labor supports the suspension of standing orders so that the motion can be properly dealt with. A censure motion is not lightly moved in this chamber. It is a serious motion and should be taken seriously. The matter in the motion is serious and calls for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to be censured. The facts and issues surrounding this matter are required to be dealt with now. The minister has had ample opportunity.
My records go back to where the Senate dealt with a motion in this house on 8 February 2005 which related to Ms Rau. Since the case of Ms Rau, Labor have had the opportunity presented by estimates, where we pursued the issue. We spent a considerable amount of time on that issue. We were told about a range of issues and given a range of material at estimates. However, subsequent to that, we have found that there are more cases. The figures are said to amount to 33 or more—we do not know; Senator Vanstone has not been forthcoming about that. We do not know about some of the issues that surround it more fully. It appears that, having set up the Palmer inquiry, the minister has maintained what I would suggest is a separation from the department. Our ability to find out information seems now to be confined to Mr Palmer finding it out and Mr Palmer at some point giving a report or making recommendations, we are told. I am unclear as to whether the report in full and the recommendations that might come from that will be made public. I am unclear in some respects as to the process that Mr Palmer will undertake in investigating these circumstances. I am unsure of when he will report to the minister and when the minister will then make those matters public.
So there are a range of unanswered questions in this debate. This is the opportunity for that debate to be had. In this instance, the minister has failed to adequately deal with the issue in the sensible and pragmatic way you would expect of a minister of the Crown. You would expect the minister to be able to answer the questions that are required, deal with them in a sensible way and provide information to this house about how these issues should be progressed. In this instance, in Labor’s opinion, there has been a failure in dealing with it on the part of the minister. We will support the suspension so that this motion can be adequately dealt with.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-05-11,"—This is a very serious motion about a very serious matter. A minister should never take on a portfolio without believing they are well equipped to handle it, having the ability to get across it and wanting to take it on. It is not something that is put onto an individual; it is something that is taken on as a responsibility—it is a very high office. This motion is not about the bureaucracy; it is about the competence of the minister handling a series of extraordinary inhumanities that have occurred at the behest of this government.
Let us look at the background of it too. This motion is not simply about some individuals who have fallen foul of government custody in a most grievous way. It is about a set-up which was deliberated upon by this government—it may have preceded them but it has been enhanced by this government—whereby warm-blooded human beings are transported to immigration centres which have no place in Australian society and which breach a number of international laws and, I submit, the ethics of this country. The case of Ms Vivian Alvarez, on the face of it, involves the extradition to another country of an Australian citizen, who had a child in this country, in a way that defies the standards of humanity we expect in our democratic society.
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has to take responsibility for those matters, but Senator Nettle is quite right: the minister has repeatedly been saying, ‘I don’t know about that,’ or, ‘Wait until the Palmer inquiry has deliberated.’ The Greens always did want a judicial inquiry here, not a government appointed inquiry meeting outside the reach of this Senate and, indeed, the public. It is not acceptable as far as I am concerned for a minister to simply say on matters like this, ‘I’m not going to give information,’ or, ‘I’m not dealing with it because there is some inquiry that I have appointed which is dealing with it.’ The minister remains responsible. It is her failure to take on that responsibility that gives power to the argument that should see this motion supported.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-05-11,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to place on record our support for the suspension of standing orders. Indeed, we support the censure motion. In relation to the issue of suspension, like the opposition and the Greens, we believe that, if there were ever a time for an urgent debate on an issue regarding immigration policies or deportation specifically, it is now.
As the motion which I hope will be debated states, and as other senators have contributed, we are talking about possibly 33 people who have been wrongfully detained and we have got at least one Australian citizen wrongfully deported. If that is not a travesty of justice then I do not know what is. So when the minister on duty, the Minister for Family and Community Services, talks about a travesty of procedure taking place in the Senate today she is very wrong: it is a travesty of justice that this system has thrown up and has allowed.
The minister on duty also suggested that this seeks to blame. What this seeks to do is sheet home responsibility. In our system, whether you call it Westminster or ‘Washminster’, the minister takes responsibility for muck-ups. This is a mighty ministerial muck-up, or bureaucratic bungling of extraordinary proportions, and I do not think Australian citizens are prepared to put up with this being swept under the carpet. I think they want an open, accountable debate and I think they want it now. In fact I am surprised that we did not have it yesterday—except that obviously notice needs to be given in this place.
The Democrats, like all Australian citizens, have been appalled by the Cornelia Rau case. We accept that it is right for the government to inquire into what has happened in that case. I think it is more appropriate that it is an open, transparent and more accountable inquiry, but we have been prepared to wait and see what the government comes back to the Senate and the Australian people with regarding that case. But now we have a new case, one that is truly even more horrific, if that is possible. For that reason, we think it is time now to not only investigate outstanding cases but to find out what happened in these two cases affecting Australian citizens. Having said that, I want to make it very clear on record that, while those cases horrify us, we must remember that every day asylum seekers in detention are subject to the same brutal and inhumane treatment. The system is set up for travesties, it is set up for tragedies. To go there is to suffer; to visit them is to be ashamed. People are driven mad, they try to harm themselves, they lose any sense of reality, they become physically ill. They experience the disintegration of their personalities. They fear that they will never know human life or freedom again. They face the will of the guards, in some cases, the department and, indeed, the minister, and that is why she should be responsible on behalf of this government when humanity is not observed or bureaucratic bungling takes place.
The two Australian citizens’ cases with which we are dealing—and which the minister should take responsibility for—are two more horrendous examples of a careless humanity that comes with this immigration policy, and detention centre policy, in particular, from this government. I think, once and for all, we need to acknowledge as a parliament, as a community, that detention centres and this particular policy are incompatible with basic human rights. If we want to be able to hold our heads up among the nations of the world, then we should be dismantling the system. But the least we can do today is to approve this suspension of standing orders and have this censure debate, because it is high time. If ever there was a time for an urgent debate about immigration policy, you would think it would be when we had deported one of our own citizens three days after a car accident and with a question of mental illness hanging over that citizen. I think it is absolutely extraordinary that we are not suspending the entire parliament for the purpose of dealing with this issue. On behalf of my party, I strongly support the motion for suspension currently before us.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Nettle’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-05-11,"—I move general business notice of motion No. 128, standing in my name for today:
That the Senate censures the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Vanstone) for her failure to:
instigate a full judicial public inquiry into the manifest failure of her department to fulfil its duty of care to those in its responsibility;
manage the timely and humane processing of asylum seekers;
abide by the letter and spirit of the international conventions relating to the treatment of children;
admit responsibility for the wrongful detention of at least 33 people and the illegal deportation of at least one Australian citizen;
take any steps to monitor the safety of asylum seekers deported from Australia by her department; and
take her accountability responsibilities seriously.
I have already outlined the reasons why the Greens are putting up this motion, but I will continue with some more remarks on this issue. Before I do that, I will comment on the contribution we had from the minister on duty during the suspension of standing orders debate. Senator Patterson got up and gave what she perhaps thought was an excuse for why Senator Vanstone behaved the way she behaved. The excuse that Senator Patterson provided for the chamber was: ‘It is a hard job.’ That is not an excuse for the failings of the minister and the department of immigration.
The Senate may be interested to know that it is a hard job being a detainee who is locked up for four, five or six years behind razor wire fences in a detention centre in the desert of this country. It is a hard job being an Australian citizen who is deported to another country, with your child left in this country and your family not told. It is a hard job being an Australian permanent resident with a mental illness, spending 10 months locked up in a detention centre and not being able to access appropriate treatment for your mental illness. It is a hard job being a detainee with a mental illness in Baxter detention centre, seeking psychiatric treatment for your mental illness and having to go to court eight times whilst the federal government spends $159,000 in legal costs in order to argue that you should not have appropriate psychiatric treatment. It is a hard job being born in a detention centre and spending your third birthday in a detention centre, having child psychiatrists come and see you and assess the impact on your mental health of having being born and spent all of your life, including your third birthday, locked up inside a detention centre, not being allowed to go to a child-care centre outside of the Villawood detention centre to spend some time engaging with other people. Spending all of your life locked up: that is a hard job.
All of those instances that I describe—and there are many, many more—are at the hands of the minister for immigration, Senator Vanstone. She needs to take responsibility for her actions. This is an issue, as we have seen, that so many Australians across this country are absolutely appalled at. The letters pages of our newspapers are filled on this issue. I noticed that the issue most talked about in the Australian is the deportation of the Australian citizen Vivian Alvarez.
We have seen the distress that is caused to the families involved by the actions of this minister’s department. We saw on Lateline last night an interview with a sister of Vivian Alvarez. We saw on Lateline the night before an interview with the brother of Vivian Alvarez. We have seen the distress that has been caused to these families. Many of us have seen and read the interviews with Christine Rau—the sister of Cornelia Rau—in which she has spoken about the distress caused to her family. All of them have spoken about the distress caused when the federal government and the minister have not acted responsibly and called for a public inquiry into these issues. There is a need for an inquiry to be public. The question being raised by critics is not about the capacity of Mr Palmer to carry out the inquiry; it is about the requirement that the public have confidence in the ability of the minister and the department to do their jobs and carry out their responsibilities lawfully.
If an inquiry occurs behind closed doors, with no capacity for the public to understand what is going on, then the public cannot have confidence in it. That is not to question the work of Mick Palmer; it is to question an inquiry that is behind closed doors. It is right that the public continue to question these ideas. A couple of weeks ago I had lunch with a man who had just been released from Baxter detention centre. He had spent 4½ years in Baxter detention centre. He is the same person who, 4½ years ago when he arrived in Australia, was told, ‘You are not a genuine refugee.’ He is the same person who, 4½ years later, all of a sudden is a genuine refugee.
It is right that the public ask questions about why this has occurred. Why has it taken 4½ years for the government, the minister and the department to recognise that this gentleman is a genuine refugee? He also happens to be somebody who has worked for seven years as a fitter and turner, and I suspect he has something to contribute to the skills shortage that we are currently facing in this country. But the issue today is the fact that he was locked up in detention for 4½ years and only after that was he found to be a genuine refugee. Why was he not found to be a genuine refugee 4½ years ago?
Another issue raised in the motion that we are debating today is the international conventions about the treatment of children, to which Australia is a signatory. I read in the newspaper today that, since 1999—if I recall the numbers correctly—3,899 children have been detained in Australian immigration detention centres. I recall that number, because I was absolutely appalled when I read that in the newspaper today.
A Federal Court ruling occurred, I think, just last week in which the judge found that the government had failed in its duty of care to people with a mental illness locked up in immigration detention centres. It was a case that revolved around two Iranian men who were in the Baxter detention centre. They are currently in Glenside psychiatric hospital in Adelaide. I note that the minister, when she was in here for question time on Tuesday, said that she had not read the judgment. It is a judgment well worth reading from Federal Court judge Justice Finn about the way in which the government has failed to meet its duty of care to detainees who have a mental illness who are in immigration detention centres.
I want to mention the story of Naomi Leong that has appalled so many Australians. Naomi Leong recently celebrated—if that is the appropriate word; I do not think it is—her third birthday inside the Villawood detention centre. The story of Naomi—somebody whom I have visited on many occasions—and her mother was on the front of Saturday’s Sydney Morning Herald, in which Virginia, Naomi’s mother, talked about how she is staying alive for the purpose of her daughter being able to have some hope and some faith. She talked about being in this detention centre and having her three-year-old daughter saying to her, ‘When can we go home, Mum?’
What is she supposed to say in response to her three-year-old daughter, who has only ever known life in a detention centre, when she says to her, ‘Mum, when can we go home?’ Does this government and this minister want to be responsible for a situation which sees instances like this occurring? After that story appeared on the front page of the newspaper, letters poured in from the Australian public. People were simply appalled at the actions of this department and this minister that have resulted in that situation occurring for Naomi and Virginia. The minister has failed to accept responsibility for these occurrences. She has failed to instigate the public inquiry that the Senate called for on 9 February this year so that the public could have confidence in the minister’s capacity to do her job.
Just yesterday an Iranian asylum seeker was taken from Baxter detention centre, and the understanding of the people who were visiting him at the time was that he was to be deported to Iran. He was flown to Sydney. I am not 100 per cent up to date with what has occurred with respect to the gentleman. I understand from radio reports yesterday that he is also another example of a long-term detainee with a mental illness.
I have been to many conferences held by mental health professionals—as I am sure many other senators here have—at which they talk about mental health problems that detainees, particularly long-term detainees, experience in our detention centres. We see several of these cases before the courts regarding whether in fact the process of detaining people in immigration detention centres is resulting in and adding to the mental distress that these detainees are facing.
Mental health professionals cry out again and again about the kinds of assessments that they are not allowed to make because they are refused entry into immigration detention centres when they have the capacity to meet with detainees. For example, they have court orders that say detainees are able to be given psychiatric assessment.
We as a country should never have to watch this occurring. We now have a minister who, in the face of the recent scandals that have come to light, is absolutely failing to accept responsibility. What is required is an open, public, full judicial inquiry. But the minister has failed to provide the public with that opportunity so that they can have confidence in her capacity and the capacity of her department to do their job. We in this Senate are forced into a situation now where, the Greens believe, we have no choice but to censure this minister because she has failed in her responsibilities to the Australian public. I commend this motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-05-11,"—I was not present during Senator Nettle’s earlier contribution or that of Senator Patterson, but it seems to me that, in looking at this issue and the motion that has been moved by Senator Nettle, there is a fundamental starting point here, and that is that everyone who has taken an interest in the plight of Ms Alvarez genuinely regrets that, plainly—as Senator Vanstone has said publicly in relation to how the matter was handled—something went wrong. That is not really in issue. What is in issue is what should be done about it. The context that is set up in the motion appears to be: what process will adequately and thoroughly ventilate the circumstances in which this matter arose in a way that deals with the sensitivities of the private aspects of the particular person involved? It is a matter of her privacy and that of not only her immediate family but, as I understand it, her former husband. So the real question here is not that there is any dispute about the need to get some facts but what will be the process through which there will be some fact gathering and checking as to how this matter arose.
Senator Vanstone has, in my view quite rightly, identified widening the remit of Mr Palmer’s inquiry as a thoroughly appropriate and adequate way to deal with this matter that acknowledges—and I do not think Senator Nettle disputes this—the fact that Mr Palmer is a very competent person and that his capabilities are not in question. That has not been in issue in the comments that have been advanced in support of the motion. So if he is a competent and appropriate person to undertake this sort of inquiry, no case has been made at all to suggest that he would other than adequately, appropriately, honestly, genuinely and completely investigate the particular facts and do it in such a way that the facts can then be made publicly available. My understanding is that Senator Vanstone said they would be. It is very important that we establish the facts so that we all know what one might say about the department or indeed the minister. So Mr Palmer is certainly an appropriate person to undertake this kind of inquiry, and nobody has suggested that they should not have confidence in Mr Palmer’s capability to undertake this task.
The second part of the proposition as to what should be done, what process should be adopted, is to look at what Senator Nettle and some others have proposed as a more appropriate way to deal with the fact gathering that will enable us all to be informed about the issues involving Ms Alvarez. It is put forward that the process will be appropriate only if there is ‘a full judicial, public inquiry’ not into the particular facts of this case but into ‘the manifest failure’ of Senator Vanstone’s department to ‘fulfil its duty of care to those in its responsibility’. That is a proposition that, quite frankly, cannot be advanced at this stage, because the facts are not known. That is something that the minister has very fairly and squarely put on the record. We do not know the facts, so we could not possibly seriously support a motion that has wrapped up in it some admonition of anyone until we can work out where the facts stand in relation to that matter.
The rest of Senator Nettle’s motion is infected with the same problem. It is not only emotive but also based on a set of assumptions, suppositions and hypotheticals that simply are not rooted in the facts that would enable such a motion to be fairly and squarely put on its merits and passed by the Senate. There is no dispute that the department abides by the letter and spirit of the international conventions relating to the treatment of children. That the department should be admitting ‘responsibility for the wrongful detention of at least 33 people and the illegal deportation of at least one Australian citizen’ is really not warranted. The kinds of assumptions that have been built into the motion are entirely inappropriate, until you have some facts to sit it on, as Senator Nettle should know. This is a chamber to debate a number of matters in which a number of judgments and conclusions can be made. Inferences can be drawn and criticisms can be made, but I think most senators—certainly those who are fair minded—wish to base those kinds of assumptions and criticisms, and something as critical as a censure motion of a minister, on some facts.
It is important that the Senate does not prejudge what went on here under the guise of censuring the minister. If the minister, for instance, were not acknowledging the fact that something went wrong, if she were not acknowledging that there was a need to get some facts, if she did not have in place a process to properly identify what the facts are, and if she had said that she was going to withhold the facts, there might be some basis to be critical of the minister. But in fact, by the letter, in terms of her ministerial responsibility, she has acknowledged that something went wrong. She has said that there is a necessity to get the facts and deal with the facts. She has a process in place and a competent and capable person—who is not being criticised for their capability—to look at those facts. Quite rightly, Minister Vanstone says, ‘Let’s get the facts before we jump to further conclusions and set in train a whole lot of processes that may not be appropriate for the particular person involved.’ A full, public judicial inquiry may be about the last thing that will assist the future wellbeing of this particular individual. We simply do not know whether or not that process would assist her, and in my view it is certainly not something that any senators who think about this for a moment would agree to.
I want to make just a couple more points. My clear understanding, from what has been said on the public record, is that the matters relating to the circumstances of Ms Cornelia Rau and certainly Ms Alvarez were not such as to put them into the category of being dealt with as asylum seekers, yet the motion seems to assume that they were. It is certainly trying, through the guise of the treatment of Ms Rau and Ms Alvarez, to make implications that relate to asylum seekers. My fundamental point is that we as a Senate could not seriously censure a minister who is honestly going about her job in finding out the facts and dealing with something in an appropriate and accountable way, as we all are. Any minister of the Crown is clearly accountable when something goes wrong, and Senator Vanstone has assumed that responsibility—she has assumed it up-front and she has assumed it in an appropriate way. This is certainly a motion that I would urge the Senate not to support.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-11,"—We have a motion that has been opposed twice by the government for this debate to go ahead. This is a government that does not want to have this debate. That is the truth of the matter. It has vigorously opposed it twice. We have had two divisions to prevent this debate coming on. This is a censure motion. This is about ministerial responsibility. In this instance, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has clearly failed in her duty.
When you look at the issue more closely, you see that it cuts right across portfolios and points to a massive systemic failure in government, starting at DIMIA and ending at the point where the minister must take responsibility for the actions of her department. She may have won out, in that she was not the only minister during the period, but at this point in time she has not pointed the finger at her colleague and I can only assume that the buck stops with Senator Vanstone. Since the start, Labor has consistently called for an open, transparent judicial inquiry to examine the issues involved in the Cornelia Rau matter. That motion started before Christmas 2004. On the basis that this was a one-off case, Labor was prepared to suspend judgment and give Mr Palmer the benefit of our considerable doubt and wait until the report was handed down before deciding what our course of action should be.
One of the new cases in particular—and I think we have discussed that not only at question time but here today and in other places, and it has been in the media—has raised that much of an issue that it needs to be dealt with here and the minister should take responsibility. The government has deported an Australian citizen. That is the simple truth of it. That should not happen. More than that, it must not happen, it cannot happen, but it has happened. It is clear that the Howard government now has a massive case to answer and the Palmer inquiry does not fit the bill.
The concerns Labor have identified were the obvious and inherent flaws that were written into the inquiry by Senator Vanstone. Is justice being done for Cornelia Rau or on the other matters that have been referred to Mr Palmer or his inquiry since then? We do not know because of the shroud of secrecy over the proceedings. Why was the inquiry date extended? What will the end date be? Will the transcripts—if there are transcripts—the witness numbers, their positions and the issues that have been examined be made public? Will the report in total be made public? We are led to understand that the recommendations will be made public. Will the minister stand by that and make them public?
When you have the type of inquiry that has been started, you have to come to a point where you say, ‘Is it still appropriate to continue with this type of inquiry?’ I think we have reached the crossroad where you can safely say, ‘No, this inquiry is no longer the appropriate course to be taken.’ The minister has had an opportunity to make a decision, call for a royal commission and deal with it, but she has not. She has failed in her duty.
The problem with the Palmer inquiry, which has been addressed by a number of speakers, is that there are no judicial powers. It seems to me that you end up with Lady Justice with one arm tied behind her back. There is no power to compel witnesses to attend, there are no sworn oaths and the testimony that is given is unprotected. Mr Palmer is not even able to compel the production of documents or other evidence. We know about the tragedy of the Cornelia Rau case and the ongoing effects that has had. What we do not know is the final tragedy that might befall anyone else who has been caught in this process. Their names may not have come out yet and their circumstances may not have been demonstrated or aired.
We know of one other who has been deported under very sad circumstances. We do not know the final story in respect of that issue. Cornelia Rau has become a cipher for possibly hundreds of victims of a very sick system. There are others like Cornelia Rau who were lawfully residing here and who were locked up, like the ill Australian mother who was deported to the Philippines, whom I have spoken about, leaving behind a young child. We should reflect on that for a moment and ask, ‘Does that require a royal commission?’ I think the answer is simply yes. The minister has failed in her duty to appreciate the scale of the issue before her. We do not know whether that child will ever see his mother again. Then there are the mentally ill detainees denied access to psychiatric assistance. There is the failure to conduct the most basic of missing persons checks, it seems.
Cornelia Rau’s case has become the symbol of everything that is wrong with this government’s administration of the immigration system. It is undeniable that much of this could have been avoided or, at worst, come to light earlier if the Liberal government had adopted Labor’s policy initiative of an inspector general of immigration detention but they did not. They had the opportunity to make changes to their system but did not. They have had the opportunity to try to correct the system to provide an open, transparent system so that the public can understand what has gone on. They have not acted. Labor’s spokesman for immigration, Laurie Ferguson, has correctly made the point that the only way we are now going to get a full and thorough investigation is through a royal commission. The extent of the failure is now beyond the scope of anything less. It is beyond the scope of the Palmer inquiry. A royal commission is required, and the minister should act.
Let me make it clear that it is not just the detainees and the Australian public who have been failed by Senator Vanstone. The staff on the ground in DIMIA are also left out on a limb. DIMIA staff have been placed in the unenviable position of enforcing some of the worst policy I have seen. They have to make this madcap system work, and it is becoming increasing clear that they have not been given correct advice with which to operate. The law is clear enough; it has been adequately defined by the Federal Court. In the case of VHAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002], Justice Gray said:
... s. 189 of the Migration Act provides no authority for the continued detention of a lawful non-citizen.
How is it then that the government has not acted on that clarification and ensured that, even at the level of basic administration, migration series instruction No. 321, which in layman’s terms is the handbook for officers, is in accordance with the law? That handbook does not provide guidance for officials on the different standards for initial and ongoing detention, explained by the Federal Court in Goldie, VHAF and VFAD. It seems to be silent on those matters. It should speak volumes about what their role is. In one sense that is not surprising. Since March 2005 the federal government’s lawyers have been arguing in the High Court that a reasonable suspicion that a person was unlawful justified, indeed required, continued immigration detention. From that it appears that the immigration minister, through her lawyers, is still arguing a case that objectively is over. Objectively, they have lost that argument but they are going to run it up to the High Court. We will see what comes of that.
Nevertheless the Federal Court stipulated in clear language in 2002 and 2003 that a mere suspicion, however reasonable, was not sufficient to authorise ongoing detention under section 196 of the Migration Act. Unless the High Court overturns that position, it will be the Federal Court’s interpretation that stays with us. That will be used in any case alleging unlawful detention by immigration authorities. A vigilant minister would ensure that her departmental officers had access to the latest and best advice.
What I am going through carefully is not only the systemic failure but also the minister’s failure. It explains why Labor is supporting the censure motion. It is not simply the inability to have an open judicial inquiry; it is the inability of the minister to deal with the issues at hand—to deal adequately with the Cornelia Rau matter and with how the immigration detention centre is dealt with at law when you look at what is required to be dealt with, which may have contributed to avoiding at least some of these matters. Instead, as to departmental advice and the lack of updates and information, we find ourselves dealing with the types of situations in which Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez found themselves.
As I said earlier, I do not blame Senator Vanstone entirely for this. Many of these administrative time bombs were left behind by her predecessor, Mr Ruddock, but they will continue to blow up in Senator Vanstone’s face until light is brought to every corner of the immigration department to expose them, and that is something that only the power of a royal commission can do. Perhaps Senator Vanstone is protecting not only herself but also Mr Ruddock—I do not know—but a royal commission will certainly find where the light is.
However, Senator Vanstone by no means gets off scot-free. That is not to say that she can sheet it all home to Mr Ruddock. It was Senator Vanstone who, as Minister for Justice and Customs, failed the Australian community by terminating the National Missing Persons Unit and failed CrimTrac by simply forgetting to include missing persons in their list of objectives—issues that they should have had in their system. Now we hear that not only Cornelia Rau but also Ms Alvarez was on the missing persons list. Where is the national missing persons database, Minister? Where is it? The Liberals took over the national missing persons bureau in 1996 but it was Minister Vanstone who effectively shut it down. That body was tasked with building a national missing persons database. The bureau has gone and so has the database.
I am convinced that, if there were a single national missing person’s unit like the one Labor—and particularly the then minister, Duncan Kerr—began to build under the Keating government, neither of these sorry cases might have occurred. What is needed is a broad, open and transparent investigation, along with a real commitment by the Howard government to in fact admit its errors and not simply say, ‘We’ll objectively look into it.’ Instead, what we heard from the minister the other night was this:
Mr Palmer has the authority to refer both to the secretary of the department for any Public Service Act matters that might need to be looked into, in terms of disciplinary action under the Public Service Act, and he has the power to make reference of any such matters to any other appropriate authorities. I have great confidence that Mr Palmer will do that if he thinks that’s appropriate.
With respect to Mr Bill Farmer from DIMIA, there is a massive conflict of interest here. The person receiving the report will be the very same person who decides whether disciplinary charges will be laid.
Anyone with in an interest in accountable government cannot simply stand by and watch this happen. There are processes that should be put in place. We have argued and called for those so that the situation can be clarified. Those processes are needed so that the public can be assured of the integrity of the Public Service and the minister responsible. I call on all government members with good conscience to take a stand, if not in the parliament then in the party room. Force a little discipline on your colleagues.
Senator Vanstone can make amends by opening a royal commission on this matter with terms that are broad enough to cover the failings that have been identified to date. Providing there is enough information and cooperation, we might be able to get to the bottom of some of these issues. So far—at least, this is how it appears from the opposition side—Senator Vanstone has not provided sufficient information to the parliament about what has in fact gone on. Those are the reasons why this censure motion should be taken seriously. It is a serious motion and the minister should heed it. The opposition, as I have said, supports the motion.
When the Cornelia Rau scandal first broke, the government, and particularly the minister, gave this parliament the assurance that a full investigation would take place. But, as I have said, it has turned into an investigation behind closed doors. We may never know what went on, what was asked and what was not asked in those sessions. We do not know whether the minister’s office has cooperated. We do not know whether the minister’s office has opened its doors to provide information. We do not know whether the minister has provided information. We do not know whether the advisers have provided information. All of that information could help sort out what went wrong in these cases.
The opposition has no faith in the current inquiry and neither should the people of Australia. The Palmer inquiry is nothing but a convenient smokescreen behind which the minister and her department can continue to work without being held accountable for anything. An interim report on the matter was due in March. We are now in May and nothing has come of the closed inquiry. We have heard, and the media has covered, many shocking allegations. To date, there have been a number of issues aired on television in relation to Ms Rau. It appears she was locked up in an isolation management unit, for want of a better name, more than once. The Alvarez incident should be examined openly so that we can know what happened and why an Australian got deported. I do not think you can cavil with it.
This government wants to argue about it. It wants to roll up in a little ball like a porcupine and try to fend it off, rather than deal with it like an accountable government would: in an open and transparent way. We are appalled to hear the answers that have been given by this government. The government is protecting itself rather than looking at the individuals who are concerned and asking: ‘What do we need to do to protect them? What do we need to do to prevent the system doing this to others? If the system has transgressed, what do we do to correct it?’ Any confidence in the answers to those questions can now only come from a royal commission. What might have been if the minister had acted quickly, effectively and efficiently earlier is gone. The government should accept that we have moved on from that point.
There is a nine-year-old sitting in foster care. Ask him when he is 20, 25 and 30 what his view of this government is. I could hazard a guess, but I will not. Surely the government can do better than tack that case on as a reference of a closed door inquiry. But that is exactly what it has done. That is a shameful action. Ms Alvarez was reportedly involved in a car accident several days before coming to the attention of DIMIA. I am not going to speculate as to the circumstances that confronted DIMIA with regard to this case; nor should Mr Palmer have to speculate about it. A royal commission could do more than that: it could find the answers which might not be found by other means. A royal commission could ensure that justice is not only done but seen to be done.
Does the fact that someone from the department knew about her deportation—if the report of that is right—lead to the minister’s office? I do not know and I am not going to speculate about it. But it is no doubt a very serious matter, especially if the department knew about her deportation two years ago. Who in the department knew? What was done? If nothing was done, then you are looking at a systemic failure, because an Australian was deported. If something was done, we need to know what remedial action was in fact undertaken, because it is, as I have said, a serious matter.
The minister’s constant refusal to answer any proper questions on this matter—saying on Lateline that she cannot comment because ‘she does not have the files in front of her’; that is the quote—is just not good enough. Surely something as devastating as this would be imprinted on her mind. It certainly would be on mine, particularly given that there is a young child being held in foster care. And the minister said, ‘The files aren’t before me,’ on Lateline. The minister has been told, advised and briefed by her department. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-05-11,"—The government recognises that this is an incendiary matter. The performance of Minister Vanstone on things that have gone wrong during her term in office is clearly underscored by the fact that the Prime Minister—who can ever forget him; for so long he has refused and continues to refuse to say sorry to the stolen generation of the first Australians—has said he is sorry about the deportation of Vivian Alvarez, an Australian citizen. He told Southern Cross radio: ‘I am very sorry if anything unfairly has happened in relation to that. On the face of it that does appear to be the case.’ The Prime Minister recognises that something is seriously amiss, it is of national significance and the government is responsible. The minister in whose portfolio the matters we have been debating today have unfolded must take the responsibility.
The government minister who spoke for Senator Vanstone used the device of saying that Mr Palmer is carrying out an inquiry; who is going to question his authority and kudos? Of course, she is right—nobody is. But it is not Mr Palmer that this motion is being directed at; it is Senator Vanstone, the minister. The Rau case; the Alvarez case; the fact that 33 other people, including Australian citizens, have been wrongfully detained by Immigration; the fact that we are seeing people deported who have been asylum seekers, have mental illnesses and have threatened suicide; and the appalling and continuing situation in which little children are locked up in government detention centres in this country when the government knows that this causes mental distress, mental injury and potential lifelong damage to these children are all things that are just not acceptable in Australia.
If the minister is not to be taken to account on this then who is? It is not just the Greens who are saying that the process that the minister has undertaken to get action here is not up to scratch; the Sydney Morning Herald wrote about the minister’s referral of these matters to Mr Palmer for inquiry out of view of the public. On the fifth of this month the editorial said:
The Rau case has been a public relations disaster for the Government, which appears to know it. Some of its own members have been calling for a review of the mandatory detention policy for asylum seekers. Just before the latest list of blunders was revealed, refugee advocates remarked on what appeared to be a slight relaxation in mandatory detention. Up to 30 detainees had been unexpectedly released ... some after three years behind the barbed wire, and without any other change in the progress of their cases. It looked like—though the Government denied it—an attempt to soften the policy’s harsh image.
The editorial goes on:
The inquiry by the former commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Palmer, into the Cornelia Rau affair—regardless of the unquestioned competence and rectitude of the man who heads it—has the same look about it. The fact it is not open makes it appear more like media management than a means to uncover the truth. Arguments about the privacy of the individuals involved justifying this cloak of secrecy are overwhelmed by the argument of public interest: the public must be confident the immigration system treats people openly and fairly. If the system is deporting Australian citizens, how can anyone be confident of its decisions in the case of refugees and asylum seekers?
We have said from the time the Rau case came to public knowledge that a full, open inquiry was needed. The latest revelations have made it essential.
The Australian, which has been very supportive of government policy in this area, had an editorial a day later, on Friday, the sixth of this month, which ended this way:
... all the money in the world will not help the mentally ill while it is easier to lock them up, even expel them from the country, than to try to discover their circumstances. And if people such as Ms Rau and Ms Wilson—
Ms Wilson is also known as Ms Alvarez—
who both called Australia home, can be treated so shabbily, what hope is there for illegal immigrants with mental illness?
Likewise, the Herald-Sun of Melbourne, in its editorial on the third of this month, ends this way:
A spokesman for Mrs Vanstone, who is overseas, said no further information would be provided about the deportee or wrongful detentions.
It is referring to Ms Alvarez. The editorial goes on to say:
This is not good enough. The public has a right to know why the Immigration Department has acted in a way reminiscent of a banana dictatorship.
Unless the Palmer inquiry is open to the public, the Government risks accusations of a cover-up.
The Palmer inquiry is not open to the public and it is not going to be made open to the public. There is no way the minister is going to heed even editorials from the Herald-Sun and the Australian on that matter. Last Sunday, 8 May, the Sunday Age, in an editorial entitled ‘Will the tide ever turn for detainees?’, said:
That immigration detention is a catalyst for mental illness, or likely to exacerbate existing conditions, has long been argued by refugee advocates and also by mental health professionals who have had contact with detainees.
The editorial goes on:
Last week, that case was strengthened by a Federal Court ruling that the Government has failed in its duty of care towards two severely depressed Iranian detainees held at Baxter. (Those detainees were transferred to a mental health facility before the ruling was delivered.) Justice Paul Finn found that the Commonwealth’s conduct towards the men, who had been in immigration detention in various parts of Australia for about five years, contributed to their ‘progressive deterioration’.
The editorial ends with this paragraph:
The sufferings of the detainees have gone on for too long. They have committed no crime and should not be deprived of their freedom. It is unfortunate that Australian residents have also been caught in the web; but more unfortunate that even this discovery has not yet led to the abandonment of this deplorable policy.
This is a deplorable policy. It is unconscionable. It is inhumane. When you look at global jurisdiction, it is illegal. At the base of it, how can this government pride itself that, as we are here today, dozens of kids are locked up in Nauru and other places behind barbed wire or effectively in imprisonment? For one little girl it has been for all three years of her life. What sort of policy is that? Is that Christian? Is that civilised? Is that the Australia of a fair go? How dare this government knowingly continue the incarceration of little kids, when it has been established that that damages those children and will continue to damage them for as long as they live. How dare the government do that. How can this minister face herself knowing that?
Then we have Australian citizens deported. We have Australian citizens locked up in these wretched asylum seeker centres. This is serious, wrongful behaviour carried out knowingly by government, as far as those children are concerned, and it is an extraordinary default at best, as far as the detainees and deportees are concerned. But it comes from the mind-set of this government, which is hateful towards immigrants who make their way illegally to this country particularly if it happens to be by boat—it is not so bad if it happens to be by aeroplane—and particularly if they are poor rather than rich. And there is no discrimination if they are totally innocent—for example, if they happen to be children.
I received an appealing letter on the same matter that Senator Nettle referred to yesterday. Another Iranian gentleman—and this is a very distressed person—has been forcibly removed from Baxter to Villawood. On the face of it, it looks like he may be deported back to Iran. That is an extraordinary thing for a democratically elected government that says that it believes in the rule of law and, moreover, says that it believes in human decency to be doing.
If there is one thing that is distressing about this debate and that shows the hubris, the arrogance and the disdainfulness of this government when it comes under criticism, it is that the minister has been absent throughout it. She has not had the decency to come in here and defend herself against a motion of censure on her failure as a minister. Where is Senator Vanstone? Why has she absented herself from this chamber? What a disdainful and arrogant attitude to the Senate on a critical vote like this. Ultimately, what a failure by the minister herself to understand the importance and the incendiary nature of the accusations that are coming before the Palmer inquiry. And we only know some of these accusations—those that have surfaced in public about the inhumane treatment of human beings, of people who have needed medical assistance rather than imprisonment and, not least of all, of children.
We only have the device of censure here. If you ask me, this government deserves the greatest censure for the deplorable policy which has allowed these situations to happen. But the right target for a censure motion is the minister who is responsible, and it is unforgivable that the minister has failed to turn up in the Senate to defend herself. One must be left with the presumption or the conclusion that the minister cannot defend herself against the accusations that are now public. There is condemnation in the press—normally very defensive of the government—of the appalling things that are happening in detention centres and under the aegis of this department and this minister. She should be here. She should be defending herself and her department, but she is not. She is a minister in default or denial, or both, and she deserves censure.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-05-11,"—On behalf of the Democrats, I indicate our support for this censure motion. I think the main problem with the censure motion is that its list of failures is far too short. There is a list of six areas where the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has failed in her responsibilities. I can certainly think of quite a few more, but I guess once you get started you end up with the problem of drawing attention to the ones you left out.
The broader problem here is an overall crisis in the capability of the minister to properly manage her portfolio. We had the Cornelia Rau case and the controversy flowing out of that—and that certainly raises serious questions. We have, of course, the case of the Australian citizen deported back to the Philippines, which the department has now admitted. The department did not realise for two years that it had done that and then apparently did very little about it once it did realise what it had done. That second case, I might emphasise, was not an asylum seeker case; it went to another aspect of our immigration law.
I will quickly touch on the problem areas outlined in the censure motion. Senator Coonan, speaking on behalf of the government, criticised the Senate, saying that we are moving a censure motion when we do not have all the facts because the Palmer inquiry has not finished yet, and that we are prejudging the minister. There are at least two significant problems with that. Firstly, many of the aspects that are put forward in this censure motion as failures of the minister are not being looked at by the Palmer inquiry, because the government and the minister specifically made that inquiry as narrow as possible. It did not initially even include cases like the Australian citizen deported back to the Philippines.
Secondly, as I said in comments to the Senate yesterday, we have had inquiries. We have had inquiry after inquiry, and then we get comments in this debate such as we got from Senator Coonan—I hope I am quoting correctly—who said:
There is no dispute that the department abides by the letter and spirit of the international conventions relating to the treatment of children.
I am sorry, but there is dispute. There is massive dispute. In fact, I doubt that there would be many people who would agree with the government’s absolutely blind insistence that they are not breaching the letter of the convention, let alone the spirit of the convention.
This parliament received a comprehensive report of well over 500 pages from its Human Rights Commissioner—appointed through an act of this parliament—reporting to us and the government about children in detention. The report was categorical and comprehensive. As I said yesterday, a main finding of that report was that, at its core, our mandatory detention regime breached the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The government’s response to that was: ‘No, we don’t; we don’t accept that. See you later.’ When you get that degree of contempt and wilful blindness and we are then told, ‘You’ve got to give us the benefit of the doubt; you’ve got to wait for the inquiry to finish,’ my answer is: I am sorry, we have had plenty of inquiries and they were quite categorical in their findings—and not just the Human Rights Commissioner’s inquiry. I detailed yesterday the Human Rights Commissioner’s 2001 inquiry and inquiries of parliamentary committees and Senate committees—with unanimous findings of major problems across a whole range of areas—which have continually been ignored by the government. There has been recommendation after recommendation and report after report. On top of that, there are the court findings, such as we had last week about the department breaching its duty of care to detainees.
Then a minister—not the minister responsible, of course, but somebody else speaking on her behalf—had the gall to come in here and say, ‘Let’s look at the facts. Where are your facts?’ The facts are in a pile of reports so high they would reach the ceiling of this chamber. But it is no surprise that a government minister walks in here and asks, ‘Where are the facts?’—because they do not want to look at the facts. They do not want to look at the reports. They do not want to look at the evidence. They do not want to admit the blatantly obvious breaches—clear-cut breaches—of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the convention against torture, the refugee convention and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. The government treat us like idiots and they are treating the public like fools when they continue to insist that there is no breach of these conventions. There are blatant breaches. They should at least be honest about it. To say that it has not been established that the minister has failed to abide by the letter and spirit of the international conventions relating to the treatment of children is wrong. It has been established. It has been comprehensively established by the Human Rights Commission—along with others.
The government have said that it has not been established that the minister has failed to manage the timely and humane processing of asylum seekers. How much more proof do you need? When last year’s season of Big Brother was on and Merlin Luck came out with his mouth taped up and a sign saying ‘Free the refugees’, Minister Vanstone said, ‘Merlin is a bit of an idiot, because there are no refugees in detention centres.’ That is the level of her response to some of these issues. I think the only person who agreed with her was Gretel Killeen. She seemed to be quite happy to slag off Merlin as well.
The basic fact is that there are plenty of refugees in detention centres. Look at the case of the Iranian writer Ardeshir Gholipour. He had people around the world supporting him. He was in detention when Merlin Luck did his thing and the minister said, ‘There are no refugees in detention; he doesn’t know what he is talking about.’ Mr Gholipour is now in the community. He has a visa because he has been found to be a refugee. Pity we locked him up for five years before deciding to acknowledge his refugee status! Yet the minister will say, ‘No, there are no refugees in detention centres.’ That case alone took five years—and we have the government saying, ‘The facts aren’t established that the minister has failed to manage timely and humane processing of asylum seekers.’
The department itself has admitted that it has released 33 people because they were not unlawful. Minister McGauran has admitted there has been the illegal deportation of at least one Australian citizen. Minister Vanstone herself in this chamber in question time yesterday said, ‘It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor the safety of asylum seekers deported from Australia by DIMIA, and they are not going to do it.’ A Senate committee inquiry five years ago—around the time Mr Gholipour first got put into detention—which featured Senator Coonan, who spoke in defence of Minister Vanstone, found that this was a problem. It acknowledged that there are issues with how you monitor people who have been sent back to another country, but it found that it was a problem and recommended unanimously, including the Liberal Party members of that committee, that the government work with non-government organisations to look at ways to set up an informal monitoring process. The government’s response then was, ‘No, we’re not going to do it; it’s none of our business.’
It has taken a non-government organisation like the Edmund Rice Centre to fund their own inquiry—going to many dangerous countries, interviewing 40 different people who have been deported by this country, Australia, because they have not been deemed to be refugees. They have found the vast majority of them to be in situations of danger. That does not mean they were refugees, I might say—there are different issues there. But we have an overriding obligation beyond the refugee convention not to deport people to places presenting serious personal danger and to at least make some effort to check that they are all right, if that is possible. It is possible, because the Edmund Rice Centre has done it—why the hell can’t the government do it? Why can’t it work with these groups? But the minister’s only response to those facts, to that report, is to say, ‘We asked them to give us some proof and they wouldn’t give it,’ which is certainly not the story they are telling me and certainly not the story they are telling publicly. They are saying they are working with the department and they are giving them lots of information, but the minister’s only response to all of these comprehensive, detailed inquiries—with a public report—is to say, ‘They haven’t given us anything to back it up. Therefore, we’ll dismiss the whole thing.’
The minister has clearly failed in that area. These facts have all been established; we do not need to wait for Mr Palmer to establish the facts of these failures outlined in the motion. In saying that, I am not in any way attacking Mr Palmer—in fact, I have no reason to believe that Mr Palmer is doing anything other than a good job. That the inquiry was expanded to include more than the Cornelia Rau case is a good sign. But Mr Palmer’s scope, even in the expanded inquiry, is very narrow—much narrower than the wide range of problems that have come to light over a long period of time with this whole area that the minister for immigration oversees. His powers are limited, so it does not matter how good a job he does: there is only so much he can do. I am looking forward to his report, and I believe it could well be quite valuable. But to suggest that that is the be-all and end-all is totally misleading.
It is as misleading as the government’s statement, made just before, that they are following the letter and spirit of international conventions relating to the treatment of children. What about the case of the three-year-old girl, who I think Senator Nettle mentioned in her contribution, who has been in Villawood and has medical evidence showing the immense damage being detained for her whole life has done to her development? The minister was asked a question about that case yesterday. It is a case that is not going to be covered by the Palmer inquiry. She proceeded to blame the child’s mother. Maybe there are things the mother should be doing that she is not, but that is no excuse for causing immense harm to a three-year-old girl. I have a three-year-old girl, and I worry about the impact on her development of my being away from home so much. The thought of her having spent three years—all of her life—locked up in a detention centre makes my blood run cold. To think that we are doing that now! And we still have ministers saying, ‘It is not proven that it is causing damage.’
I would like to mention another example. This is from a document that was tabled out of session and on which there has not yet been an opportunity to speak in this place. It contains another example of this government’s wilful misleading of the public about the basic facts of this crucial area. It is a report that was tabled out of session by the Attorney-General’s Department. It is their fourth report under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. We provide those reports regularly to the United Nations committee that oversees that convention. Australia is a signatory to this convention and there was a recommendation made by that committee that Australia consider the desirability of providing a mechanism for independent review of ministerial decisions in respect of cases coming under that convention. The fact is that at the moment there is no scope for independent review of decisions about people who are at risk of being sent back to face a situation of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
This is not just a UN committee telling us what we should do. Again, we had an inquiry into it by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That committee’s report, A sanctuary under review, of August 2000, five years ago, made a unanimous recommendation that we incorporate the convention against torture and the Convention on the Rights of the Child in our laws alongside the refugee convention so that they could be considered before people are sent back to these dangerous situations. Not only did the government reject that recommendation; looking at what they have provided to a UN committee from an Australian government department in response to this raises serious concerns. It is a perfect example of a department and a government that are willing to blatantly mislead—it is on the edge of deliberate deceit—about the reality of what the government does here. We have an obligation—I would hope everybody would agree it is a moral obligation—under this convention we have signed not to send people back to situations where they may face torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
The Australian government’s response was to say, ‘This obligation mainly arises in respect of persons seeking refugee protection.’ It does, and that is why we have the refugee convention in our law. That is not what the whole request is about; it is about those people that come under the convention against torture. The government goes on with a range of paragraphs about the system we have got for people who might come under the refugee convention, completely ignoring the aim of the recommendation. Then it says that various sections of the Migration Act empower the minister to substitute a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to enable a visa to be granted ‘if the minister considers it in the public interest to do so’. It says they have got guidelines for decision makers in the department to refer to our obligations under the convention against torture and the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a relevant factor. It is not as an automatic requirement; it is as a relevant factor—‘Take this into account while you are thinking about it but you don’t have to act on it. It is just a guideline. It is not in the law.’ That is not just a relevant factor pertaining to visas; it is a relevant factor pertaining to whether or not the minister should even think about granting a visa.
Then the government has the gall to say that these public interest intervention powers—under the convention against torture the only protection people have got against being sent back to face conditions of torture—are transparent, because any decision to intervene must be tabled in the parliament. I hope most people in the parliament have seen what is tabled. All it says is, ‘I, the minister, have decided to exercise my powers because I believe it is in the public interest.’ That is it. It does not say who, it does not say why and it does not say what. Every single time it is done you get an identical piece of paper that is tabled. Of course, what you do not get is all the times they have decided not to exercise their interests and they have sent people back. You get nothing about that at all. You have no idea if the decision takes into account the convention against torture or the Convention on the Rights of the Child or anything else.
It is that sort of utterly opaque system that leaves people open to the sorts of allegations that Minister Ruddock was subjected to about cash for visas—because you do not know why a visa is granted in one case and why it is not in another. The Senate looked into that and I believe there was no evidence for that, but it is a sign of how totally nontransparent the system is. Yet the government is giving UN bodies formal reports saying that we have a totally transparent system. We have had Senate committee reports saying that this system is so nontransparent it is not funny and that it should be dramatically overhauled. Then there is the ultimate cop-out of saying, ‘At the end of it all, we are accountable to the parliament and the people of Australia—the court of public opinion.’ That is great. But bad luck for the people who have been deported in the meantime.
That is the level, the pathetic nature, of this government’s defence of the indefensible. It has got to the stage where they are putting in grotesquely misleading reports under the name of our government to UN committees about crucial conventions like the convention against torture. We have a serious crisis. It is not new—I suppose that is one thing the minister could say—but we are clearly getting to the stage, with the material that is coming to light, where the minister is unable to indicate that she knows what is going on and that she knows what she is going to do about it. I will use one more example from this report. This is the most disgraceful. It is in paragraph 100 of this report to the UN committee where it raised the issue of the problem of children being detained. It says:
... the Government has developed a system that ensures that the number of children in ... detention is as limited as possible, that children are only detained as a last resort—
That is directly contradicted by the human rights commission report. It goes on:
As at 15 December 2004, there was only one child classified as an unauthorised boat arrival in mainland detention centres in Australia and 26 children in alternative detention arrangements in the community.
Again, that is one of the most blatantly and deliberately calculated misleading statements. It deliberately ignores the children that are locked up in Nauru. It deliberately ignores the children that are locked up on Christmas Island. It deliberately ignores children such as the three-year-old in Villawood I mentioned. She might be the child of an unauthorised boat arrival, but she is still a child and she has still been locked up for years.
They gloss over these people and pretend they are not there with these deliberately misleading statements to UN committees, and we wonder why people get cynical. It is pathetic for something as fundamental as children being placed in detention. If people want the real figures, I suggest that they regularly go to the web site of the ChilOut group. According to their most recent estimate, there are 74 children in immigration detention at the moment, including six in Nauru and nine on Christmas Island. That is 74 too many. But any child in long-term detention is too many. The failures of this government, the failures of this minister, are enormous, comprehensive and unacceptable. We support this motion. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,CENSURE MOTION,28,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2005-05-11,"—I will sum up the debate. The case has been put several times for supporting this censure motion. I do not think a strong case has been put at all by the government in defending the minister. The case has been put about the failure of the minister to set up a full and public inquiry into the scandals and operations of the department of immigration and the failure of the minister’s duty of care responsibilities to people held in detention centres, especially those with mental illness; the failure of the minister to ensure that asylum seekers are dealt with in a timely fashion, rather than spending four, five or six years in detention before they are found to be genuine refugees; the failure of the minister to ensure that people are treated humanely in detention centres. The case has been put about the failure of the minister to meet Australia’s obligations to international conventions on the treatment of children, to admit responsibility for the mistakes that have occurred and for the wrongful detention of people by her department; the failure of the minister in deporting an Australian citizen, the failure to monitor the safety of failed asylum seekers when they are deported to other countries and to take her responsibilities seriously. I commend this motion to the Senate.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-05-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This quarterly report of the chief executive officer of ARPANSA was provided to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing on 2 March 2005, coincidentally on the same day an ANAO report into the regulation of Commonwealth radiation and nuclear activities was presented to the Senate. I have a particular interest in that because, in 2002, I moved the amendment that resulted in the ANAO inquiry. Unfortunately, the quarterly report provided by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency mentions very little about the ANAO’s report or ARPANSA’s response to that report. In fact, very little about the ANAO report is mentioned on ARPANSA’s web site. A report of the meeting of ARPANSA’s Nuclear Safety Committee held on 25 February this year stated:
An ANAO audit of the ARPANSA regulatory procedures was nearing completion and would be tabled in Parliament in March. ARPANSA has set up a review of its procedures in response to the issues raised in the report. The Committee would be briefed at the June meeting on the outcomes of the report.
This comment gives some indication of the seriousness of the ANAO report that was undertaken, as I mentioned, in response to a successful second reading amendment moved by me on behalf of the Democrats to the ARPANSA Bill 2002. At the time of moving that amendment a number of agencies had raised serious concerns directly with us that the regulatory process had become overly bureaucratic to the detriment of their technical activity and capacity. Time has shown the wisdom of the Senate in supporting my second reading amendment and that it was the right thing to do at the time because the report, quite frankly, is scathing. The overall audit conclusion states, in part:
… ARPANSA’s systems and procedures are still not sufficiently mature to adequately support the cost-effective delivery of regulatory responsibilities.
In particular, deficiencies in planning, risk management and performance management limit ARPANSA’s ability to align its regulatory operations with risks, and to assess its regulatory effectiveness.
The conclusion also states:
… procedures for licensing and monitoring of compliance have not been sufficient, particularly as a licence continues in force until it is cancelled or surrendered.
Key findings of the report are simply astonishing. I will not go through them tonight, due to a lack of time. There are too many, but I will share with you some of the more important ones. No. 6 states:
… the size and scope of the regulatory function were underestimated during its planning and implementation. The number of—
radioactive—
sources was four times more than planned, and the number of facilities nearly three times more.
No. 13 states:
… overall management of conflict of interest is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the ARPANS Act and Regulations.
No. 15 states:
… the Regulatory Branch does not maintain a complaints register, as required.
No. 27 states:
The bulk of license assessments—some 75 per cent—were made without the support of robust, documented procedures.
I hope the Senate caught that figure: ‘75 per cent made without the support of robust, documented procedures’. That is scandalous. It went on:
Assessments of applications were supported by draft procedures only, which staff were not required to follow.
No. 28 states:
Some 60 per cent of applications accepted for assessment have been processed without a fee. Accepting applications without a fee is a breach of ARPANS legislation.
The list goes on. No. 37 states:
Nor does it—
that is, ARPANSA—
have a strategy for identifying prohibited activity by non-licensed entities.
That is as bad as it sounds. No. 41 states:
ARPANSA does not monitor or assess the extent to which licensees meet reporting requirements. The ANAO found that there had been under-reporting by licence holders.
The list goes on. I acknowledge that ARPANSA have agreed with all of the ANAO’s 19 recommendations and, while I applaud them for that, I would urge ARPANSA to now implement those recommendations as a matter of utmost urgency and report to the parliament on that implementation, through their quarterly reports, such as the one before us. Up until now, their accountability to government has been less than satisfactory. There are many other recommendations and resolutions that I could leave with you tonight, Mr Acting Deputy President but, to say the least, they are damning findings. The second reading amendment that we moved was a wise amendment. Unfortunately, the processes, in how bad and how scandalous they indeed are, are worse than we ever could have considered.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-05-11,"—Unfortunately I was unable to take advantage of the opportunity to speak in today’s condolence motion for Al Grassby, so I will take a short time now. Al Grassby, a former Minister for Immigration, whose short reference paper was titled ‘A multi-cultural society for the future’, changed the way our nation thought about itself. The year was 1973; the Whitlam government was still new. The concept was essentially a Canadian idea: a government solution to manage Canada’s large French- and English-speaking population. Grassby’s insight was to expand and adapt the concept to Australia. In that 1973 reference paper, the ‘father of multiculturalism’ postulated on what his progeny might look like when born. He said:
My concept of a society able to sustain growth and change without disintegration is a society based on equal opportunity for all—a goal which no right-thinking person could dispute, but the striving for which has led traditionally to some of the deepest conflicts within society.
Albert Jaime Grassby was born in New Farm, Brisbane in1926 to an Irish mother and a Spanish father. That perhaps set the tone. In 1932, his father left Australia and Grassby enlisted in the British Army in the intelligence corps in 1943 and served in the Second World War. He later studied journalism at the University of South West England. Despite being born in Australia, when Grassby returned in 1948 he had to be sponsored as a migrant as the Australian passport was not yet in use. Grassby would introduce this in 1973.
Back in Australia, Grassby moved to Griffith and worked for the CSIRO in agriculture and communications before being elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Murrumbidgee in 1965. He was first elected to the House of Representatives seat of Riverina in 1969 and was appointed as Minister for Immigration in December 1972. With a talent for self-promotion and insisting that he was a migrant, Grassby went about the task of telling migrants that far from being uncomfortable about being their blend of nationalities and cultures they should take pride in it and celebrate their background.
Al Grassby introduced changes to the immigration system that had previously subjected migrants from outside of the United Kingdom to harsher tests. He also introduced the Australian Citizenship Bill into parliament in 1973. That set out uniform laws for migrants seeking citizenship. Previously, the rules had been based on the ethnic background of migrants. Overseas students found it easier to stay in Australia after completing their studies, and the parents of Australian-born children were able to remain in the country. Al Grassby’s concept for multiculturalism set out parameters for a new approach to racial discrimination. He banned racially selected sports teams from competing in Australia and made it possible for Indigenous people to leave the country without having to seek permission. Grassby’s vision was of such great impact that 32 years on we are still debating it and celebrating some of the initiatives that he commenced.
Multiculturalism was not a new thing for Australia. Postwar immigration policy meant we became the second country, behind the United States, to actively encourage migrants. In the late 1960s Professor Zubrzycki advocated migrants keep their ethnic identities and, along with few others, he and Al Grassby drove the policy idea of multiculturalism and its policy guidelines of social cohesion and equality of opportunity.
The same year an inquiry into the departure of settlers reported that there were high migrant departure rates and a need for settlement services. Migrants left for a variety of reasons but most probably because it was just plain hard to get on in a society that was simply not yet tolerant of those who could not speak or were not learning English. The White Australia Policy, which had been in place since Federation, was abandoned and in the early 1970s the Labor Party went a step further to adopt a strategy that was to continue to this very day. From this strategy, the concept of multiculturalism was born. In short, the idea was to introduce a range of policies to assist migrants to call Australia home without them abandoning their cultural heritage. The idea was typically Australian in its pragmatism.
In 1973, Al Grassby perceived his task was not only to rectify the short-term failings of the migration and settlement program; he boldly looked ahead to 2000—a year we have already passed—and placed the cornerstone for a just society where all could make their own contribution to ‘the family of the nation’. The new direction of Al Grassby’s paper meant that we as a nation would recognise that the social and cultural rights of migrants were as compelling as the rights of all other Australians. Grassby’s concept was grounded in a huge amount of commonsense and a love of this country. He knew:
 ... the full realisation of these rights would lead to reduced conflicts and tensions between groups in our communities which are weaving an ever more complex fabric for Australian society.
This was the start. Grassby continued this work throughout his time in the Whitlam government as Minister for Immigration until his defeat in the simultaneous dissolution of parliament in 1974. Grassby’s work was not to end here. The Fraser government elected in 1975 continued the work started by Al. It took on the task of nurturing the multicultural policy initiatives, ensuring bipartisan support for the approach in its early application.
Since the 1996 election and the rise of Hansonism, some have perceived teaching English to migrants and other such services as special treatment. Grassby’s big idea has never been a favourite of the small minded. He once explained his views on Australia’s culture in this way:
I’ve always been a passionate Australian nationalist. I’ve always believed in Australia’s destiny. Those people who identify with the British Empire wouldn’t like me anyway.
But his views have often been attacked and criticised, and many have complained about his ideas over the years. The Prime Minister, in a speech when opposition leader, labelled multiculturalism ‘a confusing, even aimless, concept’. Mr Howard for many years afterwards continued to avoid the term. I believe he has not chosen to mention it in parliament for quite some time. The Liberal Party needs to go back and have a look at its history. It needs to go back to that period, to build on what was started in 1973 by Al and continued under Fraser and to give credit where credit is due.
Up to 1985 and the global diversity conference, multiculturalism was an issue that was still alive and thriving. It is a matter that Al would like to see continue. It is not, as I have said, a difficult concept to grasp. It would be easy to take the intellectually lazy approach and attack the policy. But what is the pragmatic course? To follow Al. His message was about a just and fair society for all. Some have even argued that maybe we should abandon the term ‘multiculturalism’ and come up with a new term. I have thought about that but I think I am happy to keep the term ‘multiculturalism’. It has stood the test of time. With the passing of Al Grassby, the idea he left us is best illustrated in the conclusion to his 1973 paper that was the touchstone which started it all. He said:
My personal ambition is that Australians of all backgrounds will always be proud before the world to say in whatever accents, ‘I am an Australian’.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Hon. Albert (Al) Jaime Grassby AM</title>,ADJOURNMENT,41,1
