"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-02-17,"— I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together. After debate on the motion for the second reading has been adjourned, I will be moving a motion to have the bills listed separately on the Notice Paper. I move:
That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and now be read a first time.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-02-17,"—I seek leave to move amended business of the Senate notice of motion No. 3 standing in my name. The amendment makes clear that the report date for paragraphs (a) and (b) is the interim report date of 3 April. The third paragraph deals with the report date of 30 October. 
—I do not have an amendment in those terms. 
—There is no amendment before the Chair at this time that I can see. Do you have a copy of the motion in amended form? I have Senator Bourne's amendment.
—I have a copy of the amended motion provided by the Clerk. 
—If Senator Bishop moves it by leave, I am sure it is something that the whole chamber would agree with. All it does is make sure that parts (a) and (b), which look into any online deals, finish by 3 April. Part (c), which is more extensive, will finish by 30 October. We all agree that that is the overall intent of the whole thing. If he could move it by leave, I do not think it would cause anybody a problem.  
—Is leave granted for that course of action?
—Yes. I presume that we will get written confirmation. 
—Leave is granted for you to move the motion in amended form. We will look forward to receiving the printed copy of the amended motion. 
—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and interim report on the matters specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) by 3 April 2000 and final report on the matters specified in paragraph (c) by 30 October 2000:
(a) any existing commercial arrangements for the production, supply or distribution of Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) material online, including, but not limited to, mechanisms for ensuring ABC editorial control and independence;
(b) any proposed commercial arrangements for the production, supply or distribution of ABC material online, including, but not limited to, mechanisms for ensuring ABC editorial control and independence; and 
(c) any additions required by way of amendment to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 or the ABC's charter to ensure the scope and effectiveness of the operation of the Act and the charter in the new online delivery environment.
The motion before the chair seeks to refer certain matters to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. Those matters are contained in the three paragraphs of the motion: firstly, in the existing commercial arrangements for the production, supply and distribution of ABC material online, including mechanisms for ensuring ABC editorial control and independence; secondly, any proposed commercial arrangements with the same caveat; and, finally, any additions by way of amendment to the ABC Act and the ABC charter to ensure the scope and effectiveness of the act and the charter in the new online delivery environment. As the amendments make clear, the report date for the matters in the first two paragraphs is by 3 April; the report date for the matter in the final paragraph is by 30 October this year.
The opposition have been making a number of points in this debate concerning the future of ABC Online services since about early February. We see no reason at this stage to depart from those arguments as they go to the heart of the motion before the chair. Firstly, the ABC has entered into a series of commercial arrangements with a large number of providers of online content. At least 10 companies are involved in those commercial arrangements. Telstra is admittedly the last but the highest profile user of content under discussion. As we all know, since coming to office this government has been relentless in its attacks on the ABC. It has slashed, and continues to slash, funding to the ABC whilst at the same time the ABC has had to live with three new realities: firstly, the technological convergence and need for creation of both new delivery systems and new or additional content; secondly, the coming reality of digital TV and new markets opened by that development; and, thirdly, the increasing value placed on content by the market.
These new realities can be understood only through the prism of lack of ABC funding certainty. This lack of ABC funding certainty is a deliberate decision of the current government. In short, the only reason the new commercial realities are on the table for review is that these new commercial realities may well threaten the independence of our national broadcaster. Indeed, the Melbourne Age ran a story today on this exact point. The equitycafe.com.au link site carries a list of ABC business stories which it has bought in a legitimate commercial deal. Around the page is a series of advertisements for magazines, travel and banks. Last week at estimates we were repeatedly told by the ABC management, in respect of non-exclusive content, that there was not, and there was not anticipated to be, any advertising—no advertising at all. It would be complete ABC editorial control and independence. 
The facts, as relayed by the Melbourne Age, show this to be different. Advertising is allowed—not around content but around the indexes on the link page which tell you where to go. That strikes me as a very fine distinction. It goes to the heart of the issue under discussion and the heart of the concerns repeated by the opposition. Is advertising allowed around ABC supplied content? We thought the answer was no. Mr Johns has repeatedly told us that the answer is no. Various officers of the ABC at estimates told us no. Telstra, through its officers, told us no. But apparently advertising is now allowed in certain areas, in certain sectors and by certain providers. I think it is fair to say that, at best, we have a halfway house. In certain circumstances, perhaps in limited circumstances, advertising is authorised and permitted.
The second point we have been making, and we wish to restate, is that the great danger of the proposed arrangement with Telstra, and possibly others, is that the commercialisation compromises the independent news gathering process of our national broadcaster. The great strengths of the ABC are its continent-wide coverage, a series of delivery systems, journalists and news people all around the country and a charter which has given it independence prescribed by law. These aspects, separately and aggregated, create value in the ABC. The independence of the ABC is its strength. Telstra and others seek to purchase product because of that value. That process they undergo has the potential to perhaps harm the source of that strength, that source of value. Indeed, the draft of the Telstra ABC contract arguably makes it clear this very independence is at risk.
Clause 4 of that draft contract deals with content to be licensed by the ABC to Telstra on a non-exclusive basis—nothing remarkable about that proposition, you would think, and not the subject of great discussion to date. But clause 4L of the draft agreement—and I state again it is a draft agreement; it is not yet signed off, so it is only a working document—says:
Subject to clauses 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 5G, 5H, 5O, 5K, 5L—
et cetera, and these are the important words—
Telstra will have absolute discretion over the use of ABC content and over how it places ABC content on its services.
I will say that again:
Telstra will have absolute discretion over the use of ABC content and over how it places ABC content on its services.
That is deliberately wide drafting. It arguably permits advertising because it allows Telstra `absolute discretion ... over how it places content'. We already have fine distinctions of advertising apparently not allowed on the page but allowed to be around the index that tells you where to look up particular articles.
In this contract, I am advised, there is no provision for mediation or arbitration of the disputed clauses. Telstra, it is agreed between the two parties, has absolute discretion, and it is clearly arguable that Telstra has the right to place advertising. We have had a similar mess-up—last week, I think it was reported—with Cable and Wireless Optus, where it was disclosed that Cable and Wireless are providing filtered content. That is, again, contrary to their undertakings, as I understand it, with the ABC, contrary to the commitments given to the opposition senators at last week's estimates and contrary to repeated comments made by Senator Alston on behalf of the government. It might be arguable that this is a result of misunderstanding or unclear interpretation or perhaps the actions of junior staff members or junior officials. But what it does make clear is that, in both the proposed contract with Telstra and the business with Cable and Wireless Optus, there is a difference of opinion between the negotiators of the various corporations, there is a different understanding by a range of the stakeholders and absolute guarantees that have been offered by the government and by the various senior executives of the ABC may not be as reliable as we have all hoped.
The third point I wish to make is that the Senate estimates process began the process of fleshing out the detail of the proposed contract. It established a number of points: that there was a non-exclusive content provision in the deal; that there were exclusive co-production agreements; that there were specific fees for the deal; that there is a large number of similar, if not identical, deals; that there was potential for advertising—not the actuality but the potential for advertising. There are apparent breaches of those rules already, and the attitude of the ABC board to new revenue streams was also interesting.  
The opposition believes that process has not yet been exhausted. A couple of hours of Senate estimates to deal with this one issue, amongst others, with two major corporations was insufficient time. We need a full and detailed examination, and that process, we believe, should be open and transparent. As I said before, paragraphs (a) and (b) go to the existing or proposed commercial arrangements for the production, supply and distribution of ABC material online and mechanisms for ensuring ABC editorial control and independence. Last week we were told it was not an issue, not a problem. We heard that from both the ABC and Telstra. Similar commitments were given with respect to advertising. Indeed, the Age article stated:
A spokesman for the ABC said yesterday: “There is no advertising allowed around any content.” But Ms Julianne Schultz, the ABC's corporate strategy manager, said last night the corporation allowed advertising around indexes. She admitted the ABC may have to review how much information is allowed on an “index” site.
So what was an absolute guarantee is now somewhat refined or diminished. Paragraph (c) is intended to be narrow, not wide. It is focused and not spread all over the place. The opposition is not seeking a full and wide-ranging inquiry into the act or the ABC charter. Paragraph (c) recognises the new online delivery environment as a fact of life and it asks whether the act needs to be reviewed in that limited light. So paragraph (c) is subject to the last few words in that paragraph itself: `in the new online delivery environment'.
But we know online delivery is topical. We know that e-commerce is emerging all over the place. We know that Internet gambling is a fact of life. And we know, from extensive debates last year on another matter, that the distribution of illegal or salacious material over the Internet is a fact of life. All of these issues—e-commerce, Internet gambling, online delivery of product, new revenue streams—pose new challenges, and they sometimes pose different questions for policy makers. This, of course, is recognised in principle by the government. Last year they urgently brought forward extensive debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill, concerning the regulation of illegal or improper material and its distribution online. The government has cooperated with an inquiry before the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies into Internet gambling, which had its final hearings yesterday, and a report is anticipated to come down in some four or five weeks.
The Productivity Commission in its recent report on gambling around Australia recognised this issue of Internet gambling. It has delivered one or two chapters on Internet gambling and made a series of recommendations. The government has responded to one of those recommendations of the Productivity Commission on Internet gambling by setting up a ministerial council, and its first task is to look at some of the technical aspects and technical issues deriving from online gambling. We all know that there is a need for consumer protections and guarantees for e-commerce, and the government has been actively involved in that debate. So the issue in paragraph (c) as to a limited terms of reference inquiry into the ABC charter and act in the new online environment, going to its scope and effectiveness, is really quite unremarkable, and is consistent with a range of committee and legislative developments in this place over the last two or three years. It is also entirely consistent with the government's own actions and activities in a range of areas.
We do note that apparent division continues to be a fact of life within the ABC board. Some board members, we are told, want to sell online services. Others want to garnishee additional revenue from distribution of extra product. The government last week refused to guarantee the funding of ABC Online services. Other stakeholders want separate revenue streams independent of government. Other stakeholders want no change to the operation of the ABC, notwithstanding the huge degree of change and convergence which leads to different forms of opportunity. Mr Johns gave an impassioned defence of the entire deal but Friends of the ABC, through their public statements in New South Wales, have indicated a different attitude to the proposals enunciated by Mr Johns. However, the ABC content deal with Telstra does raise unresolved issues of advertising revenue streams, the nature of the commercial agreements and understandings by both parties to those agreements, the apparent breaches and confusion by content purchasers, and the effectiveness of the ABC in the new online environment. 
In closing, I will make the final point that there is also a precedent for the types of amendments that could emerge from the inquiry outlined in paragraph (c) of the terms of reference. The BBC act has been amended by the British parliament to take account of the new reality of the online world. This is going to be an issue in a whole range of jurisdictions. In our view, it is nothing particularly remarkable and is a routine process of the Senate and government. In summary, we believe the ABC was forced to enter into commercial arrangements because of the slashing of government funds over the last three or four years. The great danger of commercial agreements with Telstra is that they have the capacity to compromise the independent news gathering process of the ABC, and we believe the whole process should be examined by the public through an open inquiry. It is not our intention to delay the interim inquiry into commercial arrangements. We hope it can report by 3 April. The broader issue of ABC activity in the online world has until 30 October. But, again, I state for the record that it is not our intention to have a wide-ranging inquiry. Accordingly, I commend the motion, as amended, to the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of clarification: could I invite Senator Bishop to indicate why it is that Mr Smith on a number of occasions has said that this matter was to be referred to the Senate standing committee on—
—Order! That is not a point of clarification.
—It is. I am coming to the form of this notice of motion, which is to refer the matter to a references committee, and I want to know why there has been this change. There was no explanation given in the course of Senator Bishop's 20-minute contribution, and it is very important for the Senate to understand.
—Minister, please resume your seat. I gave you permission to rise on a point of clarification. A point of clarification is not a debating point. There is time for you to debate the matter, and you can get your clarification during the debate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee </title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-02-17,"—The Democrats have to agree with the ALP. As far as we can see, most of the problems that the ABC is currently experiencing—and there are an awful lot of them—stem from the lack of adequate funding. I do not think anybody doubts that there is a lack of adequate funding of the ABC. We could go over Mr Mansfield's report again, where even he thought that $500 million was the minimum that you needed to run a national radio and television broadcast service. And, of course, when you take the orchestras out, they do not have that much.
One part of the funding that worries me very considerably at the moment is the proper funding of the ABC to go to the digital environment. That is a really huge problem. I suspect it is still a huge problem within the cabinet—whether it is going to be funded at all. I think it has been a huge problem all along. I could be completely wrong. I hope to goodness I am and the minister will get up and tell me that the ABC will be fully funded to go to digital in the next budget and more, which would be excellent. Bring them back up to $500 million while we are at it! But I fear that will not be the case.
As far as this motion goes, the ABC-Telstra agreement has been examined in estimates. We are supporting parts (a) and (b) of the terms of reference of the inquiry. The essential difference between this inquiry and estimates is that external comment is not allowed in estimates. It is between members of parliament and the department—or the minister, really, helped by the department. We think there will be a lot of interest from the public in putting submissions and giving evidence, and that facilitates public discussion. 
After all, over the past five years ABC Online has grown into a really strong, a really innovative and a really wonderful part of the ABC. It is one of the best ways, especially in the current environment, of getting out information and allowing people to have a look as they wish at information that the ABC news and current affairs—and the other branches of the ABC—can give them. I use it all the time. I understand it has the second highest hit rate of any Australian Internet site. Probably half of those hits come from my office during the day when we log on to abc.net.au to find out what is going on in Australia and the wider world outside this building.
I know the aim of the third part of the inquiry, as Senator Bishop has put it up, is to explore ways to formally acknowledge both the evolution of ABC Online and that ABC Online is an integral part of the ABC. That is a fairly sensible thing to do. It is going to happen anyway when the digital legislation comes up. The whole issue of the way we see, hear and get our news is changing, and it is changing very rapidly. Within about 10 years, the way we all look at news will be very different from the way it is now.
I wish to amend paragraph (c) of Senator Bishop's motion. I have circulated a proposed substitution for that paragraph. I move: 
Omit paragraph (c), substitute:
(c) any extension to legislation which could be considered to ensure that the ABC is able to effectively provide an independent, innovative and comprehensive service in the online delivery environment.
I have taken bits of my amendment out of the charter on innovation and comprehensive service, and it reflects the fact that the ABC is, of course, independent. The reason that I prefer this paragraph to the ALP's is that I have a fear and the people whom I respect in the ABC also have a fear—and who can blame them—that the ABC's charter could be opened up. I know that is not Senator Bishop's intent, but I fear that, if it is in the terms of reference of the inquiry, the ABC's charter could be opened up and made far broader than any additions required because of Online. I think the ABC is going to have to face getting its online delivery service into the act some time, and I think it is going to have to face that sooner rather than later. The ABC itself, I understand, has a legal opinion that there is no problem with it creating Online, using Online and developing Online, as it is now. That is fine but I think, as things change, it would be more sensible for the ABC to have a strong integral part of its act that says that it has both a right and a duty to deliver information in a comprehensive, innovative and independent way—as it does now and as it has done for more than, I think, 60 years—to the Australian public.
The ABC has the right and the duty to do that under its act. I would rather see that spelt out because I think things are changing at such a rate that that is going to become inevitable. Before it becomes inevitable, having what I hope would be a sensitive and sensible look at where we should be going, on this at any rate, in the near future—and I hope into the distant future as well—would be of no harm to the ABC. I think, if that is done properly—and I certainly hope that it would be done properly—it would be of assistance to the ABC. I have moved my amendment because, as I said, I would prefer that the charter was not mentioned. I have not even mentioned the name of the act, but I guess that would be the chief legislation we would be looking at. There are other bits of legislation that may be of interest there.
This is a difficult one because there are people within the ABC, as I said, whom I respect and like, and I think their views are usually—almost always—very sensible views. I can understand the feeling of not wishing to have the charter gone through and beaten about with big heavy bludgeons, which is something that appears to us to be happening, by some people within the board anyway. We think the charter as it stands is very good and that the act as it stands is very good; we just think that there may be some amendment that may be looked at which would make Online an integral part of the ABC, even in legislation. I know it can be picked up in general under the ABC Act, but I think that, if it were specified, that would make the case stronger to maintain Online—not to be able to sell off Online. That would be an absolutely appalling idea. It really is a very integral part now of the ABC, and I think making it integral as part of the legislation would be a very sensible move to ensure that it cannot be sold off without major ructions going on inside the parliament. I think it has to be maintained because it is the way of the future. It is the way in which we are going and it is what is going to happen. In five or 10 years, at least inside the cities, we will probably end up with fibre optic cable, or a better technology that we do not even know about yet, inside our homes and we will be able to both download a lot of information and have a channel to send back information. 
The ABC ought to be an integral part of that. They ought to be on top of that, as they are now. This is one of the best sites in Australia. I want to maintain the fact that this is one of the best sites in Australia and make sure that it is able to grow. The best way to do that, of course, would be to give them extra funding, and that is what should be being done. The government should be doing that. It has a duty to fund the ABC to carry out their charter and to digitise. I am sure that the minister is aware of that, but I am not quite so sure that others in the cabinet are just as aware of that. Perhaps they all ought to be sent the act so that they can have a read and realise what their duty is in relation to this. However, we support paragraphs (a) and (b) because, as I said, we would like to see external comment on this. I think there are a lot of people out there in the general public—they have certainly got in touch with me—who feel that they would like to have their say. I think that would be of interest, but not necessarily to tell the board what to do because it is, after all, up to the board. I know that there is agreement across the chamber that it is up to the board to decide how to go about this, but I think the board should have the information that the general public can provide as it makes those deliberations. These deliberations will, of course, take a couple more months—particularly if it reports by 3 April, which I think is entirely possible with that committee. I have been told that that is possible.
In terms of paragraph (c), as I said, I would prefer that the charter and the act itself were not named. We have a similar sort of intent with my proposed amended paragraph (c) and I would hope that that could be agreed to. Let me finish by saying, again, that the problems of the ABC are such that the ABC needs to be properly funded to go into the digital environment—and we all know how much they need because Arthur Andersen did an independent review and told us that the ABC were right and, remarkably, the amount that Arthur Andersen suggested for the digitisation of a national rural and metropolitan ABC is less than the commercial television stations tell us they need just for their metropolitan operations. I cannot see that the ABC could go down a cent from what Arthur Andersen says is the minimum that they need. I hope to goodness that the cabinet understands that. I know the minister does, and I hope that he can convince his colleagues of this point of view. If he would like me to send the Arthur Andersen report, with the relevant bits highlighted, to his cabinet colleagues I would be more than willing to do that—and perhaps the charter as well, which they might like to read. 
In finishing, let me say that, when you come down to it, I think funding is at the basis of all of the ABC's problems. If it were properly funded, there probably would not even be consideration of a lot of this, but there may be. There may be consideration of it purely to get information out without needing to get the money in, in response. We will be supporting paragraphs (a) and (b) but we would rather see our paragraph (c). I will be voting for our paragraph (c) and not for the opposition's paragraph (c).",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee </title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-02-17,"—There are a number of furphies in this debate. The first is that somehow some years ago we singled the ABC out for some special treatment when we had to try to make changes to repair the $10 billion budget black hole that we had inherited from the Labor Party. But we did that virtually across the board in the public sector. So the ABC certainly was not singled out. We gave very extensive notice. We waited until the end of the existing triennial funding agreement and we foreshadowed that in the next agreement there would be a $55 million reduction in funding for the ABC. 
The ABC has since on a number of occasions made it plain that `One ABC' has been a great management restructuring success. One ABC effectively meant that, instead of having separate management streams for radio and television, you combined the two; you adopted modern management practices; you introduced a flatter management structure. As a result, they say that they have achieved a $28 million saving. In other words, more than half of that amount of $55 million has been met by management restructuring which the ABC itself says has been a very significant achievement in terms of greater productivity and performance. There is absolutely nothing that current discussions have to do with somehow redressing that funding imbalance.
The fact is that the ABC has been able to develop its online site—with our support from the very outset—very effectively. For Senator Bourne's information, it is rating about No. 5 in the list of the most popular web sites. It has about three million hits a week. It is clearly an ongoing source of great interest. The real challenge is whether the ABC, particularly news and current affairs, remains relevant in the digital environment. That is the challenge. Do you want to consign the ABC to a backwater; do you want to just have it adhere to its traditional practices; or do you really want it to get a slice of the action?
—You cut their funding. 
—I am just making the point that ABC Online has emerged as a very successful venture. 
—You never funded it. It is no thanks to you. 
—They have done it—that is the point—with the existing level of funding. Back in the 1980s when you were keeping the lid on them, David Hill was off there and coming up with a whole set of new ventures. They have always been able to find new opportunities, and I commend them for it. This has been one of the most successful.
Another great furphy, which I presume is being peddled out of ignorance rather than malice, is that there are some board members who want to sell off online services. I am not aware of any such suggestion. I am aware that one board member proposed selling off a minority stake in ABC Online. That is exactly what Telstra was talking about doing last week; it is exactly what PBL have done with ecorp; it is exactly what Murdoch is talking about doing with a minority spin-off of his satellite services. In other words, this is conventional corporate structuring in the online environment. But the ABC seems to be utterly oblivious to that. You tell us that, because we have 50.1 per cent of Telstra, we have absolute control, we can run the show and we ought to tell Telstra what to do, et cetera. But, somehow, if the ABC were in absolute majority control of the online web site, you would argue that that is a compromise or that they lose control. The logic escapes me.
I am very interested to hear that Senator Bishop now says the opposition is not seeking a full and wide-ranging inquiry into the act or charter. That is a breathtaking climb down from where Mr Smith has been in recent times. This is what Mr Smith wanted on 14 February—that is just this last Monday:
... Labor will recommend that the terms of reference for such an inquiry examine the reach and relevance of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the ABC Charter for the future, given the emergence of new technologies ...
He also said only yesterday that he wanted an `inquiry into anything that the national broadcaster does or proposes to do'. Talk about death by a thousand cuts. He wanted to veto this original Telstra-ABC deal. He said, `It was red hot. Frankly, they ought to stop it.' I do not know why he kept using the word `frankly'. I presume it is because normally he is not frank and this was to be the great exception. But there he was saying that this ought to be vetoed and then he wants to have a rolling series of reviews. So I suppose over the next nine months any deal that the ABC comes up with has to be gone over with a fine toothcomb by people in the Senate who think that there is a bit of grandstanding mileage to be made. 
This is an environment in which people have to be very fast and very flexible. If you have been to Silicon Valley, as Senator Lundy has, you will know that deals are done in 24 hours. Deals are done on the run. But for the ABC it is different because they have statutory obligations; they have a charter that guarantees independence; and they have someone who has consistently over many years been a fierce proponent of that, Mr Johns, now giving assurances that they will at all times adhere to those obligations. No-one has suggested they will not. All that has happened is that the Labor Party wants to ignore the fact that written into that agreement is a very clear clause that says that Telstra acknowledges the independence and integrity of the ABC. Of course, that is only right and proper. In fact, it is required by law.  
So there is all of this nonsense about `We want to be sure that you don't compromise independent news gathering processes.' How are they compromised? I do not understand this. Mr Smith did not even seem to understand the difference between coproductions and normal activities, as though coproductions were somehow something new and horrible and should never be contemplated. We had an inquiry some years ago in which I was involved which looked at coproductions and the ABC and whether there were some excesses in current arrangements. But, as we know, SeaChange and Frontline and a whole series of ABC success stories have been coproductions. McFeast was a coproduction. So coproductions ought not be anything new to be worried about. But somehow the ALP seems to think this is yet another example of commercialisation that is unacceptable.
The ABC does get involved in a number of commercial activities. The bookshops are all about commercialisation. All of the promotions that are given on the ABC about buying products from the ABC are commercial examples. The critical issue is whether or not the ABC will be compromised in its news gathering activities, whether it will be leant on to give a different priority to news stories. It is not. Dr Julianne Schultz has made this very clear. To the extent that there is a capacity for Telstra to offer advice and be properly listened to in terms of mix and variety, it is in relation to genres; it is not in relation to news and current affairs. There is no way that the ABC for a moment would allow any tampering or modifying of its news selection processes—and, of course, as it is a party to any ultimate contract arrangement, it will have the capacity to enforce that contract to require that there be no interference with any presentation of news and current affairs.
So, again, this is a complete furphy. What this is about is non-news and non-current affairs. In other words, you have a choice of genres. The ABC thinks comedy is terrific, so it serves that up. The punters do not like it when visiting the Telstra super site, they turn off in droves and Telstra says, `Well, hang on, surely you can do a bit better than that. Why don't you come up with a different comedy format; why don't you come up with something in a different space altogether?' It might be educational programs, it might be environment or Discovery documentaries. That is a perfectly sensible response to commercial realities. But, as far as news and current affairs are concerned, that is entirely different.
Again, we are talking here about organisations, like Telstra and other portals, offering people a range of choices. So you go to the home page, you want news and you see that you have a selection on a menu. You can have NBC, American ABC, CNN, Channel 9 Australia or ABC Online news. That is a matter of choice. No-one is forcing you to go there. It is not as though you are deliberately turning on Channel 2 and sitting there and saying, `Isn't this terrific? No ads. That's my choice, I'm watching it.' Here you have a choice, a smorgasbord of choices. How does it compromise the ABC if people want to go and visit the ABC web site? In other words, if they go from the link on the Telstra home page through to ABC news, which is completely unamended, they get the ABC's presentation—their suite of offerings in news and current affairs. That is what they want, and that is what they get. Telstra understands—and is prepared to pay something in the order of $65 million over a five-year period—that the ABC has a unique brand that relies on independence, integrity and lack of advertising. That is the very sort of reason why people might want to go to that web site.
But is anyone seriously suggesting that, because you go to a portal and it has a banner ad at the top or a strip of ads on the side, somehow that is compromising the integrity of the ABC, that that would make people say, `Oh, I don't want to drill down to the ABC news site because I saw a horrible, filthy, disgusting advertisement for Kids-R-Us on the side of that web site'? It is a preposterous suggestion. It is simply pandering to the lowest common denominator argument out there that somehow, if the ABC has anything to do with commercial activities, it will be compromised. Of course it will not be. The choice is whether the ABC will have the opportunity to compete with other news gathering enterprises or whether it will be consigned to oblivion, whether it is going to have to rely on people going directly to its web site. As we know, portals are gathering speed and momentum all the time. Yahoo and AOL are two of the best examples. Why do you think the ABC has signed up with them? Why do you think they have had these commercial agreements over the last 12 to 18 months? Because they want a slice of the action. They want to see the ABC news presentation available to as many people as possible on traditional terms; in other words, with no ads inside that site. 
So you can grandstand as much as you like, but it is quite clear that the ALP is simply involved in a massive trawling exercise which is designed to paralyse the ABC, to marginalise it and to consign it to irrelevance. The best example of this and why, no doubt, I was not able to ask the question in its entirety—but I am sure that Senator Bishop will deal with it adequately in his reply—is that Mr Smith was out there for days saying that he wanted this to go to the IT select committee. That is a place where I can well understand he would want to send it because it is all about the digital environment, new technologies, new media enterprises and the like. But no, what happened is that, having said that repeatedly, he discovered that that was not the committee with the numbers that he wanted. So, all of a sudden, this goes to a references committee where the government does not have the numbers. So it simply exposes the nakedness of this whole exercise. This is entirely political grandstanding; it has nothing to do with concern about these two activities.
Mr Smith talks about reviewing the charter, reviewing the act—reviewing everything that moves with the name ABC attached to it. Mansfield came out and recommended that we amend the charter to give greater protection in terms of regional activities, news and current affairs and children's television. No, the ALP would not have a bar of it. It does not want any of that to be tampered with. Now, for no apparent reason, because the ALP has not been able to point to any deficiency in the act, it wants to have this massive trawling exercise. I must say that I thought it was really a world first when the ABC put out a release accusing the ALP opposition of intruding on ABC independence, making it clear that almost everything that had been said to date by the ALP was wrong:
In the midst of Mr Smith's selective quoting of a leaked working document, he fails to point out that the ABC would retain complete editorial control over every aspect of content in the arrangement with Telstra.
Why did Mr Smith not want to mention it? Because it did not suit his purposes. He wanted to pretend that somehow this was almost a done deal when it is actually an early version draft of a memorandum of understanding which is likely to provide the basis for a future contract arrangement. In other words, it is miles away from a completed deal. No, he does not want to mention the subservience of Telstra to the ABC in terms of editorial control or, indeed, all of the statutory protections that are built in. He said that he found it ironic that the federal opposition and others, in the name of protecting the independence and integrity of the ABC, are intruding on that very independence by seeking a parliamentary inquiry—an inquiry, incidentally, which would follow last week's intensive examination of the proposed agreement by Senate estimates.
It was not just questioning of the ABC. The first hour and a half was spent questioning Telstra. That is what led Mr Smith to go out and do a quick door stop to express shock, horror and outrage. Mr Smith has attacked proposed coproductions of online material with Telstra. He ignores the fact that not only will the ABC have total control over the content but that content will also be available for the ABC to use as it sees fit on its own web site. Claims that coproduction contents will be exclusively available to Telstra are totally false. It is perplexing Mr Smith objects so strongly to the coproduction principle.  
What I really thinks sticks in Mr Johns' craw is that there seems to be a blinding ignorance of not only existing arrangements but also the online opportunities that will simply bypass the ABC if it is not allowed to get on with it. It acknowledges up-front—and we would expect no less—that it has statutory and charter obligations. I have no reason at all to think that the board will not be entirely conscious of those matters and that it will adhere to them both in the spirit and letter. 
So what is it that we are told is deficient in current legislation that requires amendment? The answer is: `We do not know. We would like to have a long, drawn out nine-month inquiry to see whether we can come up with something that we might be able to impose on the ABC.' All this nonsense about, `Oh well, we now just want a little inquiry, thank you very much. We are not seeking a full and wide-ranging inquiry into the act or charter,' is not so at all. If the ALP had their way, they would be having a never-ending trawling through any existing or proposed commercial arrangements for the production, supply or distribution of material online. In other words, they want to second guess, they want to express their view on sensitive commercial negotiations and binding agreements. They want to be able to get out there and say, `No, that is not how the board ought to do it. We will run it our way.' 
The ALP is the only party in history that I can recall that went to an election—as they did last time—promising to give directions to the board about how they should spend money. They were going to give it on conditions. Here they are again. They are not respecting the independence of the board of directors. If they cannot stack it, as they did years ago, they want to be able to tell it what to do. If they cannot expressly do that from opposition, they want to paralyse it by having an ongoing, rolling series of committee assessments of anything commercial that the ABC might think of doing, when the rest of the world knows that most of these things involve a quick decision. If the ABC does not want to be part of a super site, plenty of others do—thanks very much, done deal, let's move on. That is the way this world operates. 
That is what the ABC quite rightly wants to get into. It understands the opportunities in new media. It has been very successful to date with its own web site. It has not been hampered in any shape or form by a lack of government funding. Yet now it is being told that it has to await the pleasure of a stacked Senate committee that is going to tell it what to do on a regular basis. It is going to reserve its right to disagree with everything that the board might do, everything that people negotiating might do. 
What an absolute nightmare for anyone who is trying to act commercially to be told, `You are subject to scrutiny at every stage of the process.' You cannot possibly enter into commercial agreements. People will run a mile. They will just say, `We cannot be bothered. We will sign up with CNN and a range of other news providers. We will leave the ABC out of it.' Is that what you really want to happen? Because that is exactly what will happen if this committee proceeds down the path that is proposed. 
If it comes to a choice between Senator Bourne's amendment in relation to (c) and the ALP's, I will support the Democrats'. Beyond that, we will oppose the entire proposition because it is totally unnecessary. It is putting the ABC in handcuffs. That may suit your political purposes. It does not suit the ABC. It is not something we support. I think the sooner you stop playing politics the better. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee </title>",Committees,9,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-02-17,"—I will briefly respond to the issues raised by the various participants in this debate. I will deal with which committee is appropriate, as raised by Senator Alston. It is appropriate for this matter to go to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and Arts References Committee for a range of reasons. Firstly, it is that committee and most of the members who are involved in the ongoing review of communication matters—whether it be digital TV or a range of other issues that have come up. It is those members who participate in the legislation committee who address the same sorts of issues relating to the ABC. The committee has developed the expertise, knowledge or some experience in a range of communications matters.  
The committee being discussed is after all the communications committee. The IT committee deals with a range of matters relating to information technology—a subset of which relates to communication matters. The broad references committee of the Senate is the instant committee and that is the only reason that the opposition is interested in referring this matter to that references committee. That committee has been established to receive these sorts of references to review.
In terms of the amendment proposed by Senator Bourne on behalf of the Democrats, the opposition has listened closely to her comments. As I compare the drafting in the Democrat amendment and our paragraph (c), they appear to me to be on broadly similar ground. We mention the ABC Act and the corporation's charter. The Democrats arrive at that by a different route—that is, they choose to extract particular words from the act in terms of their drafting. They appear to be on similar ground. We are concerned that the reference not be broad and wide ranging, as I indicated earlier and acknowledged by Senator Alston. That is why it is in the context of the new online delivery environment. We would prefer to retain our paragraph (c) and, hence, we will vote for that. If that is defeated, as appears likely as indicated by the government's advice via Senator Alston, we can live with that.
The issue addressed right through Senator Alston's comments was one of choice—the type of content you received, where you chose to access that content and the type of material delivered at a particular site or a particular portal. Senator Alston is correct to identify that issue. It is the issue that is under discussion because it does go to the matters under review and to the independence of the ABC. I would have had some sympathy for the proposition put a few moments ago by Senator Alston if he had put that proposition a week ago at estimates, because the various officers of both the ABC and Telstra gave the hardest, most rock solid undertakings and commitments in terms of respect of the ABC charter and its right to independence that anyone could possibly have asked for. Our problem is that, when it leaves the rarefied estimates atmosphere and it goes to implementation by a content receiver—Telstra or any of the other half a dozen or 10 that have been identified—and becomes the responsibility of various officers of ABC or the commercial enterprise they are dealing with, we have already had in the last week two instances of breach. 
We do not say that they were deliberate breaches, that they were breaches motivated by malevolence. They may well have been incidental or accidental or misunderstandings of the commercial relationship. But in the case of Cable and Wireless Optus, the product received was filtered—it was different. We do not say it was censored. We do not say there was any particular evil intent, but it was different, it was filtered. It was different to that which had been supplied by the ABC. That is breach No. 1. Breach No. 2 is referred to by the article I referred to in the Age at length where what was an absolute commitment to no advertising has now become `advertising around the index is okay'. It is a bit like the bucket: it is either half full or half empty. It does matter. Either you have advertising, either you have alternate revenue streams, either they are the dominant factor in the funding of an independent corporation—or they are not. You cannot have it both ways. 
Perhaps the Australian community, perhaps the Friends of the ABC, perhaps the opposition, perhaps the Democrats are content to have the ABC made into a near replica of all the commercial networks. Maybe we have changed our minds. But, if that is the case, let the public be informed. Let the public have their point of view. My own view is that we value independence. We value it being different. As Senator Alston indicated, we do value choice. We want real choice. We do not want eight versions of the same product under a different heading or in different colours being the only choice that is there. So, as I said at the outset, Senator Alston is correct to identify choice as a critical issue, but the opposition says that that is not the end of the matter. If choice is important, the product delivered by the ABC cannot be impugned, it cannot be attacked, it cannot be made less than that which is provided; and that occurs through adequate government funding, not slashing the budget by $55 million or $67 million or $80 million over a three- to five-year period. It is time to have that debate.  
So we say that the reference is limited in scope. The commercial arrangements relate to the matters referred to at Senate estimates last week in the context of the online environment and ABC editorial control and independence. The committee can report by 3 April and there is no reason why it should not. In terms of the lengthier issue in paragraph (c), we have already identified our comments. 
I suppose the final point I want to make is that Senator Alston made a lengthy song and dance for about five minutes about the urgency to conclude negotiations, that when you go to Silicon Valley you hop on the bus, you engage in negotiations for 24 hours and the deal is put on the table. There is a bit of hyperbole and exaggeration in that. As Senator Alston knows, this process was commenced by the ABC board 18 months ago. The first resolution went to the ABC board in February last year. In-principle agreement was given to negotiate. Negotiations did not commence until August and they went right through to December. We are only part way through the negotiations now. This is what Senator Alston described as a part-way process terms of agreement—nothing higher. So the fact that it might be done in 24 hours in parts of the United States is quite contrary to the facts in this case, where the negotiation process has taken almost 18 months to date. Another five or six weeks for the matter to be examined in passing by a Senate inquiry does not interfere with that. 
I confirm that the ALP will stick with its motion, as amended. We prefer our paragraph (c), and we will oppose the Democrat amendment. 
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Bourne on behalf of the Australian Democrats to Senator Bishop's amended motion be agreed to.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-02-17,"—I seek leave to move amended business of the Senate notice of motion No. 3 standing in my name. The amendment makes clear that the report date for paragraphs (a) and (b) is the interim report date of 3 April. The third paragraph deals with the report date of 30 October. 
—I do not have an amendment in those terms. 
—There is no amendment before the Chair at this time that I can see. Do you have a copy of the motion in amended form? I have Senator Bourne's amendment.
—I have a copy of the amended motion provided by the Clerk. 
—If Senator Bishop moves it by leave, I am sure it is something that the whole chamber would agree with. All it does is make sure that parts (a) and (b), which look into any online deals, finish by 3 April. Part (c), which is more extensive, will finish by 30 October. We all agree that that is the overall intent of the whole thing. If he could move it by leave, I do not think it would cause anybody a problem.  
—Is leave granted for that course of action?
—Yes. I presume that we will get written confirmation. 
—Leave is granted for you to move the motion in amended form. We will look forward to receiving the printed copy of the amended motion. 
—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and interim report on the matters specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) by 3 April 2000 and final report on the matters specified in paragraph (c) by 30 October 2000:
(a) any existing commercial arrangements for the production, supply or distribution of Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) material online, including, but not limited to, mechanisms for ensuring ABC editorial control and independence;
(b) any proposed commercial arrangements for the production, supply or distribution of ABC material online, including, but not limited to, mechanisms for ensuring ABC editorial control and independence; and 
(c) any additions required by way of amendment to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 or the ABC's charter to ensure the scope and effectiveness of the operation of the Act and the charter in the new online delivery environment.
The motion before the chair seeks to refer certain matters to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. Those matters are contained in the three paragraphs of the motion: firstly, in the existing commercial arrangements for the production, supply and distribution of ABC material online, including mechanisms for ensuring ABC editorial control and independence; secondly, any proposed commercial arrangements with the same caveat; and, finally, any additions by way of amendment to the ABC Act and the ABC charter to ensure the scope and effectiveness of the act and the charter in the new online delivery environment. As the amendments make clear, the report date for the matters in the first two paragraphs is by 3 April; the report date for the matter in the final paragraph is by 30 October this year.
The opposition have been making a number of points in this debate concerning the future of ABC Online services since about early February. We see no reason at this stage to depart from those arguments as they go to the heart of the motion before the chair. Firstly, the ABC has entered into a series of commercial arrangements with a large number of providers of online content. At least 10 companies are involved in those commercial arrangements. Telstra is admittedly the last but the highest profile user of content under discussion. As we all know, since coming to office this government has been relentless in its attacks on the ABC. It has slashed, and continues to slash, funding to the ABC whilst at the same time the ABC has had to live with three new realities: firstly, the technological convergence and need for creation of both new delivery systems and new or additional content; secondly, the coming reality of digital TV and new markets opened by that development; and, thirdly, the increasing value placed on content by the market.
These new realities can be understood only through the prism of lack of ABC funding certainty. This lack of ABC funding certainty is a deliberate decision of the current government. In short, the only reason the new commercial realities are on the table for review is that these new commercial realities may well threaten the independence of our national broadcaster. Indeed, the Melbourne Age ran a story today on this exact point. The equitycafe.com.au link site carries a list of ABC business stories which it has bought in a legitimate commercial deal. Around the page is a series of advertisements for magazines, travel and banks. Last week at estimates we were repeatedly told by the ABC management, in respect of non-exclusive content, that there was not, and there was not anticipated to be, any advertising—no advertising at all. It would be complete ABC editorial control and independence. 
The facts, as relayed by the Melbourne Age, show this to be different. Advertising is allowed—not around content but around the indexes on the link page which tell you where to go. That strikes me as a very fine distinction. It goes to the heart of the issue under discussion and the heart of the concerns repeated by the opposition. Is advertising allowed around ABC supplied content? We thought the answer was no. Mr Johns has repeatedly told us that the answer is no. Various officers of the ABC at estimates told us no. Telstra, through its officers, told us no. But apparently advertising is now allowed in certain areas, in certain sectors and by certain providers. I think it is fair to say that, at best, we have a halfway house. In certain circumstances, perhaps in limited circumstances, advertising is authorised and permitted.
The second point we have been making, and we wish to restate, is that the great danger of the proposed arrangement with Telstra, and possibly others, is that the commercialisation compromises the independent news gathering process of our national broadcaster. The great strengths of the ABC are its continent-wide coverage, a series of delivery systems, journalists and news people all around the country and a charter which has given it independence prescribed by law. These aspects, separately and aggregated, create value in the ABC. The independence of the ABC is its strength. Telstra and others seek to purchase product because of that value. That process they undergo has the potential to perhaps harm the source of that strength, that source of value. Indeed, the draft of the Telstra ABC contract arguably makes it clear this very independence is at risk.
Clause 4 of that draft contract deals with content to be licensed by the ABC to Telstra on a non-exclusive basis—nothing remarkable about that proposition, you would think, and not the subject of great discussion to date. But clause 4L of the draft agreement—and I state again it is a draft agreement; it is not yet signed off, so it is only a working document—says:
Subject to clauses 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 5G, 5H, 5O, 5K, 5L—
et cetera, and these are the important words—
Telstra will have absolute discretion over the use of ABC content and over how it places ABC content on its services.
I will say that again:
Telstra will have absolute discretion over the use of ABC content and over how it places ABC content on its services.
That is deliberately wide drafting. It arguably permits advertising because it allows Telstra `absolute discretion ... over how it places content'. We already have fine distinctions of advertising apparently not allowed on the page but allowed to be around the index that tells you where to look up particular articles.
In this contract, I am advised, there is no provision for mediation or arbitration of the disputed clauses. Telstra, it is agreed between the two parties, has absolute discretion, and it is clearly arguable that Telstra has the right to place advertising. We have had a similar mess-up—last week, I think it was reported—with Cable and Wireless Optus, where it was disclosed that Cable and Wireless are providing filtered content. That is, again, contrary to their undertakings, as I understand it, with the ABC, contrary to the commitments given to the opposition senators at last week's estimates and contrary to repeated comments made by Senator Alston on behalf of the government. It might be arguable that this is a result of misunderstanding or unclear interpretation or perhaps the actions of junior staff members or junior officials. But what it does make clear is that, in both the proposed contract with Telstra and the business with Cable and Wireless Optus, there is a difference of opinion between the negotiators of the various corporations, there is a different understanding by a range of the stakeholders and absolute guarantees that have been offered by the government and by the various senior executives of the ABC may not be as reliable as we have all hoped.
The third point I wish to make is that the Senate estimates process began the process of fleshing out the detail of the proposed contract. It established a number of points: that there was a non-exclusive content provision in the deal; that there were exclusive co-production agreements; that there were specific fees for the deal; that there is a large number of similar, if not identical, deals; that there was potential for advertising—not the actuality but the potential for advertising. There are apparent breaches of those rules already, and the attitude of the ABC board to new revenue streams was also interesting.  
The opposition believes that process has not yet been exhausted. A couple of hours of Senate estimates to deal with this one issue, amongst others, with two major corporations was insufficient time. We need a full and detailed examination, and that process, we believe, should be open and transparent. As I said before, paragraphs (a) and (b) go to the existing or proposed commercial arrangements for the production, supply and distribution of ABC material online and mechanisms for ensuring ABC editorial control and independence. Last week we were told it was not an issue, not a problem. We heard that from both the ABC and Telstra. Similar commitments were given with respect to advertising. Indeed, the Age article stated:
A spokesman for the ABC said yesterday: “There is no advertising allowed around any content.” But Ms Julianne Schultz, the ABC's corporate strategy manager, said last night the corporation allowed advertising around indexes. She admitted the ABC may have to review how much information is allowed on an “index” site.
So what was an absolute guarantee is now somewhat refined or diminished. Paragraph (c) is intended to be narrow, not wide. It is focused and not spread all over the place. The opposition is not seeking a full and wide-ranging inquiry into the act or the ABC charter. Paragraph (c) recognises the new online delivery environment as a fact of life and it asks whether the act needs to be reviewed in that limited light. So paragraph (c) is subject to the last few words in that paragraph itself: `in the new online delivery environment'.
But we know online delivery is topical. We know that e-commerce is emerging all over the place. We know that Internet gambling is a fact of life. And we know, from extensive debates last year on another matter, that the distribution of illegal or salacious material over the Internet is a fact of life. All of these issues—e-commerce, Internet gambling, online delivery of product, new revenue streams—pose new challenges, and they sometimes pose different questions for policy makers. This, of course, is recognised in principle by the government. Last year they urgently brought forward extensive debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill, concerning the regulation of illegal or improper material and its distribution online. The government has cooperated with an inquiry before the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies into Internet gambling, which had its final hearings yesterday, and a report is anticipated to come down in some four or five weeks.
The Productivity Commission in its recent report on gambling around Australia recognised this issue of Internet gambling. It has delivered one or two chapters on Internet gambling and made a series of recommendations. The government has responded to one of those recommendations of the Productivity Commission on Internet gambling by setting up a ministerial council, and its first task is to look at some of the technical aspects and technical issues deriving from online gambling. We all know that there is a need for consumer protections and guarantees for e-commerce, and the government has been actively involved in that debate. So the issue in paragraph (c) as to a limited terms of reference inquiry into the ABC charter and act in the new online environment, going to its scope and effectiveness, is really quite unremarkable, and is consistent with a range of committee and legislative developments in this place over the last two or three years. It is also entirely consistent with the government's own actions and activities in a range of areas.
We do note that apparent division continues to be a fact of life within the ABC board. Some board members, we are told, want to sell online services. Others want to garnishee additional revenue from distribution of extra product. The government last week refused to guarantee the funding of ABC Online services. Other stakeholders want separate revenue streams independent of government. Other stakeholders want no change to the operation of the ABC, notwithstanding the huge degree of change and convergence which leads to different forms of opportunity. Mr Johns gave an impassioned defence of the entire deal but Friends of the ABC, through their public statements in New South Wales, have indicated a different attitude to the proposals enunciated by Mr Johns. However, the ABC content deal with Telstra does raise unresolved issues of advertising revenue streams, the nature of the commercial agreements and understandings by both parties to those agreements, the apparent breaches and confusion by content purchasers, and the effectiveness of the ABC in the new online environment. 
In closing, I will make the final point that there is also a precedent for the types of amendments that could emerge from the inquiry outlined in paragraph (c) of the terms of reference. The BBC act has been amended by the British parliament to take account of the new reality of the online world. This is going to be an issue in a whole range of jurisdictions. In our view, it is nothing particularly remarkable and is a routine process of the Senate and government. In summary, we believe the ABC was forced to enter into commercial arrangements because of the slashing of government funds over the last three or four years. The great danger of commercial agreements with Telstra is that they have the capacity to compromise the independent news gathering process of the ABC, and we believe the whole process should be examined by the public through an open inquiry. It is not our intention to delay the interim inquiry into commercial arrangements. We hope it can report by 3 April. The broader issue of ABC activity in the online world has until 30 October. But, again, I state for the record that it is not our intention to have a wide-ranging inquiry. Accordingly, I commend the motion, as amended, to the chamber.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of clarification: could I invite Senator Bishop to indicate why it is that Mr Smith on a number of occasions has said that this matter was to be referred to the Senate standing committee on—
—Order! That is not a point of clarification.
—It is. I am coming to the form of this notice of motion, which is to refer the matter to a references committee, and I want to know why there has been this change. There was no explanation given in the course of Senator Bishop's 20-minute contribution, and it is very important for the Senate to understand.
—Minister, please resume your seat. I gave you permission to rise on a point of clarification. A point of clarification is not a debating point. There is time for you to debate the matter, and you can get your clarification during the debate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-02-17,"—The Democrats have to agree with the ALP. As far as we can see, most of the problems that the ABC is currently experiencing—and there are an awful lot of them—stem from the lack of adequate funding. I do not think anybody doubts that there is a lack of adequate funding of the ABC. We could go over Mr Mansfield's report again, where even he thought that $500 million was the minimum that you needed to run a national radio and television broadcast service. And, of course, when you take the orchestras out, they do not have that much.
One part of the funding that worries me very considerably at the moment is the proper funding of the ABC to go to the digital environment. That is a really huge problem. I suspect it is still a huge problem within the cabinet—whether it is going to be funded at all. I think it has been a huge problem all along. I could be completely wrong. I hope to goodness I am and the minister will get up and tell me that the ABC will be fully funded to go to digital in the next budget and more, which would be excellent. Bring them back up to $500 million while we are at it! But I fear that will not be the case.
As far as this motion goes, the ABC-Telstra agreement has been examined in estimates. We are supporting parts (a) and (b) of the terms of reference of the inquiry. The essential difference between this inquiry and estimates is that external comment is not allowed in estimates. It is between members of parliament and the department—or the minister, really, helped by the department. We think there will be a lot of interest from the public in putting submissions and giving evidence, and that facilitates public discussion. 
After all, over the past five years ABC Online has grown into a really strong, a really innovative and a really wonderful part of the ABC. It is one of the best ways, especially in the current environment, of getting out information and allowing people to have a look as they wish at information that the ABC news and current affairs—and the other branches of the ABC—can give them. I use it all the time. I understand it has the second highest hit rate of any Australian Internet site. Probably half of those hits come from my office during the day when we log on to abc.net.au to find out what is going on in Australia and the wider world outside this building.
I know the aim of the third part of the inquiry, as Senator Bishop has put it up, is to explore ways to formally acknowledge both the evolution of ABC Online and that ABC Online is an integral part of the ABC. That is a fairly sensible thing to do. It is going to happen anyway when the digital legislation comes up. The whole issue of the way we see, hear and get our news is changing, and it is changing very rapidly. Within about 10 years, the way we all look at news will be very different from the way it is now.
I wish to amend paragraph (c) of Senator Bishop's motion. I have circulated a proposed substitution for that paragraph. I move: 
Omit paragraph (c), substitute:
(c) any extension to legislation which could be considered to ensure that the ABC is able to effectively provide an independent, innovative and comprehensive service in the online delivery environment.
I have taken bits of my amendment out of the charter on innovation and comprehensive service, and it reflects the fact that the ABC is, of course, independent. The reason that I prefer this paragraph to the ALP's is that I have a fear and the people whom I respect in the ABC also have a fear—and who can blame them—that the ABC's charter could be opened up. I know that is not Senator Bishop's intent, but I fear that, if it is in the terms of reference of the inquiry, the ABC's charter could be opened up and made far broader than any additions required because of Online. I think the ABC is going to have to face getting its online delivery service into the act some time, and I think it is going to have to face that sooner rather than later. The ABC itself, I understand, has a legal opinion that there is no problem with it creating Online, using Online and developing Online, as it is now. That is fine but I think, as things change, it would be more sensible for the ABC to have a strong integral part of its act that says that it has both a right and a duty to deliver information in a comprehensive, innovative and independent way—as it does now and as it has done for more than, I think, 60 years—to the Australian public.
The ABC has the right and the duty to do that under its act. I would rather see that spelt out because I think things are changing at such a rate that that is going to become inevitable. Before it becomes inevitable, having what I hope would be a sensitive and sensible look at where we should be going, on this at any rate, in the near future—and I hope into the distant future as well—would be of no harm to the ABC. I think, if that is done properly—and I certainly hope that it would be done properly—it would be of assistance to the ABC. I have moved my amendment because, as I said, I would prefer that the charter was not mentioned. I have not even mentioned the name of the act, but I guess that would be the chief legislation we would be looking at. There are other bits of legislation that may be of interest there.
This is a difficult one because there are people within the ABC, as I said, whom I respect and like, and I think their views are usually—almost always—very sensible views. I can understand the feeling of not wishing to have the charter gone through and beaten about with big heavy bludgeons, which is something that appears to us to be happening, by some people within the board anyway. We think the charter as it stands is very good and that the act as it stands is very good; we just think that there may be some amendment that may be looked at which would make Online an integral part of the ABC, even in legislation. I know it can be picked up in general under the ABC Act, but I think that, if it were specified, that would make the case stronger to maintain Online—not to be able to sell off Online. That would be an absolutely appalling idea. It really is a very integral part now of the ABC, and I think making it integral as part of the legislation would be a very sensible move to ensure that it cannot be sold off without major ructions going on inside the parliament. I think it has to be maintained because it is the way of the future. It is the way in which we are going and it is what is going to happen. In five or 10 years, at least inside the cities, we will probably end up with fibre optic cable, or a better technology that we do not even know about yet, inside our homes and we will be able to both download a lot of information and have a channel to send back information. 
The ABC ought to be an integral part of that. They ought to be on top of that, as they are now. This is one of the best sites in Australia. I want to maintain the fact that this is one of the best sites in Australia and make sure that it is able to grow. The best way to do that, of course, would be to give them extra funding, and that is what should be being done. The government should be doing that. It has a duty to fund the ABC to carry out their charter and to digitise. I am sure that the minister is aware of that, but I am not quite so sure that others in the cabinet are just as aware of that. Perhaps they all ought to be sent the act so that they can have a read and realise what their duty is in relation to this. However, we support paragraphs (a) and (b) because, as I said, we would like to see external comment on this. I think there are a lot of people out there in the general public—they have certainly got in touch with me—who feel that they would like to have their say. I think that would be of interest, but not necessarily to tell the board what to do because it is, after all, up to the board. I know that there is agreement across the chamber that it is up to the board to decide how to go about this, but I think the board should have the information that the general public can provide as it makes those deliberations. These deliberations will, of course, take a couple more months—particularly if it reports by 3 April, which I think is entirely possible with that committee. I have been told that that is possible.
In terms of paragraph (c), as I said, I would prefer that the charter and the act itself were not named. We have a similar sort of intent with my proposed amended paragraph (c) and I would hope that that could be agreed to. Let me finish by saying, again, that the problems of the ABC are such that the ABC needs to be properly funded to go into the digital environment—and we all know how much they need because Arthur Andersen did an independent review and told us that the ABC were right and, remarkably, the amount that Arthur Andersen suggested for the digitisation of a national rural and metropolitan ABC is less than the commercial television stations tell us they need just for their metropolitan operations. I cannot see that the ABC could go down a cent from what Arthur Andersen says is the minimum that they need. I hope to goodness that the cabinet understands that. I know the minister does, and I hope that he can convince his colleagues of this point of view. If he would like me to send the Arthur Andersen report, with the relevant bits highlighted, to his cabinet colleagues I would be more than willing to do that—and perhaps the charter as well, which they might like to read. 
In finishing, let me say that, when you come down to it, I think funding is at the basis of all of the ABC's problems. If it were properly funded, there probably would not even be consideration of a lot of this, but there may be. There may be consideration of it purely to get information out without needing to get the money in, in response. We will be supporting paragraphs (a) and (b) but we would rather see our paragraph (c). I will be voting for our paragraph (c) and not for the opposition's paragraph (c).",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-02-17,"—There are a number of furphies in this debate. The first is that somehow some years ago we singled the ABC out for some special treatment when we had to try to make changes to repair the $10 billion budget black hole that we had inherited from the Labor Party. But we did that virtually across the board in the public sector. So the ABC certainly was not singled out. We gave very extensive notice. We waited until the end of the existing triennial funding agreement and we foreshadowed that in the next agreement there would be a $55 million reduction in funding for the ABC. 
The ABC has since on a number of occasions made it plain that `One ABC' has been a great management restructuring success. One ABC effectively meant that, instead of having separate management streams for radio and television, you combined the two; you adopted modern management practices; you introduced a flatter management structure. As a result, they say that they have achieved a $28 million saving. In other words, more than half of that amount of $55 million has been met by management restructuring which the ABC itself says has been a very significant achievement in terms of greater productivity and performance. There is absolutely nothing that current discussions have to do with somehow redressing that funding imbalance.
The fact is that the ABC has been able to develop its online site—with our support from the very outset—very effectively. For Senator Bourne's information, it is rating about No. 5 in the list of the most popular web sites. It has about three million hits a week. It is clearly an ongoing source of great interest. The real challenge is whether the ABC, particularly news and current affairs, remains relevant in the digital environment. That is the challenge. Do you want to consign the ABC to a backwater; do you want to just have it adhere to its traditional practices; or do you really want it to get a slice of the action?
—You cut their funding. 
—I am just making the point that ABC Online has emerged as a very successful venture. 
—You never funded it. It is no thanks to you. 
—They have done it—that is the point—with the existing level of funding. Back in the 1980s when you were keeping the lid on them, David Hill was off there and coming up with a whole set of new ventures. They have always been able to find new opportunities, and I commend them for it. This has been one of the most successful.
Another great furphy, which I presume is being peddled out of ignorance rather than malice, is that there are some board members who want to sell off online services. I am not aware of any such suggestion. I am aware that one board member proposed selling off a minority stake in ABC Online. That is exactly what Telstra was talking about doing last week; it is exactly what PBL have done with ecorp; it is exactly what Murdoch is talking about doing with a minority spin-off of his satellite services. In other words, this is conventional corporate structuring in the online environment. But the ABC seems to be utterly oblivious to that. You tell us that, because we have 50.1 per cent of Telstra, we have absolute control, we can run the show and we ought to tell Telstra what to do, et cetera. But, somehow, if the ABC were in absolute majority control of the online web site, you would argue that that is a compromise or that they lose control. The logic escapes me.
I am very interested to hear that Senator Bishop now says the opposition is not seeking a full and wide-ranging inquiry into the act or charter. That is a breathtaking climb down from where Mr Smith has been in recent times. This is what Mr Smith wanted on 14 February—that is just this last Monday:
... Labor will recommend that the terms of reference for such an inquiry examine the reach and relevance of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the ABC Charter for the future, given the emergence of new technologies ...
He also said only yesterday that he wanted an `inquiry into anything that the national broadcaster does or proposes to do'. Talk about death by a thousand cuts. He wanted to veto this original Telstra-ABC deal. He said, `It was red hot. Frankly, they ought to stop it.' I do not know why he kept using the word `frankly'. I presume it is because normally he is not frank and this was to be the great exception. But there he was saying that this ought to be vetoed and then he wants to have a rolling series of reviews. So I suppose over the next nine months any deal that the ABC comes up with has to be gone over with a fine toothcomb by people in the Senate who think that there is a bit of grandstanding mileage to be made. 
This is an environment in which people have to be very fast and very flexible. If you have been to Silicon Valley, as Senator Lundy has, you will know that deals are done in 24 hours. Deals are done on the run. But for the ABC it is different because they have statutory obligations; they have a charter that guarantees independence; and they have someone who has consistently over many years been a fierce proponent of that, Mr Johns, now giving assurances that they will at all times adhere to those obligations. No-one has suggested they will not. All that has happened is that the Labor Party wants to ignore the fact that written into that agreement is a very clear clause that says that Telstra acknowledges the independence and integrity of the ABC. Of course, that is only right and proper. In fact, it is required by law.  
So there is all of this nonsense about `We want to be sure that you don't compromise independent news gathering processes.' How are they compromised? I do not understand this. Mr Smith did not even seem to understand the difference between coproductions and normal activities, as though coproductions were somehow something new and horrible and should never be contemplated. We had an inquiry some years ago in which I was involved which looked at coproductions and the ABC and whether there were some excesses in current arrangements. But, as we know, SeaChange and Frontline and a whole series of ABC success stories have been coproductions. McFeast was a coproduction. So coproductions ought not be anything new to be worried about. But somehow the ALP seems to think this is yet another example of commercialisation that is unacceptable.
The ABC does get involved in a number of commercial activities. The bookshops are all about commercialisation. All of the promotions that are given on the ABC about buying products from the ABC are commercial examples. The critical issue is whether or not the ABC will be compromised in its news gathering activities, whether it will be leant on to give a different priority to news stories. It is not. Dr Julianne Schultz has made this very clear. To the extent that there is a capacity for Telstra to offer advice and be properly listened to in terms of mix and variety, it is in relation to genres; it is not in relation to news and current affairs. There is no way that the ABC for a moment would allow any tampering or modifying of its news selection processes—and, of course, as it is a party to any ultimate contract arrangement, it will have the capacity to enforce that contract to require that there be no interference with any presentation of news and current affairs.
So, again, this is a complete furphy. What this is about is non-news and non-current affairs. In other words, you have a choice of genres. The ABC thinks comedy is terrific, so it serves that up. The punters do not like it when visiting the Telstra super site, they turn off in droves and Telstra says, `Well, hang on, surely you can do a bit better than that. Why don't you come up with a different comedy format; why don't you come up with something in a different space altogether?' It might be educational programs, it might be environment or Discovery documentaries. That is a perfectly sensible response to commercial realities. But, as far as news and current affairs are concerned, that is entirely different.
Again, we are talking here about organisations, like Telstra and other portals, offering people a range of choices. So you go to the home page, you want news and you see that you have a selection on a menu. You can have NBC, American ABC, CNN, Channel 9 Australia or ABC Online news. That is a matter of choice. No-one is forcing you to go there. It is not as though you are deliberately turning on Channel 2 and sitting there and saying, `Isn't this terrific? No ads. That's my choice, I'm watching it.' Here you have a choice, a smorgasbord of choices. How does it compromise the ABC if people want to go and visit the ABC web site? In other words, if they go from the link on the Telstra home page through to ABC news, which is completely unamended, they get the ABC's presentation—their suite of offerings in news and current affairs. That is what they want, and that is what they get. Telstra understands—and is prepared to pay something in the order of $65 million over a five-year period—that the ABC has a unique brand that relies on independence, integrity and lack of advertising. That is the very sort of reason why people might want to go to that web site.
But is anyone seriously suggesting that, because you go to a portal and it has a banner ad at the top or a strip of ads on the side, somehow that is compromising the integrity of the ABC, that that would make people say, `Oh, I don't want to drill down to the ABC news site because I saw a horrible, filthy, disgusting advertisement for Kids-R-Us on the side of that web site'? It is a preposterous suggestion. It is simply pandering to the lowest common denominator argument out there that somehow, if the ABC has anything to do with commercial activities, it will be compromised. Of course it will not be. The choice is whether the ABC will have the opportunity to compete with other news gathering enterprises or whether it will be consigned to oblivion, whether it is going to have to rely on people going directly to its web site. As we know, portals are gathering speed and momentum all the time. Yahoo and AOL are two of the best examples. Why do you think the ABC has signed up with them? Why do you think they have had these commercial agreements over the last 12 to 18 months? Because they want a slice of the action. They want to see the ABC news presentation available to as many people as possible on traditional terms; in other words, with no ads inside that site. 
So you can grandstand as much as you like, but it is quite clear that the ALP is simply involved in a massive trawling exercise which is designed to paralyse the ABC, to marginalise it and to consign it to irrelevance. The best example of this and why, no doubt, I was not able to ask the question in its entirety—but I am sure that Senator Bishop will deal with it adequately in his reply—is that Mr Smith was out there for days saying that he wanted this to go to the IT select committee. That is a place where I can well understand he would want to send it because it is all about the digital environment, new technologies, new media enterprises and the like. But no, what happened is that, having said that repeatedly, he discovered that that was not the committee with the numbers that he wanted. So, all of a sudden, this goes to a references committee where the government does not have the numbers. So it simply exposes the nakedness of this whole exercise. This is entirely political grandstanding; it has nothing to do with concern about these two activities.
Mr Smith talks about reviewing the charter, reviewing the act—reviewing everything that moves with the name ABC attached to it. Mansfield came out and recommended that we amend the charter to give greater protection in terms of regional activities, news and current affairs and children's television. No, the ALP would not have a bar of it. It does not want any of that to be tampered with. Now, for no apparent reason, because the ALP has not been able to point to any deficiency in the act, it wants to have this massive trawling exercise. I must say that I thought it was really a world first when the ABC put out a release accusing the ALP opposition of intruding on ABC independence, making it clear that almost everything that had been said to date by the ALP was wrong:
In the midst of Mr Smith's selective quoting of a leaked working document, he fails to point out that the ABC would retain complete editorial control over every aspect of content in the arrangement with Telstra.
Why did Mr Smith not want to mention it? Because it did not suit his purposes. He wanted to pretend that somehow this was almost a done deal when it is actually an early version draft of a memorandum of understanding which is likely to provide the basis for a future contract arrangement. In other words, it is miles away from a completed deal. No, he does not want to mention the subservience of Telstra to the ABC in terms of editorial control or, indeed, all of the statutory protections that are built in. He said that he found it ironic that the federal opposition and others, in the name of protecting the independence and integrity of the ABC, are intruding on that very independence by seeking a parliamentary inquiry—an inquiry, incidentally, which would follow last week's intensive examination of the proposed agreement by Senate estimates.
It was not just questioning of the ABC. The first hour and a half was spent questioning Telstra. That is what led Mr Smith to go out and do a quick door stop to express shock, horror and outrage. Mr Smith has attacked proposed coproductions of online material with Telstra. He ignores the fact that not only will the ABC have total control over the content but that content will also be available for the ABC to use as it sees fit on its own web site. Claims that coproduction contents will be exclusively available to Telstra are totally false. It is perplexing Mr Smith objects so strongly to the coproduction principle.  
What I really thinks sticks in Mr Johns' craw is that there seems to be a blinding ignorance of not only existing arrangements but also the online opportunities that will simply bypass the ABC if it is not allowed to get on with it. It acknowledges up-front—and we would expect no less—that it has statutory and charter obligations. I have no reason at all to think that the board will not be entirely conscious of those matters and that it will adhere to them both in the spirit and letter. 
So what is it that we are told is deficient in current legislation that requires amendment? The answer is: `We do not know. We would like to have a long, drawn out nine-month inquiry to see whether we can come up with something that we might be able to impose on the ABC.' All this nonsense about, `Oh well, we now just want a little inquiry, thank you very much. We are not seeking a full and wide-ranging inquiry into the act or charter,' is not so at all. If the ALP had their way, they would be having a never-ending trawling through any existing or proposed commercial arrangements for the production, supply or distribution of material online. In other words, they want to second guess, they want to express their view on sensitive commercial negotiations and binding agreements. They want to be able to get out there and say, `No, that is not how the board ought to do it. We will run it our way.' 
The ALP is the only party in history that I can recall that went to an election—as they did last time—promising to give directions to the board about how they should spend money. They were going to give it on conditions. Here they are again. They are not respecting the independence of the board of directors. If they cannot stack it, as they did years ago, they want to be able to tell it what to do. If they cannot expressly do that from opposition, they want to paralyse it by having an ongoing, rolling series of committee assessments of anything commercial that the ABC might think of doing, when the rest of the world knows that most of these things involve a quick decision. If the ABC does not want to be part of a super site, plenty of others do—thanks very much, done deal, let's move on. That is the way this world operates. 
That is what the ABC quite rightly wants to get into. It understands the opportunities in new media. It has been very successful to date with its own web site. It has not been hampered in any shape or form by a lack of government funding. Yet now it is being told that it has to await the pleasure of a stacked Senate committee that is going to tell it what to do on a regular basis. It is going to reserve its right to disagree with everything that the board might do, everything that people negotiating might do. 
What an absolute nightmare for anyone who is trying to act commercially to be told, `You are subject to scrutiny at every stage of the process.' You cannot possibly enter into commercial agreements. People will run a mile. They will just say, `We cannot be bothered. We will sign up with CNN and a range of other news providers. We will leave the ABC out of it.' Is that what you really want to happen? Because that is exactly what will happen if this committee proceeds down the path that is proposed. 
If it comes to a choice between Senator Bourne's amendment in relation to (c) and the ALP's, I will support the Democrats'. Beyond that, we will oppose the entire proposition because it is totally unnecessary. It is putting the ABC in handcuffs. That may suit your political purposes. It does not suit the ABC. It is not something we support. I think the sooner you stop playing politics the better. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-02-17,"—I will briefly respond to the issues raised by the various participants in this debate. I will deal with which committee is appropriate, as raised by Senator Alston. It is appropriate for this matter to go to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and Arts References Committee for a range of reasons. Firstly, it is that committee and most of the members who are involved in the ongoing review of communication matters—whether it be digital TV or a range of other issues that have come up. It is those members who participate in the legislation committee who address the same sorts of issues relating to the ABC. The committee has developed the expertise, knowledge or some experience in a range of communications matters.  
The committee being discussed is after all the communications committee. The IT committee deals with a range of matters relating to information technology—a subset of which relates to communication matters. The broad references committee of the Senate is the instant committee and that is the only reason that the opposition is interested in referring this matter to that references committee. That committee has been established to receive these sorts of references to review.
In terms of the amendment proposed by Senator Bourne on behalf of the Democrats, the opposition has listened closely to her comments. As I compare the drafting in the Democrat amendment and our paragraph (c), they appear to me to be on broadly similar ground. We mention the ABC Act and the corporation's charter. The Democrats arrive at that by a different route—that is, they choose to extract particular words from the act in terms of their drafting. They appear to be on similar ground. We are concerned that the reference not be broad and wide ranging, as I indicated earlier and acknowledged by Senator Alston. That is why it is in the context of the new online delivery environment. We would prefer to retain our paragraph (c) and, hence, we will vote for that. If that is defeated, as appears likely as indicated by the government's advice via Senator Alston, we can live with that.
The issue addressed right through Senator Alston's comments was one of choice—the type of content you received, where you chose to access that content and the type of material delivered at a particular site or a particular portal. Senator Alston is correct to identify that issue. It is the issue that is under discussion because it does go to the matters under review and to the independence of the ABC. I would have had some sympathy for the proposition put a few moments ago by Senator Alston if he had put that proposition a week ago at estimates, because the various officers of both the ABC and Telstra gave the hardest, most rock solid undertakings and commitments in terms of respect of the ABC charter and its right to independence that anyone could possibly have asked for. Our problem is that, when it leaves the rarefied estimates atmosphere and it goes to implementation by a content receiver—Telstra or any of the other half a dozen or 10 that have been identified—and becomes the responsibility of various officers of ABC or the commercial enterprise they are dealing with, we have already had in the last week two instances of breach. 
We do not say that they were deliberate breaches, that they were breaches motivated by malevolence. They may well have been incidental or accidental or misunderstandings of the commercial relationship. But in the case of Cable and Wireless Optus, the product received was filtered—it was different. We do not say it was censored. We do not say there was any particular evil intent, but it was different, it was filtered. It was different to that which had been supplied by the ABC. That is breach No. 1. Breach No. 2 is referred to by the article I referred to in the Age at length where what was an absolute commitment to no advertising has now become `advertising around the index is okay'. It is a bit like the bucket: it is either half full or half empty. It does matter. Either you have advertising, either you have alternate revenue streams, either they are the dominant factor in the funding of an independent corporation—or they are not. You cannot have it both ways. 
Perhaps the Australian community, perhaps the Friends of the ABC, perhaps the opposition, perhaps the Democrats are content to have the ABC made into a near replica of all the commercial networks. Maybe we have changed our minds. But, if that is the case, let the public be informed. Let the public have their point of view. My own view is that we value independence. We value it being different. As Senator Alston indicated, we do value choice. We want real choice. We do not want eight versions of the same product under a different heading or in different colours being the only choice that is there. So, as I said at the outset, Senator Alston is correct to identify choice as a critical issue, but the opposition says that that is not the end of the matter. If choice is important, the product delivered by the ABC cannot be impugned, it cannot be attacked, it cannot be made less than that which is provided; and that occurs through adequate government funding, not slashing the budget by $55 million or $67 million or $80 million over a three- to five-year period. It is time to have that debate.  
So we say that the reference is limited in scope. The commercial arrangements relate to the matters referred to at Senate estimates last week in the context of the online environment and ABC editorial control and independence. The committee can report by 3 April and there is no reason why it should not. In terms of the lengthier issue in paragraph (c), we have already identified our comments. 
I suppose the final point I want to make is that Senator Alston made a lengthy song and dance for about five minutes about the urgency to conclude negotiations, that when you go to Silicon Valley you hop on the bus, you engage in negotiations for 24 hours and the deal is put on the table. There is a bit of hyperbole and exaggeration in that. As Senator Alston knows, this process was commenced by the ABC board 18 months ago. The first resolution went to the ABC board in February last year. In-principle agreement was given to negotiate. Negotiations did not commence until August and they went right through to December. We are only part way through the negotiations now. This is what Senator Alston described as a part-way process terms of agreement—nothing higher. So the fact that it might be done in 24 hours in parts of the United States is quite contrary to the facts in this case, where the negotiation process has taken almost 18 months to date. Another five or six weeks for the matter to be examined in passing by a Senate inquiry does not interfere with that. 
I confirm that the ALP will stick with its motion, as amended. We prefer our paragraph (c), and we will oppose the Democrat amendment.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-02-17,"—One aspect which concerned Senator Harradine yesterday when this legislation was before the Senate was the question of the appointment of more than one minister to administer a single department. What in effect we would have here is an appointment of the portfolio minister and then an appointment of a parliamentary secretary to that department. The draft Bills Digest mentions this. However, it does go on to say:
The Final Report of the Constitutional Commission (1988) accepted the view that section 64 may not prevent the appointment of more than one Minister to administer a single department - thus foreshadowing the sort of mechanism we see in the present Bill.
Quite squarely, we have a situation where the weight of expert opinion, legal opinion, has it that you can have the appointment of more than one minister to administer a single department. Indeed, in both this government and previous governments, we have had senior ministers and junior ministers administering the one department, albeit various parts of it. 
I say to Senator Harradine that this is not really an issue. It is one which the government has advice on, and I can assure the Senate that it does not present any problems. On that basis and because of the points I mentioned yesterday, I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-02-17,"—The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is, I think, a very important government commercially established entity. It performs a role that hitherto the private sector has been loath to commit themselves to. Its role is to insure Australian exporters against commercial risk when they are exporting goods or services, or commodities, to markets in which payment for their exports might be questionable. When you are dealing with some of those countries—some of which are in the Middle East, perhaps in some commodity areas currently in Russia or in some of the former Soviet republics—where you are selling to the state or to some commercial providers, if you are delivering over time there is a question mark over whether always you  will be paid in full.
Yet they are important markets. One does not expect these economies to remain poor economies forever; one expects them to grow. If Australia can nurture those markets and develop a `conactivity' between our exporters and their purchasers, then as those economies expand greater opportunity for Australian exports ought to arise. So that there is no commercial loss and exporters have some protection, it is very important that they have a forum to which they can go which can expertly assess what the country risk is and help them insure against loss in the event of under or non-payment.
That is an important function, because Australia has 1.7 million of its work force employed in industries which earn their livelihood from export. It is important because 21.3 per cent of our GDP is derived from export and the future of this nation in terms of being able to deliver better living standards to its community is dependent upon us being more aggressive in the international marketplace and expanding Australian exports. If we have saturated the domestic market, the only other markets open to us are those elsewhere in the world. If we can win a bigger share of those markets, quite clearly more Australians will get jobs in this country. If one looks at jobs in the export sector, these jobs tend on average to pay more than jobs in the domestic sector. They are better paid jobs. If those jobs are at the top end of our exports in the form of elaborately transformed goods—which is the statistical definition of complex and sophisticated manufacturing goods—then they are brain based jobs which go to Labor's vision for the future of this nation as an intelligent island and a country committed to a high paid, high skilled and highly educated work force.
In the context of all of that, EFIC plays an important role. In considering any proposed legislation pertaining to EFIC or trade, it is important to put the agency in the context of what it does. It is also important to put the agency and our trade aspirations in the context of this government's performance. It is important to recall three records that the Howard government now hold. Amidst all of the talk about fireproofing the Australian economy from the Asian downturn, they do not like us pointing out three basic and fundamental facts about Australia's export record under them. Australia now has the largest ever trade deficit in its history; a deficit of over $16 billion for the calendar year 1999. We have the largest ever current account deficit in our history; over $33 billion for the 1998-99 financial year or, if you want to take the calendar year concluded in the September quarter 1999, it went up another $1 billion to $34 billion for the 12 months to the end of the September quarter last year. We now have the highest level of net foreign liabilities, that is to say, we have borrowed more from the rest of the world than ever before. We are in greater debt than we have ever been. That is now figured at $358 billion to the end of September on a calendar basis last year. 
Put simply, regardless of what Australia's internal position might be or the strength of our domestic economy, our position with respect to the rest of the world has never been worse. Whilst we are buying and borrowing more from other countries, we are selling and repaying our loans at a lower level. A table produced by the Parliamentary Library explicitly sets out the trend. The line is relentlessly down in terms of trade deficit, current account deficit and net foreign liabilities. It is not just the broad statistics that are ugly; some of the detail does not make particularly pleasant reading, either. Consider the markets that we sell to. Our two largest Asian trading partners are Japan and South Korea. They are steadily pulling themselves out of recession, although there has been a bit of a blip downwards in Japan over recent months. Yet our exports to Japan as they have continued to come out of recession—and it is the same with Korea—remain flat, and those to South Korea recently dropped by a whopping 23 per cent. In other words, as their economies got bigger, we have sold them less and this is our prime market.
If senators think that is bad, try to imagine how the Howard doctrine is likely to affect our exports to Asia. As Griffith University's Professor Nancy Viviani put it back in September last year, John Howard has taken Australian foreign policy back to the 1950s and that is grim news for our exporters. The job of government in export industries is to open doors for exporters, not close them. A studied lack of interest in the region by this government, particularly from the Prime Minister, talk about Australia being a deputy sheriff to the US in Asia, and overweening hubris from Mr Howard strike a sour note among many of our Asian trading partners.
—Is that you or Viviani speaking? 
—That is me speaking. But Viviani made the point that the Howard doctrine and the stance by this government on foreign policy harks back to the 1950s. It does not look forward to this new century but is anchored somewhere in the middle of last century. It means commercial disadvantage for our exporters in the marketplaces so dear to us and so important to the growth of our external economy. 
—The place you fly over on your way to Paris—that sort of approach, is it? 
—They are the places I go to more often than anywhere else outside this nation. Take the composition of our exports as well. I have talked about markets. Let us look at composition. Recently released statistics show that our exports of manufactured goods fell over the past year. Not only did they fall overall, but the fall was greatest in elaborately transformed manufactures, the exports of which dropped by five per cent. That is, the goods that are the most complex manufactured goods involving the most intelligent input and the highest skill in Australia that we sell to the world, the ones that we want to make our mark on in the globe, actually declined. That is the legacy of this government. 
We want an intelligent Australia. The export market declined because the underpinnings that government brings to support the concept of a knowledge nation—the aspiration that Labor aspires to—have been removed by this government successively over time. The elaborately transformed manufactures sector, which we should be promoting if we are to realise the goal of creating a high skilled, high wage Australia, has been in decline and our exports of these goods have been shrinking. As I have said, Labor wants Australia to be the knowledge nation, to be a leader in the new economy and in the IT and information based economy of this century. But the Howard government is looking backwards to the past through a glass darkly, believing that educational opportunity will trickle down if you privatise our school system and that equality of opportunity will somehow emerge out of a harsh application of rational economic theory. That is not true. In order to lift our economic and trade performance in this area, we need to support our education system more strongly. 
It is necessary to remember this background when we turn to the EFIC Amendment Bill. This bill applies the principles of competitive neutrality to EFIC, ensuring that as a government business it does not have competitive advantages over its private sector competitors simply by virtue of public ownership. Labor support the principle of applying competitive neutrality to Commonwealth statutory authorities. We support it so that competition in the marketplace is fair. We supported it in government under the Keating government. The notion of furthering the development of the private sector export insurance industry is, in our view, a goal worth striving for. 
Let us not make any mistake about this either. This bill, in some respects, bears the possibility of hurting Australian exporters at a time when our export performance is less than desirable. With respect to EFIC's short-term business, it imposes on them a new guarantee fee, a new debt neutrality charge and a tax equivalence payment to the government. Taken together, it is hard to estimate what effects these additional charges will have on EFIC, since the bill gives no clue as to how large they will be. The levels of those charges are left to be determined by the minister. But we do not have guidance as to what he will do about them. 
The general effect is clear. The Parliamentary Library said in its analysis of the bill: 
While overall it is not possible at this stage to estimate the total amount of the payments to the Commonwealth proposed by the Bill, it must be assumed that they will raise EFIC's costs, and unless corresponding savings can be found, EFIC will be forced to pass on these higher costs to exporters in the form of higher charges.
I find it hard to see why, at a time when Australia's trade deficit is at an all-time high, the government would be introducing a bill which may increase costs on exporters. This is all the more incredible when you consider that the explanatory memorandum to the bill states proudly: 
There has been no formal consultation with exporters.
Those considerations have to be borne firmly in mind. But in giving a rounded consideration to this bill, it must be said that, on the other hand, private sector competition in the field of export insurance can bring the advantage of more competitive fees for our exporters, greater private sector knowledge of international markets and help build an export culture in Australian industry that should be encouraged to develop further. Having said that, we are concerned, however, that private sector interest in this new market which will be opened by the imposition of competitive neutrality to EFIC will focus only on the most profitable sectors of the market, leaving EFIC to mop up in the less profitable sectors in the national interest and take a national interest responsibility for financial markets, driving EFIC into marginal or unprofitable activity.
I remind the Senate that EFIC is a commercial agency that is required to operate commercially. If it is driven to marginality or unprofitability, that affects its commercial viability quite profoundly. If that occurs, I want to put on the record now that the Labor Party would not support any attempts by the government to further undermine EFIC in whatever form, particularly if they attempt to point to its commercial performance, driven by the nature of this legislation, and argue, therefore, that EFIC is not commercially viable or competitive. If that were to be raised, the Labor Party would not support this legislation. We would seek to entreat the government to return EFIC to a more viable format.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-02-17,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Given the government's intention to launch another extravagant multimillion dollar ad campaign promoting the GST, will the minister inform the Senate as to whether public opinion research will be commissioned and, if so, who will it be carried out by, when will it occur and what will be the expected cost of the research? Will the results of this research be made public to demonstrate that it is truly a non-political exercise and will the minister give a firm guarantee that this research will not be focus testing Labor Party ads from previous election campaigns as the 1993 ads were misused during the 1998 focus groups?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Tax Reform: Public Opinion Research</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,question

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-02-17,"—I appreciate the question from Senator George Campbell because it allows me to talk about another part of the continuing campaign to accurately and properly inform the Australian people about a very significant and substantial change in the tax system. I think it is very clear that this tax system is going to provide very extensive benefits to Australian families, taxpayers and pensioners—indeed, to all groups. This is a major reform of the tax system. Nothing like this, I believe, has ever been attempted before. We are bringing our tax system into a position where we are world competitive. We make no apology for trying to continue with reform to ensure that Australia remains at the top of the growth ladder, that we can continue to deliver rising real wages to Australian workers and that we can continue to ensure that we maximise the disposable incomes of Australian families. So we make no apologies for the changes that we are making. We went to the election on change, we received a mandate to do it and we are going to do it.
—Madam President, on a point of order—
—Senator Kemp, please sit down. There is a point of order. 
interjecting—
—After your Collins class effort, I wouldn't say too much.
—Order! Senator Kemp and Senator Ray are behaving in a disorderly fashion. I have recognised Senator Faulkner to raise a point of order.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order on relevance. Could I draw your attention to the fact that Senator Campbell asked Senator Kemp a very specific question about public opinion research: who it would be carried out by and what the cost of it would be. He also asked whether it could be made public and about the nature of focus groups. He was not asking for apologies from Senator Kemp; he asked a very specific question. Given that the minister has been rambling on his feet now for two minutes, I wondered if you could draw the minister's attention to the important question asked by Senator Campbell and direct the minister to either answer it or, if he cannot, to admit that he cannot and take it on notice.
—Senator Kemp has had a long preamble to the answer, but I do draw his attention to the question that has been asked.
—My understanding was that the question was about the education campaign on the new tax system, and that is exactly what I was talking about. Can I say that, unlike the Labor Party—through you, Madam President, to Senator George Campbell—we will conduct all our affairs with the utmost propriety. We will adhere to proper processes and to proper rules. If one harks back, I think to the previous election campaign, Senator Faulkner jumped up and made a song and dance about it. It went to the Auditor-General and Senator Faulkner struck out on every clause and every complaint. Can I put it to Senator George Campbell that we will be ensuring that proper processes, as always, are followed.
Seeing as I have one minute to go, I think I should bring to the attention of the Senate a very important development that has occurred in the last 24 hours. The Labor Party have indicated very clearly in the parliament that they will continue with the GST. After all the debates in this chamber about what a terrible tax system Labor was claiming it to be, the Labor Party have said that they will continue with it.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2000-02-17,"—I present the annual report of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances for 1998-99. 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report. 
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The tabling statement read as follows—
I wish to make some brief comments on the two reports that I have just tabled on behalf of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee.
The 108th report of the Committee reviews the work of the Committee in 1998-99. The report records that during the period:
the Committee scrutinised 1672 instruments, approximately 200 fewer than in the previous year, a decrease that may have resulted from the election period in the second half of 1998;
instruments tabled in the parliament covered the gamut of government activity, across 17 portfolio areas;
the proportion of Statutory Rules to other disallowable instruments remains relatively low at 19 per cent; and
the volume of delegated legislation remains high compared to 10 years ago when less than 700 instruments were tabled in a financial year.
In 1998-99, the Committee had concerns with 107 instruments and sought substantive responses from Ministers and other officials. As the report records, some of these matters related to relatively minor matters, such as ensuring proper numbering, citation and cross-referencing. Other matters related to more significant legal and technical difficulties that the Committee identified when applying its principles of scrutiny.
I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard a summary of these principles and the approach adopted by the Committee:
Principle (1): Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?
technical validity and effect
compliance with enabling Act and any other legislation such as the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and in other respects, be validly made.
generally void if instrument purports to subdelegate legislative power without express authority. 
legislative instruments that take effect before gazettal and that affect adversely any person other than the Commonwealth, are void under subsection 48(2) of the Act Interpretation Act.
legislative instruments may incorporate or adopt the provisions of an Act or other legislative instrument in force from time to time. However, it may only incorporate other material as in force or existing when the incorporating instrument takes effect, in accordance with section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act.
certainty of meaning and operation.
possible breaches of parliamentary propriety
drafting defects
inadequate explanatory material
proper numbering and citation.
Principle (2): Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?
rights of individuals are protected
unreasonable burdens are not placed on business
fees, allowances and expenses are not unfair or unusual
right to privacy is protected
offence provisions include appropriate safeguards
terms and conditions of public sector employment operate fairly.
Principle (3): Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent upon administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?
discretions should be as narrow as possible, include objective criteria to limit and guide their exercise, and include review of the merits of decisions by an external, independent tribunal, which would normally be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal
commercial, livelihood and personal implications.
express statement required that power must be exercised reasonably 
decision should be notified within 28 days
notice of appeal rights and availability of statement of reasons for decision should be given to affected person.
Principle (4): Does delegated legislation contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?
legislation which fundamentally changes the law
legislation which is lengthy and complex
legislation which intended to bring about radical changes in relationships or community attitudes
legislation which is part of a uniform laws scheme.
Of the 107 instruments that were of concern, the Committee gave notice of motion in the Senate to disallow 12 instruments. The report in Chapter 3 records the Committee's specific concerns with these instruments, its correspondence with Ministers and the successful resolution of these matters.
The annual report records and I am sure the Senate will also acknowledge the comprehensive, diligent and persistent work of the members of the Committee during 1998-99 and in particular the outstanding contribution of the former Chair, Bill O'Chee.
The second report I have just tabled is the Delegated Legislation Monitor for 1999. This document provides comprehensive information on every disallowable instrument tabled in the Parliament last year. This is the first time the Monitor has been tabled in the Senate. The Committee does so, as this is the only document that provides a comprehensive record of disallowable instruments. As usual, the Monitor will be available from the Internet at www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/regord_ctee

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-02-17,"—I move: 
That the Senate take note of the document.
Report No. 10 of the Productivity Commission is a very significant report on gambling industries in Australia. It is three volumes thick and certainly the most comprehensive examination of gambling as an industry in Australia. It follows comments made by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, expressing concern about the social impact of the gambling industries in this country, following their expansion in recent decades, and also comments by the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, who referred this matter to the Productivity Commission. As a personal view I have significant concerns about the social impact of the increase in gambling in Australia.  
On page 21 of the report in volume 1 there is identification of problem gamblers. The report states that problem gamblers are estimated to account for one-third of the total $3.6 billion spent on gambling in this country; and that, on average, the annual losses by problem gamblers amount to $12,200 a year, whereas the average loss for other gamblers amounts to $650 a year. There are estimated to be 250,000 adults who experienced significant harmful effects from gambling in the last 12 months.
Page 22 says that the most significant expenditure share of problem gamblers by category relates to gaming machines, such as poker machines. Their numbers have undergone an enormous expansion in this country over the last 10 years. If we look at page 25, the impact on the community of problem gambling is well identified in the illustrative diagram. There is reference to the adverse impact on work and study; the personal impact with stress, depression, anxiety and poor health; the financial impact; the legal impact with theft and imprisonment; the interpersonal impact with relationship breakdown, domestic or other violence and neglect of family; and the impact on a range of community services.
This is a very important report, and I urge all senators to have a good look at it, despite its enormous length. Table 5 on page 26 shows the estimated number of gamblers experiencing adverse impacts and says that 49,200 persons are adversely affected in terms of their job performance. Ten thousand persons are impacted in terms of crime, excluding fraudulently written cheques, 39,200 people experience the break-up of a relationship, and 70,500 suffer from depression. Flowing on from that, there are some serious statistics concerning the consideration of suicide and attempted and completed suicide.
There is a very significant adverse impact of gambling in this country. It should be said that the considerable majority of people in this country are responsible gamblers. However, a problem gambling population of 250,000, a quarter of a million Australians, is a very compelling and serious figure. I hope that the 24 major recommendations which are contained on page 2 are implemented. The government were put to the test in respect of the GST and the impact of the GST on high rollers, and they were found wanting. It is all very well to do a study, but I certainly hope that the federal Liberal Party and National Party are prepared to ensure that these recommendations are implemented to try to minimise this adverse impact on our community. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. (Time expired)

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-02-17,"—I present report No. 29 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties entitled Singapore's use of Shoalwater Bay, development cooperation with PNG and protection of new varieties of plants. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The report deals with three treaties. I want to address my remarks to the first one—that is, the one that deals with the use of Shoalwater Bay training area by the Singapore Armed Forces. There is an agreement between Singapore and Australia that, at specific times, the Singapore Armed Forces will be able to make use of the Shoalwater Bay training area, and they do so. The agreement has been completed between the two nations, but when the treaty came before the committee it was thought appropriate to go to Rockhampton to view the area. There is concern that this very beautiful area should be preserved as far as possible. 
—Indeed it is.
—As Senator Gibbs says, indeed it is. I know you have done a lot of work up in that area, Senator Gibbs, and I note that as I address this issue. Nevertheless, the Australian armed forces, the Singapore Armed Forces and indeed other forces such as those of the United States use this area. I think the Singaporeans do it on a biennial basis. In any event, we went there to see how the town reacted to the presence of these forces and how the area was treated. I would like to say that diplomacy is of course carried out in the interests of the people who are parties to the treaty or the agreement, but I suggest it is always much easier to make agreements, to welcome agreements and to keep them going if graciousness is shown on each side. I say in this case that this is what happened. The people who represented Singapore were people of great grace and were intelligent, highly experienced, highly learned and full of graciousness. I want to comment on that. I want to mention specifically Mr David Lim, who is the Minister of State for Defence from Singapore. He thought the matter of such importance as to justify him coming out here. He knows Australia well, of course.
I would like to thank him for the courtesy and for the way they looked after me and Senator Ludwig, who, like Senator Gibbs, is from Queensland; they are both great Queenslanders. They all enabled us to see how the treaty was working out. They treated us with great hospitality and openness. They made things quite clear to us. Whatever we wanted to know, they were prepared to tell us. I also mention Dr Bernard Chen, a member of the group of representatives for the defence, Colonel Chang Long Wee, who was the Singapore armed defence forces attache, and the whole of the forces. I mention people in the local council, such as Mr Jim McRae, the state government officials, Mr Barry Large and the local business community. I particularly mention the conservation group. There is a conservation group that spends a lot of time and anxiety in making sure that this beautiful part of the world is kept beautiful. 
Finally, I want to talk for a little while about the secretariat to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I mention in particular Mr Patrick Reagan, who is leaving the committee and going to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I think he was with that committee before. He will no doubt serve that committee with the enthusiasm, ability and learning with which he has served this committee. I take this occasion to thank him for all the work he has done, all the advice he has given and all the guidance he has offered the committee while he has been there. His leaving will constitute a loss to this committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

I mention people in the local council, such as Mr Jim McRae, the state government officials, Mr Barry Large and the local business community. I particularly mention the conservation group. There is a conservation group that spends a lot of time and anxiety in making sure that this beautiful part of the world is kept beautiful. 
Finally, I want to talk for a little while about the secretariat to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I mention in particular Mr Patrick Reagan, who is leaving the committee and going to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I think he was with that committee before. He will no doubt serve that committee with the enthusiasm, ability and learning with which he has served this committee. I take this occasion to thank him for all the work he has done, all the advice he has given and all the guidance he has offered the committee while he has been there. His leaving will constitute a loss to this committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. 
Leave granted; debate adjourned. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,22,2,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-02-17,"—Tonight I want to highlight what I believe is the continuing bias by the Howard government against residents of Sydney's west. I am referring in particular to this ongoing scandal about federation funding grants. I remind senators that something like 1.8 million people live in the electorates comprising Sydney's west. That comprises nearly 10 per cent of Australia's population. In the 11 electorates mentioned, there are something like 950,000 voters. The region is diverse and talented and comprised of a lot of hardworking, honest, taxpaying Australians. Yet when it comes to fair and equal treatment by this government, they have missed out, particularly with regard to funding grants. It reminds me of a view that we believe this government has about Sydney, which is that it stops at Strathfield and starts again at Leura in the Blue Mountains. 
In a number of those electorates a number of funding applications were made, and I will tell you about those. There was one that was successful, which was St Barnabas Anglican Church at Prospect. They were lucky also to pick up with the National Trust a number of projects that were nominated by them. However, only one of those projects in Western Sydney was successful; 35 were not. I might just highlight a number of the projects that did not receive funding from this government: the upper room at Castlereagh Penrith Lakes Academy, which is believed to be the site of the first Methodist church in the Southern Hemisphere; the restoration-rebuilding project in Parramatta of St Patrick's Cathedral; the female orphan school at Parramatta, the only Macquarie era building not yet restored; the St Mattias Church and hall at Parramatta; the regional Federation Park at St Marys; and the conservation of Hadley Park at Penrith as well. 
This is a number of the projects that were put before the government and refused. In fact, Ross Cameron, the federal member for Parramatta, and Jackie Kelly, the federal member for Lindsay, nominated respectively 10 and eight projects. Not one of those projects was successful. Let me just name a number of the other projects that were knocked back: the Penrith Regional Gallery, the Parramatta Riverside Theatre, the Dame Joan Sutherland Performing Arts Centre and the steam tram trailer at Wentworthville. Yet somehow or another, by some means, the government was able to find $500,000 for a project called the Commonwealth Railways Museum in Adelaide and some money for the Community Arts and Cultural Centre at Frankston.
What is the difference between those projects? As we know from the Senate estimates committee, some 16 projects were not nominated by the various departments yet, by some underhanded or dishonest means, were approved by this government, by those ministers Hill and Alston, respectively a South Australian and a Victorian. They made these decisions, which have impacted on the projects that we would like to see occur and get the funding in Western Sydney. What have Mrs Kelly and Mr Cameron done to deserve being treated this way? I am aware from rumours that Mr Cameron is not all that popular with the Prime Minister. But, for heaven's sake, Mrs Kelly is supposed to be from Kelly country, one of our madonnas. She has been abandoned by them as well.
A number of these projects are of great historical, archaeological and cultural value. The 35 of them deserve the funding from that project. If we look in per capita terms at the money that was available, with 1.8 million people in Greater Western Sydney there should have been something like $7.8 million allocated. Yet I understand that just over $1.5 million was allocated. It seems, from what I understand, from the sneaky way in which this federation funding was handled, that most of the money went south. We will never know. In fact, the Auditor-General has said that the means by which this decision making was done would lead people to conclude only that it may not have all been that honest.
I believe that these projects were of inherent value. What this says to me is that those federal Liberal MPs representing parts of Greater Western Sydney are ineffective—that not one of the projects that they supported got up. I am not sure that Mr Cameron supported any that got up. As I say, we have very ineffective local representatives. All we need is support for these projects, so that they can be restored. As I say, they are of great historical value. The fact is the only Macquarie era building not restored is still waiting for funds from this government. It is about time it did something. I am sure that over the next period we will see the exposure of how this government made the decision on 16 projects.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Western Sydney</title>,Adjournment,23,1,speech
