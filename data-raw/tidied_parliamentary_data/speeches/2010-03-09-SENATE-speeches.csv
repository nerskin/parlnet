"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2010-03-09,"—I seek leave to make a statement on civilian casualties in Oruzgan province in Afghanistan.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate for its courtesy to enable me to make this statement. Yesterday evening, 22 February, the Chief of the Defence Force informed me that he had received reports of an incident in Oruzgan province that had tragically resulted in a large number of civilian casualties. According to a statement issued by ISAF commander General McChrystal, on Sunday, 21 February, an air strike had been conducted against a convoy of vehicles suspected of carrying Taliban insurgents. According to the COMISAF statement, when ISAF and Afghan ground forces arrived at the scene they found four women and one child amongst the casualties from the strike. A number of the injured were taken to medical facilities in Tarin Kowt. While the number of people injured or killed is not yet reliably known, it appears to be a very significant number—27, according to ISAF estimates.
CDF has informed me that current reporting indicates no Australian Defence Force personnel serving in Afghanistan were involved in requesting or carrying out the air strike. However, I can confirm that ADF medical personnel did provide specialist medical support on board the aeromedical evacuation helicopters which provided immediate medical assistance both at the incident scene and at the military hospital in Tarin Kowt.
This incident will be the subject of an ISAF investigation in partnership with the Afghan authorities. I can assure the Senate that I will take a very close interest in the investigation. At this stage I am not in a position to provide further information about the facts of this matter, and it would not be appropriate for me to do so with the investigation pending.
I can assure the Senate that the Australian Defence Force deploys with rules of engagement designed to ensure they minimise loss of life, especially civilian casualties. As would be expected, these rules of engagement comply completely with Australia’s domestic and international legal obligations. The ADF also takes all appropriate steps to ensure its operations do not put the lives of civilians or noncombatants in jeopardy.
The loss of innocent lives in incidents such as these is a tragedy. It is particularly distressing that this has occurred at a time when coalition forces are putting so much effort into Operation Moshtarak in neighbouring Helmand province. These efforts are aimed at protecting the Afghan population, reversing the Taliban’s momentum and creating the space to develop Afghan security and governance capacity. A key objective of Australian and international forces is to create a secure environment in which Afghan and foreign civilians alike can go about their daily life. I have to say that this objective is undermined by tragic events such as this.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my, the government’s and I know all senators’ sincere condolences to the families of those civilians killed in this tragic event, as well as wishing a speedy recovery to those that have been injured.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-03-09,"—by leave—I thank Senator Faulkner for so quickly acquainting the Senate with the tragic circumstances that have again unfolded with a heavy loss of civilian life in a bombing raid in Afghanistan. The whole world will shudder at the news that this was not Taliban, it was civilians in a convoy, and the death toll does include four women and a child. The question has to immediately arise: how could this happen? It is not as if it is new. In the operation in neighbouring Helmand province there have been two bombing raids that have led a large loss of civilian life in the last fortnight, and that comes after similar losses of civilian life going into the many thousands and rapidly growing. Last year, after what is now almost a decade of operations, the loss of civilian life in Afghanistan was the highest by a long shot, by many thousands, in this whole conflict—and it is rapidly mounting. The Senate will know that I have had a great deal of criticism of the Karzai government, but the Afghan government has criticised and condemned, again, this destruction of the lives of innocent civilians.
The question is: how is it that the ISAF, which are led by the United States, can repeatedly make such horrendous mistakes causing such a loss of civilian life in an age of such technological wizardry? The answer surely is that the human factor is missing. The answer surely is that the relationship between the Afghani people and the ISAF is not satisfactory. It is a long way short of that and the hand on the trigger is far too easy in bombing raids which lead to the loss of civilian life. On this occasion, Senator Faulkner has explained it was a convoy. How on earth could information that said ‘this is Taliban, bomb them’ not be checked and not be corroborated before the disastrous consequences that we see again unfold?
I reiterate that the Greens believe the Australian defence forces should be withdrawn from Afghanistan and our effort should concentrate on civil assistance to that nation because of the intractable nature of the war that is going on in Afghanistan at the moment. We are seeing a surge in the number of troops coming, under President Obama, into the fray and to the big operation in the neighbouring Helmand province.
We are also seeing the collapse of the Dutch government over the very question of how rapidly the Dutch troops, who are in a very close relationship with the Australian troops, will be withdrawn. The question is not whether they will be withdrawn but how rapidly they should be withdrawn. The death toll of the troops and the shambles in Afghanistan have caused upheaval and massive public debate in Holland.
Because both the big political parties have determined there will not be a full-ranging parliamentary debate on this issue—that vote was taken just of fortnight ago—we do not have a similar debate in this parliament and we are unlikely to get it. But it behoves us to do so. This is a huge issue not just of international importance but of enormous significance to our Australian defence forces and to our relationship with the region.
There is no doubt that the Afghani people are going through enormous suffering and have been for many decades. Ultimately, it is up to them to determine their own future and their own affairs. This disaster that came across this group of civilians in convoy on Sunday is another very sorry chapter in mismanagement of the occupation of Afghanistan by the ISAF.
I have no doubt that General McChrystal wants to see success in the suppression of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the withdrawal of American troops from this theatre of death and destruction. But the management of the use of lethal force in an age of massive technology has to be much better than we have seen, repeatedly now, through the killing of innocent civilians in Afghanistan, which not only leaves the world horrified but totally undermines the safety, security and wellbeing of our own troops in that country. The two things cannot be divorced.
I would be interested to hear from Senator Faulkner or from this government what representations are being made to General McChrystal or President Obama and his administration to have the death of innocent civilians in Afghanistan much reduced if not stopped. The repeated failure to stop these bombing raids, which kill innocent Afghanis and therefore increase the insecurity of our own defence forces, must be addressed. There seems to be a failure, a blind spot and an inability of the US administration, the ISAF generally and indeed our own government to tackle the root cause of this very destructive and, one would think, avoidable repeated killing of civilians in Afghanistan in these circumstances.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,0,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2010-03-09,"—by leave—I never intended to get into this debate. I do not understand it all that well. I thank Senator Faulkner. He always, at the first opportunity, comes and briefs the parliament on this. I think we owe him thanks for doing that.
But I listened to Senator Bob Brown and I think there has to be some response to this. Senator Bob Brown is attacking the USA administration for incompetence. It is nothing unusual for the Greens to do that. They continually do that and they continually get the ultra-left of the Australian constituency. That is their target and that is what they aim at. But then, Senator Brown, you go on and say we should leave Afghanistan to decide its own future. I might remind you, Senator Brown, five, or six or seven years ago that is exactly what happened. We heard unbelievable horror stories coming through where women were being hanged for not wearing the appropriate dress. It was horrific. People had to wear appropriate clothing—or whatever the Taliban considered appropriate—to go into the street.
Is that what you want to return to? Because that is what you have told the Senate you want. You continually attack the Americans, who stand out there and carry the great weight for the world to stop the Taliban encroaching on neighbouring countries. We owe them a vote of thanks for being prepared to stand up and be counted.

12:44:22 I am surprised that you would say that, Senator Brown. War is cruel and it is bloody, and there are always going to be casualties. We all send our sympathy to the families of the people killed in this tragedy; war is tragic. But to take the next step and say we should withdraw our troops and let the Taliban take over Afghanistan, take over Bangladesh, move through and take over all those Muslim countries, is just unbelievable, and it will not be accepted by the 90 per cent of people that support the Labor Party or the coalition. Yes, Senator Brown, you will win the vote of your leftie 10 per cent; you have got their vote. You do not have to do this—you have got their vote. But you should not go and condemn America. The people who called the strike will be going through hell. They will be examining their consciences and whether they could have done better. You cannot just go and put a blanket cover over it, condemning the Americans for standing up for what the rest of the world believes in, which is that people do have freedom that they never had under the Taliban, and advocate that we go back to that terrible regime that was just horrific. I just cannot find any words that would encourage people to go back to that and I think that, if you are honest with yourself, Senator Brown, you would not want that to happen. Women were forced into football arenas and hung because they were not dressed appropriately or they went out without a male escort or family. Is that what you really want? Is that what the Greens are asking the Senate to endorse? I do not think 85 to 90 per cent of Australians would want that. So I have to respond that I think Senator Bob Brown has gone right over the top and I do not think his remarks have the support of the Australian public.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,0,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-03-09,"—by leave—The opposition’s spokesman on defence matters, Senator David Johnston, will want to make a comment on this. He is currently being briefed, with Senator Faulkner’s assistance, by the Department of Defence on this particular issue. That is why he is not here and that is why the coalition is not giving a formal response to Senator Faulkner’s comments now.
—We can facilitate that when he is available.
—But Senator Johnston will no doubt want to seek leave later on to do this, and Senator Faulkner has indicated privately and now publicly that the government will facilitate that when Senator Johnston is available.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,0,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2010-03-09,"—I am in continuation, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, having started my address last night amid the furore of Senator Carr and others who managed to wander in very late at night, very suspiciously after dinner, shouting me down. But I rise again in this early afternoon in this Senate to put the case—
—We are here to listen.
—of the Labor Party—you be careful, Senator Forshaw, with your interjections—
—I’m here to listen. I’m here to listen to you.
—You have got enough to do: you just keep your head down and watch your preselection. There is a point to be made. Isn’t this funny? This is the very point I was being shouted down on last night by Senator Carr, that big voiced leftie. Now I am getting shouted down and interjected on yet again by the Labor Party backbench. The point I was trying to make was: where is the Labor Party backbench on the speakers list? There is not one of them. Not one of them is on the speakers list. Senator Forshaw, yet again, has failed. He never got up on the ETS and he is not getting up on this issue.
We are told this debate about private health insurance is a possible election trigger, coming through the Senate for the second time—that this will be raised by the Rudd Labor government as an election issue. But not one of them is passionate enough to get up on their feet and debate this coming election issue. It is bit different on this side. We have packed the speakers list. That is the very point. That is the point I was making: not one of them has the courage or the wit or the rebellion in them—if that be the case, being so suppressed by the Prime Minister’s office—to stand up and speak on this issue that you say you are going to carry to the next election, that you say is possibly going to be a double dissolution trigger.
I am not surprised, because this is probably the most cowed and compliant backbench ever in this parliament. The Victorian senators are the worst. They would have to be the worst lot of Victorian Labor senators ever to come through here. I have never heard them get up and speak—not very often anyway, and certainly not on issues of gravity. I am not surprised, because we have the most compliant cabinet ever elected to government. They are willing to sit and have cabinet meetings on Thursday nights, after long sessions of parliament, when everyone is tired and itching to get home. The Prime Minister tells them, ‘We’re having cabinet meetings every Thursday night now.’ They are tired, they are not listening and they are dominated by the Prime Minister. It is a compliant cabinet.
This is a weak and pathetic government, and we are seeing that in the legislative program. It is coming through—don’t think it is not—the legislative program. You are ending up in a shambles and in disarray. You have a whole list of ministers that are now starting to fail after two years in the job. There is of course Mr Garrett. Could one minister be more incompetent? My memory goes back to Ros Kelly. I can tell you Mr Garrett has surpassed that piece of political folklore. Mr Garrett and his pink batts will surpass Ros Kelly and her whiteboard, now part of political folklore. But we are not short of them here in the Senate. We have Senator Conroy, the minister for good times, a good time Charlie—always has been a good time Charlie. Well, his good time Charlie days are about to end. And, of course, there is Senator Arbib. Now there was a nervous Nellie at question time yesterday! What a nervous Nellie Senator Arbib was, because he knows only too well he is caught up in the whole incompetence of it all. But there is more to the abandonment of the legislative program of the other side. And here comes their whip, who does all the spruiking for—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is pretty clear that this is a filibuster, but could you draw Senator McGauran’s attention to the question before the chair. He is now talking about completely unrelated issues. There is no relationship to the bills whatsoever. If he is going to use the time of the chamber in the way that he is and filibuster on these bills, at least let him talk about them.
 (Senator Crossin)—Senator McGauran, I draw your attention to the bills that are before us for debate.
—I want to assure you, Madam Acting Deputy President, I have much research on these bills. I can show you my notes, profuse as they are. They all come back to the Senate economics inquiry on this issue. I am more than happy to enlighten the Senate of its findings. Senator Mathias Cormann has done a lot of work on this issue. The previous speakers have laid down the foundation argument that I will speak to and enhance.
Rest assured that I know all about the incompetence of Minister Roxon, who has flown under the radar. It is not just this issue; a whole array of issues in her portfolio ought to be brought out. Do not worry, I have done my research on the halving the rebate for cataract surgery, the disability care beds—which Four Corners did a show on; when it reaches Four Corners you know there are problems—her failure to meet her ambitious promise before the election on the number of nursing places, the $120 million she spent on the swine flu vaccine that is just sitting in storehouses—less than one-third has been used; what a waste of money—and the superclinics. We have perhaps two superclinics out of however many they promised. And it goes on. There was the attempt to cut $100 million from cancer treatment, which thanks to this side and public opinion did not get up.
I was in Ballarat recently for the community cabinet—‘community cabinet’?; it was Mr Rudd’s sideshow. That was all it was. You should have seen the glum faces on all of the ministers who turned up. What a joke. In this portfolio is the midwives issue, denying women the choice to have home births. That was what dominated the community cabinet. I got a guernsey; I was there in the front row. I could not believe it. It was a sight to see the one ego on display. He really does have a big ego. You have to see it to believe it, and you are all compliant to it. It is a joke. When are you going to stand up and speak on an issue?
This Prime Minister is so frightened of the midwives issue he is not willing to meet the public outside of a controlled situation. When he had to unveil the Kevin Rudd bust in Ballarat—as many of you know, in the gardens there there are busts of every Prime Minister—he did not turn up. He left the council, the Mayor and everyone else standing there waiting for him to appear at 11 am. He just did not turn up. He did not even ring ahead to say he was not going to turn up. Can you imagine the embarrassment and the frustration? Do you know why? Because there were midwives protesting there waiting for him and wanting to speak to him. Of course, they have dubbed it as ‘cowardly’. That is the portfolio I want to speak on.
—Prime Minister Blah Blah.
—Mr Blah Blah—that is his new nickname.
—Senator McGauran, it is unparliamentary to refer to members of this parliament in such a way. I ask you to withdraw that.
—I withdraw that—and rightly so in the Senate we should not be using such terminology, but I do note that that is a term allowed in the House of Representatives. I know we are a little loftier than the House of Representatives and a little less cut and thrust, but I have noticed that term being used frequently in the House of Representatives. They have different standing orders, I accept that.
Talking about blah blah, let us look at the greatest blah blah of them all. I heard Senator Abetz saying that this is a comment that the Prime Minister used over 20 times in the lead-up to the election and has used since: one of the great moral issues of our time is, of course, climate change. We are whipping up the whole gravity of the issue. He has lived off the gravity of the issue in the last 12 months. Where is that great moral issue? Where are those bills we are meant to be discussing in the first week of parliament? We have been lectured by—
—Again, on a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, I make the point that whilst Senator McGauran may wish to filibuster, he needs to be in order. I ask you to draw him back to the subject.
—In this chamber historically we have allowed very wide-ranging speeches at the second reading stage. Senator McGauran throughout all of his speech—and I have been here for all of it—while he has sometimes referred to other matters he has always referred back to the bills. So I think that, as in the practice of the past, we do allow wide-ranging debates and he should be allowed to continue.
—I acknowledge Senator Ferguson’s contribution that we have allowed members to range widely in these debates. But in the time that I have been listening outside the chamber on my monitor and inside the chamber I have hardly heard this senator refer to the bills in question, which is why I have taken the points of order. So I simply suggest that if he has the material that he has claimed to have—and he has claimed to have a sheaf of material on the bills—that he actually refers to it.
—Senator McGauran, both senators have made a good point I think. I do want to remind you that we are not debating climate change; we are actually debating bills relating to private health insurance, and I draw your attention to that.
—We will soon be referring to it. But it is essential to also discuss the priorities of these bills and the priorities of this government—
—In context.
—In context, as my good colleague Senator Fifield says: why this Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill is where it is on a Monday and a Tuesday. Debating time in the Senate is—
—A filibuster.
—It is not a filibuster—far from it. You are the ones running scared. I do welcome the Victorian senator, Senator Collins, who has come in here not to debate the issue but to interject. Where is Senator Cameron? We have Senator Cameron, Senator Forshaw, Senator Collins, some of the best interjectors in the parliament, and none of them will get up and actually debate. None of them will take their 20 minutes.
The point is that climate change ought to be debated now—and that is my point—not these particular bills. They have already been rejected by the Senate and we will reject them again—rest assured. These bills are going nowhere. You are going around in circles. You are a government in disarray. We have been lectured by the Prime Minister and Penny Wong on the great moral issue about rising sea levels, melting glaciers, extinct polar bears, the drying up of the Murray River, extreme weather patterns, world temperatures, the Antarctic melting—all of that, have I missed anything? Yes, the Great Barrier Reef and the Amazon of course. They are all in there—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order, Senator McGauran!
—I thought the whip was about to jump up again. It is all backed up by the great and honourable United Nations committee. This has been the issue of the hour, of the year. It is terrifying stuff. If any of that were true, I would be terrified. I would be terrified to think that the sea levels were going to swamp the eastern coast.
But it has gone off the agenda and these bills have been put in its place. There is a reason for that. They have sniffed the political wind and they have seen the shift. It was only ever a political exercise to begin with and the truth has won out. As I say, we quite welcome debating this issue about health—
—I rise on a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. I have been listening to Senator McGauran now since he commenced today—and I did listen to his remarks last night in my room. I am just concerned that Senator McGauran is actually debating the bill that is listed as No. 2 on the Notice Paper, that is, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill and all of the other bills. I am rather concerned that he is debating the bill that is next on the list rather than the bills that are on the list. I was wondering whether you could draw his attention—
—The bills that you do not want to debate!
—The bills are on the red, and I am just very concerned that Senator McGauran has wasted nearly all of his time with the speech that he would have made for the next bill.
—I welcome Senator Forshaw’s interjection. I know that he is drowning in New South Wales politics at the moment, so any sort of—
—What?
—Well, it is either you or Senator Hutchins. You are not going to take the knife to Senator Hutchins—

Senator Forshaw interjecting—

—The point is that any stance he takes—now that got you! Why don’t you get up and prove to your preselectors that you can debate the issues of the parliament. You are just not a good old interjector or capable of good old points of order.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order, Senator McGauran! Let me draw your attention to the bills and the debate that is before us. You have got less than four minutes left.
—I rise on a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President. I heard Senator Forshaw call Senator McGauran a hypocrite, and I thought you would have as well. It does not require a point of order to make him withdraw it, and I suggested he should be made to withdraw.
—Senator Ferguson is correct. I did use unparliamentary language. I was provoked by the former senator for the DLP or National Party or whatever he is today, but I happily withdraw the reference that I made.
—Thank you, Senator Forshaw. No, I did not hear that, Senator Ferguson, probably because there is too much screaming and yelling in the chamber. Senator McGauran, we will call you to finish your contribution.
—He was made to withdraw. It made me sound like Billy Hughes. These bills, as I said, have been rejected by the Senate and by Senate committees—and they have been before every committee system—but most of all they have been rejected in the public arena. These bills have been pretty much universally rejected, this suite of bills with their aim of reducing the number of participants in private health. That is the intent; that is the aim; it is a budget saving. The government tell us that it is a budget saving of $300 million. They want to save $300 million from health but they do not mind wasting billions on pink batts. But that is the intent and the aim, and naturally only the Labor Party, and card-carrying Labor Party doctors perhaps, support these bills.
This is just plain bad public policy and we reject it on those grounds. It is estimated by the government alone that about 550,000 people will drop out of private health. Access Economics gives a truer picture, saying it is more likely that 700,000 to one million people will drop out of private health. And we know that, rule of thumb, every one per cent drop in public health forces the states to spend an extra $100 million on public hospitals. So do the figures yourselves. Access Economics says that 700,000 people will drop out—and that is the most conservative of figures—and with about 10 million people taking out private health you can see that there is as much as $700 million that will now be shifted onto the states’ hospital systems.
Our stance against this is not ideological, unlike the Labor Party’s—and you laugh!
—Yes, we do. We laugh!
—When I started speaking on this last night, guess who waltzed in—the most ideological of them all, Senator Carr! Whatever influence he has in cabinet, he has got his fingerprints all over this. But we are not ideological—far from it. We do it on the grounds of good management policy and good health policy.
We have proved it in government. When we came into government the private health system was collapsing, making the Medicare system unsustainable. That was a fact. Even when you left government you accepted that. Some of your ministers, namely, Senator Richardson, even accepted that, and we had to pick up that system.
We had to tweak it in the first term. We introduced the surcharge in the first term. In the second term we introduced the 30 per cent rebate, and in the next term we introduced the third prong of our policy, the life cover. It requires a balance, and it was not until we put the three prongs in place that we got it right. It took several terms of government. And then you saw a surge in uptake of private health and, of course, the obvious rational effect—it is all very rational; it is not ideological: you take the burden off public hospitals so that those who need it—the needy people, those that deserve access to hospitals and are in urgent need, those underprivileged—will have access. That is why we seek a balance between private and public health. Madam Acting Deputy President, I am about to hand over to the former president who is well across this issue and, like him and all the previous speakers, I reject this legislation.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2010-03-09,"—It gives me a great deal of pleasure to follow my friend and colleague Senator McGauran, who made so many pertinent points during his speech, about not only this legislation but also a few extraneous matters, which I am sure have kept us both entertained and enlightened, I might say. It reminded me of one of the most important things my father said to me when I was a young lad. He said, ‘Son, if you never tell a lie you won’t need a good memory.’ I wonder whether, when we go back over some of the statements made by the Labor ministers since their change of position in relation to private health insurance rebates, perhaps their parents would have done well to have given them the same advice.
The reason I want to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009 [No. 2]—and I do not get the chance very often to speak on bills—is that these are important bills because all Australians will be affected. It does not matter what the government says about the numbers who are going to be affected by the taking away of the rebate, the taking away of that rebate will eventually affect all Australians, not just the 11.3 million Australians with private health insurance. I rise to speak on this issue particularly because there are over 900,000 South Australians who are covered by private health insurance.
The Labor Party and Labor government ministers have been willing to say anything to support this tax increase—because that is what it is. If you take away the rebate it is equivalent to putting another tax on those people who are already contributing in a large way to private health insurance. It has always been said that every dollar that is given back in rebates to those who have private health insurance injects two dollars more through their premiums into the health system. That is something that this government just does not seem to understand. Labor has said that it needs this tax because of the global financial crisis. But I remember that it started its attack on private health—because it does not like private health insurance—in its first budget, well prior to the global financial crisis, so named, coming into existence. The Prime Minister says the money is needed for health reform. That is his reason for putting this additional burden on taxpayers. Minister Nicola Roxon says the money from this new tax will be used to fund e-health. So we have another view from the health minister as to why this new impost on people who have private health insurance is being put in place. Then a little later she said that the money from this new tax will be used for new medicines and improved technology. Then the Treasurer really capped it off recently when he spelt out in the budget that this new tax was to pay for the increase in the age pension. Who do you believe in the Labor Party? Which minister has got it right, or has anybody got a right?
—No-one!
—I put it to you that, as my colleague Senator Cormann interjects, none of them have got it right. This is a tax of envy. It is another tax on those whom they think can afford it. But what they really do is punish those who cannot afford to be in private health insurance. What disturbs me more than anything is the fact that Labor, prior to the last election, repeatedly promised not to alter health insurance rebates. This reintroduced legislation once again breaks that promise that they made to the Australian people. Who are we to believe? When they come to another election and they start making promises to the Australian people, do we take them on face value or do we question them very suspiciously on the record of broken promises that they now have after a little over two years in government?
On 26 September 2007, Ms Nicola Roxon said:
On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
She then said:
The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.
The Liberals were not continually trying to scare people into thinking Labor would take away the rebate; they knew on past form that Labor would say one thing, get elected and do another. I think that was Peter Garrett’s mantra. And my good friend Senator McGauran had a little to say about Minister Garrett in his speech. I do not want to go on at length or I will have the whip coming in to suggest that I am not speaking to the bills, as he did to Senator McGauran. But, in fact, Mr Garrett said, ‘We will say one thing before the election but when we get elected we will do what we like.’ The Prime Minister in a letter to AHIA on 20 November prior to the election that same year said:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
On 25 February 2008, the Prime Minister said:
The private health insurance rebate remains unchanged and will remain unchanged.
I am suggesting that perhaps his father should have said what my father said to me. I am not accusing the minister of lying or the Prime Minister of lying, but all I am saying is that if you do not tell a lie you will not need a good memory. Can you believe the Prime Minister? Can you believe anything he says? This is just one of the promises that he has gone back on. He said:
The private health insurance rebate remains unchanged and will remain unchanged.
It is no wonder that not one Labor Party senator will come in here and defend this decision—not one. You would have thought that at least some of the senators would have come in and given some reasons as to why there has been this change. But not one of them can defend this change in policy—the Prime Minister made a categorical statement and has now reversed it. In 2009, just last year, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, said in the Age that the government is ‘firmly committed’ to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.
Over a period of almost two years—certainly 18 months—we had all of these statements saying that the private health insurance rebate would not be changed, guaranteeing it. The strange thing is that Minister Roxon’s comment in the Age was made on the very same day that the Prime Minister’s department was providing advice to the government about the specific proposal to slash private health rebates in the budget. You had Minister Roxon saying, ‘We are firmly committed to retaining the existing rebates’ on the very same day that the government was planning to slash them. These changes, of course, are going to further increase the cost of health care and put extra pressure on already overstretched public hospitals.
We even got to the stage where the Treasury in recent times estimated that just 25,000 people would drop their insurance. What a joke! On 16 October 2008 the minister for health, Ms Roxon, said that the projection from Treasury of the number of people who would drop out of private health insurance was just under half a million. Some projections have been even higher. If we get to the stage when you have got those numbers of people dropping out of private health, just think of the impact that is going to have on those who retain their private health and of the impact on public hospitals. Yet here we have a government which tries to maintain that, in giving $1 back to private health insurers for people who insure with private health—who then put $2 back into the system for every $1 that is rebated—that is somehow not going to have an impact on the health system, defies belief.
After the minister for health made this statement, the government was forced to admit that 1.7 million people with insurance would be directly affected, either dropping their insurance completely, or lowering their cover or paying higher taxes. The Australian Health Insurance Association estimated one million Australians would drop their health insurance.
I do not know of a more important matter that has come before this Senate in recent times, which is why I chose to speak directly on these bills. We have had climate change and we have had a lot of other things. The problem with this Prime Minister is that everything is a No. 1 priority. I think he has had about 12 No. 1 priorities in the last 12 months and now we have got to the stage when I do not know whether they have any No. 1 priorities. What should be one of their priorities is maintaining this existing private health insurance rebate because it is the only way we can keep our health system even moderately in a healthy shape. We all know that there are lots of other problems that exist within the health department. By lowering this rebate all they are going to do is add to those problems.
Increased premiums, which is what is likely to happen with people dropping out of insurance, will drive many of the most vulnerable Australians into the already overstretched public system. I have been around this place for a reasonable length of time and I remember that under the previous Labor government private health insurance coverage plunged to 34 per cent of the population. I remember distinctly the numbers that were dropping out of private health insurance coverage and the stress that that placed on our health and hospital system had to be seen to be believed. Somebody had to do something about it.
In the three stages that Senator McGauran spoke about earlier, the coalition managed by offering the incentives to get private health coverage up to 44 per cent; not as high as we would like to have it. Introducing the open-ended private health insurance rebate enabled more people to be encouraged into the system. Members of health funds contributed $10.6 billion to the Australian healthcare system in 2008, an increase of 10 per cent on the previous year. How much do you think this would decrease if we allowed this bill to pass? How much do you think that would impact on the healthcare system if we were to allow this bill to go through? It is with that in mind that, thankfully, with the support of the Independents, we will be able to knock this legislation on the head for the second time so that those involved with private health insurance will be able to have some confidence that they can maintain their cover and still receive their rebate in the future.
We have always believed as a matter of principle as a coalition in the right of all Australians to take charge of their own healthcare needs and plan for the future. We have always worked hard to deliver the incentives that will promote the uptake of private health insurance and take the pressure off Medicare. The efficiency of the private health system is absolutely paramount in relieving pressure on the very stressed public system.
Private health insurance in Australia is an issue that has been under debate for as long as I can remember. When I first joined Mutual Community, I think it was, in 1961—the year I left school—we had a very, very strong and healthy private insurance system. We have seen under Labor governments that coverage drop to 34 per cent. We have seen under coalition governments incentives provided to make sure that it is now up to 44 per cent. The incentives required are something that we should never allow to be taken away.
This is very important legislation. I urge my colleagues and others to vote against this legislation because I think it is in the interests of all Australians, but particularly those who want to maintain a sound healthcare system in Australia, that we do not take away incentives for ordinary Australians.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2010-03-09,"—It is my privilege this afternoon to follow Senator Ferguson’s contribution. In Senator Forshaw’s interjection earlier he tried to defend the government’s view that somehow placing these bills at the top of the legislative agenda for this week did not reflect on the empty words of the Prime Minister about the greatest moral challenge of our time. His only defence was that Labor’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was No. 2. Call this a plain reading of the English language, but I would assume that the greatest moral challenge of our time would at least rank No. 1 on the list of legislation in a sitting week.
Moving away from that, it is a pity that this debate is being conducted by one side of the chamber. It is a pity that there is no-one from the government standing up to argue their case and to defend their decision. I can only assume that it is out of a sense of shame because this is a clear breach of an election promise. My colleagues have outlined that in detail. There is no ambiguity in this. The Labor Party, the Prime Minister, who was then opposition leader, and then shadow minister Roxon explicitly promised not to take away the private health insurance rebate. They explicitly promised to keep it. Now, for the second time in under 12 months, they bring legislation forward in this place to do the very opposite of that. I will not go through all the quotes again, but there are two in particular that I want to mention. On 26 September 2007, in a media release, then shadow minister Roxon said:
On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.
I do not see an asterisk on that press release; I do not see a footnote that says, ‘Except if you earn over a certain amount.’ It says ‘all of the existing private health insurance rebates’. There is no ambiguity there. Similarly, only days before the 2007 election, in a letter to the Australian Health Insurance Association, the then Leader of the Opposition said:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
Again, there is no ambiguity, no footnote and no qualification. Nowhere does it say, ‘Except if you earn over this much.’ It says ‘the existing private health insurance rebates’. This bill, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2], does the opposite. It is to the shame of Labor members opposite that they are not willing to come here and own up to that fact.
The truth is that we on this side knew that those words could not be trusted. We knew that the Leader of the Labor Party and their spokeswoman on health could not be trusted because Labor has always wanted to do in private health insurance. The dream of the Labor Party is to have a National Health Service type of system. The dream of the Labor Party is to remove the very choice that allows middle Australia to take care of their own health.
It is the same with independent schools. I guarantee that if the country is unfortunate enough to see the Labor government re-elected, the next schools agreement will do exactly the same thing. They will not stand by their word. This is an example of how they cannot be trusted at all. The government now claim that this legislation is necessary because of the global financial crisis. That is simply fiction, written by world-class fiction writers on the other side. Their fiction is world-class, if not the quality of their writing. Their first attacks on private health insurance began when we were talking about an inflation genie. Who hears about the inflation genie these days? No-one, because it is always an excuse. As Senator Ferguson outlined earlier, there is always a different excuse from a different minister. It is simply another broken promise in a litany of broken promises.
We could talk about the promise to take Iran through the international judicial process. We could talk about the promises to deal with Japan over whaling, the promises about the GP superclinics and the promises about ending the double drop-off. The list goes on. But very few issues are as explicit as this. What we know lurks under the surface of every Labor member and senator is a wish to do away with the universality of the support for private health insurance. That is what Labor wants to do and what this legislation does. Labor constantly says that Medicare cannot be means tested, that Medicare should be universal. But the one thing that cannot be universal is the ability for people to support their own health care. We have heard from my colleagues that $1 in the rebate buys $2 of extra spending. But Labor does not want that. It claims that spending should be determined in the health system on the basis of need, but—and this is the key difference—it does not want Australians to make that determination themselves. It wants the government, a bureaucrat or someone other than the person concerned to determine what health care that person needs and when they need it.
If its management of the public hospital systems in many of our states over the last 10 years is any indication, that should scare the hell out of many Australians. The other side of this chamber cannot be trusted. In my own home state of Victoria, over roughly a decade we have gained a million people but there are fewer hospital beds. How does that equation make it easier for people to access the health system? It does not. No number of press releases advertising how much money you have spent matter when it is harder to get in the door, when there are fewer beds, despite a million more people. The government is trying to make private health insurance harder to have and to appropriate for itself the choice about what health care Australians need and when they get it.
We know that more than half of surgical procedures these days are performed in the private health system. That is not something which this side is concerned about. That is a sign of a strong, mixed healthcare system. The private system allows people who can to prioritise and take care of themselves but also strengthens the public healthcare system by taking pressure off. If you did not have this support for private health insurance, the waiting lists would be longer. The waits on trolleys would be longer and the wait for critical care would be longer. But this government simply does not care. It is continuing its ideological war against choice, against the private health insurance industry and the private health sector. That war goes back for decades, because this is a philosophical fault line.
We believe that Australians should be supported to take care of themselves and their health. We believe that, just as we have a universal national insurance system in Medicare, having universal access to a health insurance rebate allows those who are more fortunate to contribute more to the cost of their own care. And it is those who can contribute to the cost of their own care or choose to make that sacrifice—and they are not all higher socioeconomic groups—who take the pressure off the public health system, who make it easier for those in genuine need, who are without those means, to access our public health system.
We know that this legislation, if it becomes law, will lead to an increase in premiums not just for those who lose the rebate but for all who have private health insurance. All that will do is create a cycle where people increasingly drop out of private health insurance. The people who will pay are not the people the government allegedly targets in this legislation. The people who will pay that price are those who will be pushed back in the queues in the public hospital system and it will be the other people who remain in private health insurance who seek to take pressure off the public health system and take care of their own health care.
The background to this rebate is important because the Labor Party talk about how they wish to take the rebate from allegedly high-income earners. The rebate was introduced at a 30 per cent level to prevent high-income earners having access to tax deductibility. As we know, if we have tax deductibility for private health insurance, the greater number of benefits go to those on higher incomes who are paying higher marginal tax. The rebate was introduced at a flat 30 per cent tax level and it already provides greater benefits, through the tax system, to those on lower incomes. It is another fiction of the Labor Party that this is somehow removing a benefit from wealthier Australians. The rebate was designed this way specifically to ensure that lower-income and middle-income Australians had access to effective, tax system based support, to underpin their choice of private health insurance.
I am sure we will hear from the Labor Party before the next election, just as we heard before the last election, that they will not do any more with the rebate—just as they have promised to do something about whaling, just as they will probably re-promise to do something about GP superclinics, the double drop-off and Iran. But this explicit promise, which has been broken by the Labor Party, ensures that their word can never be trusted. I urge Australians to listen to what Labor says now, to compare it with their actions in their first few years in government, as well as with what they said before the 2007 election. Just as they will undertake an attack on private health insurance—and this is only the first step, the first chink, in the armour of the private health insurance rebate which supports choice for millions of Australians—they will do it to independent schools and they will try to claim that it is to save money to put elsewhere. We know that the money being saved here will not be put into reform of the health system; it will merely go to plug the gaping deficits which this government has opened up.
There is no shortage of money with the Labor Party because it has the platinum credit card funded by Australian taxpayers. The government has prioritised things that rank so far down the list of the priorities of Australians and their families compared to health that it is completely unjustifiable that you would try to say that this is due to the global financial crisis.
This is merely the first step of Labor’s attack on private health insurance. It represents a breach of an explicit promise stated and restated by the now Prime Minister and the now Minister for Health and Ageing. Just as it is Labor’s first attack, and we will repel it from this side of the chamber, we will continue to do so in coming years because private health insurance and access to choice for Australians is a value and a principle in which we profoundly believe.",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2010-03-09,"—I rise to also draw attention to the hypocrisy of the Rudd Labor government in seeking to break the promise it made to the Australian people at the 2007 election that it would not interfere with the rebate applicable for private health insurance in Australia. I followed this issue very closely in the role I played at the time as Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which overviews the Department of Health and Ageing, and also at the time of the 2007 election as a senator who was under considerable attack from a number of parties, including the Australian Labor Party, on the basis that I represented a Senate which had ceased to be accountable to the Australian people and that I represented a government controlled Senate which was incapable of holding the government of the day to account. I am sure members of this place will recall the very strong campaign steered by the organisation called GetUp! in which the argument was put very strongly that people should take back control of their Senate, that the Senate belonged to the people of Australia. We even had the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats uniting in television ads to appeal to voters to deprive the Howard government of its majority in the Senate. The argument was that the Senate was not able to perform its duty as a body which would question and hold to account the government of the day if the government had the numbers to control it.
How things have change. Now, a bit over two years later, we have a new government and a Senate which is not controlled by the government and we have the Senate proposing, with its opposition to this legislation, to hold the government to account for the promises it made to the people of Australia at the 2007 election. The Australian Labor Party, which were so very keen two years ago to give the Senate the power to block governments which did things they said they would not do at elections, now have done a 180 degree turn and believe that the Senate ought to pass this legislation and ought to allow the government to break the promise they solemnly made to the Australian people at that election—that they would not interfere with the private health insurance rebate. I have to say that I do not think the Senate should do that.
The Senate has acknowledged that the balance in our health system between publicly funded health care and privately supported health care is an extremely important balance to be struck and that our system would become unsupportable and unsustainable in this country if it were unable to provide for people to afford to take out private health insurance and contribute through their own pockets to greater choice in the provision of health care and to the greater financial sustainability of the entire health system. That is such an obviously true statement; it is almost an axiomatic statement that it rather explains the comments by the then shadow minister for health in September 2007, when she solemnly intoned:
On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.
She went on to attack the Liberal Party for daring to suggest that the government had other intentions. She said:
The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.
It was not untrue; it was perfectly true. We drew attention, as Senator Ryan has pointed out in this debate, to the strong underlying hostility of the Australian Labor Party towards private health. We drew attention to the tendency of the Labor Party to want to undermine the mechanisms we had put in place to make private health insurance both more affordable and more sustainable. We predicted—as it turns out, perfectly accurately—that a Labor government would indeed attempt to wind back on our reforms in this area—reforms which had led to almost 45 per cent of all Australians having taken out private health insurance and thereby improving the capacity of our health system to deliver timely outcomes to Australians and taking pressure off our public hospital system at the same time.
I make no apologies for throwing this legislation back in the face of the Labor government and saying that it has absolutely no right to come to this place and expect the Senate to pass this legislation. It is a disgrace. It amounts to a betrayal of the people of Australia, who were told so many things about what this Labor government would do and who have been deceived on so many occasions in the process. The fact is that the balance in our health system is critical to maintaining an effective health system. It is at the heart of a health system which is, relatively speaking, the envy of many nations around the world. It is a balance in the system which preserves the capacity of people to make choices and to obtain care when they need it in general terms.
This legislation amounts to a tax on health insurance. It will make it harder for people on higher incomes to sustain their private health insurance. It is very likely in the medium- to long-term to lead to people giving up their private health insurance. In some ways, the only reason we have not seen a greater flight from private health insurance is that the public health system, over which so many Labor governments in this country preside, is for many people simply too scary to contemplate as their only safety net in the event that they become unwell. So we have the prospect in this debate of the legislation, if it is passed, undermining the capacity of Australians to afford private health insurance and placing a greater burden on the shoulders of our public hospitals around Australia because people will have given up private health insurance. If this legislation were to pass, there would certainly be an increase in premiums for all Australians who have private health insurance—and not many of those are on higher incomes.
We can see many unfortunate consequences of this legislation. We can see that the government has not thought through the implications of what it is doing here. We know this because the government has a policy on health which is all over the shop. The government was not going to take away the rebates, and now it is. The government was going to fix the public hospital system by 1 July 2009, and it has not. The government was going to hold a referendum to take control of the public hospital system if it had not been fixed by 1 July 2009, and we have no idea whether it intends to do that or not. I suspect that the government is, at this stage, completely at a loss as to what its policy should be.
The Senate is perfectly entitled to say to this government: ‘Go away and sort your policies out. Decide what you want to do. Decide how you’re going to deal with the crisis in Australian health and then come back with a plan to the Australian people and the Senate.’ In the absence of that plan, of that indication of how it is going to deal with this problem, health is a political plaything for this government, and the Senate is perfectly entitled to refuse to play that game. We are entitled to say that we will not engage in the process of passing legislation, the implications of which have simply not been thought through. The government has not explained how it will deal with the extra pressure which this legislation, if passed, would place on our public hospitals.
Every one of us in this place has heard stories of a hospital system in crisis, of longer waiting lists for elective surgery, of people fronting up to emergency departments and being unable to be treated, of people receiving absolutely shocking outcomes in the course of their accessing services in public hospitals. I acknowledge that that is not the universal experience and that many people get very good quality service from our public hospitals; but, regrettably, the number of times that the system fails because of pressure on it is very large, and that is unacceptable. We in this place have a duty to try and mitigate that occurring. This government does not seem to care about that. It wants to put pressure back on the public hospital system, and there is no plan or strategy for dealing with that in this legislation or elsewhere.
We simply assume that the government will somehow be able to persuade state governments or perhaps pay state governments to lift their game with respect to the performance of the public hospital system in order to cope with the additional demand, which surely will be the outcome of this legislation. All I can say to them is that, if that is their tactic, ‘Good luck’, because, frankly, the public hospital system in this country is creaking and groaning from the pressure that it is already under. It simply cannot afford to be placed under greater pressure.
We made it clear that the devices that we were putting in place were designed to support the capacity of Australians to make choices within the health system. We wanted that safety net to be a strong one for Australians who could not afford private health insurance or who chose not to take it out, so that there would still be access to decent quality services to the extent that we could influence that happening. During our time in government, we continued to strengthen the resourcing available to our public hospitals. Let us put to bed very firmly at this point in the debate the myth, which Labor has chosen to pursue and repeated in question time yesterday in this place, that the coalition took a billion dollars out of the public health system. You know that is not true. You know that is simply a falsehood. In every year that we were in government we continued to support to a greater extent the health burden taken on by the states through their public hospitals. When we came into government in 1996, we were supporting public hospitals run by the states to the tune of a little over $5 billion. When we left office in 2007, we had support running at twice that amount at a little short of $11 billion annually. So it simply is not true to say that any money was taken out of that system. But the amounts that we put into the public hospital system would simply not have been adequate to deal with the kind of crisis which the present Rudd government is seeking to shift onto the shoulders of our public hospital system. It simply will not be able to cope if this legislation passes and I sincerely hope that the Senate will not allow that to happen.
We also had the Labor opposition throughout the 11 years of the Howard government continually attacking rises in private health insurance premiums. Every increase in a premium that occurred was ritually attacked by the relevant shadow minister, whoever it might have been, and accusing fingers were pointed at the coalition for allowing this to occur. I note that there have been very significant increases in premiums. The minister for health herself was warning only a few days ago about some very significant increases coming down the line. She appeared to be shaking her finger in the direction of the health funds. When premiums went up under us, it was the government at whom the relevant shadow minister shook his or her finger, not the health funds. Why wasn’t the government doing something about rising health insurance premiums? That does not appear to be the policy of the present Rudd Labor government. They are choosing to blame private health insurance companies and frankly I think that is unfair. It will be absolutely unfair if this legislation is passed because the inevitable consequence will be that there will have to be a substantial increase over time in insurance premiums to account for those people who will leave the system. Of that there can be absolutely no doubt.
I think that the government has very badly failed to plan ahead for the needs of our health system, and the irony is considerable indeed that by all accounts we are seeing an increase in the government’s focus on health as a political weapon in the lead-up to the coming election. What was in prospect at one stage—an election based around the emissions trading scheme—seems to be evaporating in favour of an election built around health. With such a confused and incomplete picture of what it wants to do with the health system, with endless reports and reviews having put information on its table but without any tangible action to follow from that work, with a policy to increase the cost of private health insurance but no plan to support public health as a result of that policy, with all of these mismatched and confused policies in place it is astonishing that the government would expect the Australian people to trust it on the question of health at the coming election. But apparently that is what it is planning to do.
I think the Australian people are growing more cynical by the day with respect to what this government wants to do. They were a little more cynical when they saw the government attempt to cut rebates for cataract surgery, something which the government had mentioned nothing about before the 2007 election but which apparently became an area of high priority for them to pass. They banged their fists on the table in the Senate and said: ‘We must have this reform. Forget the fact that we did not mention this to the Australian people prior to the 2007 election.’ They said this was an essential reform. We were told that a cut in the rebate for assisted reproductive technology also had to occur, and again there was no mention of that being necessary before the 2007 election. The mother of them all was the government insisting that it is essential to their health reforms, such as they are, that they be able to rip billions of dollars out of private health insurance rebates. We even had the extraordinary claim that, if we did not pass this legislation, there were going to be tens of billions of dollars less available in the health system in the future to deal with challenges in the sector. Of course, if you are taking money away from a rebate and there is no hypothecation of the saving that you are making going back into the health system, then it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the money being taken out is not going to end up in the health system, and nothing in this legislation provides any guarantee or comfort that it will in fact be the case.
On my submission, the Senate is entitled to reject this legislation comprehensively, and to remind the Australian people that this is yet another broken promise by this Rudd Labor government, which is drifting, confused and unable to put together a coherent plan for health, much less the whole set of challenges facing the Australian community. The Senate is doing its job, the job it is supposed to be doing, the job it was set up by the Australian people to do, by rejecting this legislation, because we are holding the government to account. It promised not to interfere with private health insurance rebates and the Senate is absolutely entitled in those circumstances to say, ‘No, we will not support legislation for you to break the promise you made solemnly to the Australian people in 2007.’",SENATE,<title>FAIRER PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2009 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-03-09,"—I speak wholeheartedly and wholesomely in opposition to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2009. If the Prime Minister decides in his wisdom to use this legislation, if it is defeated, as a double dissolution trigger, then I say, ‘Bring it on!’ because I am quite happy to have a debate about the importance of health to the Australian people and about the importance of a balanced health system with public and private options and support for both. I am committed to upholding a duty of care for my fellow Australians and my fellow Tasmanians in particular.
We know full well that the government promised to the nth degree prior to the last election that they would not change the private health insurance rebate support. We have quote after quote from Prime Minister Rudd—he was then opposition leader—and the Hon. Nicola Roxon, the now Minister for Health and Ageing and the former shadow health minister, promising up hill and down dale that they would not change those arrangements one iota. They expressed strong support for the private health insurance rebate and the current arrangements, yet in this parliament last year they tried to push through changes which will adversely impact not just those who will have to pay increased premiums—those 11-million-odd Australians who have private health insurance and will obviously have to pay extra as a result of the drop-off resulting from the government’s changes—but also those in the public hospital system. They will be forced onto queues, and waiting lists and waiting times will increase.
We know that in Tasmania we have amongst the highest waiting times and longest waiting lists in Australia. We do not want to make it any worse. Last year, St.LukesHealth insurance organisation undertook research on the effect of the changes the government proposed at that time. I commend Colleen McGann, who is the head of St.LukesHealth insurance organisation in Northern Tasmania. She does a great job, she provides leadership and she supports a healthy community. Their research showed that as a result of the proposed changes Launceston General Hospital could face up to an additional 10,000 patients. That would have been a disaster for northern Tasmania. We know that the effect of this legislation if it were to pass would be to put pressure on the public hospital system. We do not want that. We want to have a balanced approach where those paying private health insurance premiums support the private sector and where there is also support for the public sector. I commend in this chamber the initiative of Will Hodgman, the state Liberal leader, on his announcement of the Smarter Health Care policy for northern Tasmania, released last Wednesday, when he said that under his proposal he would:
Create a 28-bed transitional care facility at a refurbished John L. Grove Centre ...
Provide four dedicated palliative care beds in Launceston, more than doubling palliative care availability;
Significantly boost the ‘Hospital in the Home’ service for chronic disease, frequent hospital users and post discharge care;
Establish Tasmania’s first Walk-in Care Clinic;
Create eight funded positions for nurse practitioners to deliver a range of health solutions from the hospital to the home;
Establish a $500,000 per annum Rapid Response Unit and GP Development Fund; and
Fully fund the positions of doctors, nurses and allied health staff required to meet the construction of the expanded Department of Emergency Medicine, Acute Medical Unit, Day Procedure Unit and expanded ICU/HDU at the Launceston General Hospital.
Will Hodgman is doing a great job in Tasmania. He and the Liberals support the health system and they want a balanced approach. He says:
These initiatives, combined with the Liberal policy to spend $10m in two years to drastically cut elective surgery waiting lists through a strategic public-private partnership in our Sooner the Better policy, will ensure better health results all round for people in Northern Tasmania.
They have put together a very sensible, comprehensive health policy that will support the health of Tasmanians. We know that the track record of the Labor government in Tasmania is appalling when it comes to waiting lists and waiting times for Tasmanians, whether it be in the north, the north-west or the south. Tasmanians will have an opportunity to decide whether they want real change—whether they want to put up with waiting lists and waiting times that go on and on and on or whether they want those waiting lists and waiting times to be cut so that proper health care services can be delivered to Tasmanians. They deserve better than that which has been delivered under the Bartlett Labor government in Tasmania. They know that Will Hodgman and Brett Whiteley—I commend Brett Whiteley, the shadow minister for health, on the work that he is doing and the leadership that he is delivering on health—
Government senators interjecting—
—I see that some of the Labor senators from Tasmania are having difficulty comprehending. Why have they not lobbied their state colleagues to make sure that there is a cut in waiting times and waiting lists in Tasmania? We want to get a balanced approach. Will Hodgman is offering real change and Tasmanians will have an opportunity to decide, to vote, on 20 March to say, ‘Yes, we want to go forward under strong leadership, under the leadership of Will Hodgman, so there will be good health care, whether it be at the LGH or elsewhere.’
We know that the Premier put up a dud proposal to move the Royal Hobart Hospital next to a working wharf in Hobart. Can you imagine: they wasted thousands and millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money on consultants, reports and reviews by the health department and others and they wanted to put the Royal Hobart Hospital into a working port? How absurd. What sort of vision is that? You have to redevelop the Royal Hobart Hospital proposal so that it delivers good health care to the people of southern Tasmania. They know what is best for them. We want them to decide on 20 March whether they will seek and want real change under a Will Hodgman Liberal government.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2010-03-09,"—I have some further information relating to one of the questions that Senator Minchin asked yesterday. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Further information- NBN Co Melbourne Office
In response to one of Senator Minchin’s questions on 22February 2009, I can provide the following information.
While decisions regarding the location and leasing of office space is a matter for NBN Co and its board, I have been advised by the company that, to date, it has offices in Sydney and Melbourne.
In relation to the Melbourne office, I am advised by the company that:
NBN Co has leased two floors at 360 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne for an eight year period.
The company’s decision to enter this lease followed a comprehensive review of Melbourne office accommodation and advice from the Victorian State Government on suitable office space.
The rental struck is competitive with other Government and non-Government tenants in the building. It should be noted that both floors came fully fitted-out at no cost to NBN Co.
Other government agencies in the same building are the ACCC and the ACMA. Both agencies took accommodation in the building under the previous Government.
I am seeking further information on another question asked by Senator Minchin.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Broadband</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,5,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-03-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) and the Minister for Employment Participation (Senator Arbib) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the Home Insulation Program and to asylum seekers.
Today we witnessed again Labor’s pitiful incapacity to take genuine responsibility for the massive and glaring failures of the home insulation program. Sure, Mr Rudd glibly says, ‘I take responsibility,’ but the insincerity of that oozes everywhere, because this program has been responsible for four dead, others injured—permanently scarred—90-plus roof fires, thousands ripped off and dangerous materials installed. You name it; it went wrong—disastrously wrong. So you then ask: who’s responsible? Mr Rudd says, ‘I am, of course, but I’ve got full confidence in the minister and his mini-me, who were required to implement this program.’
Labor walks away from any responsibility in relation to this disastrous program—a program which Mr Tanner admitted they were trying to rush out—deliberately not crossing every t and not dotting every i, because they just wanted to rush the program out the door. If any building contractor in New South Wales were to say to the occupational health and safety authorities, ‘Sorry: I breached my duty of care because I was in a rush to finish the contract,’ they would be up on criminal manslaughter charges under the law of New South Wales that Senator Arbib, whilst he was in New South Wales, helped to implement.
That is the reality. That is the truth. If this occurred in the private sector, those responsible would be up on criminal manslaughter charges under the New South Wales Labor government’s regime. Yet, surprisingly, Mr Rudd, Mr Garrett and Senator Arbib think they can simply walk away from this. It is an interesting insight into the way the Labor Party—and Mr Garrett in particular—do business. Remember those silly ‘Sorry’ pyjamas Mr Garrett wore? He is always willing to say sorry for everybody else’s alleged mistakes but is completely incapable of saying sorry for his own mistakes.
What is it about Mr Rudd? Remember how he was so nauseatingly pompous before the last election? He was telling us about Mr Downer’s responsibility: he should have read 1,000 cables that had been delivered to his office and, because he had not, he should resign in disgrace. Remember that? Moralising, pompous and nauseating. Today, his government is confronted with one Minter Ellison report—not 1,000 cables but just one report—and Mr Rudd simply says: ‘I never saw it. Sure, it came to the government, but I never saw it.’ Guess what! Nor did Mr Garrett; nor did Senator Arbib. It reminds me of the three monkeys, but these three were not very wise. They saw no evil, heard no evil and now are not willing to talk any evil about this program.
Let us be quite clear here. If these ministers want the ministerial stipend and if they want to be driven around in their limousines, then they have to take responsibility for what their departments do. The Prime Minister cannot simply say, ‘I have full confidence in these ministers.’ Senator Evans then said, I think quite appropriately, that there was also full confidence in the department. Who is actually responsible? If it is not the ministers and it is not the departments, then who is it? As Senator Brandis interjected, ‘I suppose it’s society’s fault.’ Nobody is to blame here; it is just something in society.
We know who is at fault. It was Prime Minister Rudd, Deputy Prime Minister Gillard, Finance Minister Tanner and Treasurer Swan who insisted that this program be rolled out—the quicker the better and don’t ask any questions—and the poor, hapless Messrs Garrett and Arbib were the ones who were required to implement it. That is why the Prime Minister is protecting them: he knows that he is personally responsible, along with these incompetent ministers. The Australian people deserve answers—better answers than we were given today.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Home Insulation Program</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,6,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2010-03-09,"—The opposition clearly will not accept the responses of ministers, whether they are given in this chamber or in the other chamber. We have just heard from Senator Abetz the repetition of this quite scurrilous accusation of industrial manslaughter. Let me direct the opposition to somebody who could be considered to be a most impartial commentator on this program and, indeed, on many other government programs—a person who has never been a friend of this government and has often been very critical of governments of all persuasions. I refer to Mr Tony Harris. Tony Harris, for those who do not know—and I am sure most senators would know—is a former senior Commonwealth officer and a past New South Wales Auditor-General. He is a person who has a reputation for sticking it up the government of the day, if I may use that phrase, when he thinks there is a failure in proper government or public service processes. He wrote an article in today’s Australian Financial Review which I urge all senators to read. It will give you some perspective and it may stop people, particularly the Leader of the Opposition and members of the opposition, from running around the country and making these outrageous, malicious and scurrilous allegations and accusations and claiming, for instance, that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts or the Prime Minister are guilty of industrial manslaughter. Mr Harris is an impeccable commentator without any bias in regard to this matter. I quote from his article titled ‘Abbott spurns the facts’:
But Opposition Leader Tony Abbott and coalition environment spokesman Greg Hunt are not worried by lack of evidence. All blame belongs to Environment Minister Peter Garrett, including responsibility for the deaths of four workers killed while installing insulation.
We are learning, in dribs and drabs, that some of these deaths cannot be fairly sheeted home to the commonwealth. But Abbott has no wish to be tainted by facts or courtesy. Of today’s politicians, only Abbott—fast becoming a brazen image of Mark Latham—would question Garrett’s “moral universe” for failing to resign and accuse him of “industrial manslaughter”.
The opposition’s approach has been adopted by the usual frenzied commentators, none of whom has ever administered more than an opinion.
There are a couple of those on radio in Sydney, for a start. The article goes on:
. . . the opposition has succeeded: the electorate is given self-serving accusations in place of considered facts . . .  judgements are prejudicial, especially those as rabid as the opposition’s.
I quote further:
. . . government requirements issued early last year—well before troubles emerged—suggest that the Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts dealt with the issues as we would have expected. For example, most applicant householders were required to obtain two independent quotes. Quotes had to name the type of product to be installed, its insulation or “R” value, and itemise material and labour costs as well as an estimate of the area of the residence to be insulated (all of the living areas had to be insulated).
When householders—they were the parties who had contractual relations with installers—were satisfied with the installation, they would sign the form allowing the government to pay.
To obtain payment, installers had to be in the insulation business (or later be a registered supplier). They had to provide details of the product, and they had to certify that it met the minimum R value specified for the region and that it met Australian standards. They also had to certify that their work met relevant building and safety standards. If installers failed to provide reasonable service, householders should not have approved their work If an installer duped a householder, the commonwealth is entitled to (and should) get the taxpayer’s money back.
These guidelines were tightened in July, September, November and December.
The article goes on. As I said, I urge all senators to read it. It goes on, for instance, to refer to the number of deaths that occur every year in industries like construction. The former government introduced Work Choices laws which removed many of the opportunities for union officials to inspect safety standards. The point about this insulation program is that there were strict guidelines in place, and they were improved upon through the program. The opposition should deal with the facts and not prejudicial accusations. (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-03-09,"—Who remembers Sergeant Schultz from that wonderful program? ‘I know nothing’—that is the response we have received today from Senator Mark Arbib, the minister responsible in this place, and indeed from Mr Garrett, over not only days and weeks but months and months: ‘I know nothing’. We ask questions and we get glib responses saying safety is a top priority. That is the best we can get.
I asked Senator Arbib three questions today. He did not answer one of those questions. He took them on notice, and at the end of question time today gave a glib, short response which was entirely inadequate and did not answer the question. The answer he gave was: ‘I know nothing.’ I asked about the 21 warnings that the minister received. I quoted from his answer to a question yesterday in the Senate. I wanted to know what happened in response to those warnings, and the dates on which the changes were made. At the end of question time he comes up with four—four out of 21 is not a very good track record, Minister. You took those on notice. So I ask you to do the right thing by the Senate, by the public, and come back in here to the chamber and answer those questions. If you cannot do that then do it in quick time, by the close of business, and you will be let off. But the ‘I know nothing’ approach is the Sergeant Schultz response we are getting from this government.
Minister Garrett has said that he has ‘taken advice’ and he has acted on it. In the dark of the night, at six o’clock last night, this government had the temerity to come in here and table a document, the Minter Ellison risk register, which should have been tabled earlier, which was given to the department in April last year. The tabled document was an attachment to the Minter Ellison report, which was released last Friday, which was made public and given to the department in April last year. What does the risk register say? It highlights the risk of fires, fraud, inflated costs and waste. What else does it say? It recommends a three-month delay in the commencement of the project from July to September last year. The minister has said categorically, black and blue, up hill and down dale, ‘I acted on advice.’ Mr Deputy President, please can we get an honest answer from the ministers responsible, Mr Garrett and Senator Arbib, today? Please can they come clean and explain in detail exactly the advice they received and when they acted on it—because it beggars belief that no minister, and no ministerial adviser, saw or read the Minter Ellison report of April last year, were advised with respect to it or were informed with respect to the risk regarding this Home Insulation Program, which is now an absolute fiasco.
This government has no shame. We now have 80,000 homes across the country with safety risks from their insulation. We have 160,000 homes across the country with substandard or non-compliant insulation. In Tasmania, on a population share basis, that is 2,000 homes with a safety risk and 4,000 with substandard or non-compliant insulation. That is not good enough. And I see in the Daily Telegraph today, in relation to waste and mismanagement, that the potential or actual waste is some $400 million. Mind you, that is one in four. So, if you have had insulation put into your home, be careful—that is nearly one in four homes that will need to be checked out or audited and that are subject to safety concerns or substandard insulation. That is a big problem—please, watch out. Fifteen per cent are now going to be audited.
As to the time frame, apparently, according to the Herald Sun, Mr David Wise rang the hotline yesterday and was advised that it would take five years before his house would be checked by the government. Come on! Is there a duty of care to the families, to the people in these homes that have had insulation installed? Come clean. This is just another broken promise from the list of broken promises that the government have made. They have had so many blunders: GROCERYchoice, Fuelwatch, the hospitals that were to be fixed by 30 June 2009, the private health insurance rebate broken promise, the childcare places broken promise, the GP superclinics broken promise—it goes on and on. When will this government stand responsible and accountable for their actions?

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-03-09,"—I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Evans with regard to the UNHCR figures. Those figures were completely disingenuous.
—Senator Parry on a point of order?
—The point of order was going to be relevance, in that we had strayed off the topic. But I will withdraw the point of order until I check my facts. It might be the case that it was not put that we were only taking note of the answers given by Senator Arbib.
—No. We were asked to take note of the answers given by Senator Arbib and Senator Evans.
—I will try again. I understand why there might have been a point of order taken, because I do not think the opposition really want to hear this—they do not want to know what the true facts are. Once again, they are being malicious and fearmongering and completely disingenuous with regard to the UNHCR figures. The data that the opposition immigration spokesman, Scott Morrison, is using, is actually from an incomplete UNHCR report. We need the opposition to learn to deal with facts—to read their reports and make sure they understand them—and to make sure that they are not just fearmongering, trying to scare people. I will get to the reason they are trying to do that in a moment.
That UNHCR report was not published on the 15th, and final figures for asylum applications in 2009 were still to be determined. But that did not stop the opposition. We know that what they really want to do is reintroduce the disgraced ‘Pacific solution’ to detain asylum seekers. In a radio interview with 2GB on 2 February, the opposition’s immigration spokesman, Scott Morrison, said:
We have no problem with finding alternative offshore detention arrangements, whether that’s in another country or within another excised Australian territory. The government has said no to that. I mean, that’s what they should have been doing for the last six months when they knew that the boats were surging. They should have been looking for an alternative offshore destination, as we did—we had Nauru and Manus.
Under John Howard’s so-called Pacific solution, 1,637 people, including 452 children, were packed off to Nauru and Manus Island, where the average length of stay was 501 days, or approximately one and a third years. This is what the opposition want to do again. The longest length of stay was 1,958 days—more than five years. The opposition ought to be ashamed of themselves for that issue alone. Of the 1,637 people detained in the Nauru and Manus facilities, 1,153, or 70 per cent, were ultimately resettled in Australia or another country. Of those, 705 were resettled in Australia.
The Howard government’s Pacific solution was condemned internationally and did nothing to foster regional cooperation on people-smuggling or promote international cooperation on providing protection to refugees. In its submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, the UNHCR expressed concern that the Pacific solution detracted from Australia’s international responsibilities. But we do not hear the opposition mentioning that at all—‘No, we’ll just forget; we’ll go back to scaremongering.’ Why can’t they get their facts right? It is beyond belief that they come in here and try to scare people.
Their latest claim, as I said, uses selective data and ignores the truth about their own record. The highest number of boat arrivals on record came under John Howard’s Liberal government in 2001, when 5,516 people arrived in 43 boats.
—But we were able to actually fix it.

Senator Back interjecting—

—The months of August and September 2001 saw more than 2,200 people arrive in just 10 boats. I understand why the opposition are interjecting—because they really do not want this to come out. They want to scaremonger; they are trying to frighten everybody into thinking that something awful is going to happen. They need to learn to tell the truth; they need to get their facts straight and stop being so disingenuous with the people of Australia by coming in here in question time and asking completely spurious questions and making out that in some way the fault lies with the Rudd government. Those on the other side never let the truth get in the way of a good story. (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2010-03-09,"—I wish to further comment regarding Senator Arbib’s answers in question time today. I generally do not at all mind being right, but I must admit that on this occasion it is a somewhat sour experience. On 11 February this year, with regard to the Home Insulation Program, I said:
… this is going to cause a frenzy of activity in the market, but for what purpose?
I said it would simply allow the ‘cowboys’ in. I continued:
It is one small section of a market. It will attract …  people who do not have a clue what they are doing, and it will attract people who are dishonest. We will have dozens and dozens of stories of pensioners who are ripped off by  people who go up into their roofs, apparently fiddle around for a while and then leave. It will be months before they discover that they did not get what they paid for; they will be lucky if they get anything.
I had assumed then that the inordinate haste with which the government was developing this program would encourage shonks and cowboys and cause fraud and dishonesty. I did not realise that it would be worse than that—that it would cause deaths and untold damage to what has been for years a very stable industry in Australia.
It is interesting to look at the figures that both Senator Arbib and Minister Garrett have used, and tried very hard to avoid, on the costs of checking out the current disaster. We are talking about up to $60 million at present simply to check whether or not what has been done is adequate. That is just the cost of checking. All these stories ignore time after time the costs not only, regrettably, to the families who have lost people but to the many small and medium family businesses in Australia that for years—20 or 30 years in some cases—have been installing insulation in Australia. They are companies like that run by Mr Russell Browning in Bulimba, in Brisbane, where yesterday 14 sackings were announced. That is being repeated in hundreds of family businesses all over Australia. Why? Because this government could not wait to be seen to be doing something. Thank God, I suppose, they did something, but why, when they have so little expertise in this area, when their ranks are composed of people who have not worked in the construction industry ever or for dozens of years, do they think they know how to run this program?
Senator Forshaw told us that it was a good thing that the government had been tightening this scheme in September, in October, in November and in December. I am sorry, but four attempts to fix it? Did Minister Garrett and Senator Arbib not realise after the second attempt that in fact this could not be fixed and that it was a bad program? This is not an example of good activity; this is an example of a bad scheme and of throwing bad after bad.
I am bemused by the fact that this government will not acknowledge that we have not said that Minister Garrett was guilty of industrial manslaughter. In fact, Mr Abbott has simply made the point that in New South Wales consideration would be given to raising the matter of investigating whether Mr Garrett would have been guilty of industrial manslaughter had he been working in the private sector. In his defence we have Minister Gillard saying, ‘Peter can’t be in every roof in Australia,’ meaning Minister Garrett. But I bet Minister Gillard will be there beside every family business owner and every small business in Australia when they are forced to put off staff and have debts they cannot meet because of the way the government has behaved. I bet Minister Gillard will manage to be at their shoulder. As has been pointed out by Mr Abbott, the buck stops with the CEO—in this case, the minister. He has not acted appropriately. He was warned that this was becoming shonky. He was warned that there had been death and that there would be ongoing, irreparable damage to a very worthwhile industry.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-03-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate—
censures the Government for its gross and systematic failure in the delivery of its climate change programs including home insulation, green loans, solar rebate, renewable remote power generation program and the renewable energy target; and
calls on the Government to put in place a unified ministry and Department of Climate Change and Energy.
I begin by assuring the Senate that this is done with great gravity. There has not been a motion of censure of a minister or of the government in the period the Rudd government has been in office. The use of the censure, I can assure senators, is not taken by me, after 24 years parliamentary experience, lightly at all.
However, as a nation we are witnessing one of the grossest episodes of mishandling of the public money and the public trust in recent governance history. The Rudd government came to office in a very large part on the basis of its commitment to the Australian public to address the issue of climate change. Two big election promises to that end were the 20 per cent renewable energy target and the promise that 150,000 Australian homes would be given green loans to improve both their water efficiency and their ability to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and therefore help in the fight against climate change.
In the event, the 20 per cent renewable energy target program has failed, not least because of the government’s refusal to take note of warnings from my colleague Senator Milne. Instead of including photovoltaics and solar hot-water services within the target, Senator Milne advised to make them additional to the target. The government did not take that advice; the Prime Minister did not take that advice; the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts did not take notice of that advice; and, in this place, the Minister for Climate Change and Water did not take notice of that advice. Now we have a renewable energy target program which is in corrosion if not at the point of sheer collapse. The wind energy system in Australia, which had such promise of investment, job creation and clean energy creation, is in the doldrums, to say the least, with hundreds of jobs and the expectation of many small businesses and, indeed, some large businesses blighted by the government’s failure to take better advice, on this occasion from a Greens senator who knew much better and was much better informed about the state of that industry and the delivery of this program.
The second commitment to the Australian people, which attracted a great deal of voter approval, was the promise by the government of 150,000 green loans. In the event, 1,000 have been and will be delivered. This is a less than one per cent success rate on that promise. Amongst the blighted promises is the program rollout to skill people to be able to take part in this program, thousands of whom now are skilled with nowhere to go, with their investment lost and with no promise of future employment.
When we look at the now renowned Home Insulation Program, which was part of the stimulus package, there was a promise which led everybody in Australia to believe that they could safely have their homes insulated and their power prices brought down to make a contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In the event, we know that this is now an utter shambles. It has led not only to potential loss of life and injury but also to some 90 house fires and some 1,000 or more potential electrified ceilings. Many people around Australia who have had this insulation installed in their homes wanted to think they would feel good about this as a result of their contribution to climate change and their lower power bills; but instead they are worried about whether death lurks in their attic or ceiling. It is a terrible situation.
I quote from an article on the front page of the Age today which outlines one account of the outcome of this program:
LIKE a chain of dominoes, the once booming insulation industry was collapsing yesterday, with hundreds of jobs axed and thousands more expected to go amid warnings the sector could freeze for a year.
At the top of the insulation food chain, Australia’s biggest ceiling batt manufacturer warned that factories could close within weeks.
Several companies have been running their factories 24 hours a day, seven days a week for months, creating a huge glut of batts that are now largely unwanted in the wake of the rebate scheme being axed on Friday by Environment Minister Peter Garrett.
Fletcher Insulation makes about 40 per cent of Australia’s insulation, and managing director David Isaacs said he expected 8000 jobs to be lost from the industry.
It is an utter shambles. We have been left to wonder how the government could get into such a mess. One of the problems is that there was not due diligence from the top. We do know that the Prime Minister’s office is inordinately interested in what the various departments, including the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, and the Department of Climate Change, are doing in the delivery of infrastructure and public spending. As the Prime Minister himself has said in the last 24 hours, he takes—and Prime Minister Rudd must take—responsibility for the way in which this extraordinary failure of billions of dollars of potential investment of taxpayers’ money, and money from the private sector, has been botched. That is what has happened.
Then we discover that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts commissioned last year a report from Minter Ellison about the proposed programs and Minter Ellison reported to the department and to the minister—and no doubt to the Prime Minister himself—in April last year that there was great concern about the government’s ability, the department’s ability, to handle such a mammoth program. They recommended a delay of three months from July to the end of September. The report warned otherwise of the extreme risk of house fires, fraud and poor quality insulation, amongst many other things, and said that up to $195 million of taxpayers’ money could be wasted if delay, due diligence and prudent rollout were not undertaken. But we also now know that neither the Prime Minister nor the minister for the environment looked at that report until a couple of weeks ago. In other words, it was commissioned by the government and it gave a warning of things that were to happen.
We are not talking about hindsight here; those things happened because the government did not take notice, and the ministers, the Prime Minister included, must take responsibility. Now we understand that neither the minister nor the Prime Minister even read the report. We have it from the bureaucracy that government was told about the consequences coming from those reports. I am not going to split hairs here, but when ministers—even if they have not read a report they have commissioned themselves—get advised on the content of that report with such dire warnings and such horrendous consequences if advice is not taken, and they listen to neither, they have to accept that there has been a gross failure of governance by the Rudd government in this area of the rollout of a green program in an age of climate change which had such promise and should have had such a massive triple dividend—economic, employment and environmental—for the Australian people.
This censure is warranted. This government ought to be censured. This government stands censured, if this motion passes by the Senate, for a gross failure of governance which involves several ministers, not least the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and the Prime Minister himself.",SENATE,<title>RUDD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2010-03-09,"—Has there been an agreement on speaking times?
—No.
—Could you just clarify?
—The normal 20 minutes is available for you.
—Except the clock has been set for 10 minutes.
—I have not been notified of any agreement.
—Neither have I been notified. Mr Deputy President, could you clarify what is going on, because, as far as I know, there is no agreement. Equally, I do not want Senator Brown being prevented, if he thinks there is an agreement, from using his full time.
—The leader has not been notified? His side, I can assure you, has been. I have no trouble with him speaking his full 20 minutes.
—Senator Brown, the chair has not been notified of any speaking arrangements, so the normal speaking arrangements of up to 20 minutes apply.
—Senator Brown claims that we are in on some sort of arrangement. I have both the whip and the relevant minister here and they do not seem to know anything about it. Perhaps, Senator Brown, in doing a deal with the Liberal Party on this motion you forgot to include us in such arrangements. In any event, nothing turns on it.
Senator Brown in introducing this motion said he did it with some gravity. Quite frankly, I do not think he is serious and I do not think the Australian public will think he is serious. A censure is a very serious matter. It is something that has not been undertaken lightly in this chamber before. It usually has been treated very seriously by all senators and very seriously by the government of the day. This is not such an occasion. This reeks of an ill-conceived stunt and is not an appropriate vehicle for the sort of debate that Senator Brown wants to have.
As I understand it, because the Liberal and National parties have agreed to support this motion, it will pass, but I suspect it will disappear very quickly as an irrelevancy in the political debate in this country. The motion reflects poorly on the Greens and I think confirms that the Liberal Party are irrelevant and unfit to govern. It seeks to censure the government over delivery of all its climate change related programs, which is an interesting to do in a censure motion. It does not actually specify any of the alleged failings, so we have been censured in general. We have been censured for being the government; we have been censured because the Greens are unhappy with our programs.
—‘Systematic failure’.
—Systematic and broad failure, apparently, is what the problem is. It does not specify anything that warrants a censure. No argument was made by Senator Brown of anything that would warrant a censure of a minister, let alone the whole government. It goes on, in an unusual break from tradition, to call on the government to:
… put in place a unified Ministry and Department of Climate Change and Energy.
This is a very unusual Senate censure motion. I do not know who drafted this for Senator Brown, but he ought to look for a new drafter. I do not know who provided this advice on the understanding of parliamentary processes, but he ought to get some better advice.
—That’s your opinion!
—It is my opinion, and I am putting it very strongly because this is an absolute nonsense! You are not serious. You do yourself a disservice by seeking to move this censure. It is poorly worded, it does not outline its case and it reflects a poor understanding of the role of censure motions in the parliamentary process. This is more about the Greens trying to get into the limelight in this debate because they have been noticeably absent and removed in the debate over Minister Garrett and the programs he administers. This seems to be a belated attempt to get involved.
I would be more convinced of the seriousness of the Greens on this matter if they displayed that this week. The Greens get very few questions in this place. They only get one a day, I acknowledge that, and they do not have the opportunity to ask as many questions as I am sure they would like, even though the government has facilitated above pro rata representation in question time. This week the Greens have had two opportunities to ask questions: one yesterday and one today. If they were so concerned about this matter, if they thought the government warranted censure, then Mr Deputy President you would of course assume that both questions to the government this week would have been about these matters. But they have not been. Yesterday we were asked about toxins in forests. Senator Sherry was asked about that by Senator Brown. Today Senator Ludlum asked a question about nuclear waste dumps. So these are the Greens: really serious about this issue, absolutely concerned. This is a very grave issue according to Senator Brown, but not so grave as to warrant a question in the two opportunities they have had this week. It is not as important as a question about toxins in Tasmanian forests yesterday or as important as the nuclear waste dump proposition was today.
The Greens are not serious. This is more about relevance deprivation in this debate than anything else. If they were serious they would have been pressing this argument, this case in the parliament, much more forcefully than they have. And rather than do an MPI or another debate, which probably would have been a better vehicle for them to raise whatever concerns they have, we have a censure motion to which Senator Brown spoke for 10 minutes. They are not serious; it is not a serious resolution.
Quite frankly, I would urge the Liberal Party to rethink whether or not this is a road that they ought to go down. The Liberal Party, by supporting this, are saying this is serious, that it is one of the gravest things being considered by a parliamentary party that professes to be the alternative government, and yet they have signed up to this piece of nonsense that is illogical and poorly constructed. Quite frankly, I think it has a couple of hooks in it for them. I know the Liberal Party have adopted a policy under their new leader, Mr Abbott, that they do not need policies, they just need to dirty up the government, and that they are going to oppose everything for the sake of opposition. That is what Mr Abbott stated, and this is a classic case. They have signed up to the Greens’ censure motion because they are about trying to dirty up the government. It is not because, on any analysis of the motion, they should be voting for it—and they will regret voting for it. Interestingly, it seems to me now that the Liberal Party are endorsing a call for there to be a new ministry of climate change and energy.
—No, we’re not!
—Well, that is contained in the resolution. So the Liberal Party are endorsing this.
—You haven’t seen my amendment.
—I have not seen the senator’s amendment. All I know is that he has signed up to this and it interests me because—

Senator Birmingham interjecting—

—I divert for a second, Mr Deputy President. I table the transcript of Senator Birmingham’s interview today because I thought his personal explanation was disingenuous in the extreme. And, so as to set the record straight, I table the full transcript that I quoted from today. People can make their own decisions about whether Senator Birmingham’s explanation was disingenuous or not, but I am happy for the record to be there. Senator Birmingham, if he claims to be misrepresented next time, ought to be a bit more frank because the full record supports exactly what I said about what he said today. But I digress.
It is interesting that maybe the Liberal Party have now had a rethink about supporting a new ministry of climate change and energy. I was wondering whether Senator Minchin had thought through his agreement to abandon his Energy portfolio as part of his responsibilities, to be demoted to only being the shadow minister for resources. I would have thought that would be a fairly large fall in status for the senator. I wondered whether he was going out there to industry to explain how the Liberal Party now supported the Energy portfolio being part of a climate change department rather than being connected to Resources. I am sure the mining industry and the energy industry were very interested in this development from the Liberal Party in supporting this Greens’ motion.
This is nonsensical, this is poorly drafted and it reflects an attempt to try to get into the public debate in a way that does the Greens and the Liberal Party a disservice. The seriousness the Liberal Party are showing in relation to this is reflected in their lead speaker. As I understand it, their lead speaker in this censure motion will be a shadow parliamentary secretary, Senator Birmingham. I am sure he will do his case justice, but, quite frankly, if you are serious about a censure, you do not send in a shadow parliamentary secretary. I have never, ever heard before of a serious censure in this parliament that has not been supported by the leader of the government or the Leader of the Opposition, and to send in the shadow parliamentary secretary says you are not dinkum.
—That’s the depth of our talent!
—The depth of your talent? I am happy to discuss that some other time. It is a very shallow gene pool.
This is how serious the Liberal Party are: they support a motion that seeks to take Energy into a Climate Change portfolio, which as I say is not something that was reflected in their decisions about their shadow ministry structure in December, and now we find they treat this issue so seriously that they send in a shadow parliamentary secretary in a censure motion. I will go back after this debate to see when a major political party in this country failed to send a senior frontbencher into the debate when they were supporting a censure motion. I have not had time to check on that and I am happy to have a look at the record, but I would be amazed if an alternative government in this country sought to prosecute a censure against the whole government and did not actually send in one of its leadership group. That shows that the Liberal Party are not serious about it; it shows that the Greens are not serious about it. This is a joke. It is not taken seriously by this government. The nature of the motion and the nature of the approach clearly indicates that this is more stunt than serious attempt to debate the issues or make a case against the government. No case has been made, and Senator Brown did not attempt to make a case in moving this motion.
As my major response to this motion, I want to take up the reference to delivery of climate change programs. It is interesting that they left out the major climate change program that this government has introduced—the CPRS, and the move to try to set up an emissions trading scheme in this country. That was the largest measure introduced by this government to try to tackle the serious nature of climate change. The motion rightly refers to a range of other measures that this government has introduced: the government having made a serious attempt across a range of areas to tackle climate change and the protection of our environment. The list shows how serious the government has been by detailing some of those measures—by no means all, but some of them.
If you are going to be serious about a debate on the government’s climate change programs, you have to start with the CPRS. You have to start with our attempt to introduce an emissions trading scheme. That is left off the list provided by the Greens in support of the Liberal Party. Why? Because they have blocked the government’s attempts to introduce that legislation. They have twice opposed that legislation in the Senate and prevented us from implementing the major measure that we took to the last election to address climate change. So they are saying to us, ‘Oh well, we are concerned about these other measures,’ when in fact they have used every endeavour at their disposal to prevent us honouring our key election commitment in this area. That shows a level of hypocrisy in those supporting this motion.
We have attempted to work with the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Greens to fulfil our election promise to introduce an emissions trading scheme in this country. We are now having a third go at that, and we had a procedural stunt pulled yesterday to try to prevent us from proceeding to having it debated a third time. I am not a great one for mandate theory. I have heard people make outlandish and unreasonable claims about mandates for many years in this place, but I have generally resisted making some of those more extreme claims. But if there ever were a policy that came before the Senate where one could claim a mandate, I think the ETS would be it. At the last election it was the policy both of this government and of the former government, the coalition.
—Then it wasn’t an issue at the election.
—You might say it was not an issue in that sense, and I suppose that it is right, in a way—there was not the complex debate about the detail of competing claims. But I do remind the opposition that they swore to the electorate that they would support the introduction of an ETS. I heard Malcolm Turnbull last night indicate that he supported the great, progressive former Prime Minister of this country, John Howard, in his determination to introduce an ETS. Malcolm Turnbull is still loyal to John Howard and his agenda and the commitments made by the Liberal Party at the last election. Unfortunately, the election commitment has been abandoned by the Liberal Party.
—You don’t still believe in nationalising banks, do you?
—This is the last election, Senator Brandis, and that was your policy. It was your policy until about three months ago. Mr President, you cannot have a debate in this chamber about the government’s climate change programs without including the ETS and the CPRS more generally. The Greens conveniently forget that. It is conveniently dropped off the list of issues when they are talking about programs that this government has implemented to address the effects of climate change. I think there is a lot of cheek involved in the moving of this motion. There is not a lot of seriousness; there is not a lot of gravity. There has been no real effort to justify the very serious charge involved in moving a censure motion against a government.
This party, this government, is very proud of its record in environmental issues in its two years in government. We promised we would sign the Kyoto Protocol, and we did. We promised we would move to introduce a carbon pollution reduction scheme and emissions trading in this country, and we have consistently attempted to deliver on that commitment. In addition to those measures, we have introduced a whole range of other initiatives that have sought to improve homes by improving energy efficiency through increasing access to solar hot water systems and phasing out incandescent light bulbs, and there have been improvements in energy efficiency standards. No doubt Senator Wong will run through the many, many things we have done to improve support for our environment and improve and tackle climate change. This is not a serious attempt to deal with those issues. It is a stunt, and it is not one that should be supported by the Senate. The government will treat it with contempt because we do not take it seriously.
—This is the Senate, and you are treating the Senate with contempt.
—Well, you go out and defend this nonsense in the public arena. I know what the view of the general public will be. They will regard it as a political stunt. I have already been out, on the weekend, talking to people and listening to what they had to say about some of the charges against Mr Garrett. He is getting a great deal of support out in the community. I spoke to an electrician on the weekend and had reported to me a conversation with a plumber. They know very well where the responsibilities for these matters of workplace health and safety lie. One of them referred me to a 1994 safety pamphlet that he had knowledge of that dealt with this question of safety with insulation and raised some of these concerns. My experience of dealing with the general public is they treat much of this as a political stunt. They do think the deaths of those poor young men are serious. They do think we ought to treat this seriously.

Senator Birmingham interjecting—

—But they do not like the way, Senator Birmingham, that you and some of your colleagues have sought to use those deaths in pursuing a political point. It does you no credit. The Australian public do not like it. Holding a minister to account is one thing but accusing him of being responsible for deaths is quite another.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I think, just like you did this morning, that you and the Liberal Party have overreached, just like you did with Godwin Grech. You do not show the judgement required in these matters and I think you will regret the excesses of this matter because you have sought to go beyond what is a reasonable attempt to hold a minister accountable for his portfolio. That is perfectly reasonable when the parliamentary opportunities are there to do that and Minister Garrett has had to come into the House of Representatives chamber and defend himself and defend himself publicly, and that is as it should be. But I think you have overreached and you have unfairly sought to take advantage of those tragic situations in advancing your case. That is regrettable. The Liberal Party ought to reconsider how far it has gone with some of the accusations that it has made.
This proposed resolution is a joke. I think the fact that Senator Bob Brown could not do more than 10 minutes in supporting it indicates how seriously he takes it. There have been no questions from the Greens on this issue this week. There has been no concerted attempt to argue that censure is warranted. I think the Liberal Party ought to think more carefully about signing up to this sort of stunt. They are increasingly getting a reputation of not being fit to be an alternative government in this country.
 (Senator Troeth)—Minister Evans, I think you were intending to table a document.
—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I table the document I referred to, which is a transcript of what Senator Birmingham said at the doors this morning.",SENATE,<title>RUDD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-03-09,"—Firstly, I move this amendment to the motion:

That the paragraph “The Senate calls on the Government to put in place unified Ministry of Climate Change and Energy” be deleted.

At the outset let me address a couple of the comments that Senator Evans made. Firstly, in relation to the timing of speeches, let me be very clear that I have been advised by the Chief Opposition Whip and Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate that there was no agreement with the Liberal Party or the coalition with regard to the timing of speeches. So any assertion that Senator Evans has made about some cosy agreement between the coalition and the Greens on this matter is quite plainly wrong. While reflecting on the timing of speeches, I would also note that I think Senator Evans has unleashed something at the end of his remarks by commenting about Senator Bob Brown only contributing 10 minutes. I am pretty confident that we all know what the consequences of that will be when Senator Brown rises to conclude this debate.
Senator Evans also sought to cast aspersions on who was leading this debate for the opposition. Let me be quite clear that I am very happy to lead the debate against Senator Evans or Senator Wong—or Senator Brown—on any day of the week, especially when it comes to the mismanagement of the government’s environmental programs. This motion has been moved by the Greens. It has not been moved by the opposition. Therefore as a censure motion it has not been moved by the opposition and taken up by our leader or deputy leader. It has been taken up by me as the spokesman on these issues in this chamber.
—Where are your senior frontbenchers?
—I am very happy, Senator Wong, to debate you and to debate Senator Evans on these and other issues any day of the week that you choose, because your record stands as a testament of failure by the government in the management of these issues. That is why the censure component of this motion, its part 1, is commanding the support of the opposition. It is commanding our support because it identifies very clearly failure across a number of programs that this government has sought to implement, a number of programs where this government has got its implementation strategy seriously wrong, and the consequences of its errors in implementing those policies have been devastating. They have been devastating to the budget where hundreds of millions of dollars have been squandered, devastating to the lives of Australians, both families hurt by the mismanagement of programs and businesses hurt by the mismanagement of programs. These programs—the Home Insulation Program, the Green Loans Program, the solar rebate, the remote renewable power generation program and the renewable energy target—all stand out as beacons of failure by the government in their implementation strategy, beacons of failure to deliver on their promises or to deliver on their promises in a manner that actually gets those promises through rather than ending up in absolute disaster. This is a serious motion. It is a censure motion and the opposition considers its support or otherwise as to the censure of the government very seriously.
—Where’s Minchin? Where are your senior frontbenchers? Where are they while you are talking? Where’s Minchin?
—I do not see too many people sitting around you either, Senator Wong. There are far more people on this side of the chamber than on your side of the chamber.
We know that there are more censure motions moved in the other place. Censure motions are moved with far greater frequency in the other place. In this place this is the first censure motion moved since 2005. Indeed, it has been moved after some weeks of debate about one particular program, the Home Insulation Program. That has been coupled in a less public way with a lot of angst and a lot of community concern about the Green Loans Program. There have also been concerns about solar hot water support that has led to problems with the renewable energy target. All of these issues have been brewing over a number of weeks. We, as an opposition, have sought to prosecute our case in the House of Representatives time and time again. We have sought time and again to bring to the attention of the House of Representatives the failures in particular of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, to act responsibly and to manage his portfolio appropriately and to manage his responsibilities in implementing these key policy areas appropriately.
He has failed to do so. The opposition, led by Tony Abbott and Greg Hunt, has highlighted time and time again the programs of Minister Garrett and the problems that are manifest in his portfolio. Given that the government has used its numbers in the House of Representatives to block our efforts time and again over the last few weeks, I welcome the fact that the Greens have accepted many of our valid points and criticisms. I acknowledge that Senator Milne and others have also been making these points and criticisms for some time. The Greens have decided to accept the manifest failure of the government and to bring a censure motion to this place to pass judgment on the government’s failings.
Judgment is an important thing. Senator Evans attempted to talk about judgment when he tried to bring into question the judgment of the opposition. Let us consider the judgment of the government in promising to introduce these policies. It has promised policies that are far from achievable and are far from sensible, measured or deliverable. The government has promised the world but instead has delivered chaos. That is this government’s legacy on its environmental policies. It promised the world going into the last election, but it has simply delivered chaos in the implementation of these policies.
—It is the most calamitous government since the Whitlam government.
—Thank you, Senator Brandis. It is the most calamitous government since the Whitlam government. By the way the Australian people are reacting to the failures of this government, it is evident that they—and, in particular, Minister Garrett—are in more strife than the early settlers when it comes to these portfolios.
Firstly, the story on the Home Insulation Program is an absolutely tragic one. Senator Evans acknowledged that. It is tragic because it has involved the loss of the lives of four young Australians working on installing insulation. I do not blame Minister Garrett directly for that loss of life; nor does the opposition. We blame Minister Garrett for failing to recognise, in implementing a government promise, the consequences of how the industry and the market would respond to workplace safety. That is the tragedy of this program. Associated with the House Insulation Program are around 93 house fires. We know from estimates of the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts today that there are around 1,000 homes at risk of electrification as a result of dodgy installation and that there are more than 200,000 Australian homes estimated to have received inadequate or dodgy insulation. A number of them are at risk of fire.
These are serious issues and serious statistics, and these are things that could have been avoided had the minister acted appropriately when implementing the Home Insulation Program. Did Minister Garrett act on the advice that he received? We now know not only that there were multiple warnings—more than 20—coming from industry and state government sources and elsewhere about the risks inherent to this program but also that the government commissioned its own independent external advice. It commissioned not one but two reports from that esteemed law firm Minter Ellison, where my colleague Senator Brandis used to practise.
—I am a Minter Ellison alumnus!
—Indeed, and I am sure you are a proud and well-recognised member of their alumni. These two reports provided by Minter Ellison to government—the risk management plan and the risk register—identified a number of concerns that should have been recognised and acted on by the government. The Minister for Employment Participation, Senator Arbib, came into question time today and, in one of the rare instances where he has been questioned about these issues, attempted to provide some level of detail to an answer. He tried to go through the risk management plan and say that each of the issues had been adequately addressed. They quite clearly were not adequately addressed. The proof is in the outcome, and the outcome is the tragic statistics I spoke of before.
It is not just that the government did not act on the concerns. The government even had suggestions put to them by Minter Ellison that it failed to act on. It was suggested to the government that risks in certain areas were not tolerable. Minter Ellison, in documenting the risks of implementing this program, found that on 9 April 2009, when they delivered these reports to Minister Garrett’s department, the risks of going ahead and implementing the programs were not tolerable. They recommended, instead, that the government consider delaying the start date for the Home Insulation Program by three months. This was so there could be more time for the government to put in place appropriate regulations, registration, training, restrictions around procurement processes and the types of things that could have ensured installers were well trained and that the pink batts or other insulation materials they were installing were up to scratch. These are the things that the government could have done had it bought an extra three months to get the implementation right. Instead, it ignored that advice. The government ignored the advice in a report that it paid more than $20,000 to get which suggested it should just wait three months.
They ignored it because the great haste was on; the pressure to deliver quickly was on. They needed to be seen to be taking ‘decisive action’—which at the time was the buzzword from the government, the ‘well-focus-grouped’ term. The government needed to be seen to be a government of decisive action, so they wanted to rush this program through as quickly as possible. That was the brief, clearly, from the Prime Minister. It was the brief given to Senator Arbib when he was appointed into the executive. I note that the best excuse Senator Arbib could offer up today as to why he was not as culpable as Minister Garrett in the implementation of this program was that he was not a minister at the time; he was just a parliamentary secretary. Well, parliamentary secretaries are appointed with executive responsibilities, and his executive responsibility was to assist in the implementation of the stimulus package. He should have assisted in the implementation of the Home Insulation Program. Rather than saying, ‘Go faster, go faster, go faster,’ he should have been saying: ‘Hasten slowly. Take the cautious approach and make sure we get this right, because, if we don’t get this right, lives could be at risk.’
It is not just the Home Insulation Program for which the government stands condemned. Yes, that program has caused immense suffering to many families and immense damage to the insulation industry in Australia—damage that some businesses who have existed not just for 12 months but for 12 years or longer will struggle to recover from—but the government also stands condemned for the other programs that the Greens have highlighted in this censure motion. There is the Green Loans program. It is worth recounting a little bit of the history of Green Loans. Green Loans was one of those great election policies of Team Rudd back in 2007. It was one of those policies where they promised the world and we can see now that they have delivered chaos. What did they promise? Kevin Rudd and Peter Garrett, in their 2007 policy document Solar Schools, Solar Homes, promised to:
Offer low interest Green Loans of up to $10,000 each to make 200,000 existing homes more energy and water efficient, with subsidised environmental audits and free Green Renovations packs.
That was the promise: 200,000 green loans of up to $10,000 each. How many have been delivered? At last estimates, it was 1,008 out of the 200,000. And guess what. In the changes announced by Minister Garrett last Friday, we discovered that the Green Loans program will no longer have a loans component. That is right. If it were not so serious, you would think it really was an episode of The Hollowmen: a Greens Loans program without a loans component.
Of course, this is not the first downsizing or change to Labor’s election promise on Green Loans. In the 2009 budget, the Labor government quietly downsized their promise. It went from being a promise to provide 200,000 green loans to instead providing 75,000 green loans. So they sliced more than 60 per cent of the loans off before they even started implementing the program. The loans were promised to be 20,000 this year, 20,000 each of the next couple of years and 15,000 in the last year. But, as I said, 1,008 out of the 20,000 budgeted for this year are all the government have managed to deliver.
The government promised to appoint some auditors to go into homes and conduct sustainability assessments of homes. They left the impression that there would be 1,000 auditors. In his 8 May 2009 media release—the one where he downsized the program from 200,000 loans to 75,000 loans—Minister Garrett said that there would be 1,000 home sustainability assessors. On 20 August 2009, Ms Kruk, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, told the Australian Economic Forum that the program would be delivered through training 1,000 home sustainability assessors. Guess what. Instead of training 1,000 home sustainability assessors, the government trained 3,648. That was the estimate given at estimates, although I note that the industry body is citing figures far higher than that as the number who appear to have been accredited.
There are some questions there that need to be answered which I have posed in correspondence to Minister Garrett. I hope that, when he finishes defending himself over the Home Insulation Program, he might address this issue, because again we have thousands of Australians who have invested their time, their money and their lives in becoming home sustainability assessors, on the premise that there would be 1,000 of them around Australia, on the premise that the work would be shared between 1,000 of them. Instead, the government has gone and at least trebled the number of assessors. Indeed, in the announcement made on Friday, the government said the number would be capped at 5,000. So 5,000—five times the number that was originally promised—is what the government has ended up putting into the marketplace.
Little wonder that assessors are complaining that there is not enough work, that when they can get work they cannot get through to the government’s booking service to book the assessment and that when they complete the assessment and they send the audit of homes back to the department it sits in the department for Lord knows how long. We have complaints from numerous assessors who say that these audits of homes have been sitting in the department of the environment not just for a couple of weeks but for several months at least—months and months of sitting there in the department before they get back to the homeowner. Of course, the homeowner wonders what is going on, blames the person who undertook the assessment, harasses the person who undertook the assessment and obviously is not able to take out a green loan even if they want to, because they have not got their audit back. It is another example of the gross mismanagement of these programs by this government.
On the issue of solar—very briefly—the government has flipped around time and again. It brought in, without any notice, a means-testing of the solar rebate. When the industry went mad in terms of the amount of rebates being claimed, the government decided to change the rules again. Again, it changed the rules without notice to industry, just ending the program overnight without warning. People got an email in the morning saying, ‘The program will end by close of business today.’ That is how this government treats the people in the solar industry.
The government also ended the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program earlier than planned and with no appropriate substitute, leaving people in regional areas reliant on diesel power instead. It is a litany of failures by this government in the way they have managed these environmental programs. In particular, Minister Garrett, who has responsibility for all of them, stands condemned. As a result, the government should be censured for its mismanagement on these issues.",SENATE,<title>RUDD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-03-09,"—I rise today to support this censure motion of the government for its gross and systematic failure in the delivery of its climate change programs, including home insulation, green loans, the solar rebate, the renewable remote power generation program and the renewable energy target.
I heard Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, say that he would regard this censure motion with contempt. He did not take the censure motion seriously; he believed it to be a joke and that there was not a lot of gravity behind it. I hope that he will front the workers at Fletcher Insulation, Bradford Insulation and Loyastar Insulation; I hope that he will go and tell them, today, that they are a joke and that he will treat the censure motion with contempt. They have lost their jobs. They were called together in the last 24 hours and told that they no longer have work.
I happen to think that that is a serious matter. Senator Evans should go and tell the people who paid $3,000 to train as home sustainability assessors that they are now not going to be accredited and that they will not have work. I have hundreds of emails from people who have said that they borrowed $3,000 in order to get the training and to get the accreditation. People left well-paid jobs in order to go and do this because they thought it was a worthwhile contribution that they could make.
And then we had Senator Evans ridiculing the Greens because Senator Brown spoke for 10 minutes. Well, Senator Evans had better come back in here and apologise very shortly because it was a member of Senator Evans’s staff who rang the Greens and asked the Greens if we would restrict our time on this debate. And we agreed to that because we want orderly management of the business of this house. We agreed to that. Usually when that happens—when we agree—the government then organises the time with the coalition and with the other parties in here so that there is a proper allocation of time. That is what happened. So if there is contempt in this place then Senator Evans had better look a little bit closer to home.
I want to go through this, because the government is being censured here because its failure is systemic and has occurred over a long period of time—since its election, in fact. It has failed to take a whole-of-government internally-consistent approach to its climate change policies. What we have is one part of government advocating one thing and another part advocating another. On the very day that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was first introduced into the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister was in the Hunter valley turning the first sod on the expanded coal railway and coal export port facility. There was a very clear media management strategy: let’s get the press gallery in Canberra to tell people that the Rudd government is moving on the carbon pollution reduction scheme but let’s go up to the Hunter valley and give a wink-wink, nudge-nudge to the coal industry to say, ‘You’ll be all right; we will look after you. The Rudd government is not going to see any winding back in coalmining or coal exports whilst we get everybody else focused on a five per cent reduction in emissions.’
Only a couple of weeks ago we had the Premier of Queensland out there absolutely ecstatic about the opening of new coal mines in Queensland. The new coalmine in question will be exporting 30 million tonnes of coal to China per year—90 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions from China via Australia. And we have national emissions of around 600 million tonnes so we think we are doing great strokes here—a five per cent reduction whilst exporting to China mega emissions way in excess of any of those reductions here.
So let us look at a holistic, internally-consistent government approach to climate change. What we have is a case of spin over substance. In terms of all these programs the government has never seen an opportunity to transform our economy—our way of life—to a low-carbon economy. If you were serious about it you would be looking at system change—whole-of-systems changes in transport, whole-of-systems changes in approaches to the built environment, and whole-of-systems change to energy in this country. There would be transformation away from fossil use into the renewables and into efficiency. But we do not have that. We have boom and bust cycles managed by the government when they roll out small programs—a few hundred thousand houses here and a few hundred thousand there—that go for short periods of time. Businesses are given a signal that there is going to be a shift in policy and then, without notice, it is wound back.
So, whether you are in an energy efficiency technology business, a renewable energy business—whether you are an installer, an assessor or whatever else—you never know from one day to the next what your future is going it be. It is all dependent on government programs and government largess. It is not as a result of a system-wide driver. That is why the Greens have argued strongly for the increase in the renewable energy target to be higher than it is, but also for a gross feed-in tariff so that you get away from industry and people being dependent on government largess and the decision, one day, to turn it on and, one day, to turn it off.
I want to go through the systemic failures here. Let me start with the solar rebate. It was an $8,000 rebate but suddenly it was stopped and we went to a means test. People absorbed that for a short while and then suddenly there was an announcement that the program was ending there and then on a particular day.
What happened to the photovoltaic industry? People in the industry said: ‘I’m having to put people out of work. I can’t deal with this. I ordered all this because of the rebate program, and now you have stopped it.’ So the government said: ‘Okay. We’ll look at the renewable energy target. When we bring that in, we’ll put a multiplier for photovoltaics into the renewable energy target.’ The solar hot water people and the energy efficiency people are now saying: ‘What about us? What about these technologies? They were included in the renewable energy target.’
Then the government came along and interfered with a mechanism like that by giving the rebates and completely flooding the renewable energy target with renewable energy certificates from solar hot water and from heat pumps and from phantom RECs. That stole from wind power, because the people who expected to make money out of the renewable energy target and to actually get a boost and an investment signal were those in the wind industry. But, no—it just pulled the rug out from under them.
Last week Pacific Hydro, opening their wind farm in South Australia, said, ‘That’s the last of the wind farms until the government fixes the renewable energy target.’ In Tasmania, the Musselroe Bay wind farm is now stalled, and people are losing their jobs there—another lot of jobs, Senator Evans. You might think it is a joke to talk about systemic failure, but people in north-eastern Tasmania—rural and regional Tasmania—do not think it is a joke. The people elsewhere in Australia do not think it is a joke, either—$20 billion worth of investment in wind sitting on the sides because the renewable energy target has been wrecked.
What about the renewable remote power generation program? This is a fantastic program which brought renewable energy to remote parts of Australia and in particular to Indigenous communities. One of the programs affected as a result of the Renewable Remote Power Generation program going west is the Bushlight program. That was an innovative renewable energy project to increase access to sustainable energy services in remote Indigenous communities across Australia. The project has gone west because of the restriction on the size of the solar systems for which there is a multiplier to 1.5 kilowatt hours.
I remind Senator Evans, who thinks this is not to be taken seriously, that, without reliable access to fresh food, refrigeration, fuel and qualified technicians, Australia’s remote communities are left in limbo. These remote programs actually assisted Indigenous communities in accessing technologies that made their lives easier and gave them the kinds of support for technologies like refrigeration that they had not been able to access on a consistent basis in the past.
I will now go to the Green Loans Program. Again, this represents systemic failure. We heard Senator Birmingham outline some of it, and I have been persisting with this for weeks. The fact that Senator Evans thinks that this is a sudden idea of the Greens shows that he did not listen when I, supported by the coalition, put a motion through the Senate only a couple of weeks ago on the renewable energy targets. The government clearly took no notice whatsoever on the RET. They took no notice whatsoever of the work I have been doing on the Green Loans Program for weeks and in Senate estimates—not to mention these other programs that we have persistently gone through, explaining to the government where the failure is.
Not only do we now have no green loans, but there are many people who have not received from the government their report on their assessment. Without that report they cannot go to the bank and borrow the money. The government has said that 21 March is the deadline. If you have not gone to the bank and asked for your loan by then, you cannot get a loan. But what if you are sitting at home and you had your assessment six, eight or even 12 weeks ago, and you still do not have your report? You are going to be denied a loan because the department has not issued the report. Whose fault is this? ‘Ask the department, not us’, they say. ‘Ask the minister, not us’, they say. ‘Ask the government, not us’, they say. And everybody goes out there and says: ‘The problem out here is dodgy people. Somewhere out here there are dodgy people. It is all dodgy people’s fault.’
It is not dodgy people’s fault that minimum, nationally accredited training standards were not in place before the programs rolled out. It is not dodgy people’s fault that registered training organisations were not the only ones offering training. Anyone could walk in off the street and get training, not just the registered training organisations that were providing that training. And where were the auditors? How many auditors were out there on 1 July when the insulation program rolled out? How many auditors are out there with the Green Loans Program?
Even worse, now that the government has abolished the green loans, you can now get a sustainability assessment. But since you cannot borrow any money at the end of it at no interest, in a lot of cases it is going to cost you substantially to buy the technologies. You would expect the report you get from these assessments to be accurate and to give you the information you need to make informed decisions. Now, however, we discover that the government or the department—somebody—has been fiddling with the calculator that weights the various parts of the loading to determine what the calculator spits out at the end as a recommendation for your house. These changes to the calculator have been going on on a fortnightly basis. If you change the loadings, what you get in the report is different each time. Because of the manipulation of the calculator that is used when you feed in the data in this green loans process, the community has a right to ask, ‘What confidence would I have in the report, when I eventually get it?’
What about the 5,000 people who had paid for training and will now not be accredited? What about the fact that the department promised people that the government would pay to have their training upgraded to certificate IV? What about the assessors who went into this thinking they were going to have a job and are now being told, ‘Five assessments a week, and that’s it’? That is less than two days work.
And what about the companies? I am one who has been critical of the fact that the government entered into discriminatory and preferential arrangements with certain companies that gave them access to a booking system that the self-employed person did not have. Nevertheless, contracts were signed with those companies. For example, I know that one of these assessor companies has spent nearly $1 million for training assessors, setting up a call centre, setting up support staff and making sure the occupational health and safety standards are in place. That company is now employing 525 people in this particular program. That company does not know if the five-booking limit now applies to them as well or to their assessors—how that is going to work. There has been no consultation, and there are at least five companies in that particular position with the government.
So, does this constitute gross and systemic failure? Does it say that the Rudd government does not take green jobs, green businesses and the green carbon economy seriously? I think that is exactly what it says. I think what it says is that the Prime Minister takes the old fossil fuel economy very seriously. He gets himself up to multimillion and multibillion dollar announcements when it comes to coal railways, coal ports and coalmines. But when it comes to transformation of the economy in energy efficiency, in fuel efficiency, in any of these programs, then the government is not prepared to let go of the fossil fuel economy and allow the shift to renewable energy, the shift to energy efficiency, to become systemic across the whole of Australia—no way. It is restricted to management by a department that has clearly shown it does not have the competence to roll it out. That is why this censure motion says the government has not taken it seriously. It is all spin over substance. It is all stop-start, boom-bust cycles. There are many disappointed, unemployed people across Australia today, and people whose businesses are about to go bust—and I happen to think that is a serious matter.
This government is also about uncertainty—no long-term investment signals, no nothing when it comes to the whole energy efficiency and renewable energy sector. That is why we need to take energy and put it together with climate change and have all these policies managed in a department which has the competence to do it, a department which actually recognises the issues. Does the Prime Minister, with his Department of Climate Change, want to transform the Australian economy to a low-carbon, zero-carbon economy? Or does he want a department which oversees photo opportunities and announcements for election campaigns while getting on with the real business of an ongoing fossil fuel economy? Because that is how it looks at the moment.
The Minister for Resources and Energy, of course, is totally focused on Gorgon gas, on big new development—all in the fossil fuel sector. He is prouder with his coal-to-liquids project for motor vehicles rather than actually getting on with the low-carbon, zero-carbon economy. That is the tragedy: consumer confidence that Australia can move to this new economy is at an all-time low, even though community enthusiasm for it was high. I hold the Prime Minister responsible for that. These programs have been oversubscribed many times over, because the Australian community really wanted to do its bit for this transformation. But now people are afraid, because if they open the door there could be a shonky operator standing there saying: ‘I’m here to deliver the government’s insulation program. I don’t have to come inside; just sign here—this will do for an energy assessment; I’ll just send it in and get the money.’ We have had endless reports of people who say that the assessor did not even come inside their house, yet we have had other assessors who have spent hours and hours, and have done a fantastic job, and consumers say: ‘This is the best thing that’s ever happened; I really understand my house now and what I need to do.’ There is that unevenness of quality, unevenness of audit.
Somebody has to be held responsible for this, and it is the government—it is not just one minister; it comes straight out of the Prime Minister’s office. We know, for example, that all these warnings that were given by Minter Ellison went to the project control board, which had on it a representative of the Coordinator-General. They were told about the risks embedded in the insulation program. We know the government knew that it could not roll these programs out effectively in the time frame. They were warned time and time again, and none of those shortcomings were fixed in the time frame—nor were they fixed before the programs rolled out, even though they were warned about the problems beforehand, including the RET.
So this censure motion stands. We want a new department that is capable of managing these programs, and we want some real effort and competence put into it—not what we have at the moment: ad hoc, internally inconsistent and contradictory policy and program delivery.",SENATE,<title>RUDD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-03-09,"—I have to say that, whilst I respect that Senator Milne does put some work into these issues, it is somewhat difficult to listen to a lecture about the need for a long-term price signal, a long-term transformation of the Australian economy, when it is the case that the Greens could have delivered precisely the price signal she is calling for had they not sat with Mr Abbott’s people and not sat with Senator Fielding, but with the government—and the two Liberal senators who showed the courage to cross the floor—to deliver a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. For the first time in this nation’s history we would have actually capped the carbon pollution we produce. That is precisely the long-term price signal that was required. Regrettably, we saw the Greens put politics over policy in a decision which I think will prove, when history looks at it, to be most unwise.
But I want to return to some of the issues raised. Senator Milne at least had some substance—whilst I disagree with it—in her contribution. Senator Bob Brown demonstrated the truth of Senator Evans’ contribution that this is about politics over policy. This is about the Greens party wishing to insert themselves into the current debate and the current attack by the coalition against Minister Garrett. The issue for the Greens now, and after the next election, is whether they will be a party of responsible parliamentarians or a party of protest. At the moment they are being a party of protest. That is fine if you are not actually interested in doing anything other than lecturing people.
I want to respond specifically to Senator Birmingham’s contribution. Whilst I do not mind Senator Birmingham—there are worse people on the other side! And he is not a bad debater—

Senator Williams interjecting—

—I wasn’t pointing at you, Senator Williams! Whilst he is not a bad debater—he has a few interesting hand moves, but I am prone to that at times myself—the fact that the opposition chose to bring to this debate neither the Leader of the Opposition in this place nor any frontbencher shows that they are not taking this seriously. It demonstrates that this is a stunt they are jumping on board with. They do not have the courage of responsible opposition to treat it seriously—or to simply not support the motion. They should know, as a former government, as a party of government, that censure motions are serious business. To not have anybody of any seniority on the other side leading off, or speaking at all, in this debate demonstrates how they regard it.
Senator Birmingham tried to defend the opposition’s credentials on the environment whilst in government. A couple of facts ought to be put on the record. The first is in relation to the renewable energy target, which he trumpeted as a Howard government achievement. Well, yes, it was, but let us remember, firstly, that it was only a five per cent target: 9½ thousand gigawatt hours by 2010. We are going to deliver four times that. More importantly in many ways, the coalition in government commissioned at least one review—the Tambling review reported in September 2003—which recommended increasing the target out to 2020, and what did the Howard government do? Absolutely nothing. They ignored even their own advice from the Tambling review, which included former Liberal senator David Kemp. So, when Senator Birmingham comes in here trumpeting the renewable energy target, he should also say: ‘And we ensured that we ignored advice about how we could make this better. We stopped at five per cent because we didn’t want to go any further.’
The senator also went on about solar panels. If those opposite want to have a go at this government for what it has done, let us remember that this government has put more solar panels on Australian roofs than any other government in Australia’s history—full stop. In 12 years, solar panels were provided by the Howard government to about 10½ thousand homes. In two years, we have funded, or are on track to fund, more than 120,000 installations. That is 10,500 in 12 years compared to 120,000 in two. In their 12 years, solar hot water rebates were provided to 4,000 households—in two years, 100,000 households have received a solar hot water rebate. So for senators from the other side to come in here and talk about their environmental credentials, citing solar panels and renewable energy, is kicking an own goal, because their record after 12 years in government is extremely poor.
I will turn now to a couple of points made by Senator Milne. Senator Milne talked a lot about coal, and I understand that the Greens have a view about wanting to close that industry. It is not a view shared by the government, and that is not because we are corrupt or we are in the pockets of anybody; we just do not agree. I want to take the following global perspective around the industry of coal. It is something which seems to have escaped some of the contributions to this chamber on this issue. If Australia chose to stop mining and exporting coal—which is not the government’s position—does anybody in this chamber honestly believe that the demand for coal in other nations would decline? Of course not. There are many other countries which already export coal, and the International Energy Agency’s prediction out to 2050 is that coal usage will increase globally. If you do not have a low-emissions solution for coal, you do not have a solution on climate change. The answer is not Australia deciding not to export it, because some other country would simply export it—it would have absolutely no effect on global emissions. That is the logical position: it would have no effect on global emissions if we did not export. What would have an effect would be to find, along with other coal-producing nations, a technology which reduced emissions from coal. I know that is a logical position that many on the other side of the chamber disagree with, but the facts are inescapable. You have to find a lower emissions solution for coal, and that is why we are putting in excess of $2 billion on the table: to help work up that solution, a solution the planet, the globe, needs.
I would also like to remind the chamber that we are not disregarding solar energy. The $1.5 billion Solar Flagships Program is about substantial investment in developing the baseload renewable solar power that the world and also Australia needs. That is part of the government’s agenda. Frankly, to deal with climate change we need a whole range of policy mechanisms which will work. The proposition that seems to be being put—that somehow it is wrong for us to recognise that Australia is a coal-producing nation—is simply illogical.
The reality is Australia’s carbon pollution is rising, it will continue to rise and by 2020 it will be around 120 per cent of what we were producing at the year 2000. It is this pollution which is contributing to climate change. Carbon pollution is what causes climate change. The fact is that the Greens have made tackling climate change an explicit part of their platform for many years and they have had not one, but two, opportunities in this chamber to vote to reduce Australia’s carbon pollution. Not once, but twice, they decided that it was better politically for them to oppose that reduction. Not once, but twice, they sat with Tony Abbott or his senators and Senator Fielding, people who do not believe in climate change. Tony Abbott, who believes that climate change is absolute crap, is who Senator Brown voted with. The Greens voted to ensure that Australia’s carbon pollution would continue to rise. The question is now, and will be in the years to come: why did they do that?
It is well known around this place that some in the Greens have made the strategic decision that, if there were an election fought on climate change, they would gain more seats. I am only quoting from the Greens themselves. Drew Hutton, one of the Greens campaigners in Brisbane, is quoted in the Brisbane Times as saying that his party would be ‘the big winners’ in an ETS double dissolution and could expect to at least double their current representation of five senators as well as pick up lower house seats. The article reads:
‘We would be very confident of winning our first Queensland (Senate) seat,’ Mr Hutton said.
Senator Brown said on Lateline last year:
… if it could go to a climate change double dissolution, if you like, at the expense of the Opposition, it would try that, and the analysis is that the Greens will come out stronger in the Senate as a result of the next election, and if it's on climate change, we Greens will be the constructive opposition going to the Australian people …
If this is why the Greens have voted this way, it is a cynical political decision indeed—a cynical political decision to vote to allow Australia’s carbon pollution to rise. Let us remember that there were two Liberal senators who honoured the agreement we struck with Malcolm Turnbull and who crossed the floor to vote with the government and if the party that claims to be the party of the environment had also voted with the government Australia would now have a carbon price. It is regrettable that this party chose to stand in the way of that progress. It is an unfortunate reality that the Greens wasted that opportunity not just to do something very significant for our environment but to put in place the required changes to our economy.
This government is committed to tackling climate change. It is committed to a comprehensive strategy to tackle it and to support investment in renewable energy. As I said, we have delivered through this chamber a fourfold increase in Australia’s renewable energy sector by 2020 on top of the commitments I have already outlined on the Solar Flagships program. The government had a big ship to turn around. Let us remember that renewables actually went backwards under the previous government. Over the 10 years between 1997 and 2007, renewables dropped from 10.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent.
The reality is that some in this chamber who profess to be pro environment should think very carefully about whether they are prepared to take responsibility for the sorts of policies which are required to implement that change, because we have too often seen the members of the Greens playing politics without regard to policy. I recall being chided quite stridently in this chamber by Senator Hanson-Young, who demanded that I deliver the amount of water that a particular academic report was proposing for the Lower Lakes. I pointed out to her that that amount of water was in fact more than we had drawn at the time from the River Murray for Adelaide and for all the towns—
—Where’s your plan? You’ve got no plan.
—I know that Senator Hanson-Young is shrieking at me again because she does not like the facts. If you were serious about the environment, you would responsibly address the facts. But you refuse to do that. The fact of Senator Hanson-Young’s position is that she was putting to me that we should shut down—

Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—

 (Senator Boyce)—Order! Senator Wong has the call.
—That is really extraordinary. Senator Hanson-Young is honestly putting to me that it is somehow a green position to shut down all drawing of water from the Murray River, including for Adelaide. That is the position you put. That is not a responsible environmental position.
—Please address your remarks through the chair, Senator Wong.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: firstly, Senator Wong should address the chair but, secondly, I draw your attention to the motion and the complete irrelevance of Senator Wong’s current contribution to the debate on the motion that the Senate is considering.
—I think the minister’s comments are within the very broad range that has been covered in debate here, and I was in the process of asking the minister to direct her comments through the chair.
—I will attempt to address my comments through the chair. I was distracted by the interjections. My point is that there is more to delivering for the environment than simply trying to play politics. There is more to delivering for the environment than simply asserting something which is unachievable. It is not a responsible environmental position to say, ‘You should stop taking any water out of the Murray River,’ including for your own home town. It is not a responsible environmental position to sit with those who think that climate change is absolute crap and ensure that Australia does not get a price on carbon. It is not a responsible environmental position to simply move a censure motion because you want to get into the media debate.
I am very happy to have a discussion with the Greens or anyone else in this chamber about sensible policy. We will not always agree. I am happy to have a debate about policy, but I think it is incumbent upon the Greens to decide whether they are a party of protest or responsible parliamentarians. At the moment it appears that they are the former, as evidenced by the fact that they sat on the other side of the chamber when Australia could for the first time have put a limit on its carbon pollution. They could have delivered the bill. That is a stark reality that they cannot hide from. It is extraordinary that a party that says, ‘We’re pro tackling the environment,’ somehow also says, ‘We’re going to vote it down because it’s not perfect.’ It was quite an extraordinary position when the extreme ends of politics combined to stymie this reform.
As I said, this is an opportunistic motion. Senator Milne made some comments about jobs and Senator Birmingham made some comments about the tragic deaths. I know Senator Milne, and I do not think that she would have meant to suggest that the government does not care about jobs. I hope she would know that we of course do. I do not think anybody in this chamber—

Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—

—Would you like to get up and speak, Senator, or could I finish? Of course, everybody in this chamber regards the deaths as tragedies. No-one on this side of the chamber regards them as anything less than that, and I hope there is no implication from that side of the chamber that that is the case. As Minister Garrett has said, they are deeply regrettable incidents, and our thoughts do go out to the families and friends of those involved.
I do not think this government has hidden from the fact that there are very significant problems with the Home Insulation Program. It was a very large program and there were problems with it—we have been upfront about that. The Prime Minister has said that quite clearly. The minister has outlined how he has taken action when advised to reduce the risks about which he was advised and the government has made a decision to close the program. The minister has made clear how he has acted appropriately on the advice he was provided and the government has closed the program as a result of the advice provided. Obviously, as I said, we do not shy away from the fact that there were problems in this program. That is why the program was changed and has been discontinued. The minister has been full and frank with the House as well as with the Australian people about the way in which he has approached that.
If you look at all that this government is seeking to do on these issues—unfortunately having been stymied by some in this chamber—you will realise it is a government that is serious about tackling climate change. It is a government that does have an ambitious agenda. I note that Senator Birmingham was critical of that. We are unashamed about that—we have an ambitious agenda because there are many things to be done. Whilst some of these policies may not have been perfect, there have also been many good things delivered. These include, as I said, a very substantial increase in investment in renewable energy and, of course, a whole range of other programs across government for businesses and households in terms of reducing energy use, reducing water use and assisting people to make this transition.
I come back to this very simple fact: we will not transform our economy in the way we have to if we are going to tackle climate change unless we put a price on carbon. Unless the Greens change their position or the opposition change their position, we will see the extreme left and the extreme right of Australian politics stop a very important reform.",SENATE,<title>RUDD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2010-03-09,"—I rise to speak in favour of this motion as amended and to speak about what has indeed been gross and systematic failure by this government in the management of a range of its programs, in particular the Home Insulation Program. In so doing, because I will not go missing in action, I take head-on comments by government members in this place about a shadow minister not being present in the debate on this motion. I take head-on suggestions by members opposite that somehow this motion of censure is not serious. In respect of the Home Insulation Program, I believe that the Australian people are looking to the very government that has got them into this mess to now get them out of it.
Their comments about shadow ministers are the height of hypocrisy. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! Where has Minister Garrett been at every step along the tortuous way of the Home Insulation Program? Missing, missing, missing—the minister has been missing in action. As recently as two weeks ago, when a meeting was held to consider restarting the rolling out of foil insulation, where was the minister? Missing in action. The headlines were ‘Garrett goes bush as batts keep burning’. He was inspecting creepy-crawlies, instead of being back at his home base attending to his program, which was unravelling as fast as it was insulating. If you are going to bother to insulate, Minister, insulate right, not wrong.
The minister has been missing in action at every step of the way—and there have been quite some steps, but it has taken us a while to learn about these steps because the government has not been particularly forthcoming about them until now. The minister has received more than 20 warnings about the failings of the Home Insulation Program, and where has he been? Missing every step of the way. He was missing every step of the way when warned by his department’s own experts, Minter Ellison, of some 19—let’s call it 20; let’s round it up; what’s an extra one?—risks that needed to be addressed in the rollout of the Home Insulation Program. Some 20 risks were identified by Minter Ellison as many as 10 months ago, of which the minister, we are led to believe, did not become aware until perhaps some 10 or so days ago. Where was the minister every step along the way when it came to identification of risk, risk assessment and risk management? He was missing in action on every one of those 20 risk management steps.
Is the opposition serious in supporting this motion to censure the government for gross and systemic mismanagement in the Home Insulation Program? Please! This is from a government that supposedly established the Home Insulation Program for three reasons: to stimulate the economy, to create jobs and to help the environment. Opposition not serious? Please tell that to taxpayers and watchers of the economy, who see this program not stimulating the economy but backing money right out of it. Not serious? Please say that to the workers who were told they would have jobs created for them and protected and instead find they lost their jobs at the stroke of the minister’s pen last Friday, whilst he manages to hang on to his. Not serious? Tell that to those who support good environmental outcomes and find instead this program doing just the opposite.
How is it that the wrong sort of insulation gets installed in the wrong places? In hot places we get insulation that keeps the heat in, instead of stopping it coming in in the first place. In cold places, it stops the heat coming in instead of the reverse. It is incubating houses in hot places, effectively, instead of cooling them. Guess what happens then? Householders utilise electricity or whatever they have got that supposedly ain’t good for the environment to neutralise the effects of the insulation that was supposedly put in there to help the environment. Not serious about censuring the government? Please! Tell that to those who really want to believe that the Home Insulation Program was going to stimulate the economy, create and protect jobs, and help the environment.
Not serious? Not serious about censuring the government? Please, please, please! Tell that to the taxpayer who finds out as a result of the recent Senate committee inquiry that they have paid Minter Ellison some $28,000 for a risk assessment and a risk register. Hey, what’s $28,000 in a $2.7 billion or so program? It is a fair bit of money to mums and dads. It is a fair bit of money, particularly when the minister seems to think he can go missing in action when it comes to hand. It is a fair bit of money, when, had the minister cared to have a look at the results of that fair bit of money, there is every argument that we would not be where we are today: we would not have homes of mums and dads with accidents waiting to happen; we would not have an industry with, at best, its reputation tarnished, particularly in the minds of the community; and we would not have workers who had a job and now they haven’t.
Tell that to the taxpayer who learns more once we see the Minter Ellison risk assessment and risk register—that is the sneaky, tricky bit we got out a couple of days ago from the government through the Senate inquiry process. The risk register identifies more fully those almost 20 risks faced by the government in rolling out the Home Insulation Program and then quantifies the cost of failing to adequately address those risks or failing to address them at all. It quantifies it. Guess what? Minister, hello! Minister, are you there? Minister, if you fail to address these risks, it could cost, says the Minter Ellison risk assessment, anything between some $250 million to $800 million to $900 million. Three times $900 million and you are pretty much hitting the supposed outlay of this program in the first place—$2.7 billion. Minister, hello! Are you still missing, Minister? I am not sure we are going to be missing you, Minister. Minister, remember that, had these risks been assessed and had you listened to the taxpayer funded risk assessment, the results might have been different.
Try telling the mums and dads who are now looking to the very government that got them into this mess to help them get out of it that the censure motion is not serious. Try telling that to mums and dads who want to know: ‘Had a guy my roof—in fact, had several guys in my roof. Is my home safe? How do I know? When do I know? Will you help me find out? Who will come to look? How long will it take? Will I have to pay for it? If they say it is not safe, what then? Who gets to fix it? The same rogue who stuffed it up in the first place?’
Not serious? Tell that to mums and dads who want to know what is going to happen to businesses that they have in the industry. What is going to happen to the reputations of those who have been in the industry for a long time and had livelihoods before the so-called Home Insulation Program and still hope they have sustainable livelihoods after the Home Insulation Program? Tell that to the long-term players in the industry. Tell that to the short-term players in the industry, who supposedly are all now fly-by-nighters and shonks because they obeyed the beckon of the government to, ‘Come in, come in and help us, please.’ Supposedly, if you have not been in the industry for long, supposedly if you are a business that set up in this industry after the start of the Home Insulation Program, you are shonk, you are a bad person. Tell all those people that the government has not failed to manage this program.
Not serious? Tell that to the workers in this industry who lost their jobs last Friday at the stroke of the minister’s pen. Not serious? Tell that, for example, to Mr Franz Mueller, who runs an insulation business in South Australia and has for many years. Tell that to Mr Franz Mueller of, I think, Insulation Matters, who until Friday had 30 workers. Now he has 12, because he had to act. Tell that to Mr Franz Mueller who has insulation materials on hand and laying idle—for three months, he reckons—until the government restarts the program. If you are someone thinking about insulating, why the hell would you bother to move in the next three months when there will probably be another government handout, if you can take Minister Garrett at his word. Oh, the minister is back in the action! Or is he, or will he be?
Not serious? Please! ‘Not serious,’ says the government—this from a government who got us into this mess in the first place and now expects us to trust them to get us out of it. Not serious? Who was not serious? It was the minister who was missing in action. We are expected to take him seriously when he says that the first bit of the Minter Ellison documentation, some 20 pages, which came to his department some 10 months ago, he saw about 10 days ago. We are supposed to take the minister seriously when now he apparently says that the risk register, which also went to his department some 10 months ago, he actually only read after it was tabled by his department as a result of the Senate inquiry a couple of days ago. We are supposed to take the minister seriously. Come on, Minister!
Extracting the risk register of the Minter Ellison report, the second bit of it, was like extracting blood from a stone. Why do you reckon that might be? Because the government machinery took that risk register pretty seriously. They know that the risk register is a bit different from the risk assessment document, the first document, which we have had for two or three days longer. They know that the risk register—this pretty thing here that identifies 19, call it 20, because what is an additional risk between friends—which identifies the 20 risks, also quantifies the cost of not addressing and not mitigating the risks. It talks about the bucks which are going to be backed out of the economy, clearly, if the government fails to mitigate and deal with risks identified.
More than that, it then has recommendations about what the government should do to mitigate the risks. Even more than that, it then assesses the strength of the mitigation tactic. Just take one risk out of the 19 risks as an example. Take the risk about procurement and licensing, the need for the program to be determined and fulfilled by 1 July 2009. The scale of the task is new to the department, yet this government imposed upon its departments—plural—the delivery of this program within government time frames. Why then does the Minter Ellison risk register effectively go on to suggest: ‘Minister, why don’t you delay the commencement of this program for three months?’ This was just one recommendation that the minister missed. Was that because the minister was missing in action or because he missed seeing this recommendation? We plan to find that out, but at least at this stage it is very clear that the government did not take heed of that risk and implement the risk mitigation strategy identified by its very own experts at taxpayers’ expense of some $29,000.
More than that, what else does the risk register say? In a convenient column—hang on, let’s go with the three columns. We have paid for it, so we might as well go for it all. No. 1, it says the risks of fallout from procurement and licensing are rated 5 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is ‘most likely to happen’. In a further column it talks about the letter ‘E’. Look at the key to the risk register and you will find that ‘E’ means the highest rating: ‘extreme risk’. Worst of all, most indictable of all, most serious of all, is the rating in respect of the particular risk of ‘weak’. But ‘weak’ is not so much the risk itself as the likelihood of the mitigating factor recommended by Minter’s succeeding at all. So translate that to English, which the minister might have been able to have done for him had he asked his department, from Minters to minister: ‘Mate, delay the implementation of this program by three months. It’s going to blow up and out if you don’t. And, by the way, even if you do delay, there is a very weak prospect of it helping this program to achieve the outcomes.’ Through all of that, the minister was missing in action, so the taxpayer funded risk assessment and risk register might as well have been likewise.
Opposition not serious? Please say that to the Australian community. Say that this is not a serious censure motion of this government for gross and systematic failure in delivery of a range of its programs, in particular the Home Insulation Program. Say that to the mums and dads who want to know if they have home insulation accidents waiting to happen and want to know, if so, what is going to be done to help them stop them. Say that to the industries and the businesses who now have their reputations tarnished. And, please, say that to the workers who supposedly were going to have their jobs protected and, instead, have lost them overnight at the stroke of a ministerial pen. Please say that, and please say that to an Australian community that knows that it is this government that got them into this mess and somehow they are supposed to be relying on this government to get them out of it.",SENATE,<title>RUDD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2010-03-09,"—I rise to speak against the motion. In speaking against this motion I confront a familiar alliance, or one might say ‘axis’—that is, the axis between the coalition and the Greens parties. It is an axis that has unfortunately wrought an enormous amount of damage in terms of the capacity—
—The only rorts are in your program, Sir! And that’s r-o-r-t!
—I endured the vaudeville of the last 20 minutes in courteous silence. What we have here is this Berlin-Moscow axis, this coalition of interests, which pits Green fundamentalists with climate change deniers. It is that coalition of interests which most fatally at the end of last year finally voted down the CPRS as it was then amended. So it strikes me that what we really have here in this censure motion is that after months of assiduous sabotage by the Greens party, by in fact delivering to the coalition and to the climate change deniers a spectacular victory on the CPRS at the end of last year, they now have the political hide to come into this place and complain about a lack of progress in advancing those important environmental interests that the government sets itself so determinedly to accomplish.
This is an extraordinary act of two-faced politics, where on the one hand the attempts of this government to introduce a carbon price is sabotaged, while on the other hand a censure motion is brought into this place complaining about the government’s lack of progress in these issues more generally. This is indicative of a party that would rather rule in hell than serve in heaven. This is a party that will never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. In striking down the CPRS at the end of last year, in delivering those five votes to Tony Abbott and his climate change sceptic party, the Greens stand accused and convicted of having sunk that piece of legislation that would have done so very much for this country, so very much for our continuing effort to deliver action on climate change.
My favourite component of the censure motion is not part (1) but, rather, part (2). Part (2) calls on the government to put in place a unified ministry and department of climate change and energy. I cannot help but suspect that here we have one small, cherished insight into what must be the grand reorganisation of government planned in the central presidium of the Greens party. It would be with wonderment and joy that I would observe the remainder of their plan—their ministry for truth, their ministry for no energy, their ministry for a command economy—because to introduce this unified ministry in this form is of course a nonsensical incursion into government and the business of government which, by their own admission, they are ill-equipped to handle. Whether they headhunt Yogi Bear or Hugo Chavez to head this glorious new department of theirs, it will not change the fact that the failure to make progress in the critical area of CPRS rests at their feet and not at the feet of the government. They made themselves the handmaidens to the coalition and its environmental policies, and they must now wear that crown of thorns through 2010.
I note that with the Birmingham amendment the coalition has quite correctly moved to extricate itself from the proposition that this grand new department designed in the Greens central presidium should go forward. Of course that is a correct separation—and perhaps the first chink in this Berlin-Moscow axis. There is of course one outstanding example of ‘gross and systemic failure’, and that is the actions and the words of Tony Abbott and his coalition.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Feeney should be directed to address Mr Abbott by his proper title.
 (Senator Boyce)—Thank you, Senator Troeth.
—I am sorry; the Leader of the Opposition. In considering the Leader of the Opposition’s spectacular rise to power at the end of last year, the whole of Australia, and most specifically we senators, was privy to an extraordinary series of events where those forces inside the Liberal Party who had laboured for so long to deliver a reasonable position, a position that accepted the reality of climate change, were struck low. They were undermined and ultimately brought down by the determination of a Liberal majority, and that Liberal majority does not believe climate change is real. In fact, to quote the Leader of the Opposition, it believes climate change is crap.
Since becoming Leader of the Opposition, we have now seen Mr Abbott deliver three clangers in this critical area. In November, the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the CPRS would cost average households about $1,100 each, and only one week later he was forced to admit that that number had been produced by the opposition on the basis of a Google News search rather than any true and exacting research on the part of the opposition. As we all know, Treasury found that the CPRS would cause prices to rise by 1.1 per cent by 2013, on average costing a household $624 a year, and of course, as the government has made clear again and again and again, there is an expensive compensation program at the heart of the CPRS which makes sure that working families are compensated for those increases.
But, undeterred, the Leader of the Opposition pressed on and in December of last year he made a $250 billion blunder in his climate change costings when he claimed that the total cost of permits to achieve a 15 per cent target to 2020 would be up to $400 billion. In fact, Treasury modelling released in 2008—that modelling that those opposite often cry for—suggested that the total cost of permits to achieve the government’s 15 per cent target over the 12 years to 2020 would be around $150 billion—$250 billion less than the Leader of the Opposition claimed. Finally, in December, we had that magical moment when the Leader of the Opposition declared that global warming had stopped. This is the kind of flat-earth viewpoint which is now prevailing amongst those opposite.
We perhaps should not be surprised that that view is prevailing amongst those opposite, but it does give pause to reflect on some of the utterances of the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Malcolm Turnbull. In recent times Mr Turnbull’s blog has become a source of inspiration for many of us on this side, and today should be no exception. Malcolm Turnbull has said on his blog:
So any suggestion that you can dramatically cut emissions without any cost it is, to use a favourite term of Mr Abbott, ‘bullshit’. Moreover, he knows it.
...                     ...                     ...
The Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is ‘crap’ and you don’t need to do anything about it. Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental figleaf to cover a determination to do nothing.
There we have it, from the former Leader of the Opposition—that the coalition’s con job of a policy on climate—
 (Senator Boyce)—Senator Feeney, I am advised that using the term that you did, whether you are quoting or not, is unparliamentary and is not to be used even if it is used as a quotation.
—Very good. I have heard the term used in this place previously, Madam Acting Deputy President, and this is the first time this ruling has been brought to my attention.
—Nevertheless I think we need to ensure that we maintain decorum.
—If there is a new-found determination to do that, I will of course abide by it.
—Thank you, Senator Feeney.
—My pleasure. So we have the former Leader of the Opposition revealing clearly and starkly the fact that those presently in command of the opposition, those presently in command of the alternative government of this country, are engaged in a policy which is about doing nothing, a policy which is about buying them time. It is a policy which is about them pretending that, so trying to look like, they care about action on climate change while they hope the whole issue disappears. It is a climate change con job.
That kind of conduct from the coalition is not the kind of stuff that would generally shock those of us on this side. That is par for the course, one might say. But what should not be forgotten is that in this task they have found themselves unlikely allies of the Greens party, who, by coming into this place and producing censure motions of this kind, do nothing more than assist the coalition in its continuing attempt to avoid serious scrutiny on these important issues. It has been suggested that the Greens party is doing this in an effort to gain publicity. Having quickly observed the media gallery above, I think that strategy has failed. But that is a matter for regret, not celebration, because the Greens party should be made as well to endure that sort of scrutiny about how it is that the lack of a carbon price in this country stands at their feet, the fact that the failure of the CPRS legislation to be passed was due to a decision that was made and ultimately they must bear responsibility for it.
—We will!
—In fact, I was talking about the Greens party, but I am pleased you will too. We come to some of the specifics. We are talking about things such as household energy efficiency measures. The assertion being put is that the government has made no real progress and that there has been, to quote the motion, ‘gross and systemic failure’. But there are important successes that this government can and does claim. There are important successes which in fact everyone in this parliament should take great pride in. The first that springs to mind is the household energy efficiency measures. These measures have been referred to in this debate, but what has not been referred to in this debate is the total effect that they are having in providing a more efficient use of energy and in contributing to action on climate change. These household energy efficiency measures are expected to deliver energy savings of 32,000 gigawatt hours per year by 2020. That is equivalent to 14 per cent of all electricity generated in Australia in 2006-07—a spectacular sum. These measures will prevent up to 19½ million tonnes of carbon emissions every year by 2020. They will save the Australian economy up to $22 billion over the next 16 years and, perhaps most importantly, they will save Australian householders up to $5 billion by 2020. These are real and tangible outcomes. These are outcomes that are measurable and demonstrable. As much as those opposite may loathe hearing it, the fact is that there are important successes in this area that have been achieved despite the program of opposition and sabotage that the Australian people have witnessed taking place here in the Senate. Millions would have benefited from the CPRS householder assistance and what we have is an example of how the gross and systemic failure was in fact in rejecting those bills and not accepting them.
Turning our thoughts to the Home Insulation Program, Minister Wong set out a few moments ago the fact that the government has accepted and takes responsibility for the program and how it has been administered. We have witnessed a minister who has acted honourably, a minister who has kept faith with his ministerial responsibilities. As the Prime Minister said earlier today, this is a minister who has commissioned and sought advice and then has acted upon that advice. He is a minister who has acted on that advice and has acted properly and prudently, a minister who is an honourable man, a minister who has behaved honourably and a minister who enjoys the complete confidence of his Prime Minister and his party.
The CFMEU had an interesting comment—I think it was made today—concerning occupational health and safety. The CFMEU is the organisation of employees that, amongst other things, represents workers in the construction industry.

Senator Milne interjecting—

—Senator Milne is referring to its forestry division, which happens to not be the division that I will be quoting in a moment. The CFMEU, like many of us on this side, chafed when listening to those opposite trying to pontificate to us about occupational health and safety. What a nonsense that those opposite have discovered for the first time occupational health and safety and now seek to try and beat us over the head with it! The CFMEU pointed out that on average one Australian dies every week in the construction industry in this country. That is of course an appalling statistic. It is a statistic that I am sure would appal every senator and everyone in this building. But in reflecting upon that statistic, Mr David Noonan, the divisional national secretary from the CFMEU’s construction division, had this to say:
“Mr Abbott presided over a government that slashed workers’ entitlements to safety in the construction industry, that brought in laws that made it harder for unions to police safety on construction sites …and everybody in the industry knows that it is unions that make workplaces safer in construction.
“Mr Abbott put in legislation which has seen an increase in deaths in construction. This is an industry which, on average, loses one worker ... every week.”
What we note is the fact that, firstly, those opposite, having cynically discovered occupational health and safety, are now being very selective indeed. Secondly, we on this side are not going to be lectured to about how a proper occupational health and safety process should be run.
—You certainly need a bit of advice. You should have taken it a few months ago.
—That advice is coming from the proper quarters, Senator. It is not coming from your nonsensical approach to public policy. Senator Milne made the assertion—which I think I could characterise as an allegation—that Senator Wong and this government take the old fossil fuel economy very seriously. That is true. We do take the old fossil fuel economy, as Senator Milne characterised it, very seriously. That is the economy which has built this country, and that is the economy which we are charged with the responsibility of managing and transitioning.
Australia is a trade-exposed and commodities-based economy. That makes it a particularly emissions-intensive economy and that means that the transformation challenge is very acute for all of us. We have a challenge which, I would submit, is greater than that confronted by any European country and I daresay by the United States.
Our great challenge is to change the trajectory of emissions so that we can bring our emissions into line with international obligations and agreements, and so we can try and achieve those targets that were set out at Copenhagen. In taking on this challenge, and accepting that challenge as real, we do understand the need for long-term investment signals. Long-term investment signals would have been set out clearly and effectively by the CPRS that the Greens party—the author of this censure motion—struck down.
The proposition that we destroy the coal industry is simply indicative of a mindset which is fundamentalist in its approach. It assumes that its opposition is always motivated by corrupt or vested interests, is always evil and is not simply comprised of persons who reach different conclusions in good faith. The proposition that we destroy the coal industry is ridiculous. The idea that we unilaterally dismantle our economy, our prosperity, our way of life is ridiculous. Unilateral disarmament was a ridiculous notion in the Cold War and the unilateral dismantling of our economy today is just as absurd.
This censure motion should be treated for what it is—a stunt. It is a stunt that has attracted no interest from the media and very little interest from those opposite. It has only attracted our contempt that a party which worked so assiduously to sabotage action on climate change now seeks to censure us on matters pertaining to the environment.",SENATE,<title>RUDD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2010-03-09,"—I would like to say how surprising it was that in Senator Feeney’s remarks of approximately 20 minutes he devoted only eight minutes to defending his minister and his government. I compare it to the actions of the Prime Minister during the censure motion yesterday in the House, when he did not have the courage to stand up in the parliament and defend his minister, his program or himself. He left Minister Garrett to defend himself. It was a truly insipid and weak performance.
I recognise that this motion put forward by Senator Brown also covers other policy failures by the Rudd government, but I particularly wish to focus on the Home Insulation Scheme. By far and away, it is the most serious failure of a minister to undertake his most basic responsibilities that I can remember in my years in this place. This government and this minister have presided over a policy that has left four people dead, four families grieving and hundreds of thousands of homes at risk of burning to the ground, threatening the lives of the people living in them.
Today, the Prime Minister says he is ultimately responsible for the failures of this program. But as is usual with this Prime Minister, those words are hollow and very different from the reality—that everyone else can plainly see—around him. The Prime Minister has not even taken the responsibility to sack his incompetent minister.
These sorts of numbers are staggering. We now have in this country 240,000 homes with unsafe or substandard installations. We have 160,000 installations that did not meet product standards. We have 80,000 installations that did not meet safety standards. We have 1,000 electrified homes and we have had 93 house fires. And we have had the tragic deaths of four young men. Yet, in the last four days, the Prime Minster had the nerve to call Mr Garrett a first class and very effective minister. This is despite the fact that the minister received at least 21 individual warnings over safety and reports on the four deaths. This is despite the minister’s officials receiving the Minter Ellison report exposing deep concerns in April of last year and a further risk register, from the same firm, with a clear warning to delay the program for three months to correct the problems. He claims he knew nothing about it until 11 days ago.
I am a member of the committee that cross-examined the department on Monday morning and I will say again what I said then. It is astounding that the minister did not know of a report, detailing those basic mistakes, from a firm that is a household name in this country for high level professional advice. Everyone in the department seemed to know about it, but no-one mentioned the report to the minister. The risks were apparently detailed in other ways, but obviously not enough. That is a very convenient lapse in ministerial procedure.
As early as last year, the minister was warned in writing by the National Electrical and Communications Association that this program was a disaster waiting to happen. In late April he was warned by state and territory ministers that this program was a disaster. On 14 October last year we had the first death directly linked to this program. On 16 October last year the Master Electricians Association formally wrote to the minister, warning him that without an immediate suspension of the foil insulation program there would be further fatalities. In November, the Australian Council of Trade Unions—surely the bible as far as this government is concerned—called for the suspension of the foil insulation program. And yet he took no action. The New South Wales minister warned of the fire risk from this program. The South Australian minister warned of the fire risk from this program. These were Labor government ministers warning this minister of the risks inherent in this program—and still he took no action. It was only in February that he finally acted.
Without question this is a breach of the most basic ministerial responsibility, and yet the Prime Minister and the minister do not have the dignity, or the respect for the victims or the people who are at risk, to do the honourable thing. The fact that Mr Garrett is still calling himself ‘the honourable minister’ is a contradiction in terms at the moment. If this kind of incompetent decision making and its disastrous consequences do not get you sacked in the Rudd government, you would have to ask what does.
Given that I have a limited amount of time, I would like to turn to the Green Loans scheme. I want to read a letter I received from a constituent in Victoria who has been left very much out of pocket by the scheme. This person writes:
I first heard of this scheme in November—
last year—
& was interested in training to become a Home Sustainabilty Assessment Scheme assessor. I’m primarily a—
professional person—
… with an interest in this area, and was very careful to do my homework …
I was aware of the total up-front cost to me; about $3000 … so I proceeded carefully. I calculated I would have to complete about 15 assessments in 2010 to break even, and that the assessments after this would provide a small income for me this year. I did not expect this scheme to provide a new job for me, just a part-time income which I could possibly increase over time with extra training in the area. There is no way I thought it possible that I would be looking at losing my $3000 investment entirely, a prospect I am facing right now.
… I carefully checked the figures in late November on the Australian Building Surveyor’s Association website as to how many assessors had been registered. According to their website, 1500 assessors were registered at this time, and there weren’t many assessors registered in the area where I wanted to work. So I decided to continue with the process …
There were no statistics from the DEWHA—
Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts—
available at this time as to how many assessments had been completed. I assumed, along with many others I guess, that if this scheme was running out, they would have let the general public and ABSA know.
I was gob-smacked in January when I found out, courtesy of ABSA, that 5000 assessors had been registered before the 24/12 [3500 in December alone!!] and that my application to assess was amongst another 5000 waiting for approval. The other shock was the fact that over half the 360000 assessments—
that were originally budgeted for—
had already been completed [in a scheme that was supposed to run till 2012!!]
Now, according to ABSA, I should get my accreditation in about a week’s time, but I am really wondering now if I’ll make even one cent from this whole government-sponsored endeavour!
There are so many assessors who have been intending to take this up that by, mid-February, this gentleman calculates:
… that leaves 80000 assessments to be carried out by 10000 assessors, an average of 8 per assessor [well below the number required to break even]
This is a tragedy for this gentleman. He says:
I know I’ll be lucky if I can even book a couple of appointments.
… I’ve blown $3000. Now, with 2 teenage children, we’re currently struggling to cope with the early year bills; school fees & expenses and bills from the Christmas period. And I believe there are 1000s more in the same boat as me.
Regardless of whatever answers the government provides to those questions, the broader question remains of how so many mistakes, along with negligence, lack of attention to detail and gross incompetence, can be tolerated. How much more can we take? The government should be censured, the minister should resign and the Prime Minister should stop trying to look like he has friends on Good News Week, try showing some leadership on a serious issue for once and sack his minister if he refuses to resign.",SENATE,<title>RUDD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-03-09,"—Here we are debating a motion to censure the government for its gross and systematic failure in the delivery of climate change programs, including the Home Insulation Program—the pink batts or batty batts program. First of all, I would like to say: what did the government expect from holding hands with the Greens and rushing ahead with wacky policy ideas? It is unreal that you would hold hands with them. Maybe you were hoping they would vote for your crazy Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. But that completely failed, and this is what you get.
Maybe we should be having a censure motion of the Greens for their wacky policy positions that would actually wreck the Australian economy. I find it farcical that the Greens have moved a motion to censure the government, when it is their ideas that the government have rushed ahead with, trying to please the Greens. They are wacky policy positions. The renewable energy targets that they were putting forward were wacky. Sorry, but they were wacky. The government have been holding hands with the Greens over their wacky policy ideas, and now you have got yourselves in a heck of a mess. The Greens did not even support your Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is absolutely ridiculous.
Maybe we should just change this motion to say that the Greens should be censured for their wacky policy positions—renewable energy targets of 30 per cent. That would cripple our economy. It would absolutely spiral up electricity prices. Families could not even pay their bills. And here we have the government jumping into bed with the Greens. They have got themselves in a mess because they tried to rush ahead with their crazy ideas. When it came to the emissions trading scheme, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the Greens had a wacky idea again—of signing up for even bigger targets before Copenhagen. Gee, what an embarrassment that would have been for Australia. Copenhagen was a farce, a huge flop. We would have been embarrassingly and recklessly signing ourselves up for targets that would expose Australian jobs and our economy.
Yes, this censure motion is real. Yes, the government should be censured on this issue, but surely the Greens should also be censured. Their whacky policies would send us back to the horse-and-buggy days. It is ridiculous to think that they would jump into bed so quickly. What did you expect? You were that much of a fool that you did it!
Bob’s forest is a dangerous place. Lurking behind every tree is a whacky dangerous Greens policy position. Look at RET—the renewable energy targets. They would have wrecked our economy. Look at their position on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. That position was whacky. It is crazy to think that you have, gullibly, let yourselves into this.
How many times could the coalition flip-flop on the climate issue? Maybe you should have gone to the Winter Olympics. You could have won an elegance award in aerial skiing for double backflips—with a smile on your face at the same time! How credible are you guys? How credible can you be? I do not think you can be credible. It was not that long ago when you were signing up for Copenhagen. You would have been elegant in the Winter Olympics doing your double backflips with smiles on your faces! We are all dizzy from how many twists and turns you have done on the ice-skating rink.
Let us look at Labor. Let us just think about this for a moment. Censure is harsh criticism or disapproval; to reprimand or rebuke formally. Labor should be rebuked. They could not manage themselves out of a wet paper bag! It is disgraceful to think that Mr Garrett has not got the decency to resign. If you could put aside the debt—which is hard to do—you would still hear about how much waste has gone on with this program. There has been up to one billion dollars worth of waste with ineffective insulation being used, some dangerous. It is incompetence at the highest level, and Mr Rudd has not got the guts. If the minister has not got the sense of decency to resign Mr Rudd should do something about it.
—I rise on a point of order, Acting Deputy President Barnett. I am sorry for interrupting the flow of this speech but I ask that you ask the senator not to belt the desk. It is very hard for Hansard to be able to interpret through that.
 (Senator Barnett)—Thank you, Senator Brown. I note your comments and I call Senator Fielding.
—Mr Rudd, on The 7.30 Report, a month or two after being elected, was talking to Kerry O’Brien, beating his chest to the Australian public and saying, ‘I will hire and fire my ministers on performance.’ I kept that transcript, by the way. I then went to Senate estimates the following year and I asked one of the ministers—I cannot remember which one it was—‘Have you got your performance measures from the Prime Minister?’ The answer was, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ Bingo! They were not even given any performance measures to start with. How embarrassing that a minister did not even know that they were supposed to get letters from the Prime Minister of the day.
What is the performance standard for this minister? There has been up to a billion dollars worth of wastage and deaths and he says, ‘Not my fault.’ Does he know what is going on in his department? He thought saying that he had never read a report was a good excuse, but for me that made it even worse. Most Australian people on the street thought: ‘You didn’t read a report which you asked for and which was pretty significant! You didn’t read it!’ It is outrageous to think that he could stand there and get away with this.
The Prime Minister said on The 7.30 Report that he would hire and fire his ministers on performance but it is a disgrace. The Prime Minister has to show some real leadership on this issue. A $2.5 billion insulation program has gone belly-up. That is gross incompetence. If it is not the Prime Minister and it is not Minister Garrett it is even worse: you are trying to blame the department now. Someone has to own responsibility for this. If the minister gets away with this there is no responsibility for any ministers in the entire Rudd government. Mr Fitzgibbon must be really thinking: ‘Blimey, I got pinged! I got pushed for what? What about Garrett?’
—Order! You should refer to the minister by his correct title.
—Thank you. The issue at hand here is really responsibility. This censure motion is absolutely real. I have problems with this idea of a unified ministry and department of climate change and energy. I will not be supporting that. I really think that the word ‘censure’ in this motion means harsh criticism, disapproval; to reprimand and rebuke formally—and that is what needs to happen here. There has been gross incompetence with this program, and the Australian public are watching this issue. They may not be listening to this debate or watching it but they have been watching what has been happening with the Prime Minister and Minister Garrett about who is going to take ownership and responsibility for this issue. This issue is bigger than you think, out on the street.",SENATE,<title>RUDD GOVERNMENT</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-03-09,"—I thank the participants in this censure motion debate. I end by repeating what I said when I began: it is a very serious step for any Senate to censure the government and, inter alia, several ministers involved in the failure of due process, proper accountability and delivery of programs, and the ignoring of advice which could have prevented those failures. We have had from a number of speakers a reiteration of the litany of problems in the $2 billion programs that have led to this censure motion coming before the Senate. Those problems include the potential loss of thousands of jobs, the blighting of hopes of some 250,000 householders who have had their houses audited for potential green loans—and now only 1,000 loans will be delivered to households—and the massive loss of confidence among people who have skilled up to audit houses and to take part in insulation programs and other components of this spectrum of delivery of climate change programs.
The awesome failure of control and due prudence in the delivery of the Home Insulation Program has led to 92 house fires, which may be related to the deaths of four young Australians and which has resulted in a large number of investors coming into an industry that has now suddenly been faced with effective closure and a consequent huge loss for most people who did make the investment. When we look at the solar hot water rebate, which on Friday was reduced from $1,600 to $1,000, we have to ask: what are the businesses that have ordered systems for clients supposed to do with the cancelled orders?
This is a real problem for businesses now as a result of the mismanagement of this program by the government and the ministers involved. Who is going to cover their cash crisis? Is this indeed not systemic failure? Whether we look at the failure of the insulation program, at the collapsing of the renewable energy target program, particularly the wind energy component of that, at the application of photovoltaics out of solar panels, at solar hot water systems or at the other components of the program, including the delivery of renewable energy to remote communities in Australia, it is easy to go to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and say that he has failed. There is no doubt that in terms of due prudence and management he has failed.
But several ministries are involved. When it comes to the colossal failure of governance with these multibillion dollar programs, all roads lead to Rudd. It is at the Prime Minister’s office that the buck stops. This is a Prime Minister who controls his departments and the administration of governance with a great deal of personal interest for a lack of initiative given to people who are within his cabinet, I believe. The Prime Minister himself has taken responsibility for the circumstances in which the government now finds itself.
I cannot recollect ever having heard such a failure of defence of a censure motion as we have witnessed here today. The Leader of the Government in the Senate and then the Minister for Climate Change and Water and finally a backbencher all failed to address the central thrust of the censure motion. None of them addressed the massive incompetence, the failure of management and the failure to heed proper warning that has led to this problem. The nearest we got to it were 10 words from the Minister for Climate Change and Water when she said, ‘There were problems with the program; the government has closed it.’ There was no defence at all of what has been so eloquently put by Senator Milne and Senator Troeth and others as the problem and which, moreover, has been emblazoned across the newspapers, television and radio for weeks now in this country.
This is a massive failure of governance, and it requires the government to face this censure motion. We have found in the Senate this afternoon a complete failure to address the problems which the government was charged to defend. There is no defence. The government has no defence. It has put forward no defence. The best it could do was to go to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and blame the Greens and the opposition for the failure to get that scheme through this parliament. Given the record of every other climate measure that has gone through this parliament and that has ended up so manifestly mismanaged, one has to wonder how gross the mismanagement of the CPRS—with its more than $100 billion program—would have been had it gone ahead.
I also reiterate, seeing the government has drawn attention to the CPRS, that it was a determined failure before it began. This is a CPRS which aimed at a five per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in this nation in the next decade plus. But, when you take into account the ability of the big polluters to buy credits from overseas and do nothing about reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this country, it could well have led to quite the reverse—not just less than a five per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions but an actual increase in greenhouse gas emissions while $24 billion compensation went to the polluters.
What I would like to have heard from the minister for climate change is a more coherent and positive reaction to the Greens proposal, which has been endorsed by Professor Garnaut and, I heard today, Mr Shergold, for a carbon levy to be implemented with an increasing price in the coming few years until a proper and responsible target system is brought into play. That system, which does not allow for external credits to be bought by the polluters, would ensure that greenhouse gas emissions in this country fall in the immediately coming years. That surely has to be the baseline test of any credible scheme that is going to tackle climate change.
I would have thought the Minister for Climate Change and Water, who chose to attack the Greens for voting against her prescription for failure in the CPRS, would have been much more positive, and maybe would have given to the chamber an account of why it is taking so long for us to get a response from the government on this positive program, which we Greens have brought forward—let alone acknowledgement of the fact that, while the opposition obstructed, it was the Greens who delivered the stimulus program which helped this country, during the last 12 months, avoid recession and massive job losses.
We are a responsible entity on this crossbench. We are determined to continue to act that way. We have brought forward this censure motion with a great deal of deliberation. We do not do it lightly; we certainly do not do it lightly to a government in its first term of office. But the failure of governance here is so gross, it affects so many tens of thousands of Australian citizens, the programs have been so manifestly poorly applied—despite the warnings of the government’s own consultants 12 months ago—that the government absolutely deserves to be censured in the way in which this motion puts it.
We will not divide on the matter of the motion’s call for a unified ministry and department of climate change and energy, but let me say this: I heard Senator Feeney, who diverted Labor preferences, unknown to Labor voters, who did not have a say in this, and helped Senator Fielding take a seat in this place—and I congratulate Senator Fielding—instead of another Labor or Greens senator, attack the Greens in here. Senator Feeney, the architect of that, was attacking the Greens in here today. I want to say this to him: he, like the leader and the minister, left the chamber after their speeches. That is the determination they have to defend the government in this place. But let me say this: five per cent was the target, with a $24 billion price-tag given to the big polluters, had the best outcome emerged from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme put forward by the government.
Senator Milne gave us the story of the Prime Minister being in the Hunter Valley in support for the coalmining industry. Prime Ministers and premiers of course will do that. But in the last few weeks we have heard Mr Palmer from Queensland announce this massive program for selling, from his one scheme only, 30 million tonnes of coal a year to China. That would lead to the increase of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere—produced in Australia, burnt in China—equivalent to increasing Australia’s greenhouse gas output by 12 per cent. So in one fell swoop a massive coal export operation—not helping Australia but to be burnt in China—would more than double any gain made by the $24 billion compensation-to-polluters prescription that this government has put forward. You can see the problem, the muddled thinking that is within government.
If you do not bring energy and climate change within the same portfolio, you have the internal contradiction of the government, which on the one hand wants to put a $24 billion compensation program, producing a five per cent result, but at the same time wants to spend billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money to cancel that and give us a plus-12 per cent result in greenhouse gas emissions. You can see the inherent contradiction within this government. It is that sort of contradiction that we believe would be eliminated by the creation of such a department, were it to be properly equipped and financed and be headed by a competent minister.
So I commend this motion to the chamber. The government has been incompetent in the management of these massive programs, which use taxpayers’ money and ought to have delivered a marvellous dividend to this nation but, instead of that, at minimum, has delivered blighted hopes, expectations, business investment and job prospects for thousands of Australian citizens. I commend the motion to the Senate.

That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 and 10 related bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the Bills

The bills implement the government’s commitment to establish a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS). They provide for the establishment of a scheme regulator and a registry, and address such matters as emissions coverage of the scheme, emissions caps, the definition of liable entities, obligations on liable entities to surrender emissions units to match emissions for which the entity is liable, allocation of emissions units, and the use of international units for compliance.

Reasons for Urgency

The bills are required to address the urgent need to respond to climate change through the CPRS.
The bills give effect to the outcomes of negotiations agreed by the government and the opposition in November 2009. Provisions that give effect to these agreed outcomes were considered in detail by the Senate committee of the whole in November and December 2009. The CPRS is the key mechanism for meeting emissions reduction targets that have the support of both the government and the opposition.
Uncertainty created by delay in the passage of the bills raises risks for business regarding the future costs of climate change action, and is hampering investments that enable the transformation to a low-carbon pollution economy.
Some elements of the CPRS, such as the crediting of carbon sequestration by reforestation projects, commence on 1 July 2010, and passage will enable businesses and farmers who intend to participate in the scheme to design and commence their projects. Passage of the legislation would also give business time to prepare for the CPRS and associated regulations.
Introduction and passage of the bills in the same sittings will not limit consideration by the Senate. There has been ample opportunity for proper consideration of the bills, consistent with the government’s longstanding commitment to ensuring adequate scrutiny and debate of proposed legislation. The content of the proposed legislation and government policy underpinning the scheme have been considered in depth by the parliament in 2009, including through inquiries by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics into exposure draft bills in March-April 2009 and into the 2009 bills in May-June 2009, a number of other Senate and select committee inquiries that examined aspects of climate change, and extensive debate in both Houses of the parliament from the first introduction of the bills during the winter and spring 2009 sittings.
Failure to deal with the bills will result in continued uncertainty for business and further delay in new investments which will lead to a low pollution economy.

—I move the motion as amended:
That the Senate—
notes that:
after sustained pressure in the Senate, the Rudd Government has finally released information about the financial position of the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Assurance Fund as at 31 January 2010,
the Government also announced additional funding for the ESOS Assurance Fund of $5.1 million,
no information about the financial position of the ESOS Assurance Fund after 31 December 2008 had been made publicly available until 22 February 2010,
in 2008 the ESOS Assurance Fund lost $1.3 million and was left with only about $1.8 million in cash and cash equivalents,
the financial position of the ESOS Assurance Fund would have been impacted by successive closures of private training colleges throughout 2009 and early 2010, and
in 2009 other than the regular ESOS Assurance Fund levies imposed on relevant education services providers the Government had to go back to providers on an ad hoc basis to impose additional levies; and
orders that there be laid on the table, by 12pm on Wednesday, 24 February 2010:
any documents and information about the target to be raised through regular contributions to the ESOS Assurance Fund set by fund managers in 2009,
total contributions made by relevant providers to the ESOS Assurance Fund in regular annual fund contributions in the 2009 calendar year,
any documents and information about the target to be raised through any additional special contributions to the ESOS Assurance Fund set by fund managers in 2009,
the total contributions made by relevant providers by way of additional special levies in the 2009 calendar year,
the current estimated contributions of providers to the ESOS Assurance Fund and total estimated liabilities as a result of college closures for the 2010 calendar year,
the cost of managing the fund in 2009 and the estimated cost of managing the fund in 2010, and
all communications between the Minister, her office and the department and the ESOS Assurance Fund from 1 September 2009 to 22 February 2010 regarding:

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2010-03-09,"—by leave—The government opposes this motion relating to an order for the production of financial information relating to the Education Services for Overseas Students Assurance Fund. It proposes a very short time scale in which to comply with a notice to produce documents. I am not sure if it is feasible to comply.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-03-09,"—by leave—I make a ministerial statement on ensuring access to the National Archives of Australia. The Rudd Labor government is committed to assisting individuals in their search for information about themselves, their families and their country. The vast holdings of the National Archives of Australia provide a rich resource for academics, researchers and other interested groups, whether they are searching for information on the dramatic events that shaped our nation’s history or the decisions that touched individual lives. Each family’s history forms part of the fabric of our national story. That is why the National Archives is today hosting Shake Your Family Tree Day to encourage more Australians to see what information they can unearth about their own family.
Today I can announce that the government has responded to community concerns about the closure of the National Archives of Australia’s Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart offices and will guarantee that a physical National Archives presence will be maintained in every state and territory. The stand-alone National Archives offices in Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart will remain open in each instance until a permanent solution involving co-location with a local organisation has been found.
This solution aims to remove the operational inefficiencies inherent in running stand-alone offices of the National Archives in each jurisdiction. It will also reflect the changing reality, which is that people overwhelmingly access records online today, while ensuring a National Archives presence in every jurisdiction and maintaining local access to the services provided by the National Archives.
The November 2009 decision to close these National Archives offices was a fiscally responsible decision. The offices in Hobart, Adelaide and Darwin are the National Archives’ smallest offices, with the lowest visitor numbers. Each of these offices costs over $800,000 per year to operate, with the Darwin office costing around $1 million. Yet visitor numbers to these offices are low: in 2008-09 they totalled just 337 in Darwin, 720 in Adelaide and 635 in Hobart, compared with 22,290 nationally. This equates to an average cost to the Australian taxpayer of over $1,000 to $3,000 per visit—a cost which is simply unsustainable in today’s fiscal environment.
I do understand the importance of maintaining a National Archives presence at a state and territory level—after all, that is where Australia’s history emerged. The Rudd government has listened to the concerns of the local community, academics, researchers and other interested groups over the proposed closure of National Archives offices. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of the statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The remainder of the statement read as follows—
I would like to acknowledge the work done by my colleagues including the Member for Solomon, Damian Hale, the Minister for Indigenous Health, Warren Snowdon, Senator Trish Crossin, the Member for Lyons, Dick Adams, the Member for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas, the Member for Franklin, Julie Collins, the Member for Port Adelaide, Mark Butler, and the Minister for Sport and Youth, Kate Ellis, in representing constituents’ concerns over the closures. I also acknowledge the work of all of the individuals and members of historians’ and archivists’ societies who have highlighted the significance of the local offices of the National Archives, and I thank them for their contribution. I also recognise the petition on the office closures tabled in the House of Representatives earlier this month by Julia Irwin, the Member for Fowler.
National Archives repositories around the country hold many records containing important information about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their history. I would like to particularly emphasise the fact that the Government will not change existing access arrangements for records relating to the separation policies imposed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; these access arrangements were strengthened in response to the landmark 1997 Bringing Them Home report on the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families.
The reality is that fewer people are visiting the National Archives in person to access their records. Instead, the country has moved to an online environment: in 2008-09 more than 1.9 million records were accessed online compared to 57,000 records accessed in reading rooms nationally. Demand for online access to records is expected to continue to increase apace, and the National Archives is developing plans to provide digital access to ever more of its records, including those currently held by the National Archives in Darwin, Adelaide and Hobart.
In today’s society, we need to explore other ways of ensuring access to archives other than a fully functioning National Archives office at a cost to the taxpayer of up to $3,000 per visit. In what is a very successful partnership, the National Archives already co-locates with the state institution in Victoria. The National Archives will be required to work with local cultural heritage institutions and other organisations in pursuit of further co-located reading rooms and record storage facilities. In this way, the Government can ensure that the National Archives maintains face-to-face services in all jurisdictions, while shaping its operations in a way which will meet the needs of future generations.
The Rudd Government is committed to ensuring continued public access to records documenting Australia’s history. This is part of our broader aim of restoring trust and integrity in the use of government information through improved transparency and accountability. The Rudd Government is committed to promoting a pro-disclosure culture across government, and ensuring that Australians can realise their right to access government information.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>National Archives of Australia</title>,Ministerial Statements,15,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-03-09,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Obviously, the coalition welcome this change, but it does come on the back of the electoral education centres issue, where the government moved to close the centres down. I just want to say a couple of things, particularly in relation to page 2 of the ministerial statement. Honestly, the nerve of the minister and the government trying to give this hotchpotch of government members any credit at all for this decision—it is complete and utter rubbish. I want to put on the record who actually was involved in this. I am talking about Senator Bernardi, Senator Birmingham, Senator Abetz, Senator Scullion and Senator Hanson-Young. They were actively involved. It had nothing to do with that ragtag of people named in the ministerial statement. Those people came in at the end of it when they realised what damage was being done. It is senators on the opposition and middle benches who actually stood up for this. They are the same people who stood up for the education offices of the Australian Electoral Commission.
Finally—because I am sure others will want to speak on this—I want to turn to page 3 of this statement. My colleagues will be fascinated to hear these words:
This is part of our broader aim of restoring trust and integrity in the use of government information through improved transparency and accountability. The Rudd Government is committed to promoting a pro-disclosure culture across government, and ensuring that Australians can realise their right to access government information.
I reckon there are a lot of people who were part of the insulation program who would like to see those words put into practice. There would be a lot of people who are wondering at this very moment why they were not told by this government what the state of play was. There will be a lot of people wondering: what is the disclosure culture of this government? It is a disclosure culture that has left a thousand people wondering whether their homes are safe. It is culture in which there is a dangerous situation for many Australians, not of their own making but due to the utter incompetence of Minister Arbib and the minister for the environment, both of whom refused to acknowledge any responsibility at all for the insulation program. This is not a pro-disclosure government. This is a government, quite frankly, that should sack at least two ministers—and, while they are at it, the minister for mates should go as well: Senator Conroy. There are a group of people responsible for saving these offices, but they are not on the Labor Party side. It is the coalition and the Greens who can take ownership of this decision.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>National Archives of Australia</title>,Ministerial Statements,15,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-03-09,"—by leave—On the same matter, just briefly: I do tend to agree with Senator Ronaldson in that I think it is a little ironic that the government are now taking credit for the work of saving the National Archives offices around the country. It is of course because of the people in Hobart, Adelaide and Darwin who came to their elected representatives and said, ‘We need to see these offices saved,’ and it is because of the work of their senators on this side of the chamber—the opposition and the Greens, including Senator Milne and Senator Brown in Tasmania—to ensure that those people’s voices were heard. That is why those offices have been saved.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2010-03-09,"—It is with a heavy heart that I rise in tonight’s adjournment debate to pay tribute to my dear friend and comrade Jock Ferguson, who died suddenly a little over a week ago. He was a remarkable man and an inspiration to many, including me. He was a strong leader, whose leadership style was underpinned by strong values. He was a fighter for Western Australian jobs and opportunities for Western Australians. He campaigned for WA jobs by tackling companies that brought in from overseas or components for big industrial projects. He strove to see WA develop its potential, working with government and industry to see the Jervoise Bay project and the Australian Marine Complex get off the ground.
Jock Ferguson could be a militant unionist but, as was highlighted by those contributing to his eulogy, he was not a mindless militant; he was thoughtful and strategic. He fought tooth and nail against individual workplace agreements, agreements that sought to destroy union representation and protection in Western Australia’s north-west. He worked to see smaller companies given the opportunity to bid for work in major projects, by lobbying companies to break down their work into pieces that local firms could bid for. He campaigned against the importation of foreign labour when there were local workers who could do the job, but he also worked hard to protect 457 visa workers from exploitation. He was dedicated to the development of training opportunities for young Western Australians.
It is not hard to understand what shaped his character as a man and a political leader within the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union when you look at the circumstances of his life. He was born in the working-class area of Possilpark in Glasgow. The industrial revolution of the 1880s saw it become a vibrant manufacturing area, with a foundry, engineering and other manufacturing works. But in the 1960s, as the Hon. Jock Ferguson highlighted in his first speech to the WA parliament, the foundry was shut down, taking with it thousands of jobs and many more jobs in associated industries.
From this Jock Ferguson saw firsthand what a life without opportunities meant—high crime, drugs, violence, low life expectancy, malnutrition and poverty. He also knew the strength of unionism. He was mentored by his grandfather, who was a convenor of the Boilermakers Union and a member of the Communist Party. The Western Australian union movement and the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union were very fortunate that he made Western Australia his home and put his leadership talents to work there.
But there is much more to Jock’s story and his political leadership than working-class struggle. He was born to an unwed Catholic woman. He was raised by his grandparents, believing that they were his parents. He had no idea that in fact his ‘sister’ was his mother. He only found out some eight years ago that he had a sister who was adopted outside of the family. Jock and his sister, Monica, were born to Protestant and Catholic parents who were forbidden to marry. Jock’s sister spent many years looking for her family and eventually she found her brother, Jock. As Jock said in his first speech to the WA parliament, when he told his story:
… I relate this part of my history … because it is a very human story, steeped in prejudice and secrets that had tragic consequences for my family.
He went on to say:
Of all my life experiences, the discovery of my sister and parentage has highlighted the truly cataclysmic effect that ignorance and discrimination can have on the everyday lives and experiences of families and individuals. My sister was robbed of ever meeting her mother and we were separated from each other for over 50 years.
He said when he was elected to parliament that he intended to work hard as a law-maker towards breaking down some of the barriers and prejudices that exclude people and their families from fully participating in our society and achieving personal fulfilment. Sadly, Jock’s time in parliament was too short. However, in the years I have known Jock, he was true to this vision as a political leader throughout his career. He worked very hard to make sure that people from all walks of life were included, regardless of race, gender or sexuality. This was not something that was always easy in a blue-collar union. He worked hard to give people from diverse backgrounds a political leg-up. His life experiences taught him never to make room for prejudice or discrimination.
Jock was the very embodiment of the fact that the labour movement is about a lot more than protecting workers. He fought for environmental sustainability and against the Iraq war. He fought for human rights and against discrimination. Jock knew that people come together in unions not just because they want to get a fair deal for themselves and their families but because they want a fair deal for everybody. The underlying motivation here, as his life’s work demonstrates, is to protect and defend people’s and individuals’ collective dignity.
Jock’s partner, Tina, his children and all those who were close to Jock should take great comfort in the legacy he left and the knowledge that the love and care from family and friends that surrounded him underpinned his capacity to give service to others. There are a great many people who, like me, will dearly miss Jock Ferguson. We will miss him as he was a man who had the courage to back his convictions and he displayed great leadership. He was smart and strategic and he could make a tough call. He had a disarming sense of humour and was a great wit. But most of all, he will be missed for his love and compassion for people.
Jock, I know a great many people, including me, will remain inspired by you and seek to be true to the legacy that you have left: to remain motivated by love and compassion for people and to work to make the world a better place for everyone. Jock, you were a man whose vision inspired us, whose strength sustained us, and whose humour lightened our load. When you saw injustice you stared it down. Where you found unfairness you fought it every step of the way. Where you saw equality you drove people towards it. You worked for justice and equality for people everywhere and you made the world a better place. Vale to the honourable Jock Ferguson.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Hon.
