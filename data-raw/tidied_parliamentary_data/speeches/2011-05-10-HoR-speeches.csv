Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  I move:


That the House express its deep regret at the death of Mr Lionel Rose MBE, place on record its appreciation for his outstanding service to world sport and to the Australian community and tender its profound sympathy to his family and friends in their loss.


This week our nation marks the passing of a remarkable Australian, Lionel Rose—a man who rose from very modest beginnings to the highest level of international sport, taking the hopes of a nation with him. Lionel Rose started boxing as a 14-year-old in a makeshift boxing ring in country Victoria. It is said, according to one account, that he used to tie his hands up in rags because he could not afford the boxing gloves. 


However, within two years, he had gone professional and by 19 was bantamweight champion of the world. In that fight in 1968 he was the underdog—the underdog who prevailed brilliantly and unexpectedly in 15 rounds while thousands of Australians listened to Ron Casey's thrilling blow-by-blow live commentary down a very crackling phone line from Tokyo. What they heard was possibly the best ever boxing win by an Australian. Not surprisingly, when Lionel Rose returned, fans turned out in droves to welcome his plane at Essendon Airport and to line his route into Melbourne. And 250,000 more gathered to cheer Australia's latest hero outside Melbourne Town Hall—truly a welcome to rival the scenes with the Beatles. That same year, 1968, Mr Rose's achievements were officially acknowledged by being appointed Australian of the Year, as well as a member of the Order of the British Empire. Few Australians have received such emphatic recognition so quickly or so deservedly.


In this golden age of Australian sport, we were not short of heroes—Rod Laver, Margaret Court, Dawn Fraser, Ken Rosewell, and of course the list goes on and on. But there was always something in the style of Lionel Rose that endeared him to the hearts of all Australians. One commentator spoke of his being a true gentleman, others of his exemplary sportsmanship and there was, of course, a winning smile and an easy manner that were just made for the camera and the TV screen. 


Of course, in a nation with such a complex history as ours, there was a serious side to all of this as well. Lionel Rose's victory came less than a year after the 1967 referendum and offered a hint of what we could be as a nation, touching upon those shared aspirations we later came to know as reconciliation. His was a record of Indigenous achievement that was accepted on its own terms and its own merits, blazing a path for other Indigenous sporting greats like Evonne Goolagong and, more recently, Cathy Freeman. Like them, he excelled without qualification. He was simply the best at what he did. There was no adjective required. 


By the end of his short but exceptional career, Rose had recorded 42 wins out of 53 bouts, including 12 knock-outs and had had a sparring session with Elvis Presley—a record any boxer would envy. He also made a point of refusing to fight in South Africa, even though the money was tempting—making Rose one of the first sportsmen in the world to stand up to the disgrace that was apartheid. 


After hanging up the gloves, Lionel Rose went on to record a handful of popular singles. I am no expert on boxing; I defer to the Leader of the Opposition on that. And even if I had taken a sudden interest in boxing as a child, I cannot imagine my parents would have allowed me to follow it, but I do remember Lionel Rose from his singing career. I remember his songs, I thank you and Please remember me—songs which reinforced his fame with many and introduced him to new fans across Australia.


The Lionel Rose of more recent years suffered health complications that seem so far away from those earlier, happier times. Sadly, those health issues have ended his life much too soon. Today it is fair to say that Australia has lost a true-blue hero, a model of sportsmanship and decency both in the arena and outside it. But while Lionel Rose's life has been tragically cut short, his is a legend that will live on for generations for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike. His song said 'Please remember me' and today we do.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:06):  I rise to join the Prime Minister in remembering a great Australian. Lionel Rose was never really a political activist, but few have equalled his efforts to bring about true reconciliation. When he returned from his legendary win against Fighting Harada in Tokyo in 1968, a quarter of a million Australians lined the streets to cheer. It was the first time so many Australians had cheered an Aboriginal person. How could Aboriginal people not be first-class citizens in their own country when one of them had done us all so proud? This was, I suspect, a seminal moment in the history of race relations in this country. As the Prime Minister said, we do remember him—especially his never-say-die spirit, which will always be an important part of the Australian character.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:10):   on indulgence—Last Thursday the world heard the sad news of the passing of Mr Claude Choules, the last known veteran to have served in the First World War. Mr Choules was born in 1901 and joined Britain's Royal Navy at just 14—one of the 65 million personnel who served in the war to end all wars. They are amazing statistics: 65 million personnel; a boy who joined at 14. It is hard to believe that every one of those men is, to the best of our knowledge, now gone. The last known link to those who served in the Great War has been severed.


Claude Choules came to build a new life here in Australia after the war, continuing his military service with the Royal Australian Navy. He lived for a time in Sydney where he and his beloved wife, Ethel, watched the Sydney Harbour Bridge go up before their very eyes. Mr Choules served in our navy in the Second World War, fighting in the two world wars, and he subsequently built a career in the fishing industry in Western Australia. I hope he found some time to reflect as he was out there on the beautiful waters off Australia's shores—to reflect on being involved in two world wars, the enormous cost of war and the role he played as an eye witness to these terrible episodes that shaped our history.


Claude Choules made an outstanding contribution to the cause of freedom in two world wars. He witnessed the price of conflict firsthand and he rejected the glorification of war, as we all must. He was the last of the last. A defining chapter in world history ends with his passing. I join the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who has already expressed his condolences to the family, and I join what I am sure is the whole House in sending our condolences to Mr Choules's family. Claude Choules was a man of peace and he now rests in peace.


Our nation will soon be reflecting deeply on World War I and Gallipoli as we enter the 100-year period of commemoration. We will say to each other on many occasions during that period 'lest we forget'. Today, we use those words about Claude Choules. Lest we forget.

In mourning his passing we remember all who served their king and their country in the Great War. We acknowledge that they put their country first, all of them.


I suppose this is an appropriate moment to express the hope that in our time, in our own way, this generation should be no less patriotic and no less motivated by the ideals of duty and service which motivated our forebears. On behalf of the opposition, I join the Prime Minister in expressing heartfelt condolences to Mr Choules's family, which, I am pleased to say, stretches through five generations. He fought that they might live.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:15):  Mr Speaker, on further indulgence, this is the first time the House has been able to reflect on the news that the world's No. 1 terrorist, Osama bin Laden, was killed on Monday of last week in a targeted operation conducted by a small team of US forces. Those personnel have our nation's gratitude. The death of Osama bin Laden is of course a great blow to terrorism. It is also a measure of justice for his victims and for a world that he has changed forever. As a nation, we are simply relieved that his long career of destruction is over—a two-decade campaign that cost thousands of innocent lives, including the lives of many people of Islamic faith. Those victims also include 10 Australians killed on September 11—9-11—and more than 100 Australians who have lost their lives in terrorist attacks inspired by or linked to al-Qaeda in the years since. 


Osama bin Laden's death is a landmark in our campaign against al-Qaeda and it is no surprise that, like any other major event, this operation has given rise to internet conspiracy theories alleging that bin Laden is not really dead or he did not even exist except as a CIA construct. Of course, even al-Qaeda itself has acknowledged bin Laden's death—a warning to all those tempted to credulity or gullibility in this age of information overload. Bin Laden is dead, but we must not allow ourselves to become complacent. Al-Qaeda is still a resilient and persistent terrorist network and al-Qaeda inspired terrorist groups remain active elsewhere in the world. 


Our long watch against terrorism is by no means over. The challenges in preventing terrorism and home-grown extremism in Australia and in the Asian region will remain. The challenges in bringing security and stability to Afghanistan will remain as well which is why on my recent visit to London I discussed with Prime Minister Cameron the need to continue our efforts in Afghanistan to take the fight to the insurgents, to train the Afghan National Army, to improve governance in Afghanistan and to work with elements amongst the insurgents who are prepared to renounce violence and adopt a path back to a constructive and purposeful civilian life. We also recognise here the crucial ongoing role Pakistan will have in defeating al-Qaeda and its affiliates, and note that many ordinary Pakistanis have been killed in al-Qaeda's ruthless attacks against their fellow Muslims. 


On Saturday morning our time, I was able to speak to President Obama, who was on Air Force One returning from a visit to congratulate the special forces personnel involved in the operation against bin Laden. In our conversation, I offered Australia's thanks to the President and the US military personnel and officials who planned, supported and conducted this operation. I was also able to confirm Australia's commitment against global terrorism and the work that remains to be done in Afghanistan. I made it clear that Australia will see the mission through in Afghanistan, so it can never again become a terrorist safe haven. The operation against bin Laden strikingly affirms President Obama's resolve and capacity to fight terrorism—a resolve I have come to know well in my own meetings and discussions with him. We have in the White House a man of character, of sober judgment and of intellectual clarity. The operation against bin Laden is not the end of our journey. It is important and it will make a difference but the job is not yet done. Our resolve endures and our purpose remains right and we will prevail.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:20):  I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister. The death of Osama bin Laden is an important breakthrough in the fight against terror. As the Prime Minister said, it certainly does not mean that the terror threat is removed, but it is grounds for optimism and an unmistakable sign that this is not an unwinnable war. The Australian forces who have served so long and so well in Afghanistan are entitled to feel very encouraged by this breakthrough, and the families of Australian victims of terrorism are entitled to feel quiet satisfaction that the author of the worst terrorist atrocity in world history has finally been brought to justice.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:28):  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, but I regret to advise him that the premises on which he has based his question are wrong. He does give me the opportunity, though, to explain some facts to him and this House about the arrangement that I have entered into with the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Either the Leader of the Opposition does not understand this arrangement, or he is misrepresenting it in the public domain. This arrangement of course is to break the people smugglers' business model and to take out of the hands of people smugglers the very product it is that they sell. They seek to prey on misery; they seek to say to people that they can get them to Australia, that their asylum claims will be processed here and if those claims are found to be valid, they will be able to stay. The arrangement that Prime Minister Najib and I are committed to is an arrangement that will break this business model. The message to people smugglers and to asylum seekers would be that if you risk your life and spend your money on getting on a boat trying to come to Australia, you risk being taken to Malaysia and being put to the back of the queue. Malaysia is a country with tens of thousands of refugees who have genuine claims which have been processed and with no prospect of resettlement. Of those refugees we will take 4,000 extra, on top of our current humanitarian intake. 


The Leader of the Opposition has been out there first and foremost trying to pretend to the Australian people that the 800 asylum seekers who are taken to Malaysia will somehow come back to Australia within the 4,000 quota. This is not right. The 4,000 refugees taken from Malaysia will be people who are in Malaysia now, whose claims have been processed and who are genuine refugees. The Leader of the Opposition has been trying to say to the Australian people that somehow we, the Australian government, will not be able to have a say in the selection of those 4,000 refugees. Of course this is wrong. Right around the world we take people through our special humanitarian intake system and we work with UNHCR and others so that refugees who have valid claims come to this country and settle in this nation.


Finally, the Leader of the Opposition has been representing that somehow it is the wrong thing to do to increase our humanitarian intake. He went to the last election saying he would increase that he would increase the humanitarian intake to 15,000. In a private conversation with the member for Dennison he said in the pursuit of his naked political interest that he would double it, costing the federal budget $3 billion. Let no Australian succumb to the analysis that the Leader of the Opposition can, without hypocrisy, criticise our decision to increase the humanitarian intake. The difference is that we explain it and we do it for a reason in the national interest. The Leader of the Opposition wanted to do it behind closed doors in his narrow political interest.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:37):  Let me tell you one thing: I am not going to take lessons on compassion from this opposition given its track record in government on children in detention, including unaccompanied minors. I am not going to take lessons on compassion from people who soiled themselves in government with a track record—




Mr Pyne:
  On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the Prime Minister was asked a very straightforward question without any hyperbole and I would ask you to ask her to answer it directly.




The SPEAKER:
  The Prime Minister has been asked a question. She will directly answer the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  On the question of treatment of children, this government has a record of ensuring that children of asylum seekers in this country are treated better than they were by the government that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a cabinet minister of. So let us not make any assumptions about treatment of children and who understands the needs of children best; let us just look to comparative track records—ours versus yours—and I will highlight ours in comparison with yours any day of the week.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Prime Minister will direct her remarks through the chair.




Ms GILLARD:
  On the question of the arrangement with Malaysia, I am not going to stand here in this parliament today and engage in a game with the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on something as serious as this. What we are going to do is send the clearest possible message—

The SPEAKER:
  The six-week break was obviously not long enough for people to think about the dignity of the House. I just hope that, for the rest of the day, you might think of the dignity of the House. The Prime Minister will respond to the question as required by the standing orders. The standing orders also require that she be heard in silence.




Ms GILLARD:
  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The last words I used before you intervened to deal with the opposition were that I am not going to play a political game with the opposition about this today. The fact that this is all a political game for them was then verified by the interjection of the member for Indi. What this government will do is send a strong message to people smugglers that they cannot represent that they can get people to Australia, because when they make that representation the people they are making it to are at risk of being taken to Malaysia and ending up at the back of the queue. 


I can also say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, with our increase of 4,000 in the humanitarian intake, I bet some of them are children. She like might like to explain why the Leader of the Opposition is opposing that intake.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:59):  I move:


That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately—That this House suspend proceedings forthwith so that the Prime Minister can stand before the Parliament and explain why:


(1) the Prime Minister refuses to consider an offshore detention centre in Nauru because, as she said in an interview on 8 July 2010, “I would rule out anywhere that is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention” yet now plans to send asylum seekers to Malaysia who hasn’t signed it either;


(2) the Prime Minister decried the use of Manus Island and the Howard Government’s so called “Pacific Solution” as “costly, unsustainable and wrong as a matter of principle” in 2003 yet is now desperately negotiating with the PNG Government to re-open Manus Island;


(3) the Prime Minister has damaged our national interest by agreeing to a deal with Malaysia that will see us accept five of their refugees for every one of the asylum seekers we send to them – with Australian taxpayers footing the complete bill;


(4) the Government allowed three people, identified by the NT Coroner as responsible for the fire aboard the people smuggling boat, SIEV36 which killed five people and injured 40, to be granted permanent residency in Australia;


(5)  it took only three hours for the NSW police to remove protestors from the roof of the Immigration Minister’s office yet no action was taken against protestors on the roof of Villawood for 11 days;


(6) rioters at Christmas Island faced no penalty for burning down buildings and risking the lives of people at the facility;


(7) the Prime Minister promised an East Timor solution before the election knowing very well that it was opposed by the Government of East Timor and was nothing more than a dishonest election smokescreen; and


(8) the Prime Minister doesn’t just come clean and reinstate the Howard Government policies that worked rather than try to maintain this elaborate fiction that Labor has a plan to stop the boats.


This is a tragedy for our country. The Howard government found a problem and created a solution. The current government has taken that solution and turned it into a tragedy for this country, for our region and for the boat people themselves. The Prime Minister might turn her back on me, but she should not turn her back on this problem, which is of her making. She should turn around and face this problem, not try to shuffle it off to Malaysia, which she is trying to do right now.


This is a very serious problem, and it is not helped by sanctimony and self-righteousness of the type that this Prime Minister has shown in question time today. Since she became the Prime Minister, we have seen more people than ever coming illegally by boat. We have seen further suffering and, I regret to say, further deaths and all this Prime Minister can do is come in here and engage in the kind of sanctimony and self-righteousness that we saw from her earlier today. We do not want sanctimony, Prime Minister; we want solutions. That is what we want, and that is what we are not getting from this government.


Let us be clear on how the Howard government stopped the boats. We stopped the boats with Nauru, with Manus, with temporary protection visas and with a willingness to turn boats around where it was safe to do so. I call on the Prime Minister to swallow her pride, to end this stubborn refusal to do what works and to pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and reopen the centre there. Since this Prime Minister has come to office, we have had almost three boats a week—that is, three boatloads of suffering humanity, three boatloads of people exposed to death on the high seas because of the policies of this government.


This is a problem that is going from bad to worse, and it is going from bad to worse because of the incompetence and the untrustworthiness of this government and in particular this Prime Minister. Let us remember back to that day, 24 June, when the Prime Minister made her 'the government has lost its way' speech. I say to the Minister for Foreign Affairs: do you remember that day when the Prime Minister said that the government had lost its way? He is pretending to have a conversation with the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, but he is marking every single word of mine. This Prime Minister said that the government had lost its way and that one of the things she was going to fix was the boat people problem. How did she fix this? She fixed it by promising before the election an East Timor detention centre that she had not even bothered to pick up the phone to the President of East Timor about. What incompetence, what ineptitude and, in the end, what absolute deceit of the Australian people on the eve of an election.


We now know that the East Timor detention centre has sunk without trace somewhere in the East Timor Sea, as it always was going to. It was yet another example of the incompetence and the untrustworthiness of this weak and indecisive Prime Minister. But it just goes from bad to worse. This Prime Minister has the Midas touch in reverse when it comes to public policy. Late last week she rushed out into the media—or had her briefers rush out into the media—to say, 'We have an answer: it's Manus Island.' That was the answer. This is the same Prime Minister who had said of the Howard government's Manus and Nauru detention centres that they were 'costly, unsustainable and wrong in principle'.


The Prime Minister is carefully studying her notes and pretending to write on a piece of paper. What she is writing is, 'What the hell do I say now? How do I answer this?' How do you answer it, Prime Minister? How could something that was costly, unsustainable and wrong in principle be wrong for the Howard government and right for her? It is simply impossible to justify, other than by concluding that this is a Prime Minister utterly without conviction or consistency.' But it gets worse. The Manus solution was unravelling within 24 hours of its announcement. And so at three o'clock on a Saturday afternoon, the week before the budget, she rushes out into the prime ministerial courtyard to say, 'We've got another plan. Manus isn't working; we've got a new plan. It's great! We are going to send one of ours to Malaysia and they're going to send us five of theirs!' A great deal for Malaysia; a terrible deal for Australia.


The Prime Minister thinks that, because the member for Cook thought a one-for-one swap might not be a bad deal, one for five must be even better. Really and truly: she is some negotiator! It originally started at one for one, then it became one for two and finally she settled on one for five. The longer she talks, the worse it gets—and we pay for every single one of them with borrowed money.


Not only is this against our national interest but it is hypocritical. Remember the reason the Prime Minister gave for not being able to pick up the phone to the President of Nauru? That Nauru has not signed the UN convention. I have news for the Prime Minister: Malaysia has not signed the UN convention either. Doodle something on your notes, Prime Minister! How do you answer that one? That cannot be answered either.


Finally, let me make this point: it simply won't work. It is absolutely crystal clear that Malaysia are not going to accept any 800 people. They are going to decide the 800 that come to their country and the circumstances under which they come, and they are going to leave the ones they don't like here in Australia, waiting to be dealt with by this Prime Minister. The other point I make is that plainly she is not going to send women and children back, which just gives the people smugglers another product to sell. It is weak and indecisive, from a bad government getting worse.




The SPEAKER:
  Is the motion seconded?

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Asylum Seekers</title>,MOTIONS,7,1,speech
"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2011-05-10,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (15:09):  I second the motion. After selling the Nine Network to Alan Bond for a billion dollars and buying it back three years later for a quarter of that price, Kerry Packer once famously said, 'You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime.' Well, Malaysia only gets one Julia Gillard. The great negotiator must explain to this House why she was completely rolled by the Malaysian government, who clearly saw this desperate Prime Minister coming—selling out Australia's interest in a fit of panic and desperation, as her government has lurched from crisis to crisis on our borders and in our detention centres.


Under the Prime Minister's panicked deal—five-for-one refugee swap—as the Leader of the Opposition said, we will send 800 to Malaysia at a cost of $95,000 each. We will pay for the privilege of taking back 4,000 at $54,000 each. These will be added to our existing program of refugee and humanitarian entrants, a program which is strongly supported by this side of the House, and the settlement services that support it. But it is a program under which, at its current level of intake, after five years one in three have a job and more than 80 per cent are still on welfare—and they want to add another 4,000 to the government funded program.


The other point is that on the weekend the Prime Minister said: 'It is 800 to be used as we want to use them.' Well, it is clear from today's reports that she did not read the fine detail, because clearly Malaysia, at the end of the day, will veto who gets to come to Malaysia—and, as the Leader of the Opposition said, not just who gets sent to their country, not just the circumstances in which they get sent, but how much the Australian taxpayers are going to pay for that privilege. The only big winner tonight from this government's federal budget will be the Malaysian government. They are the big winners. They are the ones who have secured the big deal out of this government with this five-for-one refugee swap.


On this deal, this Prime Minister needs to explain many things, because this deal just has not landed yet. Like all of the other things we have heard them bring into this place, the detail just never comes. And when it finally gets trawled over, the whole thing just unravels. We still do not know, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put to the Prime Minister today, whether children will be returned under this deal. No answer today. Who will monitor the welfare of the 800 returned to Malaysia and how, and who will pay for this monitoring? How will they ensure that those sent back to Malaysia do not find their way back into the people smugglers' queue and on another boat back to Australia? How will they be sent to Malaysia? The minister said on the weekend that it is an operational decision whether they will be sent by boat or by plane. Has the government got a firm commitment out of Malaysia that we will not have a repeat of the Oceanic Vikingdebacle, when people refused to get off the boat and the former Prime Minister cut a special deal with those asylum seekers on that boat that we all remember too well—and that, frankly, amongst other poor decisions of this government, set this whole crisis into the making?


This is a stopgap measure. It is a one-off desperate deal, a bilateral deal with one country, good for a dozen boats and then it is back to business as usual under this government—business as usual under which 224 boats arrived on their watch, business as usual under which over 11,000 people can turn up. We have 6,800 people in detention; half of them have been there for more than six months, and that includes a thousand children under this government's policies. That is their record.


What we have seen from this government is a series of bad decisions. This is just the latest. The first one, we will remember, was the asylum freeze, which this Prime Minister described at the time as being a deal in the national interest. It resulted in 58 more boats coming, carrying 2,800 more people. It resulted in a doubling of the number of people in detention and a tripling of the processing time, which I am sure has played a significant role in the riots we have seen.


Then there was the never-ever East Timor processing centre, the other great solution to this problem. Now we have the Malaysian people-go-round. This is a government that does not have the policy, that does not have the resolve and that does not have the necessary ticker to deal with this issue. 'Ticker' means strong decisions. You have the policies in front of you from the opposition; it is time to implement them. (Time expired)

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:14):  I rise to reject this proposed suspension of standing orders moved today by the Leader of the Opposition. I state to the House that today we have made a little bit of history, because today is the budget day. Today is the day when, for every year since Federation, the opposition have come into this chamber and raised questions about the macro economy; they have raised questions about employment settings; they have raised questions about spending; they have raised questions about revenue; and they have raised questions about the fiscal state of the economy. But we have seen today for the first time in our history an opposition come into this chamber on budget day and not ask a single question about the economy. They have abandoned the debate about the economic future of this nation, and it is not surprising, because essentially they have nothing to say about the future of this country. They regard the economy as something boring. How do we know that? Because Peter Costello in his book nailed the Leader of the Opposition when he said that the Leader of the Opposition was—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.




Mr Abbott:
  Reluctantly, Mr Speaker. I would imagine that this is way outside the standing orders. It has nothing to do with the subject matter of the suspension and it has nothing to do with why it is urgent.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I will take a little bit of time and I apologise to the Leader of the House. I can tell you that this is the last suspension of standing and sessional orders where I will allow the purpose of that suspension to be the debate. From now on I will draw both the proposer and the seconder back. On that basis, that is why the Leader of the House is in order.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Hypocrisy, thy name is Abbott!



Honourable members interjecting—  




The SPEAKER:
  Order!




Mr ALBANESE:
  They come in here and they refuse to debate the economy. They come in here and every day at 10 minutes to three they move a suspension, because this is the first opposition that have chosen not to even try to hold the executive to account. That is the purpose of question time. The purpose is to come in here and ask questions of the executive about the functioning of the government. But those opposite have given up on that. Perhaps Play School was not on today, because the Leader of the Opposition was 10 minutes late in his motion for suspension. And they are not fair dinkum, because they did not even ask for leave to move a motion. They just went straight to the moving of a suspension and, then, between the mover and the seconder of the motion, neither of them addressed why the suspension should occur.


There are two fundamental reasons that the suspension should not occur. The first is that today is budget day. Today is the day when Australians want to know about the economic future of this country. They want to know about employment settings and they want to know about how the economy will be set for this year and years into the future. They want to debate those issues.



Mr Morrison interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  The member for Cook.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The second reason it should be rejected is that the member for Cook has lodged an MPI about this very issue. So, straight after question time today we will have a debate on this issue and the member for Cook will have 15 minutes to add to his five minutes and the minister will be responding to that MPI debate.


But those opposite will do anything rather than debate the economic future of this country. And it is not surprising, as we know from last year's budget reply, where they handballed off the costings of their budget response from the Leader of the Opposition to the shadow Treasurer to the shadow finance minister and to that great moment with the staffer. I wonder if that staffer is still around. I suspect that might be one fewer person employed by the those opposite after that event.


The Leader of the Opposition has a big challenge on Thursday night, which is to actually put forward an alternative strategy on the economy—put it forward without the $11 billion black hole that was in their costings during the election campaign. It is extraordinary. They oppose all of the savings measures made by those on this side of the House. They did everything they could to stop savings measures in the area of health to create space for the reform of the program and the national reform of health undertaken under the leadership of the minister for health. They did everything possible to block that, but at the same time they go around the country and make promise after promise. Barely anyone on their back bench has not made a promise in my portfolio of transport, from a local road to a local railway line. But they never actually say where the money will come from.


Their fiscal credibility was blown apart after the election, and today's performance in question time and in moving this suspension shows that they have learnt absolutely nothing when it comes to dealing with the economic future of this country. Indeed, when the government put forward our economic stimulus plan two years ago in the 2009 budget, the Leader of the Opposition said:


I think what we are going to get is massive debt and a deep recession.


The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:


It will certainly not ward off recession.


The fact is that our economic management of this country did prevent a recession. It did help to create 500,000 jobs. We have an unemployment rate in this country with a four in front of it—the envy of the industrialised world. We are continuing to build the infrastructure that the economy needs to run faster and smarter. Tonight's budget will see the Treasurer continue with that good and sound economic management to deliver for the Australian public. Thursday night is the time for the Leader of the Opposition to put his money where his mouth is. They have gone round the country making promises about the inland rail line, the Pacific Highway, the Bruce Highway—it goes on and on. Will they deliver this on Thursday night? We know that last time there was an $11 billion black hole. We have to see from the opposition leader serious, credible and properly costed proposals in the budget reply on Thursday.


Let us take just one issue that has been the subject of some debate in today's newspapers: the issue of the provision of support for pensioners to deal with the transfer to digital TV.




Dr Emerson:
  They are against that.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The minister says that they are against that. Actually, the member for Mayo had this to say on 25 May 2009 in this House when speaking on legislation:


It is right that the government does help Australians, particularly those at the lower end of the income scale, to switch over to digital TV.


Indeed, Senator Minchin, the mentor of the Leader of the Opposition—or one of them—had this to say in the Senate on 18 June 2009:




The coalition supports this amendment ...





For eligible households in Mildura, such as pensioners, this measure will provide some certainty about their capacity to access and utilise the equipment needed to view a digital picture.



But on Sunday when asked about the government actually doing something about it, the shadow Treasurer said, 'We wouldn't be spending so much money.' Does that sound familiar? We can go back to the comments by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. They were talking about us having a transfer agreement, but when it is actually real and happening it suddenly becomes bad and so they oppose. They are caught up in that.


One thing that I learnt growing up in a household with an invalid pensioner as a mum—one thing that was taught to me every budget day and every day of my life—is that it is only Labor that looks after pensioners and low-income earners, and we will see that again because those over there are only interested in looking after the entrenchment of privilege. Those opposite continue to oppose the sort of reform that has seen our economy looked after in the interests of all Australians. Question put:


That the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition be agreed to.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (16:50):  I ask leave of the House to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 2011-2012, and also for leave to present a copy of my statement.


Leave granted.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  The Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act requires the committee to consider draft estimates for the Audit Office, with the chair ultimately making a statement to the House on budget day on whether in our opinion the Auditor-General has been given sufficient funding to carry out his or her duties. In support of this process the Auditor-General is empowered under the act to disclose budget proposals to the committee, which we then consider in making representations to government as necessary. This process reflects both the committee's status as the parliament's audit committee and the Auditor-General's status as an independent officer of the parliament.


The committee met with the Auditor-General in March to review the Audit Office's budget proposals for the coming financial year. The Auditor-General advised that, although facing a number of cost pressures, he is conscious of the overall pressures on the government's budget and is not seeking additional budget supplementation at this time.


The Auditor-General advised that, in common with other agencies, the ANAO is facing increased employee and supplier costs. He again reiterated that the Audit Office has had to absorb the impact of recent changes to the Australian Auditing Standards, which came into effect from 1 January 2010. Despite the support of the previous committee the ANAO was not successful in receiving additional supplementation in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 budgets to offset these costs. The Auditor-General advised the committee that the ANAO is now managing significant additional costs in this regard. The Auditor-General advised that further pressure could result from the possible implementation of the JCPAA's recommendation in report 419, Inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997. The recommendations would require the Auditor-General to review the adequacy of agencies' performance indicators. This is not expected to affect the ANAO's 2011-12 budget, as the report still requires formal government consideration. However, if implemented, in addition to initial set-up costs, ongoing costs of between seven per cent and 10 per cent of the cost of the financial statement program could be required. The committee would expect the Auditor-General to seek additional budget supplementation to cover this extended mandate in 2012-13.


The committee appreciates the efforts of the Auditor-General and his staff to establish a strong working relationship with the new committee. They have made themselves available to brief the committee regularly and have been responsive to our requests for information on a variety of topics. The committee looks forward to continuing a productive relationship with the Audit Office over the term of this parliament. The committee recognises the important role that the Auditor-General plays in scrutinising the government and will continue to support that role. The committee does not want to see the discretionary work of the Audit Office suffer due to future budget constraints and will endeavour to ensure that the office remains adequately resourced. This acknowledges the importance of the performance audit program and the contribution that the ANAO makes to better practice across agencies.


The Audit Office's total revenue from government will be $74.891 million in 2011-12. The Auditor-General has advised that his appropriation for the year ahead is sufficient for him to discharge his statutory obligations and planned audit work for 2011-12. He also advises that his office will be able to absorb the increase in the efficiency dividend over the next two years. Therefore, we endorse the budget proposed for the Audit Office for 2011-12. I present a copy of my statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2011-05-10,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (16:54):   On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, I present the committee's report, entitled The design and implementation of a mandatory pre-commitment system for electronic gaming machines, which incorporates a dissenting report, together with the transcript of evidence, submissions and tabled documents.


Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.




Mr WILKIE:
  by leave—I present the first report of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform entitled The design and implementation of a mandatory precommitment system for electronic gaming machines. There are 95,000 Australians addicted to poker machines and another 95,000 at risk. For every problem gambler, between five and 10 people are adversely impacted. Poker machine losses amount to some $12 billion a year, 40 per cent of which is from problem gamblers. Individual losses average $1,200 an hour on current high intensity electronic gaming machines. Even if the industry estimate of $3 billion for the cost of implementing precommitment is proven correct, this still represents little more than half what problem gamblers lose in a single year.


The implementation of a mandatory precommitment system on electronic gaming machines—or poker machines—was a major recommendation of the Productivity Commission and is a key aspect of my own limited support for the government. Mandatory precommitment—requiring players to preset limits before they start to gamble—will reduce the harm of poker machines and encourage all players to make rational and conscious decisions about their gambling behaviour. It will result in fewer people becoming problem gamblers in Australia.


This report makes 43 recommendations, most significantly the fitting of mandatory precommitment on all high-intensity poker machines by 2014. Players will need to pre-set their loss limit and will be locked out when that limit is reached. There will be cooling-off periods for limit increases, safeguards to prevent venue or machine hopping and an effective self-exclusion function. There will be no licence to punt and no fingerprinting. Venues will have the choice to change some or all of their poker machines for low-intensity machines having a $1 maximum bet and other loss-limiting features. The 88 per cent of poker machine players who currently wager a dollar or less will barely notice the change except that they will almost always finish their gambling session with more money in their pockets.


The report also recommends that smaller venues—those with 15 machines or less—be given until 2018 to implement the scheme and the establishment of a transition fund to assist them. Foreign tourists in casinos will have the option of being given a 24-hour card to override pre-commitment. And a new independent national body will be established to oversee implementation.


The committee received 119 submissions and heard from a wide range of witnesses from industry, from social service and church organisations, from academia, from experts and, most importantly, from a number of former problem gamblers who bravely chose to share their stories with us and offer their insights. I sincerely thank all these witnesses, as well as the members of the committee and the secretariat staff, for their contributions and efforts.


During the course of the inquiry, it became clear to me from various articles and public comments that unfortunately coalition committee members had already decided their position and that this would be one of dissent. This is disappointing given that they were, like other members of the committee, so strongly affected by the stories of those brave problem gamblers to whom the committee spoke. So too the poker machine industry has been a strident critic of these poker machine reforms. But the industry's multi-million dollar advertising campaign against the reforms—a fear campaign—not to mention intense political lobbying and a smear campaign against me personally, shows how desperate some in the industry are to overturn this historic opportunity for federal intervention in problem gambling.



Yes, we did hear many in the industry express their concern for problem gamblers and I believe that many of these concerns are genuine. But I ask of the others in the poker machine industry why they continue to criticise the Productivity Commission's work and its considered estimates of problem gambling, continue to misrepresent the evidence of precommitment trials, continue to exaggerate the costs, continue to complain about unachievable timelines, continue to overstate community contributions and continue to blame problem gamblers for an addiction caused by a fundamentally unsafe product. The number of Australians touched by or at risk of poker machine problem gambling in one form or another can be measured in the millions. No wonder our children will judge the members and senators of the 43rd Parliament on our willingness and success in seizing this historic moment and doing something about it, as they should. I commend the report to the House.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (17:01):  I seek leave to make a statement on the report.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Is leave granted?




Mr TONY SMITH:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I reluctantly grant leave but point out that the government itself rightly stipulate the program for the day, which states that Mr Wilkie would move that the House take note of the report, the debate be adjourned and Mr Wilkie would then move that the order of the day be referred to the Main Committee. We make the point that it is interesting that government members themselves do not want to follow the program of the manager of government business, but that is obviously a matter for them.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I understand that there has been no real objection to leave being granted. Leave is granted. I call the member for Wakefield.




Mr CHAMPION:
  I thank the member for Casey for his forbearance. The issue of poker machines is an issue that is very close to my heart. In my maiden speech, I spoke on how poker machines might be regulated in the community and this has been an issue that I have spoken on in the House many times since. So it is a great honour and pleasure to speak on the tabling of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform's report in the House.


It was an honour to work with the committee, particularly with the member for Denison and Senator Nick Xenophon. I think they have done a good job in putting this issue in the public's mind and to the forefront of the business of this parliament. So I hope that the report is read and considered by members and that it helps form a policy response for members.


Great damage is done by poker machines, electronic gaming machines, in our community. If you take the time to meet with people who have become addicted to these machines, you hear a lot of stories about the hardship and sorrow for the victims of these machines: the addicts, and their families, as well as the people around them. We know that one in six Australians who regularly plays these machines becomes addicted to them. We know that on average they lose $21,000 a year. We know that the losers, the addicts, contribute about 40 per cent of the $12 billion in profits that are generated by these machines. Nearly $5 billion is poured into these machines by problem gamblers.


I have seen the damage done by these machines in my own electorate, which I have outlined to the House. I have a treatment service in Salisbury, and I can tell you that some of the people attending that treatment service lose a lot more than $21,000 in a year. The damage that is done by these machines demands a policy response. The two major reports by the Productivity Commission and this parliamentary report provide, I think, a strong foundation for a coherent policy response by this parliament. 


There are a number of important recommendations in this parliamentary report entitled The design and implementation of a mandatory pre-commitment system for electronic gaming machines. I would ask the House to pay particular attention to recommendations 2, 11 and 34, which look to having a national jurisdiction for the regulation of these machines, the harmonisation of the standards—the so-called national standard—and also a national research capability. We simply do not regulate these machines appropriately, and we simply do not research their effects enough. Recommendation 12, which outlines our commitment to a pre-commitment system, is particularly important, as is recommendation 23, which outlines the committee's strong support for a self-exclusion scheme that will help addicts exclude themselves from playing these machines when they do not want to. It effectively allows them to bar themselves. I think recommendation 36, which recommends low-intensity machines, is a great step forward. It will do a lot of good in the community and prevent a lot of harm. Finally, recommendation 39 proves that the committee did listen to clubs and small venues and that it is aware of the very genuine concern that they would have trouble in the transition. The committee did listen to industry, to the addicts of these machines as well as to the social welfare organisations.


In conclusion, it has been a great privilege for me to be deputy chair of the committee. Again, I would like to thank the member for Denison for his very good work in chairing the committee. He was very fair to all members of the committee and ran a very good inquiry into this issue. 


This is a very important report for the parliament, as I said. It will receive the strong support of the government. I sincerely hope that the recommendations find strong support in this House, and I commend the report to it.

Australians will greet this decision with relief. The Australian government welcomes this decision by the Supreme Court. It is a bipartisan policy in this country that we oppose the death penalty.

There are, of course, two other Australians on death row in Indonesia, and Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran have also launched judicial appeals against their death sentences. We will continue to provide consular support to both men and their families.

Scott Rush was a young man, aged 19, at the time. It was his first visit to Bali, but he had a somewhat troubled past. If ever a lesson was needed for people to understand that, whatever we might think of the judicial system or the penalties in place, we must abide by the laws of other countries then this is it. I note that at the time of his sentencing Scott Rush put up on a website these words:




I apologise for bringing shame on Indonesia and Australia, my parents, family and friends. I am very, very sorry for my actions. I know many people have been hurt by illegal drugs, such as my parents, and people who take illegal drugs, and I am so sorry. I did say all this publicly in court.




He is a young man who has learned a very harsh lesson. Our thoughts are with his family and his friends. However harsh it may seem to Australians, we welcome this decision of the Indonesian courts.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (17:48):  I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. The coalition, as indicated by the shadow Treasurer, largely support the bill but we have reserved our right to move some amendments at a later time and in another place. We support the bill because it implements some of the recommendations made by the Productivity Commission in its recent inquiry into executive remuneration in Australia, which reported on 14 January 2010. It was one of the myriad reports and inquiries that the Labor government has implemented since it came to office in November 2007. 


Of course, talking on a financial bill on budget day is a coincidence. I note to the House that tonight we will see some of the consequences of the Labor Party's mismanagement of Australia's finances and Australia's budget situation when we see, in just a couple of hours, one of the biggest deficits ever laid down in this place.


It is a concern any time the Labor Party moves any sort of regulation in this space because we see that when they move into this space they do not do it well. The action usually has more of a consequence than was intended in regard to the problem that they are seeking to solve. 


The coalition understands that there is broad community concern about executive remuneration, particularly during the bank reporting season. In some respects I understand that the numbers paid to some top executives are beyond community expectations. It should not surprise anyone that those concerns are raised through the media, through our offices and through discussions at community forums around the place. However, there is always a danger in this game that we identify problems without any reasonable expectation that we can solve them. It is easy to play the politics of envy and it is easy to do the 'us versus them', but we do our constituents a grand disservice if we raise expectations of fixing a problem we cannot ever realistically address. The truth is that company directors and the shareholders of companies make decisions on how much they pay their executives, their CEOs and their staff. 


The other fact of the matter is that we are part of a global economy and we have to compete for labour and skills at all levels. And this is one of the areas in which we have to compete for skills. So we do need to be careful, in some of the contributions from members opposite, that we are raising expectations in the community that these amendments will massively change the way that these salaries are brought about and the amounts that do seem at times to be beyond community expectations, because the fact is that even with these changes we are not going to see smaller executive remuneration in the very near future. In fact, I would hazard a guess that this year we will see some quite extraordinary amounts of money paid to individuals based on the performances of their companies. In particular, as we have a very strongly performing mining sector, we are going to see some very large amounts paid to people involved in it. The government is not going to stop that, and constituents in my electorate will understand that the government and, for that matter, those of us on this side do not seek to do so. What we do seek to do is empower shareholders more, particularly when the Productivity Commission, whose work I have a very high regard for, is making some sensible recommendations on how we do that. The recommendations in this bill, as I said at the beginning of my contribution, in large part are recommendations that the coalition can and will support in amending the bill.


I referred to the politics of envy that those on the other side occasionally like to play on these matters—the raising of 'us versus them' because it is cheap and easy politics to get a run out of. Recently we saw a very bad example of that. The Treasurer, who will shortly deliver the budget, a budget in which he is handing down a $50 billion deficit to add to our massively building debt, a month or so ago made some ill-informed and unfortunate comments in the media in relation to the payment structure for the Governor of the Reserve Bank. I know there have been people on my side of politics who have been critical of some of the actions of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, but while those on the other side like to pat themselves on the back for their management of the economy during the global financial crisis I think there is little doubt that Glenn Stevens, through the actions that he took through monetary policy, played a very significant role in ensuring that Australia survived the worst of the global financial crisis. He has had a very well thought through and clearly set direction in the way in which he has managed Australia's monetary policy in recent years, and it was a big mistake to raise the issues in relation to his salary, given the amounts that people who are managing similar institutions are paid in his industry not just in Australia but also around the world. The governor goes about his job in a very competent fashion and he does what we in this parliament ask him to do, which is manage Australia's monetary policy. He does an excellent job particularly within the band of inflation. It was very ill-informed of the Treasurer to go down the populist road and raise those issues just a few weeks ago in a 'politics of envy' style. Unfortunately, it was what we have come to expect from a man who should really be focusing on how to bring the Australian fiscal position back to a much more reasonable position. If the Treasurer did his job half as well as the Governor of the Reserve Bank does we probably would not be seeing some of the numbers in tonight's budget.


As I said at the beginning of my contribution, the coalition largely supports the direction of this bill. We will have some concerns in the Senate, which the shadow Treasurer so ably, as usual, outlined in his contribution to this place some time ago, back in March. Amendments to the bill will be well thought through and well-considered. It is a bill which seeks to empower, largely, shareholders. It seeks to make some changes around voting. It seeks to make some changes in relation to remuneration consultants. I understand that the member for Mitchell reflected on those earlier, which seemed to start up the comical contribution of the member for Blair; it got him a little bit worked up earlier. The bill deals with the hedging of incentive remuneration. It deals with the declarations of no vacancies at annual general meetings. It deals with the way that proxies and remuneration reports are dealt with and with recommendations out of the Productivity Commission, which should be taken seriously. I do not think there is any doubt about the quality of the work that the Productivity Commission does for the Australian public; it is always there. 


In those respects the coalition is broadly supportive of this bill and will not oppose it, but we will be seeking to make some changes at a later time.


Debate adjourned.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-05-10,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (17:48):  I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. The coalition, as indicated by the shadow Treasurer, largely support the bill but we have reserved our right to move some amendments at a later time and in another place. We support the bill because it implements some of the recommendations made by the Productivity Commission in its recent inquiry into executive remuneration in Australia, which reported on 14 January 2010. It was one of the myriad reports and inquiries that the Labor government has implemented since it came to office in November 2007. 


Of course, talking on a financial bill on budget day is a coincidence. I note to the House that tonight we will see some of the consequences of the Labor Party's mismanagement of Australia's finances and Australia's budget situation when we see, in just a couple of hours, one of the biggest deficits ever laid down in this place.


It is a concern any time the Labor Party moves any sort of regulation in this space because we see that when they move into this space they do not do it well. The action usually has more of a consequence than was intended in regard to the problem that they are seeking to solve. 


The coalition understands that there is broad community concern about executive remuneration, particularly during the bank reporting season. In some respects I understand that the numbers paid to some top executives are beyond community expectations. It should not surprise anyone that those concerns are raised through the media, through our offices and through discussions at community forums around the place. However, there is always a danger in this game that we identify problems without any reasonable expectation that we can solve them. It is easy to play the politics of envy and it is easy to do the 'us versus them', but we do our constituents a grand disservice if we raise expectations of fixing a problem we cannot ever realistically address. The truth is that company directors and the shareholders of companies make decisions on how much they pay their executives, their CEOs and their staff. 


The other fact of the matter is that we are part of a global economy and we have to compete for labour and skills at all levels. And this is one of the areas in which we have to compete for skills. So we do need to be careful, in some of the contributions from members opposite, that we are raising expectations in the community that these amendments will massively change the way that these salaries are brought about and the amounts that do seem at times to be beyond community expectations, because the fact is that even with these changes we are not going to see smaller executive remuneration in the very near future.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (20:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012, is one of the principal pieces of legislation underpinning the government's budget.


Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012 proposes appropriation for agencies to meet:


payments direct to local government, and some national partnership payments through the states, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory;


requirements for departmental equity injections; and


requirements to create or acquire administered assets and to discharge administered liabilities.


Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012 seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund totalling $7.396 billion.


Appropriation Bill 1 and Appropriation Bill 2 include a one-off contingency clause apportioning the appropriation for the Department of Human Services between the Department of Human Services, Centrelink and Medicare Australia should the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 not receive the royal assent by 30 June 2011. This will enable the three agencies to continue operating from 1 July 2011 until the legislation receives the royal assent. Importantly, these clauses will not change the total amount appropriated by the bills.


Bill 2 also provides for amendments to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911. The amendments will increase the limit on the face value of stock and securities on issue to $250 billion and repeal the special circumstances provision. These amendments provide for the government's financing requirements over the forward estimates and ensure flexibility in implementing the government's objectives for maintaining a liquid and efficient Commonwealth government securities market. 


In addition, amendments to the CIS Act will establish two special appropriations. One is for the costs and expenses incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the issue or sale of stock and the other is for the costs and expenses incurred by the repurchase and redemption of stock prior to maturity. These special appropriations are intended to provide greater flexibility in managing the debt portfolio and thereby support the efficient management of the government's debt portfolio.


These amendments increase the legislative limit on Commonwealth government securities issuance and borrowings as well as establishing two special appropriations for borrowing and debt management activities.


Details of the proposed appropriations are set out in schedule 2 to the bill, the main features of which were outlined in the budget speech delivered by my colleague the Treasurer earlier this evening.


I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Mr Fletcher
  asked the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 20 October 2010:


In respect of the roll out of the Government's National Broadband Network in Tasmania, and a statement on National Broadband Network Tasmania's website that the: 'port on the [Network Termination Unit] into which an end user plugs their equipment is a standard Ethernet 10/100Base T interface': (1) does this reflect the interface that is actually being provided; (2) if so, how does this reconcile with the statements by this company and the Government that the network will provide speeds of up to one gigabyte per second, when the use of the interface described would limit speeds actually delivered into homes to no more than 100 megabytes per second.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-05-10,"



Mr Albanese:
  The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:


(1) A standard NEC manufactured Ethernet 10/100Base T interface Network Termination Unit (NTU)  has been used in Tasmania for the stage 1 'pre release' rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) in that State. Stage 1 of the rollout was designed to test network planning and construction techniques under different conditions.


(2) NBN Co Limited is purchasing Alcatel-manufactured Ethernet 10/100/1000Base T interfaces for the rollout of the NBN nationally. This NTU is capable of supporting speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. 


Premises in Tasmania currently connected to the NBN via a standard NEC NTU will be progressively migrated to the Alcatel NTU, meaning that all premises in Tasmania connected to the NBN fibre network will have access to speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second.
