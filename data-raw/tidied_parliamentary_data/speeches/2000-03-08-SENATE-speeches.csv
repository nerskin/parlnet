"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-03-08,"—When the Senate rose last night, I was summing up the second reading debate on the Navigation Amendment (Employment of Seafarers) Bill 1998. I was indicating that, whilst I expect little better from the Labor Party, captive as they are to the unions—most of the Labor senators are here only because of the support of the unions; an ever decreasing element in our society these days as people realise that the unions really do not have a lot to contribute—I was disappointed at the Democrats' level of involvement in this bill.
The government is trying to achieve a modern and efficient waterfront for the good of Australia. To do that, we rely on public servants, on people who have knowledge of the industry to look through it and work their way through it. They look at the facts and the arguments in an independent way. Our advisers have no particular interest except to make the industry much better, more efficient and more modern for the benefit of Australia. 
I have been told by Mr Anderson, the minister, that we have offered the Democrats a briefing not from Mr Anderson's office and not from me, but from the public servants, the bureaucrats, the department who understand this issue. They could go through the legislation with the Democrats and explain what each clause means, why it is there, what the pros of the proposal are, what the cons of the proposal are and let the Democrats understand just what it is all about in a calm and rational way. 
Regrettably, the Democrats have not taken us up on that offer of consultation. That is a shame. I repeat the offer to Senator Greig—I know he is relatively new here—that the bureaucrats are available not to convince you one way or the other, not to run a line, but to simply answer your questions, to explain why various provisions are there and to let you understand what the facts are so you can make a decision. Regrettably, Senator Greig and the Democrats did not avail themselves of the offer of some independent advice and they have sought advice elsewhere. I do not know, but I can only assume from Senator Greig's speech in the second reading debate that his source of advice was the Maritime Union of Australia.
We are fairly well aware of the Maritime Union of Australia's reputation. Perhaps they do some good work, but they have a bit of a reputation. They have a major influence on the Labor Party and its senators in this chamber. They are there desperately seeking to maintain their position in society as the rest of the Australian society understands that unions are becoming more and more irrelevant because of the way they have approached things. The union bosses are determined to maintain their power as much as possible.
I note that Senator Greig expressed some disappointment at the majority committee report where those sorts of sentiments were expressed. Senator Greig, this is the real world. That is what it is about. The report of the majority of the committee is, in that regard, worthy of consideration. You obviously considered it and rejected it. Can I say to you that you have to get your advice from places elsewhere than that. 
I am aware that Senator Greig's background is relatively maritime. You understand what it is like around the wharves, as I recall from your maiden speech. Can I suggest to you that, as well as talking to the Maritime Union of Australia, you should perhaps get some other advice. You do not have to take it. You do not have to be swayed by arguments, but at least get the facts right. I regret to say, from the things you have said in your speech at the second reading stage, that it is fairly clear that your consultation has been limited.  
I do not say that in a critical way. What I am saying to you, Senator Greig, and your colleagues is, `Please take some advice from the bureaucrats. Do not have Mr Anderson's office there, do not have me there, do not have my office there, but speak to the bureaucrats and understand what is being proposed and where some of the things the MUA have told you are simply not correct.' 
In the few minutes available to me, I want to go through some of the issues that Senator Greig mentioned in his speech which are factually incorrect. I mentioned briefly last night the articles of agreement. The Democrats are proposing that the articles of agreement system be retained because the Democrats are told and they believe that they provide a record of a seafarer's service at sea. The Democrats also believe that AMSA should supervise the articles of agreement process.
Senator Greig, the articles of agreement system was originally established to cover a casual employment situation on ships and it was an appropriate system for that situation. However, seafarers in Australia are now employed on a permanent basis, not a casual basis, under individual company employment agreements registered with the Industrial Relations Commission. Under these circumstances there is no longer any need for the old-style articles of agreement system or for AMSA to actually supervise these agreements. The Industrial Relations Commission is now the appropriate body to oversight seafarers' company employment arrangements. So that article of agreement system is old-fashioned. It may have served a purpose years and decades ago, but it is no longer relevant. 
There was an issue of crew handling of cargo. As I understand Senator Greig's speech, the Democrats do not support the removing of the restrictions on a ship's crew handling cargo because of safety considerations. That is what I understand he was saying—it was all related to safety considerations. The first point to note is that the Navigation Act, as it now stands, permits ships' crews to handle cargoes where there is not a sufficiency of shore labour. It is quite common for ships crews to handle cargo at small ports where there is no stevedoring labour available. That is already happening, Senator Greig. There are not safety considerations there—well, there are safety considerations but it is deemed to be done safely. So the suggestion that this provision has to apply because of safety considerations is just plain wrong. Whoever has told you that is telling you the wrong information obviously for the wrong reasons. 
The safety standards covering the loading and discharge of ships' cargoes apply equally to the ships' crews as they do to the shore labour. Again, it does not matter whether the ship's crew are doing it or whether shore labour is doing it, Senator Greig: the same standards, the same regulations, apply in a safety way. So safety is dealt with by other means, not by that particular provision. When it comes to container terminals with large shore side cargo handling equipment, the terminal operators employ their own permanent labour force trained to handle their equipment. They clearly do not want untrained staff from the ships jumping on board to handle that equipment. The suggestion that this approach by the Labor Party and the Maritime Union is the right one is simply not factual. The shore side cargo handling equipment is handled by professional people and the last thing the owners would want is untrained sea workers, ship board people, actually handling such equipment. 
The Marine Council was mentioned. As I understand the Democrats' position, the Marine Council was to be retained as an independent regulator of ship board employment arrangements. I am told, Senator Greig, that the Marine Council has not met in 12 months. It has nothing to do with the current dispute being heard by the Industrial Relations Commission. It is now the commission's role to exercise oversight of employment arrangements, not the Marine Council. I understand that the Marine Council has not met for 12 months but even before that I understand it met fairly infrequently. So if people were relying on the Marine Council to oversight employment arrangements, then it has not worked for many, many years, Senator Greig. It is not necessary and it is part of an antiquated system that really serves no purpose these days. For oversight of employment relations, it is the Industrial Relations Commission, not some strange hybrid group that rarely meets.  
I understand that the Democrats also were concerned to retain a prohibition on demands being made for seafarers to have to pay some third party to find them a job. If this is the case, the government would consider retaining such a prohibition, but we consider that it is quite appropriate for ship management companies that find crews for ships to be paid a fee by the relevant employer. This is the same situation that applies to shore employment agencies. That is the way the world is going today. Senator Greig, if you had a concern about that, if you were able to talk it through with the bureaucrats, if you had a point that was relevant, we would be prepared to have a look at that. But that is my understanding. You may have information that my bureaucrats and advisers do not have. If you have a point there and are genuinely concerned—I am sure you are genuinely concerned about it, although I suggest some of the information that has been given to you has not been quite as genuine—and if you are interested in pursuing that matter, I am quite happy to make the officers from the department available to talk it through with you. If there is some concern that we can address there, then we would be very happy to amend the legislation to comply with your requirements. 
The Democrats, as I understand, also want the current sick leave provisions to remain in the Navigation Act. I point out that these provisions are well in excess of the norm applying in other industries in Australia and can considerably add to the costs of Australian shipping companies. This, again, comes back to the question: do you want a modern, efficient and sustainable industry in Australia or do you really want to chase people out of the industry? We are not saying that the standards should be made worse than they are elsewhere; we are saying that the provisions that apply elsewhere in industry in Australia, and apply well elsewhere in industry in Australia, should equally apply to the shipping industry. The government believes that sick leave is a matter that should be left to the employer-employee negotiations and employees are free to have their unions represent them in such negotiations. We are always very happy with that.
Knowing the Maritime Union, they would be there. The suggestions that are conjured up of some poor little seafarer wandering along to the big company office and being belted around the head by the uncaring, profit grabbing shipping companies is simply something out of Dickens. These days the union would be there with them, negotiating those agreements and negotiating the sick leave provisions in a way that suits the industry but, importantly, suits the seafarer himself or herself. The government's view and the industry's view is that, to get a modern efficient industry, those sorts of provisions should not be in the Navigation Act, that they should be a matter for negotiation between the parties, and that all the parties should be properly represented in the negotiations.
Turning to the six-month voyage limit: I understand the Democrats want to retain the current restriction of six months on the length of time seafarers should be at sea without a break. Again, this is a provision that can add significantly to the cost of operating Australian ships, particularly when the six months expire and the ship is a long way from the seafarer's port. In some cases, this might happen when a ship is at a port at the opposite end of the world. There is a better way to do that. There is a better way, which, no doubt, we will go through in the committee stage, of overcoming that provision. It is the government's view that, in getting the ultimate goal of a more efficient and effective modern shipping industry that is good for Australia and is sustainable, those provisions should not be in the Navigation Act but should be a matter for arrangement and agreement elsewhere.
When this matter went through the House of Representatives, there were three amendments from the Labor Party which were debated and which we have come here to debate today. We found that, as the second reading speech started last night at 6.01, 14 new amendments were tabled. My understanding of those amendments is that they simply gut the bill and leave nothing to debate in the committee. 
—An irrelevant interjection, as usual, Senator.
—You just stick to your RTCs.
—Perhaps I could say to Senator Greig, now that you mention RTCs, that if you do have a question this question time on RTCs, could you please ask me.
—It was not Senator Greig who made that interjection.
—know it was not Senator Greig, but I am talking to him now. If the Democrats have a question about RTCs, please ask the right minister and you will get the answer. Anyhow, I am being diverted. Overnight, we have had a look at these amendments and we will deal with them in committee. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-03-08,"—I rise to speak to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1998 and the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998. What a mess the Australian censorship system is in today. A system which has been developed over a number of years, at length and in consultation and in cooperation with the states is now in a mess because of a rearguard party room revolt by a small number of excited and agitated National Party backbenchers, the self-proclaimers of morality in this country.
We have a scheme that was developed over years, particularly by the previous Labor government, a scheme that was adopted and adapted to some extent by the current government and a scheme that relies on a national approach built on cooperation with the states and after consultation with the states and passage of legislation in this parliament. It was a structure that was agreed to. A censorship board, which has been more independent in the past than it is at present, was set up to govern the operation of the scheme. But events of the last 24 hours have led to headlines in today's papers such as `Nats in X-rated censorship rebellion'. There has been a party room revolt as to the fundamental structures of the scheme.
It is important to note that good policy management is about ensuring a consultative outcome and approach, and this is what we have achieved in this area over a number of years. We have a national approach—we need a national approach, given our small population and the common borders that we all have in respect of the importation of films—which has been built on and depends on consultation and cooperation with the states. The government adopted that scheme. They have made only one small change, and that was to—sometime in the last 12 months—stack the censors.
In the last 24 hours we have seen an overruling of the censors. We have seen an ambush by excited, agitated National Party members who want the proposed classification `nonviolent erotica' to be `nonviolent pornography' or some other term that De-Anne Kelly in her wildest dreams may want to assign to this category of video. As a consequence, we have seen an undermining of the hapless Attorney-General, Daryl Williams. We have also seen, once again, a lack of leadership by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is missing in action in the debate. The Prime Minister has not been able to protect his Attorney-General and the scheme that the Attorney-General has been able to get through cabinet and has been able to get the states to agree to.
The Prime Minister believes in selective censorship. When it comes to those he wants to protect, as we discovered just a couple of years ago with Pauline Hanson and her mates, he turns a blind eye. He gives them cover. This is the Prime Minister who railed against censorship when he first came into office. When Pauline and her racists and bigots got out of the blocks, he was the one who said that he did not believe in censorship and that people had a right to express their views. But when it comes to views he does not like, censorship is on, even though it may mean an undermining of one of his senior ministers. We have a Prime Minister who has told us in the past that, in this community, you cannot call a racist a racist or a bigot a bigot. But you can call things like this what you like, and it does not matter that a consultative process over a number of years has led to another definition. When it comes to his cultural opponents, the Prime Minister offers no such defence of freedom of expression or freedom of people being able to see and read what they want to, subject to protection of minors, and so on.
We have had a backroom revolt by a small number of people. A small number of National Party members, De-Anne Kelly and her moral vigilantes, have taken over censorship in this country. You may as well now call De-Anne Kelly the Commonwealth Censor. One wonders what they will want to do next. One wonders why they have done this now. When you look at reports of the party room meeting, De-Anne Kelly says, `We've done this because my concern is that this is a softening up process to allow over-the-counter sales of these movies.' Is she afraid that the three movies that she put on for her small number of friends the other night, Transexual Adventures, Max Goes South and Black She-Men, will pop up on her local grocery store shelves? That will not happen under this scheme. A good appreciation of policy shows it will not happen. She will not get them in her local grocery store. She is afraid that something might happen and, as a consequence, we have derailed a nationally accepted scheme.
One wonders where this will go next. I am sure, given the creativity and imagination of De-Anne Kelly and her state of agitation, we may next have her advocating labels on videos reading, for instance, `Watching these videos could lead to blindness'. I say this because this is the ridiculous nature of the situation we are in at the moment. Censorship in this country, the Commonwealth Censor, has been supplanted by De-Anne Kelly and her band of merry National Party vigilantes.
I urge the government to apply some sense in this. I urge the government to take some lead from the Attorney-General, although he has been substantially undermined by this, and to acknowledge that they have a scheme that has been worked out in consultation with the states and a scheme that has to come through this parliament for amendment. In doing so, they should appreciate that what De-Anne Kelly may want and what John Howard may let through to the keeper while he is missing in action in the party room may not be acceptable to the rest of Australia.
In that context, it should also be of concern to us that, when Mrs Kelly decided on Monday night she wanted to see some nonviolent erotic videos, she did not go to Fyshwick like the rest of Canberra might. She went to the Attorney-General's office, and she was refused. She was refused because the view of the A-G's office was that this would constitute an unlawful public viewing.
So there has to be some real concern that we had an illegal act in this parliament on Monday night. It is not a brave thing to say. She put on a nonviolent erotic video for a small audience. The film night constituted, in the view of Mr Williams's office, an unlawful public viewing. Crimes can be committed in this parliament, Senator Heffernan—you know that. They can be committed in this parliament, and there has to be some concern as to whether what she did the other night constitutes an unlawful public viewing. It is obvious that this is the case in the assessment of the Attorney-General and his office, and it is something which I think the Attorney should look into further. This is the state of censorship.
In the legislation before us today, we have an attempt by the federal government to implement a 1997-98 budget commitment to provide full cost recovery for the classification services provided by the Office of Film and Literature Classification to apply from 1 July 1998. As an interim measure commencing on 1 November, the government introduced regulations to increase the relevant classification charges. An attempt was made to disallow these fees in the Senate, but at the time Senator Harradine supported the government and Senator Colston abstained. The regulations were projected to raise some $1.2 million per year. The government originally also introduced these two bills in the House of Representatives on 27 November 1997. The bills passed the House of Representatives but lapsed when the parliament was prorogued for the 1998 election. With one minor exception, the 1998 bills are substantially the same as the 1997 bills. The bills seek to further implement the measure announced in the government's 1997-98 budget and, if passed, they are expected to increase the revenue of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, and of the government, by some $2.15 million per year. The government has already indicated that if the bills are not passed, it will seek to alter the financial arrangements of the office to ensure its financial position. 
The first issue we need to address is the question of the bills imposing a tax. Whilst the bills claim to be imposing a charge, they in fact seek to impose a tax under section 55 of the Constitution. The government has received constitutional advice that it cannot otherwise include the full cost recovery of the ancillary services provided by the office in determining the appropriate level of the charges to be paid by those seeking the classification of publications, films and computer games. These ancillary services, as we have come to appreciate over recent estimates and other hearings, include such matters as research, policy development, ministerial support and payments to the states and territories for enforcement and related purposes. This is because, under the constitutional principles laid down by the High Court in the Air Caledonia International v. the Commonwealth case, for a charge to be lawfully classified as a fee for service rather than as a tax, the fee must bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of providing the service. The fact that the government is seeking to recover the cost of these ancillary services by imposing a tax is indeed an admission on its part that these charges do not in fact bear a legally sufficient relationship to the cost of the actual service provided to the industry, namely the classification of publications, films and computer games. The Labor Party believe that it is inappropriate to charge industry for the public interest functions performed by the office. We believe classification is a matter of genuine community, not just commercial, benefit. It is therefore appropriate that industry meet the cost of classification while government meets the cost of the related public interest functions.
We also have real concern about the effect of these charges on independent and small film-makers. The Attorney noted in his second reading speech that the level of the charges had been agreed following consultation with industry. To this end, the government appointed Ernst & Young to review the charge structure. What the Attorney omitted to state is that, despite having had only a few days in which to lodge their objections to the proposed fee structure, independent and smaller film producers have vigorously opposed the new charges. This is because it is the small, independent producers and publishers who will be hardest hit by these new fees. The fees for classifying a publication, film or computer game are levied on a one-off basis. For example, once a film has been classified, all identical prints of the film are also deemed to have been classified. In this context, large commercial distributors of films are therefore able to absorb the increased costs of classifying a film, given the considerable revenues generated from the multiple copies of the film distributed to cinemas across the country.
However, for the small and independent film-makers, those who already operate on limited budgets and who may be in a position to distribute only one or two prints of the film, the fee is the same but the increased cost as a proportion of the overall cost of production is quite considerable. As a result, the enactment of this bill will make it even harder for small and independent distributors to service niche markets and, in particular, to encourage the development of the creative talents of young and upcoming Australian film-makers. The Attorney has claimed that these charges would have little impact on new and small film-makers because film festivals are generally exempted from these fees. It is very obvious that he does not understand that film-making in Australia has developed enormously and film-makers have to prove themselves in the commercial market before major film studios, distributors or film festivals pick them up. 
The level of the fees also gives rise to concern about the level of compliance with Australia's classification system. The shadow Attorney has been advised by industry sources that the level of compliance with the system has dropped since the fee increases of 1997. The office stated at the Senate estimates that it was not aware of these concerns. It also noted that it had not been looking at such a trend. Rather, it pointed to the excellent work that is done by the community liaison office in seeking to encourage increased compliance. But if the trend is indeed true, as industry claims it is, then it has to be a worrying trend. Public interest is best served not by a community liaison officer but by industry complying with the laws. I think it is something that needs to attract the Attorney's attention and the attention of his officers. If increased fees are indeed resulting in an increased number of rogue operators on the fringe of the system, then they are neither in the interests of the government nor in the interests of the public. Public interest is clearly best served by maximum compliance with the scheme.
The question of varying the tax also comes up in this legislation. The charges bill provides that the level of the taxes can be varied by way of regulation. The government argues that this is necessary because the charges will have to be regularly adjusted with a view to the cost structure of the office. However, this also gives the government considerable flexibility to increase the relevant charges so that they bear no relationship to the future cost structure of the office. Therefore, they cease to be a cost recovery measure, even in the grossly expanded term, which is used by the government in this legislation. In effect, what the bills do is allow the imposition of potentially punitive taxes on publication, film and computer game industries, with only subsequent Senate disallowance as a possible check on government excesses. We believe that this situation is not acceptable as it enables the government to increase taxes at its whim.
Part 1 of the amendment bill also removes some formal requirements in making application for classification of material and for the investigation and prosecution of an offence. These amendments overcome the failure of two prosecutions in 1997, which occurred due to lack of compliance with all the formal requirements. We support these amendments.
There is only one difference between the 1998 bill and the 1997 bill. That relates to subsection 91(1) of the 1998 amendment bill which, if it is in the public interest to do so, permits the director to waive, in whole or in part, the classification charges for limited distribution of special interest material which comprises a documentary record of an event or which is of a cultural or like manner. It is estimated that only about 100 films per year will be excluded on this basis, and the cost to budget will be some $54,000. It is a very limited exemption. It is not the broad exemption that the Attorney sought to portray in the House of Representatives. It will not provide a sufficient mechanism for small independent distributors of films to get exemptions for their works. It would not allow, for example, religious institutions to seek an exemption for films within a religious context. However, it does address the problems experienced by a very particular niche in the market. Once again, the Labor Party supports this.
Consistent with our stance on the 1997 bills, Labor will continue to oppose the charges bill. We will support those amendments contained in the amendment bills which improve the enforcement of this area of law, but we will be moving amendments to the amendment bill to remove references to the imposition of charges. This will allow the amendment bill to operate independently of the charges bill.
So I indicate that there are a number of amendments. They are large in number, but they all amount to achieving this particular purpose. I will be seeking to move them all together in the committee stage, if that is procedurally possible. I would say once again that we do and we will continue to oppose the charges regime proposed by the government, but the other parts of the legislation we can accept.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-03-08,"—I would echo the preamble to Senator Bolkus's speech in the second reading debate by expressing too my alarm at the state of censorship in Australia, particularly with the way in which in the last 12 to 24 hours we have seen a strange scuttling of proposed legislation that has been in the pipeline for so long and which has undergone such thorough consultation and which has cooperative cross-party support. It concerns me that such a scuttling can take place by such a small group of what I consider to be unrepresentative people. I would go further than Senator Bolkus. I would argue that it is not simply members of the National Party who have managed to bring about this effect; I fear too the shadowy hand of the Christian Right whose sinister, I think, influence is so dominant in America—and there has been much reportage of that in recent weeks in terms of the preselection battles between the presidential candidates in the States. I fear that that dominance will grow here in Australia also.
However, I will go back to the bills at hand. We are not debating NVE at this point in time but the classification of such matters. In essence, these bills are about taxation. There are some other amendments, which will attract the support of the Australian Democrats. However, what we are in essence talking about here is the imposition of a tax on freedom of speech and, in those terms, democracy itself. When these bills were first proposed around 1998, the Australian political landscape was a very different place. Senator Harradine and former Senator Colston held the effective balance of power in the Senate and conservatives and, as some unkind people have suggested, wowsers had the ear of government. At that time the ANTS package had not passed this parliament. So to my mind, one must question how this new film, literature and computer games tax is meant to now fit into the government's new tax package.
The current bills are stated as being a reflection of an ongoing application of cost recovery by successive coalition and Labor governments. In terms of the rhetoric of economic fundamentalism, these bills fall under the nominal heading of `user pays'. As stated in the Office of Film and Literature Classification annual report of 1997-98:
A subsequent decision however taken by the government in the context of the 1996 budget required the OFLC to achieve cost recovery for its entire operation including the services provided to government and to the community.
The Australian Democrats support a legitimate role by the federal government in classifying material in the public domain. We also support a vibrant and robust environment where freedom of expression is promoted and protected within the context of respect for, and adherence to, appropriate community domains. The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1998 and the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998 fail to take into account these principles. Furthermore, the bills fail to establish a system of classification that is workable, competitive and responsive to the community's expectation of an efficient system of grading and classifying visual material in the public domain.
The Australian Democrats believe that it is the public responsibility of government to provide a system of efficient, unbiased and cost effective classification to industry and consumers. We do not believe it is the role of industry to fund the classification system in this country. The Parliamentary Library's Bills Digest outlines the legislative history of the current bills. These bills replace the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1997, which passed the House of Representatives on 4 December 1997, having been introduced on 26 November 1997. The previous bill was introduced into the Senate on 4 December 1997, but not debated further. It then lapsed when the election was called on 31 August 1998. 
The new bill contains one significant change from the earlier bill. It concerns the power of the Director of the Classification Board to waive the whole or part of the charges for classification of material that has limited market appeal. This change has been made following concerns expressed by independent film makers about the possible inequity of the new charges.  
The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995—that is, the principal act—is part of a Commonwealth, state and territory cooperative legislative scheme for the classification of publications, films and computer games and enforcement of classification decisions made under it. That act established the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board on 1 January 1996 and provides the procedures for the classification of material. 
It is clear that the classification amendment and charges bills were conceived by the government at a time prior to the development of the series of bills presented before the Senate, variously known as a new tax system. The Democrats believe that, in light of the new tax system, which at various times the government has described as being a replacement for superfluous charges and taxes, there is an apparent inconsistency between the government's stated objective and the concept of creating a new tax system. 
Notwithstanding that, the Australian Democrats remain concerned that, until the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquired into this bill, there appears to have been little or no consultation with industry groups and bodies towards the appropriate or even alternate cost recovery structures necessary to give effect to a workable and affordable system of classification. I remain concerned that the Ernst and Young and the KPMG reports, on which these bills are purportedly based, appear not to have been released for public dissemination. If that has occurred, I apologise to the minister. However, the fact remains that the report was not released before these bills were drafted. 
Evidence from the Commonwealth Attor-ney-General's Department to the Senate hearing suggests an extensive consultation process: 
The time for turning this around was tight, but we engaged Ernst & Young and there was a report to the Attorney-General's Department, which reported in March. This is dated 3 April, but I think the submissions cut off on 23 March. What it did, according to this, was write to everyone who had used the OFLC services in the previous two years. That should have covered some of the people today that said they were not. There was a very tight two week timetable to put in the initial submissions. There were several meetings with interested people. 
However, in evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitution Legislation Committee, Mr Stephen Bladwell, a partner of Ernst and Young and representative of the Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia, Village Roadshow and Fox Film Distributors, had the following to say upon an invitation to comment from Senator Cooney, who asked: 
Are there any comments you would care to make about some parts of it?
He was referring there to the Ernst and Young report. Mr Bladwell replied: 
I know what it is about. A partner of mine, Colin White who is a specialist accountant was requested to do a review. That review was very limited in scope and it really did not address—and was specifically required not to address—the overall increases in the charges, nor was it allowed to address the correctness or otherwise of trying to recover costs. What we are saying to your committee now is that our first and foremost charge is that the whole bill is flawed. That is something that Colin White was not required to do. Indeed he was specifically required not to do it, that is, address the nature of the charge. The second point we are making to you is that the fee is excessive, again that was something that Colin White was not allowed to address. 
I think that really says it all. I am indebted to Senator Cooney for his continued insightful questioning at Senate committee hearings, as indeed I am to my colleague Senator Bartlett, who presented the Democrats' report to the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. 
It appears that the government has proceeded to drafting legislation based on a report that did not address the fundamental questions of classification. In fact, the submission from the Screen Producers Association of Australia on `A new tax system' summarised their concerns by stating: 
SPAA submits that in the short to medium term, the overall impact of these charges may lead to a downturn in film and television production levels. This could give rise to unemployment within the industry, reduced opportunities for Australian creative talent and affect Australian cultural identity.  
At the very least, A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Bill 1998 will impose significant pressures on an industry that functions with skeletal corporate/organisational structures and limited resources. This is not to plead for exceptional treatment in a concession tax system. Rather we seek special assistance to see this important industry through the early stages of the GST's implementation thus ensuring the viability of Australian film and television production. 
In conclusion, the Democrats will not support the charges bill and the correlating sections in the amendment bill. I foreshadow our support for the amendments as circulated by the opposition. 
Freedom and responsibility of speech and publication is an important democratic tenet which should always be debated with balance in mind. For too long in this country people who disagree with explicit depictions of sexual expression have held to ransom the hearts, minds and tastes of those adults who are bestowed with a freedom of expression and opinion. That should be their birthright as Australians. If democracy is to have real meaning, then it must be based on respect for the diversity that is the human family. 
In closing I would like to quote the words of our current Attorney-General: 
The government is aware that some members of the community who find the portrayal of sexually explicit material on video tape offensive are unhappy with the government's decision not to ban this material. While the government understands and accepts these views, there is a need to approach this issue from a general community perspective. 
I concur with those sentiments and express the Democrats' support for the Attorney-General's balanced view on these matters. Given that it is my intention to support the first aspect of this legislation and not the latter, I would ask that when we get to the second reading vote on this they be moved separately.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES)AMENDMENT BILL 1998CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS,FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) CHARGES BILL 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2000-03-08,"—I listened a few minutes ago to Senator Bolkus, who came into this chamber and made some very serious accusations and was very aggressive in his comments towards the National Party on the topic of hard-core pornography. 
—You blokes had a special showing for it. Best turn-up you have ever had, I suppose. 
—Senator Schacht, you are quite entitled to join this debate after. What, in effect, happened yesterday was not an overturning of some sort of a position that the government took—
 (Senator Murphy)—Order! Senator Schacht and Senator Heffernan, your comments and actions are disorderly. You know the Senate rules and I ask you to desist from interrupting Senator Boswell. 
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. What happened yesterday was democracy at work when a group of representatives—not only National Party representa-tives but also many women in the Liberal Party—responded to the concerns raised by De-Anne Kelly. I do not want to be the deep throat of the coalition party room. But let me say this: this is democracy at work and that is a position that is taken by our members. 
A party room—certainly the coalition's party room—is where the cabinet and the Prime Minister listen to the concerns of the members of parliament and the senators who represent constituencies right across Australia. In effect, what happened was that a very strong case was presented by not only De-Anne Kelly and National Party members but also Liberal members—and I will say that most of them were Liberal women members of parliament—who said to the executive, `We don't want to go this far.' The Prime Minister has responded. That is democracy. Do not come in here and say that the Prime Minister is not showing leadership. The Prime Minister is showing leadership. He is responding to the members of parliament who are responding to the electorate. 
The National Party represents many families throughout this country who do not want to see society move towards accepting hard-core pornography. We are quite proud to be standing up for those families and we do it with every forum that is available to us. We believe in labelling—whether it is labelling pornography or labelling produce. If a thing is pornography, it should be labelled pornography, not nonviolent erotica—it is nonviolent pornography. I give full marks to De-Anne Kelly, who presented this to the party room. That is her duty and she did it very well. That is why we have rating systems. We should not be naming something that is X-rated pornography as nonviolent erotica. We know at the moment these particular videos cannot be sold over the counter and that they can be obtained only from Canberra and the Northern Territory. I remember when former Senator Bjelke-Petersen was here she actually named Canberra as `Pornberra'. That is where the pornography is coming from. 
—Get stuck into the Liberal government in Canberra. They tax it. They make money out of it. They are not going to close it down. 
—Senator Schacht, your actions and interjections are out of order. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, can you control Senator Schacht? 
—Senator Boswell, I am. A senator sitting on my right is not helping matters either. I have asked them both once to desist from interjections that are disorderly.
—The National Party has a proud record of standing up for these social and moral issues. There are many Australians, beyond the trendy lefties, who applaud us for doing so. That is what we are here to do. We are elected by constituencies to come down here and be their voice in this place, and that is exactly what we are doing. 
I would have thought that on this International Women's Day Senator Bolkus would give some attention to many women who find these videos absolutely degrading. I would have thought that he would have shown more sensitivity on International Women's Day than getting up and defending in this place pornographic videos. It was a masterpiece in mistiming that he would do this on International Women's Day. Surely he could have thought of the number of women who take a violent reaction against these sorts of videos. 
I am absolutely proud of what the National Party and members of the Liberal Party did yesterday. They stood up for what they believed was incorrect and then presented a very strong argument to the Prime Minister, and he listened to their argument. So do not come in here and say that that is not democracy. Maybe you just go through the charade of having a party meeting—you all stand up and say what you think and the executive of the Labor Party take absolutely no notice of the advice that they get from members of parliament. That may be why you are in opposition and you will probably be there for a good many more years. A government that is responsible to the people takes note of what representatives of the constituencies are telling their executive, and that is exactly what happened yesterday. So the Prime Minister cannot be accused of weakness. If anything, he showed great strength in standing up for what the people said—

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-03-08,"—I would like to raise before the Senate the matter of the government's budget approach when it first came into government in 1996. While much has been reported on the government's reforms—such as industrial relations, which led to the reform of the waterfront; social welfare, which led to the tightening up of social welfare, making it more responsible and accountable; and, of course, in the area of taxation, major tax reform which is under way—it is worthy to note, and for future governments to note, four other major reforms that this government has brought in. They are in the area of budget, fiscal and monetary reporting, bringing a new discipline, responsibility, accountability and transparency to government and to government accounts. These are important words in relation to our democracy and how a government runs and uses taxpayers' funds. 
I will go through the four major reforms. Firstly, the government's Charter of Budget Honesty, which was brought in to coincide with the government's first budget of 1996. The main purpose of the Charter of Budget Honesty was to provide for an improvement in fiscal policy outcomes by providing a framework for the conduct of the government's fiscal policy. So the bill, made law, requires the publication, once a general election is called, of a pre-election report setting out the fiscal and economic outlook. The bill also provides that, once a general election has been called, the government or the opposition may request the secretaries to the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration to prepare costings of any of its publicly announced policies and for the publication of such costings. The request from the opposition must be made through the Prime Minister of the day.
The Charter of Budget Honesty came about from the National Commision of Audit, commissioned by this government. Its findings were based on requiring governments to state their objectives and assessed fiscal policy outcomes against established benchmarks, which will contribute towards enhancing fiscal transparency and accountability. The fiscal responsibility legislation, in the form of the Charter of Budget Honesty, was the outcome and made law. The background to the introduction of this bill was summed up by the Treasurer in his budget speech on 20 August 1996. To quote him:
Before its election defeat on 2 March, the previous Government maintained that the budget would now be in underlying balance. The truth was it was $10 billion to the contrary.
Fiscal dishonesty of that sort of magnitude undermines public confidence in our political system. The Charter of Budget Honesty restores that confidence not just for this government but for all future governments. The charter will require any future government to set out a fiscal strategy and report against it. The charter will entrench this government's commitment to responsible and accountable fiscal policy. Also, from the Charter of Budget Honesty, reform No. 2 outlines the requirement to produce a midyear economic and fiscal economic outlook report: a report to the nation of the government's finances, measured up against the reality and the government's budget. I have before me that midyear report. It has to be brought down before January each year. This one was brought down in November 1999. It says in its foreword:
The 1999-2000 mid-year economic and fiscal outlook has been prepared in accordance with the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998. The Charter requires that the Government provide a report by the end of January each year which provides updated information to allow the assessment of the Government's fiscal performance against its fiscal strategy.
Again, it is an accountability measure for this government and future governments. It provides an overview of the fiscal outlook. It discusses the economic forecasts which underpin the expenses, capital and revenue estimates of a government. It provides details of the financial position and outlook. The report should provide details of the general government revenue estimates and provide details of the general government expenses and capital estimates. It is an extensive review of the government's management up to date. The report handed down in 1999 has been the fourth such document. This system of accountability and transparency is well and truly under way.
The third major reform that the government introduced in its very early days of government to bring about that accountability for this government and future governments—and I keep saying that because that is the importance of these reforms—was the Auditor-General's Bill 1996. I will repeat again: we have heard of the major reforms in tax, industrial relations and social welfare. These types of reforms are nitty-gritty. I want to make that point: they are basically uninteresting, very technical and very bureaucratic, but they will have, and have had, a profound effect upon the transparency of government, which can only strengthen, in the end, democracy. 
As I said, the third reform that this government introduced was the Auditor-General's Bill 1996. Again, it placed stronger and tougher discipline and scrutiny on governments, matching this government's call for responsibility for taxpayers' funds. The Auditor-General's Bill 1996 provided for the establishment of the Office of Auditor-General under the proposed new financial accounting regimes. So it was replacing the old Auditor-General's Act 1901. You can see what major change has occurred from just the difference in dates. The Auditor-General is now an independent officer of the parliament. That was the big change. Prior to that, the Auditor-General was an officer of the executive. He is now an officer of the parliament. He now has a more clearly defined role and powers with which he can act. In fact, he has greater independence than he had before.
The bill also provided for a range of statutory safeguards insulating the office from inappropriate interference by either the executive or the parliament, but the office is ultimately responsible to the parliament. The bill also created the Australian National Audit Office as an independent statutory body employing staff under the Public Service Act but with a capacity to contract out work where considered appropriate by the Auditor-General—a most important point. Together with the transitional provisions bill— which must have come through at the time of this bill—it makes provision for a wider role for the parliament in selecting the Auditor-General and in monitoring the performance of the Audit Office, therefore not just giving the minister of the day the sole power to appoint. Again, that diversifies more power to the parliament. It also re-establishes the Office of Independent Auditor, who is the parliament's auditor.
The fourth big change we made to the budget process and the reporting process of this government was in relation to the Reserve Bank, and a most significant change it was. It increased the accountability of the Reserve Bank and also its independence. It gave clear signals as to the responsibility of the executive with regard to monetary policy and the responsibilities of the Reserve Bank. No longer will we have, as we had in the previous government, a Reserve Bank Governor in the Treasurer's back pocket. That was the quote of the Treasurer of the day of a former government, that he had the Governor of the Reserve Bank in his back pocket. That really undermined the credibility of the Reserve Bank, the credibility of any of its decisions, when it was so closely linked to political decisions of the day. Here we have undertaken an agreement with the Reserve Bank and enhanced its independence. So there will not be a Governor of the Reserve Bank in any Treasurer's back pocket anymore. That single sentence used by former Treasurer Paul Keating really motivated this government to introduce this major reform.
The statement between the government and the Reserve Bank, as I said, sets out the policy that both must undertake separately and independently. It clarifies their responsibilities and roles, and the government recognises the independence of the bank. The framework of the objectives and of the signed agreement, exchange of letters, between the Reserve Bank and the government sets out that the Reserve Bank requires the board to conduct monetary policy in a way that, in the board's opinion, will best contribute to the objectives of (a) the stability of the currency of Australia, (b) the maintenance of full employment in Australia and (c) the economic prosperity and welfare of Australians. In addition, with a clearly defined inflation objective, it is important that the Reserve Bank report on how it sees developments in the economy, currently and in prospect, affecting expected inflation outcomes. So the Reserve Bank will set the inflationary targets, the band, and will act independent of governments in maintaining that inflation band. We have elevated the need to keep inflation down in this country, and we have given the Reserve Bank the responsibility to enact policy independent of any government to maintain that band of inflation, whatever it sees it at on the day.
In recent years, the Reserve Bank has also taken steps to conduct a far more public policy approach, making it more transparent. In fact, under the exchange of letters, it is required to come before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration. So twice a year the Reserve Bank Governor will come before the parliamentary committee to answer questions and to restate the policy of the Reserve Bank, making it clear not just for the markets but for the government and the Australian people. So the Reserve Bank is now far more independent and far more transparent. 
The final major reform to the budget, without doubt, has been in the area of accounting. Here we have the rather complex and hard to understand change of the accounting process from cash accounting—a most traditional form of accounting for governments, a very Westminster type of accounting for governments—to accrual accounting. We are one of the few governments in the world to change to accrual accounting. But we believe that others, including the United States, which has not yet changed, will follow suit because it brings greater accountability and transparency to government accounts.
It is a major change. It has been a major upheaval within the bureaucracies. They have tackled it well. If you think the GST is going to be hard to introduce, try introducing accrual accounting, after all these years, into the bureaucracy. It is most difficult but it has gone smoothly. To give credit to some degree to the previous government, they had those plans on the drawing boards and we have simply taken it up in government and enacted it. I will quote Mr John Fahey, the minister for finance, in a speech he made. He sets out to explain what accrual accounting is and what it does.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-03-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to questions without notice asked today, relating to the goods and services tax.
During the entire GST debate, the opposition made a number of comments concerning the new Howard GST. We said and still say that it is an inequitable and inefficient new tax which is bad for the economy. We said that the GST would unfairly impact upon low income earners, single income families, welfare recipients and pension recipients. We said that it would impact upon the entire community from birth to death. We repeatedly asserted—and there was mountains of evidence to the Senate committee—that there would be administrative inconvenience, a host of anomalies and huge compliance problems for small business. Indeed, almost every day new problems, additional anomalies and further conflicts arise. Problems with tampons, caravan parks, rounding up, non-business registration, exemptions for retailers and lengthy phase-in periods are simply passing examples of the problems created by the new GST.  
None of these issues is made up or beat up by the opposition. Out there in the Australian community there is fear, dread and even sheer terror at the prospect of the GST. The government is responsible for this fear and dread. Millions of Australians are now unequivocally opposed to the GST. Once they were prepared to consider it and now they are opposed to it unequivocally and remain so. My electorate office in Perth has been inundated with phone calls and thousands of replies to a survey on the impact of the GST. In the last month alone, my office has been contacted in writing by a staggering 2,033 persons in the electorate of Pearce who are opposed to and concerned about the impact of the GST. Their concerns are for their financial security as the affordability of essential items decreases with the introduction of this new tax. 
I will give you a summary of the thousands of written responses in that particular electorate. My constituents have raised a number of specific examples that cause them considerable anxiety, none of which has been attended to properly in recent months and all of which have been displayed in the press on repeated occasions. These include the imposition of a tax on women's hygiene products which has never been imposed in Australia's history. All previous governments have seen the fundamental rationale for exempting these items from taxation. Caravan park tenants and mobile home owners feel betrayed by this government which promised that no GST would be imposed upon them. Concerns have been expressed by low income earners, pensioners and self-funded retirees about the GST increasing the cost of everyday routine purchases. These increases will not be mitigated by the potential for savings on large one-off purchases, which they cannot afford, or by any inadequate, one-off compensation packages. Pensioners who can least afford it will pay the GST on food items more often than people in other sectors of the community as many live on pre-packaged food for ease of preparation, which has been the government's threshold for exemption of the tax. 
People make these complaints. These are the concerns that they have put in writing. These same pensioners, many of whom keep a pet, are understandably distressed that increases in the cost of pet food and veterinary services will deprive them of already rationed pension dollars. They say that the government's promise not to tax education rings hollow to parents faced with increased school costs for such sundry items as transport, clothing, sporting items, canteen food and excursions. Never in the history of Australia has the cost of education been so heavily taxed by any government.
Small business operators are concerned. They are writing that they are appalled at the government's laughable compensation payment for the significant costs which they will incur in becoming tax collectors for the government. Contrary to the government's widely publicised promise that the GST would replace all existing taxes, the fact remains, as we all know, that some items will not have existing excises removed before the GST is imposed.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2000-03-08,"—I can tell you that Senator Bishop is dead right: there is fear and dread out there in the community-real fear and dread. There is a fear and dread that by some mistake Labor might one day be returned to power. There is a fear and dread that the wage earners in the Australian community will not keep their tax cuts. That is what the fear and dread is about—fear and dread that the promised tax cuts, which the Howard government is going to deliver on 1 July, come the election of a Labor government would be rolled back, that they would be rolled back like the GST and rolled back like the income tax cuts. 
Yes, Senator Bishop there is fear and dread in the Australian community because the one thing they do not want to see is a return of a Labor government. If you need any more recent proof, Senator Bishop, perhaps you should look at the Newspoll last Tuesday. That is a sign of the fear and dread in the Australian community—the fact that they do not know what the Labor Party stands for. They have a fear and dread of what might happen to their tax cuts and what might happen to the economy in the rare event that a Labor government should be returned to office in this country.  
It is all very well for Senator Bishop to come in here and ask a question and then purport to take note of the answer and read a prewritten speech-a speech probably written this morning before the question was asked and before he had heard the answer. If that is taking note of answers then I think it is an abuse of the process. He should have listened carefully to what Senator Kemp said and then made a response in taking note of answers. But I do agree with him that there is a fear and dread in the community and that is reflected in the polls and reflected in a lot of the comments that have been made by the newspapers in recent times in relation to what the Labor Party would do if by chance, some slight chance, it happened to be returned to government and was allowed to take away the income tax cuts which this government is promising—and will deliver on 1 July—and roll back the GST so that it becomes unworkable. 
You can contrast what Senator Bishop had to say and make your own judgment as to the truth of his assessment by judging comments made by people such as Woolworths. Woolworths said, `Around half of everything that is sold by supermarkets will be GST free. Customers will get real benefits from the removal of wholesale sales tax.' That is the wholesale sales tax that the Labor Party want to keep. That is their form of taxation—keep up the income tax rates, keep the wholesale sales tax and all the burden that it puts on the Australian business community. Where are the Labor Party on tax policy these days? To the best of my knowledge, they have only three major points: they will put up income tax given the opportunity; they will roll back portions of the GST without saying how they are going to replace that budget revenue; but they will keep the GST. That is the important part of their policy—they will do away with income tax cuts but keep the GST. 
Who are the people in the community and worldwide who support the GST? One of the greatest supporters is the new New Zealand Labour Prime Minister, Helen Clark, who recently visited this country. What did she say of the GST which was introduced in New Zealand some 10 years ago? She said, `It is a very well accepted tax at the moment and no-one seriously thinks it would ever be changed.' That is the attitude of the Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand to the GST and the effect it has had on the New Zealand economy. She had some advice for Mr Beazley—some advice, I hope, Mr Beazley would take, but if he is not going to determine any policy at all it is a bit hard to know whether he ever will accept that advice. Of his roll-back theory she said, `Once you start differentiating between classes of goods you get into anomalies, and that can be a bit hard to explain.' 
I think it is about time Mr Beazley started to explain. He has been the leader of the Labor Party now for four years—four years without a policy, four years without a tax policy—and all he and the Labor Party can do is criticise the greatest tax initiative that this country has ever seen, one which will be welcomed by Australians and one which every Australian is going to benefit from in the long run. I say to the Labor Party: come clean and tell us how much you are going to put up people's income tax by, tell us how much you are going to roll back the GST by, tell us where you are going to find the extra revenue to replace the roll-back of the GST. When you come forward with that policy and give the Australian community a chance to see it, you will find that the fear and dread that they have for the Labor Party and the Labor Party's tax policy will be realised when they return this government because of its tax initiatives.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-03-08,"—Isn't it interesting the focus that the coalition senators try to put on this? We are talking about a tax that the coalition has put in place. We are talking about a tax that we already know, far from looking at the problems with implementation, the Howard government is about rolling forward. You said it yourself, Senator Ferguson, that there are anomalies associated with having a differential GST, and we know that the coalition government is not happy with the deal it did with the Democrats. It wants to put it on everything. The coalition is about more GST and Labor is about rolling back the GST because we are the only party that understands the damage that the GST is going to do to this country.  
We have seen from the evidence given to committees exactly how unfair the GST is. We have seen how it is going to hurt the underprivileged in this country. We have seen how it is going to hurt those on lower incomes. We have seen how it is going to hurt those Australians who are on pensions and who expend all of their weekly income. They are the people that this GST really hurts and hits hard. This is why Labor is committed to rolling it back. 
I want to talk about a couple of issues that Senator Kemp raised specifically. In response to a question from my Labor colleague with respect to the boom period we are in, this period of economic growth, Senator Kemp tried to defend the position of the GST. He sung the praises of growth in one particular area of industry about the 1998-99 boom and how there is rising growth in the purchase of particular commodities. Let us look at a little bit of history here. Let us have a look at what happened to Japan in 1997 when they raised the GST from three to five per cent. Preceding the introduction of the GST, there are a number of very clear and important economic indicators that Australia can learn from. What we know about Japan was that there was a domestic consumption boom. Why? Because everyone who needed to purchase a large commodity for their home—be it a fridge, a car, a bed—did it before the introduction of the GST because they were afraid of the price increases. We know that.
The analysis following the rise of the GST in Japan at that time showed a pattern of growth in consumption demand leading up to it. This happened post the introduction of a small two per cent increase in the Japanese GST. Here we are talking about the introduction of a 10 per cent new tax. What is going to happen post introduction? Let us hear what the government have to say about the potential for a domestic consumption slump and what that will do to the local economy.
Senator Kemp, sing the praises all you like about the economic growth at the moment but, beware, the introduction of a 10 per cent GST will play havoc with the welfare not only of Australians but of Australian businesses who rely on the domestic marketplace to fuel their turnover, to buy their commodities and to purchase their services. Let us focus on the fact that this is the first time that a tax will be placed on services in this country, as well. It extends itself across a whole field of new services that people will now be paying for.
Another point I would like to focus on, Madam Deputy President, is the responses today by Senator Kemp. We have in our midst a new aspirant to fill Joh Bjelke-Petersen's shoes when he said, `Don't you worry about that.' I heard him say it: the latest response from Senator Kemp and his pitiful attempt to try to justify the coalition's actions with respect to the Howard-Lees GST is, `Don't you worry about that.' That is about the level of it from Senator Kemp in this chamber. Australians are fed up with this attempt by the government to now try to make out that somehow there is a concern on their part about what Labor are doing. Labor oppose the GST; Labor always have opposed the GST. Through the committee processes, we extracted evidence as to not just why we think it is a bad tax for this country and why it is a tax for times past but indeed why it will actually inflict severe damage on the economic and social prospects of so many of our citizens. Unfortunately, it is the citizens that actually rely on government and on public policy that will be the most hurt with the introduction of the GST come 1 July this year.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2000-03-08,"—I think that the Labor Party know that the new tax system that this government is introducing on 1 July this year, in a few short weeks, is going to succeed. There is no question about that. There is not one credible organisation in Australia that has said otherwise. Why is it going to succeed? It is going to succeed in spite of your scare campaign. It is going to succeed in spite of your Senator Mark Bishop saying that there will be `fear, dread and sheer terror' about this. That is reaching ridiculous depths. That is plumbing the depths like I have never seen before: trying to scare people about the GST. Why would you do that when there is no election coming? Why would you do that when you know in your hearts that this is going to work? You know very well that Woolworths said as recently as last week that the only increase in the price of food that they could see was going to be less than one cent in the dollar. 
The government has undertaken to get $12 billion worth of tax cuts that come not at the end of the next fiscal year but that come in the first pay period after 1 July. The people that allegedly, you purport, serve you, vote for you or support you are going to get pay cuts, and these are net pay cuts. These are not gobbled up by inflation or created by GST. These are genuine pay cuts for those people, and they are substantial pay cuts. If you earn $50,000 a year, you are going to get a substantial pay cut. Why would you do it? Why would you not support nine taxes that we are going to remove? Why would you not support the fact that pensioners are going to get more in net value. Pensioners are going to get more—more, understand that—even with inflation. We are going to set it above that level of inflation. I find it quite stupid that you even mention the GST is not going to work. The real fear and the real terror is with you people, because you know it is going to work and you know that workers are going to be better off—
—Address the chair, please, Senator Lightfoot.
—and you know what that is going to extrapolate into at the next elections: it is going to extrapolate into you losing seats.
—Order! Senator Lightfoot, address the chair, please.
—That is where the fear, the loathing and the sheer terror is, as your Senator Bishop said. It is with you people, and you are now starting to feel uneasy.
—Address the chair, please, Senator Lightfoot.
—But nowhere near, Madam Deputy President, the fear and the sheer terror that your Mr Beazley is undergoing at the moment, because you know—and you know that I know—the numbers are being done against him to roll him. Not only are you going to roll back the GST, but you are going to roll Mr Beazley too! You have two areas you are going to roll.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I am reluctant to interrupt this incredibly interesting diatribe from Senator Lightfoot, but I must note this. Apart from not addressing you, which is the first part of my point of order—and, Madam Deputy President, I ask you to address that—the second part of my point of order goes to Senator Lightfoot letting the cat out of the bag about `pay cuts' with the GST. I want to give Senator Lightfoot the chance now to correct the record, or does he stand by the statements that he has made in this extraordinary contribution—that is the most generous I can be—to the chamber?
—The second part of your point of order is not a point of order. However, the first part is. Senator Lightfoot, I have asked you previously to address the chair and not use the word `you' because, when you say `you', you are referring to the chair. Please be careful with the use of that word and address the chair. I would appreciate that.
—When I said `you' it was in the plural, too, Madam Deputy President. Of course, I was addressing the chair. I appreciate the opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has given me to regather my thoughts. If I said `pay cuts', that was not what I meant. There are actually going to be net pay gains and tax cuts, as everyone knows.
Let me get back to the real crux of the problem and where the sheer terror is. The sheer terror is this: when we came in here in 1996, we had a $10 billion black hole that became colloquially called the Beazley black hole. What is going to happen again? The opposition has never learnt its lesson. You cannot tamper with the economy the way the opposition did when it was in power. You cannot be trusted with your fingers in the till. Keep the other side away from the till. 
What will happen when you roll back the GST? You are going to roll back the GST, you are going to guarantee payments to the states and you are going to guarantee tax cuts as well. Where are you going to get them from? You are going to put up personal income tax, you are going to put up business tax. That is where the sheer terror is—that excise will go up, fringe benefits tax will go up, death duties will be back in again and capital gains tax will go up. We know what you are going to do.
What is going to happen to the economy that this government has so assiduously rebuilt after it was damaged so badly and almost irreparably by the other side? It is going to happen all over again. The people of Australia are not that stupid. They are not that naive. They will not trust you people with your hands anywhere near the federal till. Get that out of your mind altogether. The new tax system is going to work and it is going to work well.
—Order! Senator Lightfoot, your time has expired. I would say to you that the `you' you referred to throughout all of that speech was not the chair.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2000-03-08,"—I rise today to take note of the attempted answers by Senator Kemp to the questions relating to the issues faced by small business operators, which were raised in the chamber today. First of all, may I make the point that Senator Kemp did not have any idea about the low take-up rate of the field visits program.
—As usual.
—You are right, he did not have any idea, as usual. He simply read the brief describing the field visits program and then had no answer to my question asking what the government intended to do about removing the perception held by most small business operators that the field visits program is in fact a quasi audit.
—So you admit some small businesses actually support it.
—Why don't you take your medication!
—Order! Senator Faulkner!
—The question is: how many people are actually taking up the field visits program? There are not many at all.
—I think that statement should be withdrawn, Madam Deputy President.
—Senator Faulkner, would you like to withdraw that?
—Certainly.
—Stand up and do it properly, please.
—Yes, Madam Deputy President, I withdraw.
—You didn't stand up and you didn't do it properly.
—I did do it properly.
—Order! Senator Faulkner and Senator Lightfoot, if you wish to continue your conversation, please do so outside. Senator McLucas has the call.
—We know that this government has failed. It has failed the whole community on the implementation of the GST, in particular it has failed our small business community. Just take the Yellow Pages Small Business Index report for February, which shows that confidence amongst Australia's regional small businesses is in free fall, down 27 percentage points from the previous survey. This is the lowest level for nearly six years. At the same time, the survey shows that the GST is the major concern facing small business in all mainland states and territories and that nearly two-thirds of small business operators believe the federal government has done a poor job of implementing the GST.
—You can't trust those TLC surveys.
—The Yellow Pages Small Business Index report, I repeat. The Liberal and National parties clearly misunderstood the task ahead when they embarked on their great tax adventure and, as a result, they have left small business ill prepared and underresourced in its efforts to cope. That the government was prepared to play down the complexity of the GST is not surprising. This government has, throughout the whole GST debate, failed to come clean on the GST to the extent that some members have been caught out telling their electorates what they know is incorrect about how the GST will affect them. We need look no further than the issue of the GST and a caravan park resident to establish that. 
It is surprising that a government that has always trumpeted its support for small business, even here in this chamber today, that promised to reduce red tape for small business, that promised a simpler tax system for small business, that promised all of these things, could be so badly prepared to assist small business with this massive task of complying with the GST. I note Senator Kemp's comments in his responses today about the phone advice line—and he gave us that number many times. I would like to give him the story of the caravan park resident from Innisfail who rang me to say that he had waited 40 minutes in a public phone box ringing the hotline—cold line—for the ATO. He waited 40 minutes in a phone box trying to get some information about whether or not he was going to pay tax on his site fees at the Innisfail caravan park. He got too tired and too bored waiting—there was probably a great  line-up of people outside the phone box as well—that he rang my office.
—And got some action.
—And at least could get some information. At the start of the GST debate, this government told business that compliance costs would be `minimal'. Twenty thousand dollars may be minimal in the business circles that the Liberal and National Party members mix in, but I can assure you that where I come from $20,000 will break many small businesses. I should explain that the $20,000 is an estimate from the Small Business Association of Australia.
This government must by now realise that small business is really hurting. You have only to step out the door and speak to your local shops to work that out. Many small businesses feel overwhelmed by the task at hand, and I would briefly like to give you the example of a woman I met in the small town of Ayr some two weeks ago who runs a very efficient small business. She is 64 years old and her business is not computerised. She is absolutely daunted by the task of turning her business into a compliant tax collection point, and her answer is in fact just to close up. She employs two people, and those two people will lose their jobs, as will she. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-03-08,"—I move: 
That the following matters be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report by 30 June 2000:
(a)	relations between Australia and Indonesia with regard to West Papua (formerly Irian Jaya);
(b)	Australian Government aid in West Papua;
(c)	links between Australia's armed forces and Indonesian armed forces operating in West Papua;
(d)	Australian trade links with West Papua;
(e)	the impact of Australian investment and trade on human rights and the environment in West Papua; and
(f)	West Papuan immigration, including refugees, to Australia.
It is long past time that this parliament had an inquiry into our nearest neighbour. With perhaps the exception of Papua New Guinea, West Papua is the nearest neighbour Australia has. It is a nation of 1.8 million indigenous people and it has been forsaken by the rest of the world since the 1960s when, with the departure of the Dutch from the colony as they had it, Indonesian paratroopers dropped in and took over the country. This act of forced accession into Indonesia was followed by the United Nations agreeing to Indonesia's wish that West Papua become its 29th province.
In recent times we have seen the release of documents showing that Australian and American diplomats were complicit in keeping from Australians at the time the true nature of the feelings of the West Papuan people, which was that 95 per cent of them wanted independence. In the years that have followed, many thousands of West Papuans have died fighting for their country. There has been a clandestine bush army representing the military component of the never ending quest for independence which has been in the heart of the West Papuan people. 
The rest of the world, and in particular Australia as part of the rest of the world—and as a neighbour that should have ascribed to the principles of democracy and the aspirations for freedom and self-determination—turned its back on these neighbours of ours, so much so that very few of them have ever been allowed into this country. You can count the number of West Papuans in Australia on your fingers and toes. Ten thousand West Papuans fled across the border into Papua New Guinea in the 1980s and 1990s, hotly pursued by the Indonesian troops. We know of massacres in West Papua like those in East Timor. We know that those people who were involved in fighting for self freedom and self determination did so only at the peril of their lives and many of them were tortured and put to death in the bad old days of the Suharto regime.
In pursuing support for this motion, I can report to the Senate that things have changed for the better since President Wahid came to office in Indonesia last year. I must say that in President Wahid we have an admirable leader of the Indonesian people and a president who is giving back to Indonesians the kudos they deserve as a people for having humanity and regard for the rights of others. But this has not extended to the military which still has a great deal of say in what happens in West Papua, the biggest province incorporated into Indonesia. However, President Wahid went to West Papua on New Year's Eve and by decree he altered the Indonesian name, Irian Jaya, to West Papua. In doing so he recognised West Papuan people in a way that Australian governments have not. He also has made it clear that he recognises the aspirations of the West Papuan people at least for a greater degree of self determination.
There is at the back of this whole debate a need for Australia to look at the economic politics of West Papua. It is a resource rich country, not least in forest, minerals and fisheries. Many people listening to this will know of the giant Freeport mine—one of the largest mines on the face of the planet—in West Papua but will not know that very little of the riches or the spin-off from this huge gold and copper mine have gone to the West Papuan people. Indeed, recently the Governor of West Papua has called upon that mine to give 80 per cent of its profits to the West Papuan people, but he is not going to get much support unless we in this parliament are listening to what is happening to our neighbours, and what is happening to a country which is largely controlled by the military and the aspirations of external investors, not least those from Australia.
Some Australians will be aware that the environment of West Papua is one of the richest on the face of the planet in terms of its species richness, rainforests, mangroves, fantastic rivers, glacier capped mountains on the equator, coastal regions and wildlife. That fantastic repository of environmental riches is under imminent and huge threat from all directions in this resource hungry age of materialism. The last people having any say as to what happens in the future to this country's environment with which they relate so much are the West Papuan people themselves. It is time they had that say.
The Australian parliament and, indeed, the Australian media and people, cannot turn their backs on events in West Papua. We have a clear obligation to be informed about what is happening in this country and to be aware of such events as a shooting in the last month of at least four young people who were espousing freedom for their country. We have an obligation to take part in raising the debate worldwide about the future of West Papua. We have a role to follow initiatives now being taken in the Dutch parliament in The Hague to reopen the question of the sham of the referendum held in the 1960s whereby 1,100 so-called representatives of the West Papuan people were coerced into signing a document giving away the freedom of themselves and their people. We cannot turn our backs on the fact that, if a plebiscite were held in West Papua this coming Saturday, it would give a resounding vote in favour of the freedom of the West Papuan people and the emergence of a new Melanesian nation. 
The first Papuan congress ended two Saturdays ago in Jayapura, the capital of West Papua, with the unanimous rejection of that 1969 plebiscite. In a statement from that, some hundreds of leaders at that congress unanimously called for the process towards independence. Is that a call that we in this parliament are going to ignore? I am not saying, let's endorse that through this motion today. I am saying, let's inquire into it. Let's find out what is going on in West Papua. Let's at least do the right thing by informing ourselves about this important issue which is not going to go away. I put it to the chamber that this issue will become increasingly volatile. We do not want to see a repeat of East Timor in terms of the process of self-determination. In President Wahid we do have a different attitude towards the rights and freedoms of people within the Indonesian aegis, and we ought to be talking about this issue with the Indonesian authorities, as well as making sure that we are informed about the aspirations of the West Papuans themselves.
Let me say this: West Papua will be free; it is inevitable. Australia can put its head in the sand and say, `Let them work that out,' or we can say, `We, as a neighbour, will be a facilitator.' We have a role as a middle order power which stands for democracy and freedom to help in the new birth of this nation of West Papua, as we so belatedly did in the rebirth of the East Timorese nation. I would at this point again say to everybody in this place, particularly to the government and opposition: think again if you are going to vote against this motion. West Papua is our business. It is our duty to be informed about West Papua. West Papua will not go away simply because we do not inquire into it and do not want to know about it. It is a fundamental component of our democratic obligations that we are informed about issues in our neighbourhood. I reiterate that there has never been an inquiry into West Papua and the aspirations of the people of West Papua—and, indeed, Australian involvement, as this motion would inquire into.
I ask those who might vote against this motion: where is your alternative? Where is your specific alternative to inform us about this nation of nearly two million people on our doorstep? There are two options here: vote for this motion, or vote it down but come up with a reasonable alternative. I have not had feedback about that reasonable alternative, and I think it certainly does down the charge we have in this national parliament to be informed about what is going on in our neighbourhood and how we can help neighbours aspiring to their democratic rights, their civil rights, their environmental rights, their economic rights as a nation which is going to emerge into the light of freedom in the coming years.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,17,2
"Brownhill, Sen David",NP,2000-03-08,"—The government does not support the motion as laid down by Senator Brown. I think it is good that we put on record some facts and figures regarding the issues that have been raised. Australia, together with all the UN members, recognises that Irian Jaya is a part of the Republic of Indonesia. Australia's policy is to work for the welfare and human rights of the people of Irian Jaya within a strong and united Indonesia. We believe that grievances should be dealt with through a dialogue and in a peaceful way.
We are pleased that Vice President Megawati has been given special responsibility to address issues of concern to the people of Irian Jaya and that the government of Indonesia is taking steps to develop a framework for regional autonomy, covering political and economic issues. Implementation of autonomy will be the responsibility of the newly created position of Minister for Regional Autonomy, currently held by Dr Rasyid. It is important to understand that, unlike East Timor, Irian Jaya was an integral part of the Dutch East Indies. It was reunited with the successor state through the United Nations sponsored 1969 Act of Free Choice. That act was conducted in the context of broad international support for ending the last vestiges of Dutch colonial rule.
Australia's bilateral aid projects in Irian Jaya are publicly known and are focused on the health sector and institution strengthening. The main programs include the $3 million Jayawijaya women and children's health project; a UNICEF safer motherhood program, worth $13 million across Indonesia; and a project to strengthen quarantine and animal health infrastructure, worth $150,000. Australia has also been active in providing humanitarian aid, including through Medicins sans Frontiers, the UNFAO and Leprosy Mission Australia, and assistance to Indonesian NGOs for human rights training and water supply and sanitation. 
Defence cooperation with Indonesia remains one aspect of the overall relationship. Following recent events, the government has been looking at the appropriateness of various elements of the defence relationship. The Minister for Defence announced in September that some activities would be suspended and others would be reviewed. There are, however, no ongoing defence ties specifically with Irian Jaya. Occasional cooperative military activities have included Operation Ausindo Jaya in early 1998—a major joint drought relief operation which brought vital food supplies to isolated and remote communities in Irian Jaya and saved many lives—and joint activities to retrieve World War II aeroplanes. Likewise, there is no special trade relationship with Irian Jaya or program to develop trade relations with that province.
In general, trade statistics on a province by province basis are very difficult to obtain. Australia does not maintain export statistics on a provincial basis. The bulk of Australian exports to Irian Jaya is in the mining sector, either providing machinery and services directly involved in mining or providing goods and services related to supporting mining communities. Given the limited Australian trade and investment in Irian Jaya, the human rights and environmental impacts will be limited and very difficult to gauge. There certainly is no linear relationship between Australian trade and investment and the environmental and human rights situations in Irian Jaya, which are in any event very complex and multifaceted issues. The number of Irianese applying to migrate to Australia is negligible, and Irianese do not feature strongly in refugee statistics.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-03-08,"—Labor do not support Senator Brown's proposal to establish a Senate inquiry into the situation in West Papua. As Senator Brown knows, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, to which this matter is proposed to be referred, has not yet completed its inquiry in respect of East Timor and it has at least two other matters currently under consideration. Let me say, however, that for our part—as the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Laurie Brereton, indicated late last year and as he has indicated more recently—Labor are inclined to favour a broad inquiry into Australia's bilateral relationship with Indonesia. It is the shadow minister's view that such an inquiry could be conducted in the course of this year by either the Senate committee—that is, the committee to which this matter is proposed to be referred—or the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Labor's view is that such an inquiry could make a valuable contribution to efforts to build a new relationship with a new, more democratic Indonesia. Such an inquiry could address the question of West Papua and, might I say, also address many other issues of importance. It would do so in the context of the overall relationship between our countries. So I say again, for these reasons Labor are not minded to support the reference proposed by Senator Brown but, hopefully, those matters that I have indicated to Senator Brown may satisfy him that the issues he seeks to address could be dealt with in some way in the manner that I have suggested.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,17,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-03-08,"—I thank the government and the opposition for their contributions, although I must say that I am totally dissatisfied with them. I will not go over my earlier submission, but I will say that it is my intention to continue to raise the issue of West Papua and to raise it forcibly in this chamber. Australia must face up to its responsibility to at least be informed about West Papua as a necessary basis for taking its responsibilities seriously towards its neighbours' civil, human and democratic rights. The government could start by catching up with the fact that the name has been officially changed from Irian Jaya to West Papua and that the formerly labelled Irianese people are now officially labelled—even by Jakarta—as West Papuans. That is a matter of very great importance to the self-esteem of the West Papuans who are Melanesian people and who identify with their Melanesian brothers and sisters in fellow populations. 
We have had an indication, too, of the paucity of information available on what our relationship is with West Papua, even by the government. If I look at the figures that Senator Brownhill provided—and I thank him for those figures—Australia is providing between $3 million and $4 million in aid to the two million people on our doorstep. The mining and logging corporations and other corporations operating out of Australia—and, increasingly, tourist operations—will be doing bigger business than that. I remind the chamber that the last people to benefit from the big mining corporations operating in West Papua are the West Papuans themselves. One has only to look at the statistics on social services on such things as education to understand that that is the case. I also remind the chamber that many West Papuans have in fact been killed as a result of their opposition to the social and environmental impact of mines like the one at Freeport. So I understand, clearly, that this motion for the Senate to inquire into West Papua is lost, but I can assure the chamber that my ardour for bringing this important matter up for debate will continue, and I will return to the matter in the coming months.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-03-08,"—The basis for the changes in the management plan for the Northern Prawn Fishery contained in regulations lie in the concerns of expert groups and others, including the industry itself, that the Northern Prawn Fishery is seriously overfished. That is particularly the case for tiger prawns. CSIRO research indicates that the tiger prawn stock could be overexploited by as much as 35 per cent. AFMA, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, which manages the fishery pursuant to the Fisheries Management Act of 1991, also supports this estimate of overfishing and has been engaged in a process with the industry since at least 1991 to try to improve the sustainability of the resource.
Industry representatives agree that there is a problem but there are differences within the industry on the extent of the problem and also on how it should be addressed. The report that has been tabled here today sets out the background to the issue, including details on the location and extent of the fishery, its value, the methods of trawling and the options that have been considered in trying to improve the sustainability of the tiger prawn resource.
Two important points I believe should be noted from the background to the regulation that is now being considered. Firstly, the Northern Prawn Fishery is the most valuable Commonwealth fishery in Australia with an annual production ranging up to $150 million. The overwhelming proportion of that production is exported. Secondly, there have been a number of attempts to arrest the overexploitation but those attempts in the past have not been sufficiently successful to either improve the sustainability or arrest the decline.
Some of those earlier measures included in 1977 and again in 1980 imposing a three-year moratorium on the entry of new operators into the fishery. Further, in 1983 a management plan based upon the issuing of A-class and B-class units was implemented. A-class units were related to hull size and engine power and B-class units were related to the number of licensed fishing boats able to operate in the fishery. According to the CSIRO, this plan did not prove very successful as a study in 1986 showed a continuing serious decline in the stocks of brown tiger prawns. At that time the CSIRO urged a 25 per cent reduction in the fishing effort. This in turn led to a voluntary buyback of A-class units.
Notwithstanding the changes undertaken through the 70s and 80s, the reduction in effort was insufficient and other strategies were then used throughout the early 1990s. These included closure of the fishery for certain periods of time during the year, restrictions on towing gear and the amount of net, and a more restrictive voluntary vessel replacement policy involving the surrender of two B-class units for each new vessel. 
Further, in 1993 a compulsory buyback of A-class units occurred. Then followed in 1995 the implementation of the Northern Prawn Fishery's management plan. Under this plan the previous A-class and B-class units were reclassified as A-class and B-class statutory fishing rights, or SFRs for short. Then in 1996 and again in 1999 further reports on the status of the fishery were released which continued to show that there was a major problem with the sustainability of the resource. Indeed, the latest estimate in 1999 shows that fishing effort in the Northern Prawn Fishery is 35 per cent above the maximum sustainable yield, thus threatening the long-term sustainability of the fishery. Whilst—as I said earlier and has been acknowledged—there were differences of opinion as the extent of the overfishing and as to the likelihood of success of the measures to be introduced, it is clear that the current measures have not worked, nor have previous measures worked to the extent required to reverse the declining trend in sustainability.
We then come to the proposed changes to the management plan, which Senator Crane has referred to—that is, a change from the current system where the A-class statutory fishing rights are based on vessel and engine size to one based on gear units. Gear units are calculated having regard to the amount of headrope and footrope that tows the nets. To try to put it in simple terms: the proposal is to regulate the fishery through the amount of net that can be towed by a fishing boat, with also a continuation of the B-class units. This change has been proposed by AFMA following recommendations of a working group of the Northern Prawn Fishery Management Advisory Committee. This working group considered alternative options but ultimately recommended moving to the gear unit proposal. There has been vocal opposition to the proposal, mainly from the Northern Prawn Fishery Queensland Trawl Association, who appeared during the proceedings and strongly argued their case. Other organisations have supported the proposal. I think Senator Crane acknowledged that the committee was faced with complex arguments with strongly held views on both sides and was clearly in a position where it had to weigh up this evidence at the same time having in the forefront of its concerns the ultimate sustainability of the resource for the future.
The committee's hearings provided an opportunity for all interested groups as well as the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the CSIRO and expert witnesses to appear and argue their case. It is fair to say that some of these issues raised are complex, and differing opinions were put forward from people on both sides holding expertise in fishery management and prawn fishing. The committee was also advised about the possible consequences on employment in the industry and on regions where the industry operates. In particular, there was dispute over the amount of effort creep and, indeed, the manner in which effort creep is actually calculated. There was also disagreement over whether or not gear units would produce the reduction of the fishing effort that the CSIRO says is required—that is, between 25 and 30 per cent.
The Northern Prawn Fishery Queensland Trawl Association, as I said earlier, opposed the change to gear units and argued for a system based upon effort units—that is, retaining the current system—combined with time units. Time units under their proposal would allocate a certain number of nights' fishing to each operator. The association also argued that greater enforcement of the effort units could be achieved through monitoring of vessels when fishing and also through calibration and sealing of fuel pumps to check on engine power to check that people were not illegally changing those ratios or those calibrations on their vessels. Time does not permit me to discuss in detail the various arguments and all of the evidence put to the committee.
In coming to a conclusion on whether or not the changes to the management plan should be implemented, the committee reached two major conclusions: firstly, the sustainability of the fishery is seriously threatened and action needs to be taken to arrest the decline; and, secondly, the current system has not been successful and in the absence of any viable alternative the change to statutory fishing rights based on gear units should be implemented. However, we do not believe that it has been proven that this change will immediately solve all of the problems and, accordingly, we have recommended, particularly in recommendation 9, ongoing research work over the next two years to examine a range of issues as well as monitoring this proposed change. In conclusion, I reiterate the remarks of the chairman in expressing the appreciation of the opposition to all of those who made submissions as well as the staff of the secretariat for their assistance during the inquiry.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-03-08,"—I will try to constrain my comments on this to allow a bit of time for other senators to speak. As the person who moved the motion to refer this matter to the committee, it is my fault that we are here discussing this. But I hope that all committee members feel that it was a worthwhile process. It was a difficult one, one that from my perspective and the Democrats's perspective had a strong focus on environmental impacts, one that was very important and continues to be very important. I think the report reflects that it is an ongoing issue of significance in terms of not just the economic future of the fishery but the obvious intertwining of that with the environmental sustainability of the fishery.
I would have to say that I am far from convinced that the changes that AFMA has put forward in the new plan will lead to a significant reduction in effort which would improve the chances of sustainability of the fishery. Clearly, what the committee is faced with is what the alternative is and, if the plan were to be disallowed, what else would be put in place. As was clear through the committee process from all sides of the debate, there has been a lot of differing views about the best way to manage the fishery over most of the 1990s, if not longer. It has been clear that change is needed to be made, and it has taken a long time to get to this process in this plan—which, as I say, I am not completely convinced is necessarily the best way forward. But the alternative to going down that path would be to place a great deal of uncertainty back into the management of the fishery.
I think a lot of the recommendations the committee has put forward—beyond just simply saying to not support disallowing the plan—are important because they recommend the putting in place of a lot of measures to try to address some of the problems that have not been adequately addressed to date. I think it is also important to emphasise that one of the issues which quite surprised me that came forward—or, in a sense, did not come forward—through the inquiry was the lack of research that had been done on some crucial issues and, accordingly, the lack of information available. For a fishery of such value and environmental importance, I was, frankly, quite astonished at some of the gaps in knowledge. I acknowledge that fishery management involves some imprecise science—it can be difficult to make definitive statements and definitive judgments—but I was surprised by some of the gaps in research in this area given how long this debate has been going on and how long some of the issues and potential problems have been before AFMA. I am not sure whether that is a fault that lies with AFMA or a fault that lies with government in terms of funding for AFMA, CSIRO or other agencies, but it is clearly an area where we need, as a government and as a parliament, to step up our efforts—that is, to increase assistance to research not just in this fishery but across the board.
Hopefully, some of the changes that the Democrats have assisted in making to the environmental protection acts, which will come into force later this year, should move things towards establishing a greater requirement for all fisheries to demonstrate that they are environmentally sustainable before they are able to continue operating. I think that is the path we need to go down to lock these things in place before the fishery gets to the sort of size and requires the amount of effort that is involved in some places. Hopefully, we can move more in that direction. I realise that a number of people, particularly in my own state of Queensland, will be disappointed with the conclusions of the committee. 
I would like to commend all of the people who put evidence to the inquiry. For an issue that obviously aroused a lot of passions and firm views, I think people entered into the process, by and large, in good faith and in a genuine spirit of trying to present their side of the argument in a factual way. I want to encourage people, particularly people from Queensland—many are based in Cairns—to continue to engage with the process. That process, like every process, may have its flaws, but it is important to continue to try to engage with it—even if, on this occasion, people's immediate views have not been able to be adopted through the varying government processes. I might leave my remarks there to leave some time for others. I thank all those people who were involved in the committee inquiry and I thank the Senate for agreeing to my initial request for the committee to investigate this matter. I am sure that process will lead to a much greater scrutiny of the future operations of this fishery.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-03-08,"—Let me concur with all of the comments that have been made about the exemplary performance of the committee secretariat. It has a considerable workload and is one of the busiest committees of the Senate. To do the work that has been done to assist the committee to present this report in the short time that we deliberately set for it is, I think, proof of what good work is done by the public servants who work for this parliament. Let me say that it is my intention at the conclusion of my time to seek leave to continue my remarks. There were other people who wanted to speak on this, so I would seek to preserve this matter on the Notice Paper. In the limited time that I have available to me, let me say that the committee has made findings on the evidence available to it. There was a lot of agitation about the disallowance of the regulations that, in effect, the committee supported—that is, the change from the statutory fishing right units as they existed to the `gear units', as they are described in the report.
I think it has to be said that the committee was absolutely convinced that the existing regime, the statutory fishing right unit, had ceased to be an effective way to measure the effort of the fishing activities of individual boats. The relationship between the number of units held and their ability to catch prawns—certainly in the tiger prawn fishery—seemed to have all but disappeared. Those people who fought from 1992 until now to postpone the inevitable have postponed changes to a system which, as demonstrated in the charter on page 38, has become less and less relevant over that time. The committee was faced with the decision of approving a change from a totally inadequate system to a system which might not be said to be supported totally on all of the evidence. But that is the reason this committee suggested that the science which underpins the management of this fishery required further work. This committee has been at pains to say to AFMA and the Northern Prawn Fishery community that that work should be done. The work that is possible should be done within the next 12 months, but certainly over the next two years significant research ought to be done in terms of the resource; the ways that resource is affected and fished; alternative proposals, which I think have been put forward in good faith by people who have different views about the management of the resource; and, of course, the legal efficacy of other regimes.
One of the problems that the committee noticed with some alternatives is that they did not seem to have the basis of legal certainty in the regimes they were proposing. Those who propose alternative regimes ought to look to what might be a deficiency in their case to date. All operators would be prudent to look closely at this report, to look at what might be described as the caveats on the system over the next two years and to make their financial decisions according to that report over that period. Members of the committee will be keen to ask AFMA just what they are doing over the next two years when AFMA come before the estimates committees of this Senate, so that we are aware as to what is happening. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

The work that is possible should be done within the next 12 months, but certainly over the next two years significant research ought to be done in terms of the resource; the ways that resource is affected and fished; alternative proposals, which I think have been put forward in good faith by people who have different views about the management of the resource; and, of course, the legal efficacy of other regimes.
One of the problems that the committee noticed with some alternatives is that they did not seem to have the basis of legal certainty in the regimes they were proposing. Those who propose alternative regimes ought to look to what might be a deficiency in their case to date. All operators would be prudent to look closely at this report, to look at what might be described as the caveats on the system over the next two years and to make their financial decisions according to that report over that period. Members of the committee will be keen to ask AFMA just what they are doing over the next two years when AFMA come before the estimates committees of this Senate, so that we are aware as to what is happening. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-03-08,"—The topic of classification has prompted much debate involving issues as provocative as basic freedoms and censorship. There is a world of difference between classifying material in order to provide information or guidelines that assist users in making informed choices and censorship, which carries with it the ability to morally dictate what we should or should not watch or view. Classification is a matter for the general community and not just an issue of commercial benefit. Given this, it is appropriate that industry meets the cost of classification for films, publications and video games whilst government meets the cost of unrelated public interest functions.
The Labor Party believes it is entirely inappropriate for the government to charge industry for the public interest functions which are performed by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. In fact, if passed, the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1998 and the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998 are expected to increase the revenue to the OFLC and the government by $2.15 million per year. In the 1997-98 budget, the Howard government committed itself to providing full cost recovery for the classification services provided by the OFLC from 1 July 1998. In order to facilitate this, the government introduced almost identical bills into the House of Representatives on 27 November 1997.
Consistent with Labor's stance on the 1997 bills, we will be opposing the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998. Our reasons for this are simple. Whilst the bills claim to be imposing a charge for the delivery of services by the Office of Film and Literature Classification, they are in fact imposing a tax under section 55 of the Australian Constitution. The fact that this government is seeking to recover the costs of ancillary service provision, including matters such as research, policy development, ministerial support and payments to the states and territories for enforcement and other related purposes, is a clear admission on its part that these charges do not bear a legally sufficient relationship to the actual services which are provided. The services which I am referring to are, namely, the classification of publications, films and computer games.
The charges bill also provides that the level of the taxes can be varied by means of regulation. The government argues that this is a necessary measure because the charges will have to be regularly adjusted with a view to the cost structure of the OFLC. However, this also gives the government considerable flexibility to increase the relevant charges so that they bear no relationship whatsoever to future cost structures of the OFLC. At the core of the matter, this will mean that the charges will therefore cease to be a cost recovery measure, even in the grossly expanded interpretation of that term that the government has proposed.
In effect, these bills will allow the imposition of potentially punitive taxes on the publication, film and computer game industry sectors, with only subsequent Senate disallowance as a check on any government excess. My colleagues in the Labor Party and I believe this situation is entirely unacceptable because it allows the government to increase this tax at its whim. The Labor Party, however, will support some aspects of the amendment bill. Part 1 of the amendment bill removes some of the formal requirements in making application for the classification of material for the investigation and prosecution of an offence. These amendments overcome the problems associated with the failure of two prosecutions in 1997 due to the lack of compliance with all of the formal requirements of an application of the material concerned. The Labor Party support these amendments.
We will also be supporting section 91(1) of the 1998 amendment bill. This subsection permits the director of the OFLC to waive in whole or in part the classification charges for limited distribution special interest material which comprises a documentary record of an event or material which is of a cultural or like manner. This waiver will be utilised if the director believes it is in the public interest to do so. I must note that is it is estimated that only 100 films per year will be excluded on this basis at a cost to the budget of $54,000. This exemption is indeed very limited and bears no resemblance to the broad exemption that the Attorney-General sought to portray in the debate in the House of Representatives. It will not allow, for example, religious institutions to seek an exemption for films which have significant religious content, and it will not provide a mechanism, for example, for small and independent distributors of films to gain exemptions for their works. 
The effect of this legislation, and the charges that it provides for, on independent and small film-makers is worthy of note. Small independent film producers, computer game designers and publishers will be the hardest hit under the government's proposed new fee structure. The fees for classifying a publication, film or computer game are levied on a one-off basis. So, for example, once a film has been classified, all identical prints of the film are also deemed to have been classified. As these charges are levied only on the initial cost of classification, large commercial distributors of content—be it in games, film or publications—are able to absorb the increased cost of classifying, given the considerable revenues generated from multiple copies of the product being distributed in outlets throughout Australia. By way of example, the new classification fees will increase the costs of classifying a film for sale or hire from the current fee structure of between $510 to $1,010, depending on the film's length, to a significantly higher cost structure of $810 to $1,590. They will increase the cost of classifying a computer game from $590 to $930. This equates to an additional and unfair burden on domestic computer game developers, who already operate on limited budgets and who may be in a position to distribute only limited copies of their game in a highly competitive, very short-term market. It is a very competitive marketplace.
As a result, the enactment of the classification amendment bill and charges bill will make it even harder for small and independent distributors to service niche markets and, in particular, to encourage the development of the creative talents of Australia's young and up-and-coming content producers. Interestingly, the Attorney-General claimed that these changes would have little impact on new and small film-makers because film festivals were exempt from these fees. The Attorney clearly fails to understand that Australian film-makers increasingly have to prove themselves in the commercial market prior to their works being picked up by major film studios or distributors. The level of fees also gives rise to some concern about the level of compliance with Australia's film classification system. Industry sources currently state that the level of compliance has decreased since the 1997 fee increase was established under this government. Rather than learning from its negative real-world experiences, this government is setting itself up to repeat its own mistakes. Whilst the OFLC has stated in the Senate estimates that it was not aware of these concerns nor their effects on Australian consumers or film-makers, it also stated that it had never even looked at the possible occurrences of such a trend. Rather, the OFLC pointed to the excellent work that is undertaken by the community liaison officer in seeking to encourage increased compliance. However, if this trend is accurate, then it is an extremely worrying trend.
The public interest is best served by industry complying with these laws, and I understand that the principal users of the system will continue to do so. But if increased fees are resulting in an increased number of rogue operators on the fringe of our classification system, then they are not in the interests of this government, the industry or indeed the public. The public interest is clearly best served by maximum compliance with the law. By this I mean that parents have the right to know that their children are legally able to access only suitable material—that is what classification is all about. The government has an obligation to ensure that the Australian classification system is as watertight as possible. The government's interests are served not only through compliance as a legal and moral norm but also through the increased revenue that such compliance brings. Industry's interests are best served by having a market in which none seek to gain advantage by evading the law and in which all pay their fair share towards the provision of this important service. If these bills are passed, however, the ridiculous situation will arise where a business that complies with the law will have to pay for the cost of having the law enforced against a business which seeks to evade it. This is hardly a fair situation, nor does it provide any incentives for business to comply. 
It is also extremely interesting to note that we are contemplating a bill such as this at a time when the production of digital content—be it computer games, films or in new content industries—is so critical to Australia's place in the global market. It is very important that the government take note of ways in which they can offer encouragement and incentives to the digital content producers in Australia, and I would like to make particular mention of computer game developers. Late last year saw the inaugural meeting of the Australian Game Developers Association, which was brought together for the first time not only to celebrate the achievements of the Australian computer game industry but to promote the work that they do in exporting their product around the world. The production of computer games is an extremely competitive business in what is very much a global marketplace, dealing with the fickle market of young people who are obviously passionate about, and interested in, new products.
On a recent visit to the west coast of the USA, I found it quite inspiring to walk into an Internet cafe to inquire about a particular Australian game developer located in South Australia and whether or not they were familiar with their game. It turned out that the young man in the Internet cafe had been a tester of the Australian game, which is produced in the suburbs of Adelaide. For me, it was a great lesson in just how important this industry sector is. It has a global reach. It is about digital content and an industry which is not constrained by geographic boundaries or Australia's isolation in terms of proximity to markets. If you can get it across the Net, if it is digital in form, there is an inherent advantage for access to a competitive global marketplace. This example highlights the fact that we are dealing with an incredibly important sector. Those in the chamber and others that look at cultural export figures for OECD countries would know that content of that nature and computer games are quite often used as exemplars of growing marketplaces. Hence, we are dealing with bills today that actively highlight the work of this industry by calling it into legislative focus. But they do so by putting a penalty on that industry, by putting on it unfair fees and charges that penalise those who are contributing to the production of content in a very proactive and important way for Australia's economic future in the exciting and rapidly growing area of the digital content market. I think it is a very fair comment to say that Australians are excellent content producers and we have excellent global products ready and available for consumption and export. A government would be better placed putting emphasis on promoting that particular industry sector rather than looking at punitive bills like this which will not advantage the position of this industry sector in the marketplace. It will put it at a regulatory disadvantage by applying a fee structure which is nothing more than an additional tax.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) CHARGES BILL 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,24,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-03-08,"—We are here discussing the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1998 and the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998 which develop the scheme operating in Australia to classify films and literature. If we are to have such a classification system, there must be somebody to do the classifying and that, as is shown by debates in this area over the years and by events that have happened in very recent days, is a very emotional issue. I see that there are now present some people who do the classifying—perhaps that is the best way of putting it—and they have a very difficult task. Therefore, I believe it is important that we establish what the classification system is meant to do.
As you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President, the government has been faced with some difficulties with this. I am not suggesting for a moment that there are no difficulties elsewhere but, in particular, as this morning's press has shown, there have been some difficulties in the government party room. Some implied criticism has been made, I think, of the Attorney-General in this area, and it is perhaps worth while reading what he has to say about it. There are a number of bills which will come before the chamber in this area. In respect of one of them, the Attorney-General has made a statement which sets out quite clearly what the underlying philosophy for Australia is. What he says is that the classification in Australia is really aimed at children; that the proposition that we in Australia go forward with is that adults should be able to read and see what they choose to read and see. 
People might object and take strong opposition to that proposition. But that, in fact, is what the law is and that is the law that has been agreed on not only by the Commonwealth parliament but by the various state and territory parliaments. This is one of those examples of a national scheme of legislation. In other words, one parliament alone cannot set up the system of certification that we have in Australia. The various parliaments have got together and have come to an agreement about what the system for certification in Australia ought to be—and I use the word `certification' advisedly because that is the way censorship is carried out in Australia. Whether it is some publication or a film, it is not to be released to the public until it has received a classification. If it has not received a classification, then it is not released to the public. The emotional issue that is faced again and again in this area is that at times people, including parliamentarians, think that something is beyond what is right; they think something is so beyond what is reasonable that it should be banned. Then we have great discussions in this chamber about it.
If we are to have a classification system—which we do have—we have to rely on those organisations that we set up according to legislation, according to a national scheme. We have to rely on those organisations and we have to place some sort of trust in them because, if we do not, we are not going to get anywhere with these highly emotional issues. The whole system starts to go astray when a decision is made according to the law and people say, `Well, look, we're not happy with that. We want a further institution put in to look at this in the hope that our position might be reached.'
I will just read from the second reading speech of a bill which I mentioned earlier, the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999. In the second reading speech this was said:
The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 will make a number of procedural and other amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995.
That is a sort of formal opening to the speech. It continues:
The bill includes amendments to give effect to the government's decision to abolish the X classification and to introduce a new NVE, or non-violent erotica, classification.
This is where this whole area produces great debate, great emotion and, hopefully, in the end, considerable light. The second reading speech goes on:
Censorship of what adults should be allowed to read, hear or see brings forth a wide divergence of views in the community. Where views in the community are divided, government intervention in social issues is inherently difficult.
And I think that is absolutely right. It continues:
The government is aware that some members of the community who find the portrayal of sexually explicit material on video tape offensive are unhappy with the government's decision not to ban this material. While the government understands and respects these views, there is a need to approach this issue from a general community perspective.
For over two decades now, all Australian governments, of both political persuasions, have subscribed to the principles that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they wish, that persons should be protected from unsolicited material that they find offensive and that children should be protected from material that is likely to harm or disturb them. To these the act has added the need to take account of community concerns about depictions that condone or incite violence, particularly sexual violence, and the portrayal of persons in a demeaning manner. 
That sets out the concepts, the law, the propositions that sit behind this legislation.
The legislation has been developed over the years as national scheme legislation. Violence is done to that legislation when anybody protests and does it in the way that was done in the government party room when sending it back to cabinet. It was said earlier that that is simply an expression of democratic rights. That might be so. It is right that people should be allowed to say what they want. If they find this offensive then it should go back to cabinet in the way that it has been done. In that situation, I think that the Attorney-General ought to be treated with some respect and with some consideration because he is subject to the national scheme that every state and territory has agreed to until it gets to the party room. All you can do is put forward the legislation as agreed to around the country. To have that refused at the last moment is obviously going to cause difficulties. It is my proposition that parliament should have the final say whether the proposed legislation is agreed to or not. Debates in this area should be conducted with some consideration for those who have to make the system work. They should be conducted with a deal of grace and courtesy.
If these two bills are made into law then a series of taxes will be applied in this area. It is said that those who benefit from this legislation should be the ones who pay. The people who benefit from the classification are the public. The classifications are made specifically so that that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, me and everybody else in the community have an understanding of the material we are purchasing. That is a service that should be welcomed. It seems to me that the public should pay for that on the basis of the proposition that those who are to benefit from this classification are those who should pay. 
It is said that industry should pay because they are the ones who are going to get the classification. That is one way of looking at it. On the other hand, the industry generally simply wants to show its films and wants to have its books accepted, have its literature brought out to the public. It is a funny way of looking at it to say that industry is the one that is going to benefit or not benefit from all this. There is a presumption behind that proposition that somehow the making of films and the writing and publishing of books is an exercise that should, by its very nature, be censored. That is a wrong concept in my view. Most people go about writing their books, making their films and things like that to express their views on things. They certainly want to make money. It is the attitude to that expression of views that is a worry in this area. People should be entitled to express their views. 
It is going back a long way, but over the last 50 years or so we have had a series of conventions and agreements made between countries. A lot of that goes back to President Roosevelt's state of the union address in 1941 when he talked about the four freedoms. I would think that nobody would argue about the last three freedoms. The second freedom is the freedom of every person to worship God in his own way. Some of us went off to an Ash Wednesday mass today because we worship God in our own way. That is a right that we should have and everybody agrees with that. The third freedom is freedom from want. That is understandable. The fourth freedom is freedom from fear. The first freedom that President Roosevelt spoke is freedom of speech and expression. It is the threat to that freedom which is a great worry in this area.
—Hear, hear! I agree. 
—It is the threat to that ability to express yourself that is of concern. So when we talk about the author, when we talk about the publisher, when we talk about the film-maker being the one who is serviced by the classification system, there is an inference in that that somehow they have not got a right to express themselves until their works have been classified. We had an inquiry into this, one of the many exercises that the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee undertook. I found out, for example, that a film of the Melbourne Cup or a film of the grand final—things I must confess that I go to; not the Melbourne Cup so much but the Derby and the Cox Plate certainly and the Guineas and so on—had to be classified. They are still classified, I think.  
It seems to me that there is an inference that ought to be immediately put aside, if it can, in this legislation that it is somehow wrong to be able to express yourself until there has been a certification that that expression is all right. Senator Harradine has done a lot of work in this area, and he would certainly be against any inhibition on expression. What he is against is gross depiction of matters that outrage the human heart and soul. That does present a problem because who is to judge what is outrageous, who is to judge whether something is pornographic or whether it is erotic. That is where we have a lot of problems. We have a classification board. That is not sufficient, so we have other bodies on top of that. There are some real problems in this area. It is in that context that we have to deal with this issue, in terms of respect for each other and for the system and for the freedoms that we all like to enjoy. 
In any event, this bill is going to level charges on people who want their material classified. In my view, I think the opposition is right in the approach it has taken in this context. No doubt when we come to the committee stage there will be an opportunity to say something further on these matters. 
All these freedoms are important. Freedoms are never absolute in the sense that people can just grab hold of a thing like freedom and say whatever they want they can have. Certainly there must be some restrictions in the interests of children and in the interests of public order. But it is that judgment of what is against public order, what is wrong, what is pornographic, that is a bit upsetting. 
The last thing I want to say is that there is a tendency to describe literature and to describe films in a way that might well embarrass those who look at them. Whereas you might think it would be all right to go down the street and buy a ticket to a nonviolent erotic film, you might not think it would look so good if you bought a ticket to a nonviolent pornographic film—you would not want children to see you going there. If it is pornographic, then it is fair enough to label it that way. But if that word is being used as a means of embarrassing people so that they do not do what they would otherwise be legitimately entitled to do, I think that is taking things much too far.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) CHARGES BILL 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,24,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-03-08,"—We are speaking to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1998 and the subsequent bill, the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998. Those pieces of legislation are really about the funding of the scheme, not a great deal to do with the very important issues that were raised by my colleague Senator Cooney. But he was justified in raising them because these bills are about how that system, referred to by Senator Cooney, is going to be funded in future, and the aim of the legislation is to attempt to have it self-funded through the fees that are charged for classifications, et cetera. We will be dealing with those matters in detail in the committee stage. 
I just want to make an observation to the chamber. We often listen to Senator Cooney. I am constantly not amazed but encouraged to listen to what he says because he almost always hits upon a key point which is overlooked by many others. He talked tonight about the right to freedom of expression. That is a key concept that is forgotten very often in this debate. The legislation itself does not base its provisions on that right; it bases its provisions on what it says is a right for adults to read, see and view what they wish. But, of course, adults cannot do so unless it is published. So it gets back to the question of balancing the asserted right of the pornographer's right to freedom of expression against the protections that should apply.
We need to go back to the philosophy of these matters, and many of us recall the censorship debates of the 1960s. Those debates were about the interference of the state in what was perceived to be literature and the arts. Some saw these debates as a battle between the literati and the philistines over the survival of writings, both new and old. It was against that background that the then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy, announced a policy on censorship which said that federal laws were to conform with the general principles that adults be entitled to read, hear, view and do what they wish in private and public, and that persons and those in their care should not be exposed to unsolicited material offensive to them. It is ironic that this policy formed by the literati during the censorship debates of the late 1960s and announced as policy in the early 1970s should be used as a slogan in the 1990s and in the year 2000 to exempt from general censorship guidelines only one type of video in the ACT, and that is hard-core pornography, produced by the philistines to make a fast buck. 
The Joint Select Committee on Video Material said:
When the principle that adults be free to see, hear and read what they choose was originally stated as public policy the number of videotapes entering Australia was insignificant and there was not the widespread availability of objectionable video publications as exists today as the result of the flood of these materials into Australia ... This principle is often stated, but not adhered to in practice, since adults are not free to view video material depicting, inter alia child pornography, bestiality, sexually explicit violent pornography as these are banned under censorship guidelines ... and prohibited from entry under the customs regulations ... The principle that adults be free to see, hear and read what they choose is dependent on the pornographers' claimed right to freedom of expression and the balancing of this claimed right against the requirements fundamental to the common good which legislators are bound to uphold. The issue is not whether there should be censorship as was the case in 1973 when the principle was first stated as public policy but where to draw the line. The Committee considers that the current line is not appropriately drawn.
The fact is that we do have film censorship in this country, with the one exception that I referred to above. In general, those who constantly parrot the Murphy policy in practice do not really regard it as a principle to be applied universally or uniformly but rather as a slogan to be used selectively and arbitrarily when it suits. The question in the real world in which we live is: where do we draw the line? For anyone who, like me, has a passionate commitment to the principles of civil liberties in public policy relating to censorship and availability, these censorship provisions must be soundly based and must not deprive persons of their liberties.
I will turn to the definition of terms. A moral philosophical analysis is required of the concept of censorship generally, and of censorship of pornography in particular, so as to determine what censorship it is and whether it can be said to have any moral philosophical justification. The study of moral philosophy involves the examination of the principles which underlie all human actions and conduct. To conduct such an analysis, therefore, we must examine the principles involved in censorship and determine if they are consistent and universal. Fundamental principles upon which human actions are based may be expressed. The words used in any analysis of this kind must be tested and rigorously examined. Therefore, it is essential that the terms used are defined and examined. To define these terms and thus transform them from rhetorical abstractions into definite principles is fundamental to moral philosophy.
Take the word `censorship'. This is a word with prehistoric roots and rather interesting origins. Mr Acting Deputy President, this is from a paper I wrote. I would be pleased to incorporate the remainder in Hansard.
 (Senator Murphy)—Are you seeking leave to incorporate the remainder, Senator?
—It is my paper entitled
—Normal practice, with regard to such documents, is that the parties would view it before granting approval to incorporate it. I suspect that it will be okay.
—I have handed the paper to the officer to ask my government, opposition and other colleagues whether I could have that incorporated. It is entitled `Censorship principles'.
What I want to say now, because the matter has been raised, is that I think it is a very healthy thing that some people have had a really good look at what is going to be in the NVE classification, the nonviolent erotica classification. I challenge anyone at all around this chamber to have a look at the material and say whether that material is pornographic or erotic. `Erotic', of course, has sensual human sexual love, art house and other connotations. The material that I am talking about is material that, as was said by the joint committee, treats persons, especially women, as sexual commodities—in other words, equal to the sum of their sexual parts—to be exploited for sexual gratification. Women frequently are depicted as eager and available for sexual activity of any kind, however deviant. This is frequently manifested in the group sex scenes, which incidentally is an AIDS high risk behaviour. If anybody would class those as erotica, they do not know the meaning of the term. The term `pornography' is defined as material, the content, intent and theme of which is designed to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience. That same definition can be accepted by those who use the material and those who are offended by it and feel the material is objectionable. 
The porn merchants have for years been trying to have the `X' title removed because of the odium that is attached to that title, and it is a justified odium. They have been trying to get in `NVE', nonviolent erotica, which sounds far less harmful than the `X' title. What is being suggested is how this is to be done for the type of material that I described. Experts, behavioural scientists and others came before our committee and made statements about the material—that the material engendered in the minds of the habitual viewer a callused and manipulative orientation towards women and portrayed women in general as being highly promiscuous and available.
—It also says that men are highly available and promiscuous.
—Yes, I said `people' or `persons' but it is designed particularly for the male audience. When the plan was announced by the Attorney-General on 8 April 1997—I come back to what Senator Cooney said—the Attorney-General made a statement saying that the new classification, the new title, was required in order to remove demeaning material. How could the first law officer of the Crown sodeceive the public? Demeaning material is already excluded, or should be excluded, under the act, the schedule which is the national classifications code. But here you have the Attorney-General saying, `We have to have a new NVE title so as to exclude certain material that is currently there, a minor part of the overall because the bulk of the material will be the current X going into NVE.' So just changing the title fixes up the election promise to do away with X, does it not? Yes, but he says in his second reading speech he is going to propose three other things: exclude the depiction of certain fetishes, exclude sexually assaultative language—do people around this chamber believe that that is not demeaning; let them get up and say, if it is demeaning, it should have been out already—and exclude the depiction of actors who are over the age of 18 as minors in sexual activity. Does anybody around this chamber think that that is not demeaning? It should have been out already, and why was it not? If any of the states or territories get up and say, `No, we're not going to approve of new guidelines that will remove those three things, unless we still have the NVE,' righto, Mr Carr, Mr Beattie, Mr Bacon, Mr Bracks, Mr Court—
—Olsen.
—Mr Olsen, but particularly Mr Burke and those in the ACT. We should ask them, `Do you not think that that material is demeaning?' They would have to say no for the sake of giving the porn merchants what they want: their NVE. We will not allow that. We will not allow that de-meaning material to stay in there. Let us be very clear on where we are going in this area. I must say that I do endorse the fact that the government is going to have another look at this matter. I think it is important that we hold faith with the public, the people who have elected us, and not have these things determined in a way which appears to be deceitful. I agree that it is a very difficult situation which the OFLC and the board of review face. I do not blame the Attorney-General. I certainly had a lot of other things on at that particular stage and indeed on that particular day.
—It was a great day other than that.
—Yes. But he seems to have just accepted the advice of the Attorney-General's Department in respect of this matter. I do not envy the task of the classifiers. I must say that, having gone through many of these videos and studied them, I have become completely blase about the whole matter. You have to bring yourself back into the real world. I do appeal to the parliament and to the government to reconsider this matter in the interests of the people of Australia and not in the interests of the porn merchants. I seek leave to have the document I mentioned incorporated in the Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
CENSORSHIP PRINCIPLES
Many will recall the censorship debates of the 1960's.  These debatesover 20 years agowere about the interference of the State in what was perceived to be literature and the arts. Some saw these debates as a battle between the literati and the philistines over the survival of both new and old writings.
It was against that background that the Attorney-General in 1973, Lionel Murphy, announced a policy on censorship which read as follows:
“Federal laws to conform with the general principles that adults should be entitled to read, hear and view what they wish in private and in public and that personsand those in their carebe not exposed to unsolicited material offensive to them.”
It is ironic that this policy formed by the literati during the censorship debates of the late 60's and announced as policy in the early 70's should be used as a slogan in the 80's, 90's and new millennium to exempt from general censorship guidelines only one type of video in the ACThard core pornography produced by philistines to make a fast buck.
As the Joint Select Committee on Video Material observed
“When the principle that adults be free to see, hear and read what they choose was originally stated as public policy the number of video tapes entering Australia was insignificant and there was not the widespread availability of objectionable video publications as exist today as the result of a flood of these materials into Australia.
This principle is often stated but not adhered to in practice since adults are not free to view video material depicting interalia child pornography, bestiality and sexually explicit violent pornography as these are banned under censorship guidelines and prohibited from entry into Australia under Customs Regulations.
The principle that adults be free to see, hear and read what they choose is dependent on the pornographers claimed right to freedom of expression and the balancing of this claimed right against requirements fundamental to the common good which legislators are bound to uphold.
The issue now is not whether there should be censorship as was the case in 1973 when the principle was first stated as public policy but where to draw the line.  The Committee considers that the current line is not appropriately drawn.”
The fact is that we do have film censorship in this country with the one exemption referred to above.  In general, those who constantly parrot the Murphy policy in practice do not really regard it as a principle to be applied universally and uniformly but rather as a slogan to be used selectively and arbitrarily when it suits.
So the question in the real world in which we live is where to draw the line.  For anyone who, like myself, has a passionate commitment to principles of civil liberties public policy relating to censorship (and availability) must be soundly based and not deprive persons of their civil rights.
DEFINITION OF TERMS
A moral philosophical analysis of the concept of censorship generally and of the censorship of pornography in particular so as to determine what censorship it is and whether it can be said to have any moral philosophical justification is required.  The study of moral philosophy involves the examination of the principles which underlie all human actions and conduct.  To conduct such an analysis therefore we must examine the principles involved in censorship and determine if they are consistent and universal.  Fundamental principles upon which human actions are based may be expressed in words.  The words used in an analysis of this kind must be tested and rigorously examined.  Therefore it is essential that the terms used are defined and examined.  To define these terms, and thus transform them from rhetorical abstractions into definite principles is fundamental to moral philosophy.
Take the word “censorship”.  This is a word with prehistoric roots and rather interesting origins.  Philologists tell us that in the hypothetical Indo-European language which is the basis of nearly all European speech, “censor's” ultimate ancestor is the root word “kens” which meant “to assess, to set in order, to make known to authority”.  This gave rise to a number of descendant words, including the Greek word : “Cosmos” (the ordered universe) and eventually the Latin verb “censere” (to judge, order or evaluate).  From this “census” was derived, since the Roman census was originally a tax assessment, and finally “censor”. 
This title was held by two magistrates elected by the Comitia Centuriata in Republican Rome who conducted the census.  Eventually the power of these magistrates grew until they became the official arbiters of Roman manners and morals, with far-reaching authority from which not even the Senate and Consuls themselves were exempt.  Thus the word “censorship” in English tended to become associated with the act of enforcing moral standards.
CONNOTATIONS
Whilst the word's origins are of interest, it is also useful to remember its popular connotations.  These connotations are, on the whole, negative.  Censorship has the association of narrow-minded, reactionary interference.  It gained this mainly as a result of the rear-guard action fought by the champions of Victorian morality in the first half of this century, in a time when the perceived absolutes upon which that morality was based appeared to be crumbling.  As a result censorship came to be seen by many as the enemy of art, and therefore of free expression.  Books such as Joyce's Ulysses and Lawrence's Lady Chatterly's Lover were banned, and as late as the Nineteen-Sixties film-makers were struggling to convince authorities that nudity does not necessarily constitute obscenity. 
The result of all this is that the idea of censorship being a blinkered and dangerous threat to freedom lies in the near background of the word's common usage.  The other misuse of censorship perpetrated on a grand scale this century was its application in insidious partnership with propaganda.  Thus censorship has acquired connotations of mis-information and mind control; it is often seen as a step towards a repressive totalitarianism.  While both these negative connotations lie in the background (the Oxford English Dictionary does not acknowledge them) nonetheless they continue to have an effect on the word's usage, as any examination of the censorship debate will show.CENSORSHIP DEFINED
It is these kind of connotations which lead to semantic blurring which complicates and confuses debates such as the one over censorship;  it is part of the task of the moral philosopher to make the terms of the discussion clearer.  With this in mind we must move away from the word “censorship” as a rhetorical abstraction to the term “censorship” expressing a principle which will stand up to scrutiny and perhaps provide a philosophical basis for the concept of censorship.  To do this we must arrive at an adequate definition of censorship.  To begin with therefore, censorship can be defined as the application of a carefully balanced and judiciously evaluated assessment of that which is conducive to the essential common good of an equal, liberal and life-affirming society.  (Note that here “liberal” is used in the sense of “upholding liberty or freedom”).
It is important to consider the nature of “society” in an analysis of the justification, or lack of justification, for censorshipsince many of the arguments against censorship are based on the right of the individual within society.  If we take the definition provided in the Oxford English Dictionary as adequate, then society is,
a system or mode of life adopted by a body of
individuals for the purposes of harmonious
co-existence for mutual benefit.
Thus a society is made up of a large number of individuals or groups of individuals who live within that society because it provides benefits which autonomous individuals could no provide for themselves.  For example, welfare support, defence in war, legal protection and so on.  In other words they strive for “mutual benefit”, the common good.  These individuals try to achieve this common good through harmonious co-existence.  So ideally they try to keep their individual interests from threatening that harmony.  There are three basic rights which this harmony contains and preserves in all advanced societies.  These are:
(i)   the essential equality of all humans,
(ii)  the essential freedom of all humans, and
(iii) the essential dignity of all human life.  
The harmony which gives rise to mutual benefit in society is the result of a balancing of these rights.  If any of these three is considered more important than the others then the balance is lost and disharmony results.
MILL MISAPPLIED
Once again, in common usage the term “society” is not usually thought of as clearly as the Oxford English Dictionary would have us believe.  It is influenced by a great many diverse and, at times, conflicting elements.  Once again it is this blurring of principles into words which leads to confusion.  For example, many thinkers this century have been influenced by the ideas of the utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill.  Mill prized individualism greatly and freedom of expression was fundamental to his ideas about society.  He considered the concept of “the open market-place of ideas” to be vital and that, on the whole, the enforced imposition of paternalistic majorital wisdom was detrimental to society.  Mill was certainly a noted philosopher, but there is a tendency to apply his ideas out of their context.  To begin with, Mill was writing about a future society which he hoped could be formed;  one in which “individualism” meant breaking away from accepted ideas in order to strive after higher ones, one where people were thus constantly trying to better themselves and society.  
It is inappropriate to apply his individualist ideas to advocate or protect a society where this is not the case, or one which is devoted not to striving  for higher things but to simple self-gratification or to materialism and the profit motive.  Secondly, it is a further misapprehension of Mill to suppose his discouragement of the imposition of majorital wisdom to be a condemnation of all interference by the society as a whole in the wishes of the individual.  He himself made it clear that,
the sole end for which mankind are warranted,
individually or collectively, in interfering
with the liberty of action of any of their
number is self-protection.  The only purpose
for which power can be rightfully exercised 
over any member of a civilised community,
against his will, is to prevent harm to others.
(J.S. Mill, On Liberty)
Despite this, the idea that any interference by society into the affairs of the individual is an infringement of that individual's freedom continues to be based on these popular misapplications of Mill's philosophy.
Even if the philosophical origin of this idea is based on misapprehensions however, there may still be some substance to it.  This idea is certainly the basis of almost all arguments against censorship.  However, on analysis, these arguments seem to be based on a semantic blurring around the word “freedom”.  Within the context of common usage “freedom”, like “society” and “censorship”, has acquired many shades of meaning; including those which tend toward meaning “autonomy”.
“FREEDOM” AND “AUTONOMY” NOT SYNONOMOUS
When discussing the concept of censorship in society and the freedom of the individual however it is clear that “freedom” cannot mean anything close to “autonomy”, since no-one who is in a society can be autonomous.  Thus, within a society, an individual is free, ie. he has liberty, but he cannot by definition have autonomy.  The fact that he is within that society carries with it the idea that he should strive for mutual benefit with his fellow societal members through harmonious  co-existence.  If the purpose of society is to provide this mutual benefit through the encouragement of harmony then it follows logically that it is also its purpose to discourage anything which is disharmonious.  Thus it is the responsibility of that society to aid its purpose by 
(i)	defining what is conducive to harmony and what is not, and 
(ii)	encouraging harmonic elements while discouraging disharmonic ones.  
As we stated before, this harmony which gives rise to mutual benefit is based on a careful balance of equality, liberty, and dignity of life.  Therefore if an individual or group acts in such a way that it encroaches on, threatens or violates any of these rights in another individual or group, they are causing disharmony. 
BALANCE TO PROTECT FROM ABUSE
It is the responsibility of their society to protect itself, and preserve its essential purpose, by restricting the actions of those individuals. To claim that in so doing the society is denying one of those rights itself, the right to freedom (of speech), is to misapprehend societies' function. To maintain harmonious co-existence, society must not let any of these rights dominate the others; it must maintain the balance. To curtail some aspect of an individual's freedom is not to deprive him of that freedom, but to bring it back into line with the balance of rights which make up harmonious co-existence: which is the whole aim of society.
So, to claim censorship is unjustifiable is to 
(i)	deny that society's essential function is to promote mutual benefit through harmonious co-existence (curtailing the abuse of some rights which threaten others), and to 
(ii)	deny that society must, by the very nature of this function, maintain this balance by curtailing aspects of some right in order to preserve others.  
EXAMPLE OF MURDER
We can see that harmonious balance must be maintained in this way by taking the rather morally clear-cut example of murder. In a sense a murderer is an individual committing a free act expressing his freedom within society.  He is therefore exercising an aspect of one of his basic rights.  An advanced society however, would not condone his action because it completely violates the rights of his victim.  The murderer violates the victim's right to the essential dignity of human life, by taking that life by force.  He also violates the victim's right to human equality since, by his action, the murderer is implying that his victim is not his equal. In addition to this, the murderer's action threatens the rights of all individuals within society, and therefore society itself, by stating implicitly that his rights are more important than anyone else's.  
Therefore, society must protect itself by 
(i)	defining murder as a disharmonious and thus undesirable action, and 
(ii)	going to appropriate lengths to prevent murder.
By curtailing this particular expression of freedom society is to bring the murderer's right to freedom back in line with the balance of rights upon which all societies' benefits are based.
Now to consider the above principles in relation to the example of the censorship of pornography.
DEBATE NOT ABOUT TASTE
It is important that we are clear about the nature of the video material which is the subject of this debate. It is not typically material which is simply gratuitous in regard to sexual matters to the extent that it is crude, tasteless and vulgar, rather than pornographic. Nor is it video material which includes simulated dramatic depictions of sexual acts in the development and treatment (whether serious or humorous) of themes involving human sexuality which in context and intent are not pornographic.
The video material with which this debate is concerned can properly be described as non violent degrading pornography.
“HARD CORE PORNOGRAPHY”
“X”-rated video material is described officially by the Federal Government in its explanatory memorandum to the Australian Capital Territory Ordinance as “hard core pornography”.
In the words of the Joint Select Committee on Video material it treats women “as sexual commodities to arouse the sexual desires of its target audience” and “reduces persons to objects or occasions of sexual pleasure”. The Film Censorship Board's bland description of material contained in the “X” classification fails to convey the exploitative and degrading nature of “X”-rated videos which promote sexually promiscuous (AIDS-high risk) behaviour. Although physically non-violent, this material cannot be described as NVE (Non-Violent Erotica) without violating the true meaning of  the word erotic.
“SEXUALLY CALLOUSED AND MANIPULATIVE ORIENTATION TOWARDS WOMEN”
Evidence cited by the Joint Select Committee Majority shows that such material engenders as “sexually calloused and manipulative orientation towards women”. It mediates in the mind of the habitual viewer a perception of women in general as being highly promiscuous and available.
It is interesting to note that at least four behavioural scientists whose research was submitted to the Committee saw non-violent pornographic videos as more harmful in this regard even than the violent explicit pornography which has already been banned.
INCITEMENT TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT
The Joint Select Committee on Video Material stated
“Women are often depicted as sexually malleable for the purposes of satisfying male sexual desires.  This is sometimes manifested by themes involving workplace sexual favours.”
FUNCTIONS SIMILAR TO RACIST PROPAGANDA
Of considerable interest to me as one dedicated to upholding civil liberties and human rights are the observations of Professor Zubrzychi Emeritus Professor of Sociology, ANU, in the Canberra Times of 24 July 1988
“Pornography functions quite similarly to anti-Semitic or racist propaganda: it serves as a tool of anti-female propaganda. The intent of all three is to distort the image of a group or class of people, to deny their humanity, to make them objects of humiliation, to use them for whatever purpose.”
PORNOGRAPHERS CLAIMED RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION VIOLATES OTHER RIGHTS
Clearly the abuse of the pornographers claimed rights to freedom of expression can rightly be said to violate the rights of citizens to equality, freedom and human dignity.  
This is particularly so in relation to women.  It is also relevant in this debate to consider the AIDS implications of allowing pornographers to promote high risk AIDS behaviour through hard core pornographic videos.
Society therefore has a right to curtail the abuse of the pornographers claimed right of freedom of expression in order to maintain a proximate and long term harmonic cohesiveness within an equal, liberal and life affirming society. 
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES ENTITLED TO ACT
Whilst most people would accept that argument a problem appears to arise when the word “society” is replaced by the words “the State” or “the Government”.
It is this which leads to the objection that people do not need governments to tell them how they should live.  In the practical application of censorship “society” as an amorphous whole cannot protect itself, but the state, or, to be more specific, the government of the time, which acts on behalf of society can.  It cannot be denied that, as the legally elected representatives of a society it is the government which must make the balanced and judicious assessment of what is conducive to the common good and apply it.  Since governments must make such assessments responsibly, they must make themselves as conversant as possible with all the relevant facts and base their assessment on them.  
This is not to say that censorship cannot be abused.  If a society's assessment is not balanced and judicious, (for example, because it is not based on all relevant facts) or if it is misapplied (for example because a government wants to suppress certain kinds of expression) then it is not fulfilling its essential function.  The task of objectively balancing rights to maintain the common good is certainly a difficult thing to expect our legislature and judiciary to achieve, but we already expect these bodies to decide on matters just as difficult on our society's behalf.
WHY NOT COURTS?
It may be argued that the issue should be left with the Courts.  The issue of “obscenity” was rarely raised in the Courts and in any event the common law offence of obscene libel in relation to material that has been classified is no longer available in the ACT.  The reliance on Courts to apply the obscenity test are costly and cumbersome.
DOES CENSORSHIP OF PORNOGRAPHY THREATEN DEMOCRACY?
Some people argue that any kind of censorship threatens the right to free expression and, by implication, our democratic way of life.  In the case of censorship, this argument is a red herring.
Because the harm with which the proposed censorship seeks to deal is generic to pornography, censoring pornography has no implications for the rights to participate in political life.  To argue that it threatens the free communication of political ideas to censor images which, by their very nature, are harmful, is to debase the nature of political discourse.  Such an argument confuses the nature and purpose of free political activity with the nature and purpose of pornography.  But free political action and pornography are radically incompatible.  The former is concerned with the preservation and development of human rights, the latter with destroying them.
Pornography takes away the dignity of women and propagandises the idea that women are fit only to be the sexual chattels and slaves of men.  By thus attacking the dignity of women, pornography undermines the status due to full participants in the free society.
If women really have so little dignity that society can tolerate the mass dissemination of pornography, then women should be disenfranchised.  On the other hand, if women are entitled to the franchise, then they should be treated with a dignity commensurate with their political rights.
A society which tolerates pornography, and claims at the same time to be democratic, is pure hypocrisy.  The censorship of pornography, therefore, does not threaten political freedom, but in reality strengthens it.
CONCLUSION
While it is true that censorship is a necessary element in our imperfect society, it cannot be denied that is also a difficult and challenging one.  Censorship rests firmly of the principles of equality, liberty, dignity and on the concept of society itself.  It has a sound moral philosophical basis of justification.
BRIAN HARRADINE",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) CHARGES BILL 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,24,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-03-08,"—I rise to speak on these bills. Senator Bolkus has indicated on behalf of the opposition that we will oppose the substance of the bills, which is to place a new tax regime via the Office of Film and Literature Classification. There are other parts of the bills he said that we would support. I normally would not have chosen to speak on these bills, but I think in view of certain circumstances and certain publicity in recent times, not just in the last 24 hours but over the last few years, it is about time a few more of us in this parliament stood up and declared that we do not accept the conservative view of some members in this place and some members of the government who are rolling back the reasonable censorship regime that has worked successfully in this country for the last 30-odd years. I am one of those who oppose what Senator Harradine is doing. He knows this. We have had this debate on a number of occasions in this place and on Senate committees. I oppose what National Party members have done in the last two days, claiming great credit that they rolled the Attorney-General of this country, who had reached agreement with the state attorneys-general over the introduction of what he called the `nonviolent erotica' classification. 
There is a wider agenda that the conservative elements in this parliament and in the community are about. I think they have to be opposed. It ought to be clear to the Australian public that there are many members of this parliament who are willing to stand up and oppose that conservative, narrow-minded agenda that treats adults as children. I am proud of the fact that when I came into the Labor Party in the late 1960s-early 1970s it was at the beginning of the great leadership of Gough Whitlam and Don Dunstan, two great leaders in the last 50 years of the Labor Party. With Lionel Murphy as shadow Attorney-General, they wrote the policy for the Labor Party which was adopted at the 1971 national conference and which Senator Harradine quoted tonight. It is still in the platform, as adopted at the last convention. It states:
Labor believes that adults should be entitled to read, hear and see what they wish in private and in public, subject to adequate protection against persons being exposed to unsolicited material offensive to them and preventing conduct exploiting, or detrimental to the rights of others, particularly women and children.
That has basically been our policy since 1971. Fortunately, previously in the Liberal Party there was Don Chipp, who was a customs minister in the late 1960s, and others who took a similar view about the right of adults to choose for themselves what they read, see, hear and do in private. As Pierre Trudeau, the great Canadian Prime Minister of the 1960s said, `The state has no right in the bedroom of adult citizens of a democratic country.' We have seen the National Party skiting here today that they rolled the Attorney-General, supported by Senator Harradine. They want to be in the bedroom conducting a moral test on what adult Australians should be able to do as consenting adults in the privacy of their homes. That is what the agenda of the conservatives is. In the press today, we have seen mention of the Lyons Foundation supporters. I have to say to you, Senator Harradine, and to those others, there are enough of us in the Australian community and in this place to stand and fight you on this, because what you are about is demeaning to adults. It has been demeaning for a long time for people to say, `We know better than other ordinary Australians about what you can see, hear and read.'
The rules that have been established for the Office of Film and Literature Classification by a previous Labor government—by and large supported by previous Liberal attorneys-general and the present Liberal Attorney-General—have worked well in this country. Any public surveys show that 70 to 80 per cent of Australians believe the present censorship regime has got the balance about right. But there is a small minority in this parliament and in the Australian community saying, `No, we want to roll it back to somewhere in the 1930s and 1940s.' That is when you had the joke of the customs department opening letters and checking whether they contained what they called pornography. Senator Harradine and members of the National Party have used that term here today. In the 1960s they would have banned Lady Chatterly's Lover as pornography.
 (Senator Crowley)—And they did.
—And they did. And they banned it for decades.
—I rise on a point of order. Are you suggesting by your interjection, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I would have done that, as is being alleged by the speaker? I am asking you a question.
—You are objecting to me, are you?
—No, I am objecting to the interjection by the chair.
—Senator Harradine, there is no point of order. I must say that I failed to appreciate that the mike was on. I was in error and I apologise. 
—There is no doubt that the people who are today trying to roll back the present rules under the guise of banning pornographic videos are the same group of people, the successors to those in the 1950s and 1960s, who would have banned Lady Chatterly's Lover or a whole range of books. Remember the joke of the former chief secretary of Victoria in the 1960s, Sir Arthur Rylah, saying he wanted to ban the book called The Group by Mary McCarthy, because I think it mentioned a few sexual things that he said his 14-year-old daughter would not have liked to read? He did not have a 14-year-old daughter. It is always the way. You see letters in the paper from `Concerned mother of five' or `Concerned of eight'— there is always the claim that they speak on behalf of others they think they are protecting.
The regime on censorship that was adopted in this country as a result of the reform by the Labor Party going right back to the Whitlam government makes it clear that things that are illegal such as bestiality and child pornography are banned. They are banned by the Office of Film and Literature classification. If you put those things in a movie or in a book and you circulate it, it will not get a classification and you will be charged. If you are found with it, you will be taken to court and, if found guilty, you will get a severe sentence. There has never been a suggestion—by any of us in the community who believe in being able to read and see in private what we like as consenting adults—that we want any of that made available. We have completely supported the right of the Office of Film and Literature Classification to ban that type of thing by not giving it a classification. 
Those with a narrow-minded view who want the videos banned try to imply that those items currently given an X classification—which I think is a reasonable description—do have bestiality and child pornography in them, but they have never been able to prove it to the Office of Film and Literature Classification. When that office does get such an example, they do not classify it and the person takes the risk of being charged if they are using it or circulating it. That is an excellent system. It is being undermined for other purposes by the National Party and by Senator Harradine. He has been consistent on this issue over the whole 25 years he has been in this place. If nothing else, he has been consistent in campaigning on it. I think he is absolutely wrong. 
He talks about demeaning women. It is interesting that he only ever talks about demeaning women; he does not talk about demeaning men in these X-rated moves. He does not seem to think it is conceivable that there may be women in the world who actually like being in a blue or X-rated movie. If a woman consents to be in the movie through no force or duress, that is her business. It is in private, and she has made that decision. It seems to me that it is always the women who are being exploited. If they are being exploited and forced to do these things, that is against the law. If you have examples of that, Senator Harradine or Senator Boswell or Senator McGauran, go to the police immediately and say, `These people are being forced to do this against their will', and action will be taken. So it is extraordinary that they make out that these people are being abused and are doing this against their will. That is against the law, as it should be.
The next thing I find extraordinary is that the National Party is raising this issue. There is one National Party government in this country called the Country Liberal Party of the Northern Territory. Did they ban X-rated videos? Of course not. They have accepted them. You can make them and distribute them from the Northern Territory. In 25 years of continuous Country Liberal Party government I have never seen any CLP minister, Attorney-General or Chief Minister saying they are going to ban X-rated videos, as they have in the other states. In the ACT, we have a Liberal Chief Minister, Kate Carnell. Is she moving to ban the industry that makes, reproduces and mails out the X-rated videos? Of course not. She has turned it into a great little tax earner. But, again, she is doing it in accordance with the rules laid down over the last 30 years by the Office of Film and Literature Classification.
Next I hear Ron Boswell get up and say, `We in the National Party represent the family.' Senator Boswell from the good old Country Party of the past says, `We represent the farmers. We represent rural conservatives.' I suggest that Senator Boswell should go down to the people who distribute the X-rated videos under the law as they are entitled to by mail subscription around the country and find out how many thousands of the videos are mailed every month to his good old family people in country Australia. I bet he will be surprised. 
The next thing he and Senator Harradine say is it is only for men. There is apparently some evidence in the mail subscription industry that sends these out that they are overwhelmingly going to married couples. They may be lying, Senator Harradine—by the laughter of your interjection—but apparently there is some evidence that a lot of these X-rated videos are going to married couples. Adults in private are enjoying them as they want to without any interference from anybody else. There is no evidence that they go out and create mayhem in the community.
I would be interested to hear from Senator Harradine, Senator McGauran, the National Party and others who jump up and down about this how they explain that for 3,000 or 4,000 years before X-rated videos were invented—they were invented in the last 20 years—there was always a problem in society with sexual abuse and sexual exploitation. It did not take X-rated videos to increase the rape level or child abuse in Australia or in the Western world. Unfortunately, anyone who studies history will know that these crimes have been committed regularly and consistently in society throughout the last 4,000 years of recorded history. So the argument that this leads to an epidemic of abuse just does not stand up.
I want to turn to the remarkable events of the last 24 hours—and Senator Bolkus mentioned this as well in his remarks. In today's Sydney Morning Herald the National Party were skiting about how they had rolled the Attorney-General and forced the legislation with the nonviolent erotica category to be referred back to the Attorney-General for further consideration. The article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Margo Kingston states:
Mrs Kelly decided on Monday night she wanted to see some NVE videos. Mr Williams's office refused because that would constitute an unlawful “public view”.
Mrs Kelly contacted Senator Harradine, who happened to have four of the most extreme examples, organised an audience, and gave them his briefing notes. 
One viewer said: “This isn't erotic. Erotica is arthouse stuff, a sensual depiction.”
I will take three guesses at which dopey National Party member said, `This isn't art house stuff.' We know which ones run around trying to find movies they can ban and so on under the guise that it is art house or not art house. 
It is interesting that, when the Attorney-General said, `I can't provide you with an NVE video, it is illegal,' they went to the one person who apparently does have a collection of them—Senator Harradine. I believe in the privileges of parliament, Senator Harradine, so I do not want you arrested, but it is interesting that they did not go to those of us who actually support the principle of adults in private to see whether we had any. I do not have any and never had any. They went to Senator Harradine, who apparently has the best collection in parliament. I just think this is an obsession that some senators should get over and get back to having a more mature attitude about what adults in a modern society should do.
Unfortunately, since this government got elected we have had a persistent and consistent pattern of undermining the view that we are a mature adult democratic country. The Prime Minister and other ministers have consistently rolled over, first of all to cater to Senator Harradine when his vote was important in this place on these sorts of issues. It was exposed at the Senate estimates committee by my colleagues last year how the appointments to the review panel of the Office of Film and Literature Classification were done. The office put up a list of people whom they had interviewed after calling for nominations from the community. So what happened? Somehow or other John Howard believed that they were not conservative enough. Out of the blue other names were found and they got appointed. So we know this government made an attempt to cater for the conservatism of Senator Harradine by rigging the appointments of people to the panel. 
Debate interrupted. ",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) CHARGES BILL 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,24,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-03-08,"—I rise tonight to talk about Shaping up—the government's white paper into the future of Australian sport—and the problems facing elite sport in Australia because of foreshadowed funding cuts. First of all, the history of this white paper says a lot about a government ignorant of the problems facing elite sport and unable—or unwilling—to face the tough policy issues involved in sport and recreation. During the last federal election the coalition made a commitment to the Australian sporting community. According to their policy document, the coalition would:
... commission a White Paper on sport and recreation post-2000, to lay the base for a comprehensive policy statement that addresses principles, defined policy goals and objectives.
Given that the post-Olympic landscape is so uncertain and there is a high level of anxiety among both Olympic and non-elite sporting organisations, an inquiry into our sporting future was not unjustified. It was, in fact, in desperate need of occurring, in light of the coalition's mismanagement of the sports portfolio since they were elected. The opposition, however, was rightly concerned about the manner in which the Minister for Sport and Tourism, Jackie Kelly, established this review, and in hindsight our concerns have been justified 10 times over. In the first place when the white paper was announced there were already a number of inquiries into sport under way, including an Australian Sports Commission internal review and a National Elite Sports Council inquiry into the organisation and delivery of funding to elite sport after the 2000 Olympics.
Then it took the minister over seven months to find four task force members to conduct the white paper review, but she allowed just four months for them to report back. That is half the time it took her to come up with the task force members. The white paper task force, which the minister subsequently renamed the Oakely review, was late in getting their report completed—understandably, I believe, given the enormous task they faced in preparing such a major document. And indeed this document was supposed to come up with a plan for the future of Australian sport.
And didn't the minister talk up this white paper as a major government policy document. We heard more about the potential of this white paper to solve the government's policy dilemmas with sport than anything else. Here is just a sample of what Minister Kelly has said about the Shaping up white paper: it will lead to the `greatest change in the administration of Australian sport and recreation in recent history'; it is `the most far reaching assessment of Australian sport in 20 years'; and it is `the most thorough look at sport and the sports industry in Australia in 25 years'. These are all quotes from Minister Kelly.
The white paper was eventually completed at a cost of over $270,000, an enormous amount of money considering sporting organisations are busy preparing to slash programs and services in the light of coalition funding cuts. Furthermore, the minister promised that the government would be officially responding to the white paper `in early 2000'. It is early 2000, and this white paper into the future of Australian sport is collecting dust on a shelf in Minister Kelly's office. It is a pretty expensive bookend at a total cost of $270,000. 
During the last round of Senate estimates I tried to find out just when in `early 2000' the government would be producing their response and why the minister is refusing to address its controversial recommendations. These were questions I asked. It will not come as a big surprise to the sporting community—who did work extremely hard in preparing their submissions for this inquiry—that the white paper actually recommends an increase in funding for sport. This is not what Minister Kelly wanted to hear. I remind you that at the time my suspicions were that indeed this whole process of a white paper was to establish some public imprimatur for a further cut to federal funding. But look what happened. The coalition is busy slashing $25 million out of the sporting program through the loss of the Olympic Athlete Program and reducing their funding for sport and recreation after the Sydney Olympics. That has led to the minister wanting to bury the white paper. It did not come up with the recommendations she was looking for. Solution: put it on a shelf and let it gather dust, and proceed with the funding cuts.
During Senate estimates Mr Robert Crick, head of the Sport and Tourism Division of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, denied that Shaping up is a white paper, which the coalition promised at the last election, backing off at 100 miles an hour. For the record, a white paper is `an official report or policy proposal of a government on a specific subject'. Yet when I asked Mr Crick if Shaping up is a policy paper, he told me that is not a definition of a white paper. He then qualified his answer by saying:
I think there was an intention initially and it was foreshadowed that the government would produce a white paper. A decision was made, however, as an initial sort of step towards a process of producing a policy statement on sport post-2000, that a review would be undertaken by an independent panel of people well experienced and expert in the area ...
There it is on the public record: either Minister Kelly has broken an election promise to commission a white paper into sports funding or she has kept her promise and chooses now to bury the paper because she did not like its recommendations. Either way, it is an appalling indictment of the government and the minister, because the Australian sporting community is in desperate need of long-term policy and funding structures to be set in place before the Sydney Olympics.
There is no point in addressing the white paper's recommendations after the next budget. Why? While the opposition has many concerns about some of the recommendations in this white paper, we certainly concur with its conclusion that Commonwealth funding is essential in the battle to increase sporting participation and encourage active lifestyles amongst individuals and the community. The most important aspect of Commonwealth funding to the sports sector is to ensure security and continuity of those community organisations which do provide the infrastructure to allow people to be active, healthy and sometimes in their competitive sport participate in compellingly interesting pastimes during their leisure hours. At the moment, elite and Olympic athletes, coaches and organisations are facing massive cuts to their programs—and at least a half a dozen will be axed from the AIS—because of funding shortfalls.
In the last round of Senate estimates the Australian Sports Commission revealed that once the $25 million Olympic Athlete Program—OAP—ceases later this year there will be a reduction in funding for all sports. The commission made it clear that they have told all fields of sport not to enter into contractual arrangements that rely on OAP funding beyond 31 December 2000. This means that, unless increased funding is provided, many Olympic coaches and athletes will head overseas. It also means that Olympic sports like gymnastics, water polo, canoeing, squash, and some track and field and swimming programs may be axed, regardless of their achievements at the Sydney Olympics. In other words, we may face the situation where Australia wins medals in Olympic sports that the AIS will later have to cut because of a lack of funds. I was also told in estimates that the Sports Commission will have to shed jobs in light of the loss of OAP funding.
I find this quite amazing because the sports industry is very much a growth industry. It provides millions of dollars in revenue for state and federal governments—as we shall see when the Olympics occur. That is why the Labor Party believes that investing in both elite, community-based and participatory sport is of essential long-term benefit to the wellbeing of the nation. There will be no Olympic legacy without a continuing investment in athletes, coaches, administrators and support staff and there will not be significant benefits from the Commonwealth investment in sport unless that investment is continuous, consistent and balanced. Unfortunately, none of these three elements is apparent in Minister Kelly's approach to the portfolio. As I said, the white paper contains many recommendations that the opposition disagrees with. However, to simply ignore a document and hope it goes away is an abrogation of responsibility. All of these issues need to be openly discussed and debated rather than shelved. It is not enough to provide funds for the Sydney Olympics and then throw up your hands and say, `We won't fund sport.' To secure our sporting future and retain the legacy that Australia deserves from hosting the Olympics, we must retain our top athletes and coaches. I am concerned that we will lose them when they feel that they have no job security in Australia after the Olympics. Moreover, the AIS and the Sports Commission should not be placed in the position of having to cut programs and tell young athletes that they are no longer wanted because of funding cutbacks.
