"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-09-11,"—by leave—I want to restate an argument the Democrats have put again and again, this year and last year, about the number of sitting days. This motion will take away two sitting days and bring pressure on the Senate to deal with legislation again during the late hours of the last few days of sitting, which takes a very big toll on all of us and on the staff. We urge the government to find alternative sitting days to replace those.
We do support the proposal that four days be set aside for the Senate estimates hearings. We think that is important, but it means the removal of two days of sitting from what is already a very low number of sitting days in the year. In fact, that number now matches last year's number which was an all-time low for a year which did not have a general election. I wish to record our protest that two more sitting days are going. Again, this means there is going to be less time for the Senate to deal with important legislation and more likelihood of us having to rush through bills in the early hours of the morning. Apart from the fact, as I said, that that puts a lot of stress on all of us, it means that the debate on those bills will be less thorough than it might otherwise have been.

At the end of item 1A, add:
18B  Publication of agreement on Internet
		The Commonwealth Minister must cause the Authority to publish the agreement or any amendment of the agreement on its website within 15 sitting days of either House of the Parliament of the agreement being made or amended by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers.
The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 seeks to remove the capacity for ANTA agreements to be placed in the legislation at the time at which they have finished being negotiated and agreed to. The Australian Democrat amendment that we have previously been discussing moves to ensure that the minister tables the ANTA agreement in the parliament within 15 sitting days after the agreement has been made. The Australian Greens amendment that I have moved now to the Democrat amendment we were discussing comes as a result of interested parties having contacted the Australian Greens about the accessibility of the information in the ANTA agreement. The Australian Greens recognise the government's comments that they will be accepting the Australian Democrat amendment to table the information. 
Concerns were raised with us about the accessibility of that information, and so the Australian Greens have proposed that the information that is tabled in parliament also be available on the ANTA web site. It may come as some disappointment to senators to know that sometimes when things are tabled in parliament they can be lost in the sense of public accessibility to that information, so that is the basis in our amendment for having them accessible on the ANTA web site. It is part of a recognition that previously, interest groups and third parties were able to access the information as it was amended in the legislation. We believe that this amendment allows the web site to be recognised as a clear and distinct place where that information can be based. The Australian Greens originally would have preferred to have a shorter time frame in which the ANTA agreement was placed onto the web site, but after discussion with government and others on this issue we agreed to move an amendment which fits within the same time frame as the Australian Democrat amendment. I acknowledge the comments of the minister yesterday about accepting both amendments from the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens, and I commend the amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I was making some comments last night about these issues. I was, unfortunately, not aware that this matter was coming on so quickly.
—I was just not on the ball this morning. I was busy plotting and planning to do great mischief to this government, Senator Faulkner, and I am sure you will be pleased to hear that. The unfortunate consequence of that was that I was not able to make a few comments about these amendments. I have indicated that the opposition is supporting these amendments. The questions that have been raised, I think, are clearly worthy of support. Unfortunately, they do not necessarily go to the key issues that are at stake here and, if it was not for the provocative and I might say unhelpful comments by the minister at the table last night, I suspect that this bill may well have been dealt with last night. I draw that to the attention of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. It might be necessary for government members, in the final stages of this parliament, as they face the prospect of moving over to the other side of the chamber, to perhaps give advice to the ministers about what it takes to get legislation through. 
I would like, nonetheless, to raise one matter I have yet to raise in this debate, and that is to congratulate the government on its appointment of Mr Julius Roe to the ANTA board. I have known Mr Julius Roe for some years. While there has obviously been considerable debate about the structure of the ANTA board and the various personnel appointed to it, there comes a time occasionally when the government does make decisions which are appropriate for the welfare of this country. This is one of those occasions. The appointment of the National President of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union to a position on the ANTA board is a decision that is long overdue. Mr Roe would probably be one of a small group of specialists within the trade union movement. There is a great deal of interest and knowledge in the trade union movement about the operations of the vocational education system, but there would be few that could rival Mr Roe for a knowledge of the system and commitment to it, which he has developed over many years of experience. 
Mr Roe is a member of the Victorian Qualifications Authority. He is also an active member of the Joint Industry Training and Education Council, JITEC, and he has been working in this area for many years. I think he developed his interest while he was working for the tramways board in Melbourne, not as a manager in a management position but as a driver. He was heavily involved as he became an official of the Metal Workers Union from 1987. The Metal Workers Union have a longstanding commitment to vocational education and see themselves as a very important player in the ongoing welfare of this sector. They have devoted resources to it, which is highlighted by the fact that so many of their senior officials have committed to this type of work. I notice that Mr Hornrey, the chairman of the ANTA board, welcomed Mr Roe's appointment and I join with him in acknowledging the strength of this appointment. I look forward to Mr Roe's contribution.
ANTA has recently had some serious losses of staff. I do not say there is anything untoward in this, but the fact remains that the CEO and the deputy CEO have moved on. I think Ms Moira Scollay and Mr Paul Byrne equally did a first-rate job while they were there. There are new officers coming on board, and I think they have an enormous challenge before them, particularly in the context of their not really getting the full support of the government in regard to the importance of vocational education. Appointments such as Mr Julius Roe's will help make up the gap left by the government. This is where the real weakness is. The government has at least had the sense to acknowledge the strength of his commitment. It is a pity the government did not share it.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-11,"—Labor will be supporting the Migration Legislation Amendment (Sponsorship Measures) Bill 2003. In the winter session of parliament this year, when the bill was introduced into the House of Representatives, Labor signalled to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs that we would be supporting the bill in the House of Representatives and that when the matter came before the Senate we would be seeking a short inquiry by a Senate legislation committee. That inquiry has in fact been held and a report was tabled in this chamber in August this year which delivered some minor improvements to the original bill. The inquiry was to enable an examination of what is largely a technical change to the way in which the migration scheme works but a change we believe is warranted. However, while we are supportive of the specific proposals in this bill, Labor believes that for these proposals to be successful the government must improve its inept handling of the migration program and the minister must make much greater efforts to ensure the whole program is administered with greater integrity, transparency and humanity.
This bill deals with the question of sponsorship, which is a feature of a number of different visa classes. Sponsorship ensures that a permanent resident in Australia assumes responsibility for supporting and ensuring visa compliance by a person entering Australia. While sponsorship has become an increasingly common feature of the migration system, it has appeared visa class by visa class through regulations. The bill is designed to establish a legislative framework for a sponsorship regime. The framework established by the bill provides for the following: sponsorship to be a criterion for a valid visa application and for the granting of a visa, a process for the approval of sponsors, undertakings to be made by sponsors and mechanisms for the barring of sponsors.
The bill provides only a framework. The details of sponsorship requirements will be prescribed in regulations on a visa by visa basis. Clearly, Labor will be scrutinising these regulations as they are made and they can be disallowed by the parliament when we believe they are not consistent with the legislation. The framework contained in the bill provides that the matters dealt with, including prior approval of sponsorship, the enforcement measures and the barring provisions, are reviewable by the Migration Review Tribunal. 
The framework contained in the bill also provides that the enforcement measures proposed at this stage will apply only to temporary residents in Australia who have come here sponsored by businesses under the two specific business categories—the 457 business long-stay visa and the new professional development visa. Sanctions are not applicable to sponsors of people in other visa classes. I understand the government has been motivated to focus on enforcement issues for temporary residence for two reasons. Firstly, there has been much expressed concern about visa class 457, which is the business long-stay visa. It allows a person to be sponsored into Australia with some restriction for the purposes of employment. Labor has been pressing the minister to introduce sanctions against employers who breach their obligations. However, to date this has not happened. The minister has said that he is thinking about it, and thinking about it, and thinking, and thinking, and thinking. Actually he has been doing so much thinking it has been more than three years since his initial statements. However, through the Senate estimates process Labor has been able to establish that no specific legislation dealing with that point has been drafted. The sponsorship framework in this bill enables some of those enforcement matters to be dealt with in the visa class itself. 
The second main purpose for dealing with enforcement questions around temporary residence in Australia has been motivated by the newly heralded visa class dealing with professional development. This was part of the international education package which formed part of the budget related announcements around higher education. As part of the international education package there is a government commitment to the introduction of a professional development visa. This new visa is designed to enable training providers to deliver tailored academic and practical training for professionals, managers and government officials from overseas. This visa will enable Australian education providers to capture a portion of the growing market for such training, particularly from China in the lead-up to the Beijing Olympics. 
The application will be a two-step process of sponsorship approval and visa application. Only applicants with a sponsor will be approved. So the framework of this bill, as it does with sponsorship heralding the introduction of enforcement measures around temporary residence, obviously contemplates resolving some of the difficulties that we have had with the 457 business long-stay visa and ensuring that we have a robust system to obtaining compliance around the new professional development visa.
When we come to the question of the requirement for enforcement measures around these visas, and specifically visa 457, the business long-stay visa, it is time the government acted to deal with the problems that we face with the exploitation of this visa class. What we know about this visa class is that visa holders are sponsored by employers and the visa allows employers to sponsor an overseas employee if their business will advance skills through technology or training and the employer agrees to comply with Australian industrial laws. 
That is the technical requirement. Experience in the field is greatly to the contrary. There has been increasing evidence of unscrupulous employers sponsoring temporary workers into Australia on the basis of claiming a skill shortage and then exploiting these foreign workers. DIMIA evidence to Senate estimates has indicated that employers have breached industrial laws in the way in which many of these workers have been treated. Indeed, it is likely that the detected cases are only the tip of the iceberg. We do know that during the two years between July 2000 and May 2002 DIMIA recorded serious breaches by 24 sponsoring employers involving 63 subclass 457 visa holders. These breaches included underpayment, either below the award or below agreed amounts; taxation offences; excessive working hours; failure to provide superannuation; non-payment of overtime, penalties or other agreed payments; provision of substandard accommodation; demand for excessive payments or bonds in regard to accommodation; breach of occupational health and safety standards; unfair dismissal; and outright intimidation. 
The visa 457 is not the only temporary visa with which there has been a problem of exploitation of foreign labour. It is also clear that the temporary short-stay business visa subclass 456 is being exploited. There was evidence not long ago of a South African slave ring being set up and built up involving this visa class. Subclass 456 was created in 1995 and is issued on the basis that the activities the holder will be engaged in cannot be done by an Australian permanent resident or citizen. Clearly, that means that Australia would have to be in a circumstance of critical skills shortage in the relevant area.  
But we find this is not what is happening with this visa. In November 1997, in response to evidence that some visa subclass 456 holders were working for extended periods in Australia in relatively unskilled professions, the minister, Mr Ruddock, changed the scheme so that the application would only be accepted from outside Australia. While that was a well-motivated change, it has not fixed the problem. Applications for subclass 456 are accepted at most Australian overseas posts and it is not necessary to conduct a face-to-face interview before the visa is awarded. Electronic applications are invited and may be lodged by someone other than the applicant, such as an agent. It is possible that, if anything on the application were considered suspicious or raised questions, the applicant would be interviewed by DIMIA representatives at the mission where the application is lodged, although interviews do not occur as a matter of course. It is obviously very easy for the applicant or the agent simply to lie when completing the form. Given there is no way for DIMIA to check the validity of signatures on the form, forging signatures is easy.
The way in which these visas were misused was exposed by what became a notorious case of a South African man who was seriously injured in New South Wales in October 2002. He arrived in Australia in August 2002 on a 456 visa but was not a person with unique skills. He worked as a labourer in the construction industry, 14 hours a day, seven days a week, and was promised full remuneration for his labour when he returned to South Africa. His wife in South Africa is understood to have received a weekly stipend of $100. 
There were two deaths at the site, including the employer, also a South African national, and the man with the 456 visa was seriously injured. He was discharged from hospital in less than a week and against doctors' orders, despite his very serious injuries. He was placed on an Australia-Johannesburg flight paid for by his employer's widow. Investigations revealed that this visa was obtained by an Australian company which sent a request on a letterhead for a suitably qualified businessperson to travel to Australia to undertake commercial research. There is a lot of difference between commercial research and working on a building construction site. On the strength of the letter, the visa was granted and the man did not have to apply in person. DIMIA has confirmed that such business visas are commonplace. This is a very clear and graphic example of misuse of this visa. The man had no unique skills, he was not being employed in the occupation disclosed on the visa application and regrettably he was seriously injured in an accident on a construction site where all known health and safety standards were thrown out the window. Indeed, it was such a serious accident that two people were killed.
The minister has dismissed serious allegations raised by the South African government regarding the existence of similar schemes where black labour is exploited. However, evidence of abuse of the business visa continues to grow. There are lawyers who have claimed that three South African black chefs have been underpaid more than $300,000 by a Sydney restaurant which is operated by a white South African migrant. All three chefs were brought to Australia on 456 visas and transferred after three months to 457 visas. None would have been entitled to either visa subclass on any genuine application of the law and regulations and most of their earnings were repatriated to South Africa in rand. That clearly shows that there is a major problem with these visas in terms of compliance and they are not insignificant in number when you add them up across the globe. Labor says there is evidence that this government has refused to address the problem of illegal foreign workers. By that, I mean people who either are working here without an appropriate visa—that is, they may have come in as a tourist or under some other visa class and commenced to work in breach of visa conditions—or they have received a 456 or 457, even though, on any proper application of the law, they ought not to have received them. 
Why has the Howard Liberal government failed to act? We would say it is for two main reasons. Firstly, the Howard Liberal government has found it politically expedient to target boat people rather than to protect Australia from the real immigration challenge it faces, which is this kind of misuse of the migration system. Secondly, the Howard government has been too frightened to stand up to employers. The Howard government did nothing in this area until 1999 when DIMIA conducted the review of illegal workers in Australia. Following this review, the government launched initiatives in November 2002 to help employers to check work rights of prospective employees. This included a pilot workers' rights information line and a free-call centralised work rights fax-back facility. 
The government canvassed the possibility of a new legislative sanctions regime but received a very negative reaction, particularly from employers but most spectacularly from the National Farmers Federation. As I am sure senators in this chamber would be aware, the NFF were able to feed their views into the National Party, that very weak, wimpy and doormat partner of the Liberal Party. As a result of the kind of reaction received, the government backed down. Consequently, the only thing that happens to employers who employ illegal labour is that warning notices are issued. 
This legislation heralds the prospect that the government might do some things to finally address this area. As I indicated at the commencement of this debate, the details of the things the government is prepared to do will be contained in regulations relating to individual visa classes. On behalf of the Labor opposition, I put the government on notice that we will be scrutinising them very carefully to see whether or not they are adequate to meet the challenge or whether or not they have been moulded with one eye firmly on the reaction of employers, particularly the NFF—this case is one of the few times when the National Party has had any clout at all in decision making in this government. We will seek to ensure that the regulations for these visas address matters such as award wages and conditions and meet occupational health and safety standards. 
We will also continue to press the government to adopt Labor's green card proposal, which we believe is the key to making sure that we can crack down on illegal workers in this country. The green card was launched as Labor's policy at the end of last year. We believe it is a sensible measure to ensure compliance and to identify foreigners with work rights, which of course would mean it would be easier to identify foreigners without work rights. It is a comprehensive measure that includes changes to the tax file number system. Apart from loss of face, we see no reason why the Liberal Howard government could not seriously consider that policy and pick it up. We will continue to press the government to do so. 
I will deal briefly with the findings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. One of the reasons we asked the committee to look at the Migration Legislation Amendment (Sponsorship Measures) Bill 2003 was that the devil is in the visa regulation detail. Not surprisingly, when the committee looked at this bill they expressed some concern about this aspect of the legislation as well. In fact, in their conclusion the committee stated their concern that the proposed broad amendments do not establish a scheme that is transparent and that the committee's task of scrutinising this bill has been made more difficult by the lack of detail or information as to the ambit of proposed regulations. The committee also noted great concern about the possibility of the provisions in the bill being extended at some future time to other visa classes in the family stream, something which could indeed occur with further regulations being enacted. 
One of the key recommendations, recommendation 2, concerns how this could be dealt with. Because of the broad regulatory framework established by this bill, the committee recommends that the Senate ensure that future regulations made under these provisions are scrutinised most carefully to ensure that more onerous sponsorship obligations are not imposed without adequate justification and consultation, particularly in relation to family stream visitors, and that appropriate decisions are prescribed as reviewable by the Migration Review Tribunal.
One of the greatest concerns was the possibility that, under this legislation, sponsors would be held liable for potentially unlimited costs relating to locating, detaining and removing a sponsored person if the visa conditions were breached. This is covered in the notes to section 148 of the bill. While there was no argument with the requirement for sponsors to take some financial responsibility for their employees under a sponsored visa class, the new provisions could impose an unreasonable financial burden on employers, making sponsorship a business and making professional development applications an unattractive proposition. The committee recommended that either a regulatory impact statement be prepared before proposed section 148 may proceed or that the section be amended to provide that costs for locating and detaining a sponsored person are specifically excluded from the ambit of the regulations that may be made under that section. The opposition are therefore pleased that the government has agreed to recommendations from the Senate committee that there be a limit placed on the costs for each visa class. An amendment to this effect has been moved by the government.
Another aspect of concern that was raised by witnesses before the committee and by the committee itself was whether or not decisions regarding visa applications for sponsored visas should be reviewed by the MRT. The removal of the merits review could have serious consequences for individuals holding their sponsored visas. It seems like a very blunt tool to use for the purpose of preventing abuse. The committee also found in the course of its inquiry that the loophole being exploited by some of the current visa holders and applicants has already been addressed by two previous regulations, but the department failed to mention this in its submission to the committee. Once again, our concern about the integrity of the migration system and the transparency of its decision-making and legislative processes is not made easy by a finding such as this.
In considering submissions before the inquiry, and in questioning witnesses who appeared before the inquiry, there were a number of other concerns about the potential impact. The breakdown of the relationship between the visa holder and the sponsor is not uncommon. Some witnesses gave evidence that putting more onerous sponsorship obligations onto both parties could lead to a greater incidence of violence or intimidation of sponsored workers. 
On the issue of cancellation or barring of sponsors for temporary classes of visas under sections 140L, 140J and 140K, the lack of detail provided in the bill was noted again. The heavy reliance on future regulations to give further information made it difficult for the committee to properly scrutinise. At the end of the committee process, Labor senators agreed with the two recommendations put forward—for a regulatory impact statement and for careful scrutiny of future regulations made under these provisions. We agreed with concerns raised in the submissions, particularly those relating to the application of the proposed regime to sponsor family visitor visas, the ability of the MRT to review decisions on visas and sponsors, the impact of full sponsorship obligations in the context of violence and abuse and the breadth of possible sponsorship undertakings. The government has put forward amendments. With these reservations, we will support the passage of this bill; however, we will monitor carefully whether the spirit of the bill and these concerns are reflected in future regulations. We would also reiterate that the sanctions regime against employers, as outlined in this bill, is not anywhere near as rigorous or tough as that proposed by Labor and its policy announcement in 2002. This government refuses to get tough on employers for fear of losing their support in either financial or other terms. Regrettably, there will continue to be an abuse of the system in this way.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-09-11,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Sponsorship Measures) Bill 2003. The bill is designed to enable sanctions to be applied to sponsors of temporary entrants where those sponsors do not meet the agreements or the undertakings they put forward to sponsor somebody into Australia. It is designed to be particularly effective where there is a breach of formal undertakings given to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs by those sponsors. It is consistent with government policy, under which sponsors who bring visa holders to Australia should bear costs associated with them and plan for these costs when making a decision to sponsor an overseas person to come to Australia. 
This is a position that I have some sympathy with—as in many circumstances, with qualification. Those qualifications are: who it applies to and the extent to which the undertakings or the costs can be applied to people. I believe that, when people sponsor somebody for business purposes and say they are going to offer somebody a job and then do not do so, that sort of activity should clearly be penalised and sanctions should be able to be applied. The concern I have is when it is inadvertent breaching, particularly by sponsors who do not have a lot of resources. How best to divide those differences is something the bill does not seek to do and this leads to the possibility of regulations. The bill amends the act to apply to all visa classes, and it is drafted in such a way that the amendments cannot be activated unless and until specific regulations are made in relation to the enforceability of undertakings. That, in effect, is the crux of the problem before the Senate today.
The minister has written to me saying that sponsorships for the family stream, for example, will not be affected by these changes to the act, as specific regulations have not been made to cover these visas, to which I would have to add the words `not yet'. The government is initially proposing that the controls imposed by this act apply to only two major visa classes—the existing long-term business entry, visa class 457; and the new visa class, the sponsored training class or professional development visa. They may be the only two it will apply to at the moment, and the government may be giving undertakings that it will not apply to the family stream in the future but, unfortunately—unlike undertakings that sponsors give, whereby if those undertakings are breached sanctions are available—if undertakings the government gives are breached there is not much scope for sanction by the parliament or by anybody else. 
The problem the Democrats have is the lack of detail available for us to make an informed decision about the long-term impact of this bill. As Senator Sherry said, the devil is in the regulations' detail. Unfortunately we do not have that regulatory detail, so the devil is still out there somewhere—and who knows what he or she may get up to? This is a bill which leaves virtually all the detail to regulations—a bill which potentially affects all visa classes that are not permanent entry visas, and a bill which has 34 sections, all of which need regulations to provide the fine detail.
The government argues that this is a framework which the details will hang from, and they will be determined later in the day. It argues that the Senate have the power to scrutinise this detail and disallow the regulations if we do not like them. I will expand on the problem that may occur in relation to such a suggestion down the track. When the bill was before the Senate committee—and Senator Sherry has given a reasonably good outline of some of the concerns the committee had and some of the concerns that were raised in the submissions—a fairly frequent response by the department officials was, `If you do not like the detail that we bring in in regulations, you are free to disallow them.' I was somewhat willing to take that on trust. It always surprises me that, after so many years in this place, I continue to take things on trust—particularly from this government—but I was somewhat willing to do that.
Being on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and keeping a close eye on migration regulations in particular, certainly on a number of occasions I have thought areas worth examining to see whether they should be disallowed. On a few occasions, I have moved for the disallowance of parts of migration regulations—once or twice successfully; usually unsuccessfully. However, this government has just introduced a regulation—pertaining to a different matter, I must say—which is specifically designed to basically make it impossible to disallow a component part. The regulation was drafted in such a way that the disallowance will hurt a significant number of people around one area whilst trying to address the component that I have a strong opposition to.
I would be interested to ascertain how long the government feels it can keep saying to the parliament or the Senate, `Just pass this legislation, which gives us a whole range of powers that will be initiated once we get the regulations out there,' but not giving us the regulations and saying, `You can see the detail when they appear and, if you do not like it, deal with it then.' This is particularly relevant to another piece of legislation that is also before the committee at the moment, to do with empowering the department to require people to provide a range of personal identifiers. Again, it is legislation that will provide a lot of power, but the detail of what that power will be used for will still not be available until the regulations appear.
The point is not what is in this bill—or that other bill, for that matter—because we can examine what is in this bill; the point is what is not in this bill. We cannot know for sure. All we have before us is a framework. We have concerns—I believe very valid concerns—that this bill has the potential to impose changes down the track on the family visa streams which provide for visas for husbands, wives and de facto partners, including same-sex partners, of Australian citizens, and the prospective marriage spouse visas for fiances of Australians who intend to come to Australia and marry their partners here. That power is provided within this bill if regulations are moved down the track to try and initiate that power. 
It does need to be emphasised that delegated legislation, by its very nature, is not scrutinised as comprehensively either by this chamber or, equally importantly, by the public. People can say that that is our responsibility and it is up to us to do it, but every piece of primary legislation that comes before this chamber has to be debated, has to be moved and is easily available. Apart from it being much harder to understand what regulations actually mean, they are not even formally tabled as documents in this place. We just get a list with the titles on it.
Whilst we do have the regulations and ordinances committee and it does an absolutely critical job, it does only look at a specific range of issues. It does not look at policy detail and policy impacts. There are also issues in terms of the accessibility of regulations and delegated legislation instruments for the general public. I think that needs to be emphasised as well, in terms of the greater difficulty there is in giving the proper scrutiny to regulations that is required. I should emphasise that in the migration area I take great care in scrutinising every regulation that appears. If bills like these continue to go through, we will have to take even greater care to scrutinise them even more closely. I would suggest that we get more stringent about putting forward objections to components we disapprove of.
Concerns in relation to this legislation that have been raised by migration and legal experts are that the inclusion of measures in regulations could impose financial criteria to be satisfied before an Australian is approved as a sponsor of their partner prior to the date of lodgment or before the application would be considered a valid application. This could then make an application for, say, a spouse visa an application that cannot be reviewed unless the spouse can fulfil certain financial commitments. There is nothing in this legislation to stop that kind of situation occurring should a future government—or the current government in the future—try to implement a regulatory regime to put that in place. I realise these visas already have requirements which impose financial obligations upon sponsors, such as an assurance of support. What they do not have is a regulation which prevents review of applications, and that is something that can be extended to family visas by regulation.
Spouse visas are very hard to obtain and often have extraordinarily long processing times. They make up a significant number of the appeals, and I think it is not unforeseeable that the government would want to restrict the type of people who can successfully apply for family visas and who could have a review of a rejected application. I believe we have already in effect been virtually forced into accepting a two-pronged parent visa which provides better treatment for those who can afford it. I have no doubt the government is capable of extending this philosophy to other family related visas. It is not beyond the government to introduce regulations on sponsored visitor visas which would allow relatives to come to Australia but require them to pay a security bond to the department to guarantee that they will return by the appropriate date. Add this type of restriction to the current risk factor profile used by the government to prevent families visiting Australia and the impact could be profound on specific categories of visas.  
It is worth noting that the bill inserts a new paragraph which provides that a decision to refuse to grant a visa is a Migration Review Tribunal reviewable decision if the noncitizen made the application in certain circumstances. The new paragraph limits the circumstances in which a decision to refuse to grant a certain visa or visas may be reviewed by the MRT. I know the MRT is under a lot of stress at the moment in terms of the number of cases before it, and I think that is an argument for improving resources to the MRT more than anything else. We as a nation are encouraging not just permanent migrants but exchanges of people from other countries or people to come here temporarily to explore business opportunities or to strengthen family links. We can only assume that will mean larger numbers of people coming to this country either permanently or temporarily. That is not something I have a problem with as long as it is done in a controlled and equitable fashion. That has a consequence which I believe has to be accepted as part and parcel of the positive that migration brings, that of providing people with the right to appeal what they believe is an unfair, unreasonable or unlawful decision. To try and continue to limit the circumstances in which people can have their visas reviewed by the MRT is a concern. Again, this bill does not directly limit MRT appeals but it provides a power for the government down the track to limit appeals via regulations for a certain class of visa under certain circumstances. That again is a concern. 
As I said, it is a concern I could possibly have lived with if it were not for the subsequent appearance of a regulation deliberately drafted, and quite openly acknowledged as being deliberately drafted, by the government to combine a number of quite distinct components and changes in migration law and to intertwine them in a way so it is not possible to disallow one without disallowing the rest. This matter was brought up by Senator Ludwig at the committee hearing on Monday night into the other legislation I was talking about, the personal identifiers legislation. He specifically asked about this regulation, which is the one that has had some publicity and has got some publicity in the Australian today, I believe. It extends temporary protection visas to refugees who have arrived here lawfully. That regulation also does a couple of other things that are very positive, but extending temporary protection visas—at least in the Democrats' view, and I am pleased to hear in the Labor Party's view—is something that is unacceptable.
Senator Ludwig asked whether or not that regulation did in fact make it difficult to separate a part or parts if you do not like those specific parts. It makes it difficult to separate the regulation into its constituent parts. He suggests it is almost a circumvention of the power that we might otherwise have and has created a position where it is very difficult to agree with the department that a disallowance motion is an effective means to deal with regulations that we may not have yet seen. Mr Walker, the departmental official, responded:
It is certainly a mechanism that was used in the regulations that you mention.
That is, the TPV regulation. He continued:
The circumstances relating to those regulations did cause a lot of effort to go into the drafting.
That is code for saying, `We worked damn hard to make sure that we drafted it in such a way that you could not just disallow the TPV part.' Senator Ludwig said:
I appreciate that. It is the mechanism I am interested in, in that it is one that you have obviously used. I do not think it is one that I have seen before ... 
The departmental official said:
I think it is fair to say it has not been used before.
As Senator Ludwig said, it is effectively designed to prevent the Senate disallowing a part of it.
Suffice it to say that we have a regulation that was deliberately drafted—and this has basically been admitted by the government—to prevent the Senate from disallowing a particular component of it. According to Mr Walker from the department, it has not been done before. It obviously can be done and could have been done before, so I think it is fair to say that it is a new approach from this department to try and draft regulations in a way that makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the Senate to disallow component parts. If you have done that in relation to distinct areas to do with protection visas—distinct components of protection visa criteria—why won't you potentially be doing it with sponsorship visas down the track? Whilst, as the official said, there are 80 different visa subclasses that are potentially affected by this legislation and it would be difficult to draft a regulation that could intertwine all those, it would not be difficult to draft a regulation that intertwined two or three different criteria, say, removing the appeal rights to the MRT along with reducing the financial burden and just having a provision that says that provision A does not come into force unless provision B also is in force and things along those lines. Once you have seen how it is done, it is not that difficult to do.
That precedent having been set, and quite openly and deliberately set as a way to try and hamper the Senate from disallowing parts that it does not like, I think we now have to take a different approach to bills like this and the personal identifiers bill. Frankly, now we cannot rely on the answer, `If you don't like the regulation down the track, you can disallow it,' because we may not be able to disallow it—or not without causing unintended consequences of our own. I cannot underestimate the significance of that. To quote from Hansard, in relation to any future legislation the department official said:
What may or may not be done in the drafting depends on the circumstances of the particular requirements.
And, as Senator Ludwig said, it is certainly open to the department to do future regulations in a similar way, using mechanisms similar to those in the regulation that I referred to.
With that precedent now having been set—and quite openly set without any apparent concern being expressed by the government in regard to it—I think we are in a new phase of how we deal with legislation that expects us to take on faith the ability to deal with future regulations. As I said at the start, there are components of this that I have some sympathy with. Providing a clearer ability to place sanctions on people who breach their undertakings is desirable, but we still need to ensure that those sanctions are not excessive—or that the requirements or undertakings are not excessive—and that avenues for appeal are appropriate and reasonable. It is because of the approach that I spoke about that has been taken in relation to regulations that I have an amendment to move in the committee stage.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I rise also to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Sponsorship Measures) Bill 2003. Senator Sherry from the opposition, who spoke earlier, has outlined Labor's position on this bill and I will not seek to repeat the comments that he has made. I intend to confine my comments on the bill to the findings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, of which I am a participating member who participated in the hearings on this bill. 
As Senator Bartlett has outlined, one of the difficulties with this legislation is the heavy reliance on future regulations to spell out the detail. This is certainly something that the committee struggled with and it is something that the committee made a number of recommendations in relation to. During my remarks today I hope to outline exactly what those concerns were. In fact, at the conclusion of the committee process, the committee stated, as part of its conclusion, that:
... the proposed broad amendments do not establish a scheme that is transparent. In fact, the Committee's task of scrutinising this Bill has been made more difficult by the lack of detail or information as to the ambit of proposed regulations.
That was the crux of the committee's concerns: the absence of regulations that we could scrutinise made it very difficult for us to understand just how it is that this legislation proposes to operate.
The committee also noted our concern about the possibility for the provisions in the bill to be extended at some future time to other visa classes in the family stream. Of course, this is something that could indeed occur simply by future regulations being enacted. So again, the possibility that the bill may be extended by future regulation down the track concerned the committee. In fact, one of our key recommendations concerned how this would be dealt with in the future. Recommendation 2 of the committee's report states:
Because of the broad regulatory framework established by this Bill, the Committee recommends that the Senate ensure that future regulations made under these provisions are scrutinised most carefully, in order to ensure that more onerous sponsorship obligations are not imposed without adequate justification and consultation, particularly in relation to family stream visitors, and that appropriate decisions are prescribed as reviewable by the Migration Review Tribunal.
One of the committee's greatest concerns was the possibility that under this legislation sponsors would be held liable for potentially unlimited costs relating to locating, detaining and sponsoring a sponsored person, if in fact their visa conditions were breached. A number of those who made submissions to the committee and appeared before us emphasised this as being a matter of concern. A number of the questions that came from committee members sought to flesh out the difficulties that could arise in this context. The submission of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre argued that a sponsor would be required to `pay to the Commonwealth the costs of locating, detailing and removing from Australia a visa holder sponsored by the sponsor'. While there was no argument with the requirement for sponsors to take some financial responsibility for their employees under a sponsored visa class, we thought the new provisions could impose unreasonable financial burdens on employers, making sponsorship of business and professional development applicants an unattractive proposition. We thought that this was a matter of concern.
In the case of family relationships, it would also cause undue stress on the immediate and extended family of anyone violating the terms of their visa. Again, a number of those who made submissions to the committee emphasised this point. For example, the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre argued in their submission that `it would enable the government to hold private individuals and organisations liable for unlimited costs which are beyond their capacity to meet or constrain'. In particular, they expressed a concern that such undertakings would impose extraordinarily undesirable and indeed inappropriate dimensions on family and employment relationships which could quite unavoidably compromise or endanger those very relationships. 
While it must be noted that the bill does not provide for measures that could be applied to sponsorship for persons seeking to be permanent residents, such as spouses, parents and others under the family reunion scheme, this concern is highly relevant to employment arrangements. The committee considered that the costs of locating and detaining a person might include, for example, police costs of investigating and searching for a person, perhaps even on a national scale, as well as detention, which of course, as we know, could be very considerable. The committee's recommendation in relation to this, recommendation 1, said:
The Committee recommends that either a Regulatory Impact Statement should be prepared before proposed section 140H is agreed to, or the section should be amended to provide that costs for locating and detaining a sponsored person are specifically excluded from the ambit of regulations that may be made under that section.
The committee's concern was to ensure that costs do not blow out and, if necessary, that these costs be matters that are excluded from the regulations that will be made under this act.
Another aspect of concern raised by witnesses who appeared before the committee and made submissions to it was the issue of whether decisions regarding applications for sponsored visas would be reviewable by the Migration Review Tribunal. A number of those who made submissions to us emphasised that the removal of merits review could have serious consequences for individuals holding these sponsored visas. It was the opinion of a number of persons who came before the committee that this was an extremely blunt tool to use for the apparent purpose of preventing abuse of the system by some subclass 457 visa applicants. The view was that there has to be a better way to minimise abuse if in fact such abuse is occurring.
The committee was also concerned about an apparent loophole that allows those who do not meet the criteria of the visa to submit an application and, when the application is rejected on the grounds that it does not meet the criteria, request a review by the Migration Review Tribunal. In practice, this means an extension of whatever visa the person holds—the class of visa held at the particular time—until the MRT has the opportunity to review the application. This occurs not infrequently. A departmental representative who appeared before the committee told us that this was a `substantial problem' in the case of subclass 457 visas. Of 35,000-40,000 applications, around 1,000 were submitted without an employing sponsor. However, it was revealed that this problem has already been addressed by previous regulations. But this was something that the department did not raise during the public hearing or in its subsequent submission to the committee. Once again, the concern of the members of the committee about the integrity of the migration system and the transparency of its decision making and legislative processes is not in any way eased by findings such as this, which do not reflect at all well on the department.
In considering submissions before the committee inquiry, and in questioning the witnesses who appeared before the committee, there were also a number of other concerns raised relating in particular to the potential impact on sponsored persons who are subject to domestic violence and abuse, either by a sponsor or an employer sponsor. Relationship breakdowns between visa holders and sponsors are not uncommon. Some witnesses before the committee gave evidence of how putting more onerous sponsorship obligations onto both parties could lead to a greater incidence of violence or intimidation of sponsored workers. Ms Jennifer Burn, a lecturer in the Faculty of Law at the University of Technology, Sydney, submitted to the committee: 
... in the context of a relationship breakdown where there are Australian citizen children of the relationship and where there is domestic violence in the relationship, the Australian sponsor has withdrawn their sponsorship and the visa is refused that would not be reviewable.
The response of DIMIA was to refer the committee to special provisions relating to domestic violence in division 1.5 of the Mig-ration Regulations 1994. However, the domestic violence provisions already in place under the Migration Act to which the department referred only cover permanent visa holders, so this means that those on temporary visas will be left with no recourse to the Migration Review Tribunal if their sponsorship arrangements break down due to domestic violence. This is not a satisfactory situation.
Other submissions to the committee were more broadly concerned with violence in sponsored relationships. For example, Ms Priscilla Jamieson—course coordinator, solicitor and migration agent for the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre—submitted to the committee:
People have been bustled off to airports at 4 a.m. to get them out of the country before they can complain about the appalling conditions and the physical abuse they have suffered as employees. If exploitative employers were also to be responsible for compliance costs and so on or any further visa applications, there would be the possibility of irreparable harm being caused.
Such conditions would certainly be very negative for those persons who are already in powerless positions in the employer-employee relationship. Recent interest in the cases of sex workers in Australia has revealed that many women victims of sexual servitude in Australia do enter the country legally—conceivably with sponsorship—and then engage in or are forced to engage in work such as prostitution that is not permissible under their visa conditions. Because of the precarious nature of their position, more stringent sponsorship conditions would conceivably put such women in sexual servitude in an immeasurably more difficult situation. The already disturbing record of this government on human rights issues does not bode well for the treatment of non-citizens in such a precarious situation. The government's undue emphasis on immigration law in the cases of women engaged in the sex industry has meant that, three years after the enactment of the Criminal Code Amendment (Slavery and Sexual Servitude) Act, no cases have been prosecuted.
On the issue of cancellation and barring of sponsors for temporary classes of visas under sections 140L, 140J and 140K, the committee noted again that the lack of detail provided in the bill and the heavy reliance on future regulations to give further information about how this would work made it very difficult for the committee to properly scrutinise this issue. This is the issue that Senator Bartlett was emphasising. The absence of detail in this legislation made it very difficult for the committee to form sound conclusions as to how the legislation will operate in practice.
This concern about the lack of detail also extends to the proposed section 140V regarding the minister's ability to disclose personal information of a visa holder or former visa holder to an approved sponsor in prescribed circumstances. At the end of the committee process, Labor senators, including my colleagues Senator the Hon. Nick Bolkus and Senator Joseph Ludwig and I, agreed with the two recommendations put forward by the committee—that is, for a regulatory impact statement and for careful scrutiny of future regulations made under these provisions. Labor senators further agreed with the concerns raised in the submissions, particularly those relating to the applicability of the proposed regime to sponsorship for family visitor visas, the ability of the Migration Review Tribunal to review decisions on visas and sponsors, the impact of further sponsorship obligations in the context of violence and abuse, the breadth of possible sponsorship undertakings and mandatory cancellation of sponsors. With these reservations, Labor will support the passage of this bill. However, we will monitor carefully whether the spirit of the bill and these concerns raised by the committee are reflected in future regulations. We would also reiterate that the sanctions regime against employers as outlined in this bill is not anywhere near as rigorous or as tough as that being proposed by Labor in its policy announced in 2002. 
While this government refuses to get tough on employers for fear of losing their support in either financial or other terms, there will continue to be abuse of the migration system. Unscrupulous employers who fail to abide by the requirements to employ only lawful workers will also be putting at risk the lives and the health and wellbeing of these employees working illegally and, as we have seen in the examples outlined earlier by Senator Sherry, the consequences can be horrendous.
With 60,000 people here illegally and 30,000 of these working illegally, this is the largest immigration challenge facing Australia but one that this government chooses to ignore. More than a quarter of these people have been here over 10 years so we are not talking about a problem that the government has not had a chance to properly address. The exploitation of workers under the subclass 456 business visa and the subclass 457 skilled visa seems to be a continuing problem, due mainly to the government's inability or unwillingness to put adequate resources into monitoring the existing compliance requirements. In the end, it is Australian workers who are losing out, as well as those being exploited by these illegal scams.
In contrast to the lack of government policy in this area, Labor has a clear position on these matters. Labor has said that it will crack down on illegal workers by issuing a US style green card to non-citizens who have a visa which entitles them to work, by placing an obligation on employers to check green cards and by prosecuting and harshly penalising those who employ illegal workers. Labor will create an illegal workers roundtable involving the federal government, state governments, employer representatives, including small business and farmers, and unions to design and implement the green card system and to run the national crackdown. Finally, we will create and resource an illegal workers strike force within the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. This would all be undertaken as part of Labor's broader immigration policy to ensure that we return some integrity and fairness to the migration system, something that seems to have been lost under the present minister and this government.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SPONSORSHIP MEASURES) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-09-11,"—in reply—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendment to be moved to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Sponsorship Measures) Bill 2003. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 9 September 2003. I also table a regulation impact statement relating to this bill.
I thank senators for their contributions to this debate on the bill. Perhaps it is timely to look briefly at what this bill does. It makes a number of amendments to the Migration Act 1958 in relation to the sponsorship of Australian visa applicants. Sponsorship is an important element of the system for managing the entry and stay of persons in Australia. It plays a central role in protecting the Australian community from the costs and risks associated with the stay of non-citizens in Australia. This bill formalises the government's longstanding policy that these costs should be borne by sponsors who bring persons to Australia rather than by the Australian community. This is particularly relevant in cases where sponsors gain a commercial advantage from the sponsorship arrangements. The bill establishes a comprehensive and transparent framework for migration regulations to deal with sponsorship requirements and standardises sponsorship arrangements as much as possible. 
The framework proposed by the bill provides for regulations to be made depending on the type of visa, for sponsorship to be a criterion for a visa—that is, a criterion for both the visa application and the grant of a visa—and the process and criteria for the approval of sponsors and undertakings to be made by sponsors in respect of the costs and risks associated with the stay of sponsored persons. With respect to the last point, it is envisaged that the regulations will provide that one of the undertakings a sponsor might be required to give is to pay the costs incurred by the Commonwealth in locating, detaining and removing from Australia a sponsored person.
The bill also allows certain actions to be taken against sponsors of prescribed temporary visa holders if the sponsors breach their undertakings. These actions include the ability to cancel sponsorship or to impose bars on sponsors. These bars can prevent the sponsors from gaining further approvals as a sponsor and from sponsoring other persons under their existing approvals. 
The bill gives the power to make regulations that differentiate between the approaches taken in different visa regimes. For example, it will allow us to differentiate between sponsors who sponsor professional development visa holders and those who sponsor long-stay temporary entry visa holders. The regulation making powers provided in the bill are not intended to affect sponsorship regulations made under any other provision of the act. The opt-in provision of the bill requires that different visa regimes and their accompanying sponsorship requirements will need to specifically come within the new framework before it will apply to them. 
This is important because it will allow the existing regulations relating to sponsorship to be changed and implemented gradually, following appropriate consultations. It also means that any regulations that are made pursuant to the new powers will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and of course this is a very important point. Initially, regulations are proposed to be made to include the long-stay sponsored business visa, subclass 457, and the new professional development visa, subclass 470, under the new framework. 
In addition, the bill seeks to prevent abuse of the merits review process by certain temporary visa applicants who are required to have a sponsor but who, at the time of applying for review, do not have a sponsor or have not attempted to obtain one. In these cases, the decision to refuse to grant the visa cannot ever be overturned by the tribunal because the requirement that the applicant be sponsored is simply not satisfied. This amendment will effectively close off a loophole that has led to visa applicants pursuing what are clearly claims without merit. In summary, the measures in the bill will ensure that the integrity of Australia's migration and entry programs is not compromised. 
Senator Bartlett referred to some concerns about temporary protection visas. I understand the Democrats have an amendment which will be dealt with at the committee stage, and perhaps the government's remarks are best left until then. Senator Sherry mentioned two cases: one involving the death of a South African worker who was in Queensland under a 465 visa, which is for a short stay; and the other involving chefs from South Africa working in Australia under a 457 visa, which is for a long stay. In the case involving the chefs, a matter was taken to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission, but I think that action was then discontinued. There was a report on whether there was a breach involved in the matter, and I understand none was reported. Those cases indeed highlight the very point the government is making in relation to this bill: it is targeting this issue. The regulations that will flow from the bill will enhance the integrity of the migration system and, the government believes, will enhance the migration regime generally for Australia. 
In summary, the amendments contained in the bill will enhance the effectiveness, integrity and fairness of the visa sponsorship scheme. If the bill as amended is not passed, the effectiveness of the visa sponsorship regime will be undermined. In particular, the onus will be on the Australian community to bear the risks and costs associated with the entry and stay of non-citizens in Australia. This is a very big issue and one of concern to all Australians. We have a generous immigration program, but one which needs the necessary checks and balances. This bill provides just that. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-09-11,"—It will not surprise senators that the position of the Labor Party is that we insist on these amendments. There is quite a long history on this issue, and I think it would be helpful at this stage to go through some of it. The government proposes with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002 to exclude casual employees of less than 12 months regular and systemic service and those who do not have a reasonable expectation of continuing employment. The standard for exemption from unfair dismissal for employees engaged on a casual basis for a short period is that set by article 2.2(c) of the International Labour Organisation's Termination of Employment Convention 1982. This convention has been ratified by Australia and is a schedule to the act. The general question, going right back to the critical principle, is what is reasonably regarded as a short period. The government seeks to argue that 12 months is a short period; the opposition's preference ultimately would have been three months, the compromise six months; and the Democrats view was six months. But still the government seeks to insist on 12 months.
Before I go into some other aspects of the history, let us put this into an international context. It is interesting to note that in 1999 the OECD compared the standard of employment protection legislation in member states and ranked the standard from one to 26, with one being the least strict and 26 being the strictest. Australia ranked fourth—that is, at the least strict end of the scale—behind the US, the UK and New Zealand. We do not stand out as a paragon of employee rights, we fall at the other end of the scale, but this is apparently not good enough for the government. The rhetoric and the scare campaign that is out there amongst employers on unfair termination is what is mounting this case. It is outrageous—given the many genuine issues of concern with the cuts and other proposals the government is canvassing—that the government claims that the opposition and the minor parties are running scare campaigns when this very government itself is prepared to develop the perception amongst employers that is damaging access to employment. 
Let us reiterate that point for starters: Australia ranks fourth of 26, fourth being at the worst end of the scale. In that context it is quite clear that this bill is designed to make it easier for employers to sack casual workers. The government is intent on removing protection for workers, particularly casuals, against unfair treatment in the workplace. I remember that this was discussed in some earlier debates on unfair dismissal. Senator Len Harris brought to the attention of the Senate some of his views and experiences in relation to casual employment, and he agreed that the growing trend of casualisation in Australia and the uncertainty that is being provided to many ordinary Australian families as a consequence of this needs to be redressed. If I recall the last occasion issues similar to this were debated in the Senate, the government was out there on its own. The position of the minor parties—the Greens, the Democrats and the Independents—and the Labor Party is that they all see this for what it is: a scare campaign in which the government seeks to maintain the support of small business by deluding them that this is a significant issue to them. I can recall several years ago that even COSBOA eventually said to us in a committee hearing: `We just want the government to get their act together. We just want something genuine here, and this is yet another one of these ingenuous stunts.'
Let us go back to some of the issues that Senator Harris raised. For many casuals, if their labour is simply not needed on a particular day or part of a day, they will join the ranks of the unemployed—depending on the current definition of `unemployed'. I suppose that if they have worked one hour in the week they are in reality counted as `employed', but what that means for their lifestyle, their security and their dignity is a very different reality. This uncertain situation is compounded by no rights to paid leave, paid holidays and all sorts of other entitlements. For many casuals, a holiday with their family, with a few extra dollars for the Christmas period, remains nothing but a very distant dream.
Despite the government's agenda here, there have been movements in the other direction in other areas. This is perhaps what has been most concerning to the government. The unsatisfactory fact that casual workers have low pay and very few rights was the subject of recent groundbreaking cases in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I will revisit some of those that have been canvassed in this debate and other debates in the past, but before I do that I will go to my favourite one: parental leave. We finally extended parental leave to casuals working on a regular and systemic basis. On the one hand, the commission are able to say, `Casuals working on this basis should have access to parental leave,' but, on the other hand, they are saying, `We're going to limit, though, for 12 months their access to protection from unfair termination.' It is, frankly, just unprincipled and rank.
We need to have some consistency in standards for casuals—some consistency and certainty for these people. In some areas they may not be eligible for the conditions of employment for part-timers and full-timers—there may even be some good, genuine arguments for why that might be, in respect of some conditions—but, on this one, there is nothing. There is no principled basis for arguing that, on the one hand, we accept that casuals should have access to parental leave but, on the other hand, in relation to access to fair termination that they are different to full-time or part-time workers. It is just utterly inconsistent. 
The independent umpire in the field is already telling us these things. Let us look at some of those points. Affidavits presented in the metals case of 2000 show that casuals were deprived of holidays, sick leave, family leave, income security and, as I have said before, dignity. The evidence showed that most casuals are entitled to a loading of 20 per cent but many receive wages lower or not much better than those of their permanent counterparts. This harsh situation largely reflects the reduced capacity of casuals to bargain for better pay and conditions. Most casuals are reliant on award and statutory rights for protection against exploitation.
The commission is starting, slowly, to respond to these things. The commission is tightening up award protections for casuals. It has raised the loading for casuals from 20 to 25 per cent, and it gave casuals the right to convert to permanent employment after six months. Whilst the commission was limited to workers in the metal and engineering industry, it is worth noting the reaction to the casuals decision by the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, Mr Bob Herbert. Senator Murray and I have had a long history of hearing from Mr Herbert, but he is often one of my favourites to quote because he does often represent a balanced, genuine perspective of employers. On this occasion, Bob Herbert said:
There has been no adjustment to casual employment for 26 years. Certainly, there will be some murmurs among employers over the increased loading rates but, in reality, the AIRC ruling simply brings casuals to roughly the same pay and condition levels as their full-time colleagues.
It is similar to what I said about parental leave: the commission is reflecting that employers are more and more casualising their employment arrangements, and often this is unfair. Better conditions closer to those of their full-time and part-time counterparts are required not only to improve those conditions but also to prevent further casualisation.
Let us revisit the history of this particular matter. Late last year the full court of the Federal Court of Australia issued a decision that ruled invalid a regulation that prevented regular casual employees from mounting an unfair dismissal action until they had been with an employer for a year on a regular and systemic basis and had the expectation of continuing work. I think in the past the minister has indicated that he thought I had mischaracterised this decision, so let me be quite clear on what this decision said. In Hamzy v. Tricon International Restaurants trading as KFC the Federal Court faced the question of whether the statutory discretion conferred on the government to prescribe an exemption from unfair dismissal protection for employees engaged on a casual basis for a short period meant that the commission could knock out casuals who had not put in 12 months regular service with an employer or who could not hold out an expectation of continuing employment.
Let us look at the decision. The full court was unanimous in holding that the prescribed regulation—namely, regulation 30B(3) of the Workplace Relations Regulations—did not conform with what the act allowed. In other words, the regulation unlawfully excluded various classes of casuals who were entitled by an act of parliament and the international precedents I have referred to—and that we are committed to—to the right to some measure of employment security. Labor believes that, where there is an exception for casual employees for a short period, a short period is six months not 12 months. In fact, I think, apart from the government, the Senate is united in that view. 
But back to the history: the government had broadened the exclusion to 12 months. Shortly thereafter Labor moved to disallow the government's regulations. We did so on the basis—amongst the reasons I have raised earlier—that this arrangement would further promote the casualisation of the work force, which we certainly have seen since that time. I have to say that we have been proven correct in that assessment. The Democrats allowed the government's regulations to stand on the important condition that the minister review the regulations after 12 months and the Democrats be given an opportunity to review empirical evidence of the operation of the exclusion after that period.
It is now more than 57 months since that occurred, and we are still waiting to see the evidence. I understand that this was an arrangement between the Democrats and the government over support to allow the regulation to stand, but I ask in this debate whether such a review has ever occurred. Do we understand how this is operating? Is it going to be the basis of our considerations now? I have some fairly strong suspicions that, no, that review never did occur. We have certainly never seen any public indication that it had. There was no indication in the last debate, if I recall correctly, that it had. So the government has dishonoured its agreement with the Democrats, if I am correct, and the review never occurred.
It is important to be clear about the impact of a 12-month exclusion. Australia is close to leading the world in the trend towards casualisation of the work force. According to the ABS, in 1982 there were 700,000 casual employees in Australia. By the turn of the millennium there were 2.1 million—from 700,000 up to 2.1 million. Casual employees now represent more than one-quarter of the labour force. Federal legislation should not provide an artificial incentive for employers to prolong the period in which a person is employed as a casual unnecessarily. Labor believes that the government's 12-month exclusion has exactly that effect. If a casual employee has been working for six months and has every expectation that their employment will continue indefinitely, it is probable that the government's 12-month exclusion in part influences the employer's decision to maintain the employee's casual status. 
The government has denied the benefit of the exclusion to an employer where the substantial purpose of holding the employee as a casual is to avoid their obligations under the act. The opposition recognises that an employer may have legitimate reasons for employing a casual, but what is often missed, and is certainly never mentioned by this government, is that an employee has legitimate reasons for wanting security and stability in their employment. Labor notes that the government proposes to exclude employees engaged under a contract of employment for a specified period of time, but Labor is concerned that this exclusion does not impose any limit on the period of time or require that those periods be reasonable. Some of these issues we will probably address a bit later in the debate; I would like to give Senator Murray an opportunity to deal with his amendments before I raise some questions there. But Labor believes that the period of time should be less than 12 months because Labor believes that employers should not be given an incentive to avoid their obligations under unfair dismissal legislation by placing an employee on a fixed term contract where in reality their employment will be ongoing.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-09-11,"—Senator Collins is quite right that this issue has been before the Senate for many years, including during Labor's term of government. But the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002 also has a long history too in that it was introduced in the House of Representatives in February 2002 and passed by the Senate with three Democrat and two Labor amendments in December 2002. The government brought it back to the House of Representatives in August 2003 and here we are in September 2003 dealing with the message, so there has not been that much of a sense of urgency from the government. Nevertheless, it is an issue which you need to deal with because of the certainty that both employees and employers need to have with respect to these fundamental issues.  
Senator Collins outlined the 16 November 2001 Federal Court decision in Hamzy v. Tricon International Restaurants trading as KFC where they declared invalid the regulations which excluded certain classes of employees from unfair dismissal provisions, saying they went beyond the exclusions authorised by the act itself. It must be stressed that the exclusion is not a complete exclusion; it is a probationary period which is evident in the Commonwealth jurisdiction at 12 months and in the Queensland Labor jurisdiction at 12 months.
The aim of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002 was to confirm existing regulations by excluding casual employees with less than 12 months service from access to federal unfair termination remedies. After that period they would have access. This was amended by Labor to change the casual probationary period to six months, and the Democrats supported that amendment. The second aspect of the bill was to repeal the regulations denying defined types of employees access to federal unfair termination laws and to re-enact with minor changes those exclusions in the principal act. That was turning from a regulation into legislation the fundamentally same provisions, and that was passed by the Senate.
The third area was to retrospectively validate the operation of federal termination of employment regulations held by the Federal Court to be beyond the regulation-making powers available under the principal act. That too was passed by the Senate and allowed for continuity and consistency of approach to be catered for since 1996. The fourth area was to require applicants for relief under federal unfair termination laws to lodge a $50 filing fee. That fee has been imposed since 1996 by way of regulation. The filing fee will now be indexed to the CPI. That too was passed. I might add as we go through that list that the Industrial Registrar does in fact waive very large numbers of fee applications where impecuniousness is a reasonable cause. The fifth area which was not in the bill is to provide casuals with access to unlawful dismissal provisions—unlawful, not unfair dismissal provisions—for the first time. The Democrats moved an amendment to that effect and that was passed by the Senate.
The background to the existing situation is that in 1996 the Australian Democrats agreed to the Workplace Relations Act provisions to exclude casual employees with less than 12 months service from access to federal unfair termination remedies. As the Senate knows, the Senate and the government have accepted that the probationary period for permanent employees is now three months. The casual probationary periods in place since 1996 through regulation will be reinstated in the act if this bill finally passes today.
It is difficult to know the number of employees likely to be affected by these laws and, once again, I make a plea through the minister on duty for the department to try and improve the data collection on where casuals are employed. It is very difficult to work out where they reside. My belief is they mostly fall under state jurisdictions, with the obvious exception of Victoria, but it is difficult to determine. So it is difficult to know how many employees are affected by these laws, but it is the minority of casuals. 
If the bill is not passed, the government could theoretically face some difficulties, the most notable being that the current regulation for casuals has a sunset clause to 11 September next year. Most casuals, as I have said, still fall under state IR regimes, and the complicating factor since 1996 has been the rapid growth in casual employment and the need to attend to its consequences. The line is also now blurred as to what is a genuine casual, as opposed to someone who is essentially a permanent part-timer. Senator Collins quite rightly drew attention to the Democrats' concern as to the way in which casualisation is progressing and whether the probationary period of 12 months was the right one any longer. Without sufficient data, we have moved to a view that the probationary period should be shortened.
In the recent Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill, we moved an amendment to reduce the probation time for casuals who are excluded from federal unfair dismissal protection from the present 12 months to six months. I am pleased that federal Labor has accepted the principle of a probationary period. That is not a principle which all Labor jurisdictions agree with. For instance, WA and Tasmania both have zero months—in other words, you can access unfair dismissal on day one. Frankly, that is an unrealistic and unreasonable approach. Every employee and employer should have a probationary period to go through, and the question is how long that should be. The Labor jurisdiction in New South Wales has arrived at a view that six months is appropriate. However, the Labor jurisdiction in Queensland arrived at the view that 12 months—the same as the Commonwealth—is appropriate. So, plainly, there is not a consistent view about these matters, but the Australian Democrats have come to the view that six months is probably a fairer way to go.
Change in the regulation of this area obviously can generate uncertainty for employers and employees and be a source of business aggravation, but we stress that there actually has not been change in this area over the last seven years. The change that we seek to introduce would be a change to the law on unlawful—not unfair—dismissal: that is, in terms of section 170CK(2) of theWorkplace Relations Act, dismissal on the grounds of things like union membership, sexuality, race et cetera. Under the Workplace Relations Act, unlawful dismissal provisions cover the field. It was interesting to see in the termination of employment bill debate a great deal of resistance from Labor to covering the field provisions, yet this one, of course, is very much embraced by them—and we agree with that.
When you talk about covering the field, unlawful dismissal provisions in fact apply to both federal and state jurisdictions, but presently only for permanents. Casuals have been excluded from unlawful dismissal access ever since Labor first introduced a casual exemption into the termination of employment laws. So we are going to reverse a policy that Labor first introduced, but I am happy to recognise that federal Labor have reversed their position as well, because they supported that.
—They had fair termination too.
—Well, you are doing the right thing now, and I recognise and acknowledge that, so there is no issue from me. Excluding casuals from protection against unlawful dismissal does deny them recourse if they are dismissed because their employer discovers they are not a member of a union, have a sexual orientation which is not acceptable to their employer or are a member of a particular racial group, or on some other spurious grounds. The Democrats' amendment for unlawful dismissal is one we will insist on. The message from the House of Representatives states that the government did not support the Labor or Democrat amendments, but does say that there was some merit in the Democrat amendments. As I mentioned to my Labor colleague recently, that put up a big signal to us that we could probably persuade them to our viewpoint. 
The other issue I want to raise is an amendment we have circulated, on sheet 3082, to deal with casuals' employment ceasing at the initiation of the employer. We have heard anecdotally, and there is not enough data for me to be firm about the numbers or the extent of it, that some employers—rogue employers, not the majority of employers—are terminating casuals' employment prior to the unfair dismissal provision access locking in and then re-engaging them later, claiming that it is a new term of engagement. Whether that is happening on a minor or a major scale is irrelevant to me in that it is just an unacceptable practice. The amendment we have circulated says that, if a casual's employment ceases at the initiation of the employer and that person is then re-engaged by the same employer within a three-month period, both the engagement periods count towards the total length of employment.
Where are we to date? The government have had discussions with us and our position is as follows: if the government accept our insistence on the Democrats' amendments and if the government accept the continuity of employment amendment we will put, we would in turn be willing to support a position that essentially holds to the status quo in terms of the current probationary period for casuals. We say that, making it quite clear to both the government and the Labor Party that we have come to a view that six months probation is preferable.
However, we think that these advances in law on the unlawful dismissal side and on the continuity of employment side, coupled with the fact that the actual probationary period for casuals will not change, do mean that we could claim that this would be a valuable advance for casual employees. Minister, what I intend to do is propose an amendment to your motion. The amendment would recognise that we are insisting on Democrat amendments, but not the opposition amendments which are in the message. We would move our amendment on sheet No. 3082 as a motion to your motion, if that makes any sense.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR TERMINATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-09-11,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002 is another attempt by the government to undermine the job security and workplace rights of a large portion of the Australian work force. Previously, this chamber was required to dispose of the government's plans to scrap unfair dismissal laws for small business employees; now it is being asked to consider a bill that would put into the Workplace Relations Act express provisions for a further series of exemptions from unfair dismissal laws.
One of those proposed exemptions is to permanently exclude casual workers who have been employed by a single employer for less than 12 months. As it is currently structured, the act already makes provision for this exemption. Under section 170CC of the act, a casual employee engaged for a short period is not protected from unfair dismissal. The phrase `a casual employee engaged for a short term period' is taken from International Labour Organisation Convention (No. 158) Concerning Termination of Employment at the Initiative of the Employer, to which federal unfair dismissal laws owe their origin as an act of parliament under the external affairs power of the Constitution. Regulation 30B(3) gives effect to section 170CC by defining `short term' as a period of casual employment of less than 12 months. 
Regulation 30B(3) has a curious history. The Keating Labor government first introduced it in 1994 to define a short-term period of casual employment as being less than six months. In 1996 the current government altered that definition to increase from six to 12 months the required period of engagement. It was able to make this change by doing a deal with the Democrats in which the government promised to review the change after 12 months. Not surprisingly, the government has failed to follow through with this commitment to review the operation of the exemption.
Late last year the government was forced to reword regulation 30B(3) to overcome disallowance of the regulation by the Federal Court in Hamzy's case. This revised regulation remains in force and thus operates to already exclude casual employees employed for less than 12 months from accessing federal unfair dismissal laws. The government's aim then is to overcome the problems encountered in Hamzy's case and to set in stone in the Workplace Relations Act the provisions of regulation 30B(3). This bill then will give unscrupulous employers a no-questions-asked free ticket to sack casual employees who have been engaged for less than a year. This is an exceptionally lengthy period of time for a casual employee to be without any real sort of job security. Labor's longstanding position on this issue is that a short-term period, for the purposes of ILO convention 158, to which federal unfair dismissal laws owe their origin, should not be more than six months. This was the state of play when Labor left office federally in 1996, and is currently the state of play under the Industrial Relations Act in my home state of New South Wales.
The extension of this period to 12 months, in my view, has not only put Australia in breach of its international obligations under ILO convention 158, but operated to further accelerate the rapid casualisation of the Australian work force that is taking place. From 1984 to 1999 casual employment levels more than doubled, from 848,300 casual employees to 1,931,700—that is, an increase of 117 per cent. Over the same period permanent employment increased by just 19 per cent. As at August 2000 casual employees represented around 27 per cent of the work force. Between 1990 and 1999, 71.4 per cent of total employment growth was casual. Since 1996—the year the coalition was elected to federal office—an extra 276,400 Australians have joined the casual work force.
The growing casualisation of the Australian work force has seriously undermined the rights of many working Australians. The 27 per cent of working Australians who are employed as casuals do not have automatic access to rights like sick leave, annual leave and employer contributions to superannuation. They suffer extremely low levels of job security, as their employment can be cancelled with just one hour's notice. Casual employees also have less access to employer sponsored training courses. The tenuous nature of their employment also makes it difficult for casuals to establish a place in society, as they are generally unable to gain finance for assets like houses and cars. Generally speaking, casual employees receive lower remuneration for their hard work and are overrepresented in the lower echelons of the labour market, working predominately in low-paid and low-skilled jobs. The basic contention that demand for casual employment is linked to a reduction in workers' rights was recently supported by the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the metals casuals' award case. 
This year the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, of which I am chairman, conducted an inquiry into poverty and the working poor. Two of the terms of reference for the inquiry were: an examination of the social and economic impact of changes in the distribution of work, the level of remuneration from work and the impact of underemployment and unemployment; and the impact of changing industrial conditions on the availability, quality and reward for work. The committee visited various parts of the country to speak to hardworking Australians about how hard it is to make ends meet under this government. I heard from many Australians employed in casual work who struggle by with poor pay, low levels of job security and no leave entitlements.
There has been a great deal written on what has driven the trend towards casualisation in Australia over the past 20 years. At the most basic level, casualisation is driven by labour market supply and demand. On the one hand, there are a number of Australians who want casual work as they may be balancing work with other commitments like family or study. At the other end of the scale there will always be a demand for casual workers to perform work that may only be short term. For these reasons, there has been a long history in Australia of provisions in industrial awards making allowance for various kinds of casual work to be performed. When the federal commission introduced casual work in 1920 in Australian Timber Workers Union v. John Sharp & Sons, it was determined that some work, such as ship repair, was urgent and could not be attended to adequately by permanent employees.
Although there are a large number of Australians who prefer casual work, unsurprisingly, most Australians engaged as casual workers would prefer to have more secure and stable employment. An ACTU survey in 1999 found that 59 per cent of casuals would prefer permanent employment. Demand has well and truly outstripped willing supply. This has occurred in part due to the fact that institutional arrangements in place governing casual employment provide a strong incentive for employers to employ casual instead of permanent or full-time staff. Changes introduced by this government in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 have made it easier for employers to employ casuals instead of permanent staff by removing determinations governing levels of casual staff as an allowable matter to be included in an award.
In addition, the state of the law in relation to casual employment provides an incentive for employers to take on casuals instead of permanent staff. Many employers find that the 20 per cent loading paid to most casual employees is much cheaper than having to employ extra staff to cover leave periods and having to make superannuation contributions or pay overtime.
In relation to this bill before us, laws governing the termination of casual employees also drive demand. As I mentioned earlier, many unscrupulous employers will see this bill as giving them a blank cheque to sack casual staff willy-nilly. Many employers will see this bill as another incentive to employ casual staff. Not only do you not have to pay casual staff leave entitlements, superannuation or overtime, or provide training, but if they have been employed for less than a year they can be sacked at will.
This bill, if passed, will contribute significantly to the ongoing trend towards the increased casualisation of the Australian labour force. It provides an extra incentive not to employ full-time permanent staff but to put on casuals. This, as I have mentioned earlier, ultimately leads to an overall decline in the employment conditions of Australian workers. It means that potentially this bill reaches much further than merely those in the work force already employed as casuals. It indirectly threatens the job stability of those employed on a permanent basis and in the long run will make it difficult for future job seekers to obtain permanent work. 
As well as accelerating the rate of casualisation this bill will also further undermine the already limited rights of casual workers. This outcome would be contrary to the growing trend in the courts and in industrial tribunals that have in recent years begun to afford greater rights to casual workers. In 1996, it was determined in the decision in Reed v. Blue Line Cruises that casual workers can be characterised as either `true' casuals, those whose employment conditions are typified by `informality, uncertainty and irregularity', or `long-term' casuals. Long-term casuals are those who may be employed as casuals yet in fact have quite stable and regular employment.
There are a number of casual workers who may be defined as long-term casuals. AWIRS data from 1995 found that the average job tenure of a casual worker is over three years. This suggests that most casuals have a relationship with their employer that is almost identical to that of a permanent employee. There is a growing recognition of the fact that a large number of casuals are merely employed as such to save costs to their employer, whereas in fact the nature of their employment relationship is one that is permanent and long term. Accordingly, courts and tribunals alike are becoming increasingly prepared to afford these long-term casuals rights akin to those of permanent employees.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR TERMINATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-09-11,"—The Australian Greens believe the chamber should be insisting on our amendments in relation to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002. We believe we should be doing this because now is a pertinent time when we need to be ensuring that the law provides protection for casual workers. That is because we are in a period of labour market reform where we are seeing more and more casualisation of the labour market. Indeed, part of that is a result of changes that this government is making to a range of different pieces of legislation that, as the previous speaker said, make it far easier and far more economically advantageous for employers to employ people on a casual basis without access to the sorts of entitlements that permanent employees are provided with.
In this structural change that is occurring in the labour market, casuals are at the forefront. As of August 2001, as other speakers have said, 2.2 million Australians were employed on a casual basis. The statistics show that between 1990 and 1999 the proportion of casual employees in the labour force increased from 19.4 per cent to 26.4 per cent. That is more than a quarter of the work force. The overwhelming proportion of new jobs created during that decade—that is, 71.4 per cent of those jobs—were in casual work. In addition, many employers are using these casual employees on a long-term basis. This is often in an attempt, as I said, to avoid the responsibilities that come with full-time employment. Statistics show that more than 66 per cent of casual employees worked regular hours and more than 50 per cent had been employed for more than one year.
It is important also to look at who these casual workers are. Perhaps in the past people have thought of casual workers as being those people who were mums who were working while the children were at school or people who were looking for a little extra work or an opportunity to engage in the labour market while they were engaged in other activities—be they study, childrearing or carer responsibilities. That is increasingly less often the case in terms of the characteristics of the casual work force in this country.  
There are hundreds and thousands of Australians who are trapped in a pattern of casual employment because that is simply all they are able to find. That is the only work that is available to them. Many of them are untrained and poorly skilled. They often include large numbers of migrants, young people and women. Some of these people are living on the margins of society where the loss of a job, which is what we are talking about in this legislation, is not just a setback but a catastrophe to their living environment, their situation, their capacity to pay rent rather than be homeless, their capacity to fund school activities for their children and their capacity to make sure that they and their children do not miss out on educational or social opportunities within our community.
Let us look at a common example: a single mother who does not have any particular qualifications and who works in a casual job. She is extremely vulnerable—she needs that job; she has few other options. She may not be able to meet unreasonable demands that are made of her in working longer shifts or working without adequate notice. Under the government's industrial relations regime she would have little or no protection from being sacked without fair notice or reason. 
We need to ensure in the industrial relations legislation that we are now debating in this chamber that we are providing protection for casuals. We need to ensure that right now. We have seen the massive casualisation of the Australian work force. We continue to see it and we recognise that from this point on it will be a trend that will continue for many years while we have the sort of labour market reform that we are seeing under the Howard government. That makes it all the more pertinent. That makes the responsibility of the Senate to ensure that we have protection for casual workers all the more important right now, while we see this increasing casualisation occurring.
Casual employees already have limited access to a whole range of entitlements. So when we have legislation like the legislation before us, we need to ensure that casuals are protected. If we want to protect some of the most vulnerable people in our society who are working as casual workers because that is the only employment that they can get, we need to have a fair balance between employers and employees. 
The Greens support employment relationships where each party has responsibilities and privileges, but we believe that the government is pushing too far in the interests of employers and that ordinary Australians are losing out. Of course, many employers do not act in this heavy-handed fashion; there are many employers who fully understand that the basis of success is a reciprocal and cooperative employment relationship. But we must not forget that laws should make the unethical minority of employers accountable and that, under the changes being proposed by the government, casual workers lose the right to stand up to employers who choose to act unfairly. The Australian Greens believe this is simply not good enough. We believe the chamber should insist on its amendments in relation to this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR TERMINATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002 and to make some brief comments regarding the contribution of Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats. A number of speakers who have gone before me have discussed the context in which this bill operates—that is, a context of increased casualisation. Certainly if you look at it from the point of view of a historical analysis, traditionally the Australian industrial relations system has tended to focus on benefiting full-time permanent workers. In saying that, I am not criticising the trade union movement, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or Labor governments. I simply make the observation that that is fact if one looks at the history of the regulation of industrial relations in the country and, frankly, that was a logical decision given the make-up of the vast majority of the work force.  
As many speakers before me have emphasised, the world has changed. I will not dwell for very long on the reasons why that has occurred. However, the increasing participation of women in the work force, the substantial employment growth in the services sector and a strong push by quite a number of employers to avoid regulation, by seeking to employ employees on precarious employment contracts, are among the reasons for the increasing casualisation of the Australian work force. It seems to me that unfair dismissal laws are one locus of the conflict between this move to casualisation, the increasing number of people who are employed under precarious employment conditions and the community desire that employees be treated reasonably and fairly.
As has been said, casual employees make up some 27 per cent of the labour force. The question I ask the Democrats and the government is this: how many of them are genuine casuals? In my experience many are called casuals simply because of the nature of the work they perform. Often such work is sporadic, although frequent, and required at short notice. During my time as a union official and as a lawyer, I have represented many persons in this category. For example, cleaners are very often employed in the private sector on casual employment contracts and may work for lengthy periods with such employers and never achieve permanent employment because of the nature of the work performed.
I emphasise that 30 years ago, or even 10 years ago, we could not have envisaged the sorts of numbers of casual employees that we now see in the Australian work force or the nature of the work they perform. We would not have expected that so many employees would be working in ways that enable an employer to call them casual and thereby avoid various wage costs, including sick leave and annual leave, and of course avoid the right of such workers to challenge their dismissal if that dismissal was unfair. 
I say to the Australian Democrats that laws must take account of the reality of the working lives of Australians if they are to have real effect. I note that Senator Murray has said that the Australian Democrats will insist on extending the unlawful dismissal provisions to casuals—that is, dismissals which deal with the proscribed grounds. While I welcome the extension of this jurisdiction to casuals, I do make the point that excluding those persons within 12 months from the unfair dismissal jurisdiction will require casuals to undertake different procedural actions in order to access this remedy, with consequent cost implications.
I also want to make some comments regarding the new amendments that Senator Murray has moved today in relation to the bill, which go to continuity of employment. I think this is a well-intentioned amendment and I understand what Senator Murray intends for it to achieve—that is, to bring within the jurisdiction those employees in respect of whom an employer has tried to avoid unfair dismissal jurisdiction by terminating them and then re-engaging them. What I say to Senator Murray is this: this looks good on paper but do not think that it will prevent employers who seek to from still engaging employees in ways that prevent them from accessing the unfair dismissal provisions. All you have done is to set a different set of hurdles. Employers who want to avoid the jurisdiction will still be able to do so. 
The other point I want to make concerns Senator Murray's comments regarding probationary periods. It seems to me there is a justification for probationary periods on the ground that an employer can test an employee's suitability. There is a vast difference between that and casual employment on an ongoing basis, which is a way of life for many Australian workers. It is inappropriate to conflate the two concepts and, in doing so, the result can be, and it appears will be, that many Australian workers will suffer detriment. The Labor Party's amendment of six months may be a blunt mechanism for trying to ensure the rights of casual workers, but it is a far more effective mechanism for ensuring fairness than the amendments before us. In my view, we should be insisting on the opposition amendments.
Finally, I want to comment briefly on the rejection of the House of Representatives of Senate amendments (1) and (5) which go to enabling the Industrial Relations Commission to vary an award to reduce the period of time a casual must serve before being able to access the termination of employment provisions and to enabling better rights in that respect to be inserted into a certified agreement. Given what we know regarding the casualisation of the Australian work force, ought we not empower the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to deal with the reality of workers' lives in this way? 
I think it is extremely disappointing that these amendments do not appear to be being insisted upon. They provide an opportunity to enable the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, on the basis of evidence before it, to provide appropriate protection for Australian workers rather than leaving such protection to the theoretical considerations of the Senate. I think it is also interesting that a government that trumpets enterprise bargaining and seeks to move away from centralised conditions is refusing an amendment which denies employers and employees the right to negotiate provisions that give unfair dismissal rights to ostensible casual workers. It seems to me that those amendments ought to have been insisted upon.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR TERMINATION) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I suspect that, with the time now available, I will have the opportunity only to deal with a couple of aspects of the issues that I wanted to cover specifically relating to the amendments to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002. But before I go to that area I will revisit one of the issues that I raised in my opening remarks following Senator Murray's reflection on some anecdotal data that is available here. I have not had an answer to this question—I can only assume, through lack of answer, that the review the government promised the Democrats has never been done.
—I will table it if you want me to.
—I would like you to. I would find it very interesting. If we do not conclude this discussion now, by the time we come back on Monday the data might be very useful.
—It proves you wrong.
—No, it does not prove me wrong because I did not assert that you had not done it. I said that you had not answered my question. 
 (Senator Hutchins)—Order, Minister! Stop provoking the speaker.
—I am very pleased that you have now answered my question. I suspect that Senator Murray thought it was up to the government to protect themselves on that point. But, if you are tabling that document, I thank you very much.
The final point that I want to make on principle—and something that I am sure Senator Murray will join with me on—relates to some of the more recent reports about what is happening to Victorian employees. It looks as if, finally, we can move towards a resolution for the Victorian employees that were referred to the federal jurisdiction by Jeff Kennett and that consistent standards of employment will be introduced into the federal jurisdiction for Victorian workers. I raise that principle because we have all been quite strong on it. The principle is that if you are going to accept that employees should have access to particular entitlements it should be done consistently. This is my biggest problem with what has been proposed, as Senator Murray outlined here. What we are really saying is that casuals should be protected by fair termination but they have to have a much longer probationary period. 
I have not heard anywhere the case justifying a difference between a regular and systemic casual and a part-timer and a full-timer in what is the necessary relevant probationary period. I do not know if that argument has actually been addressed, Senator Murray. I am not aware of it. Whilst I was not acting in this role for about 18 months, it may have occurred, but I certainly have not heard it. That is the issue of principle. Unless by some principle you can argue that these workers should not have access to an entitlement, and unless you can use some principle to rationalise why that should be the case, then they should have access to protection of fair termination on the same basis as any other employee in the federal jurisdiction. Senator Murray has already indicated that he agrees with us that six months is a far more reasonable level. He has already noted that there is a fair degree of inconsistency right across this field which he sought to address in the—
—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002.
—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill, that's right. Thank you, Senator Murray. I think that is a critical issue for us. If we are going to be working towards a unitary federal industrial relations system, then consistency needs to be the principle. I think that this is where this arrangement is erring significantly. 
There are some other concerns which I have that I will flag briefly, as I suspect that we will run out of time. In relation to unlawful termination, we supported the Democrat amendments, but on that occasion not in the absence of access at six months to unfair termination protection. Now that we are looking at a scenario whereby casuals would only have access to unlawful termination for up to 12 months, I think it is relevant for the chamber to consider the issue that Senator Murray raised in the press today about what the real value of these provisions is for casuals. In one sense, Senator Murray argued that they were valuable but, in another sense, he acknowledged that there is not a very high level of litigation in this area and it is possibly hard to judge. But I want to share with the chamber some experience from the sector about what is really involved here. 
 (Senator Hutchins)—Order! It being 12.45 p.m., I shall report progress but, before I do that, I understand Senator Campbell wishes to table a document.
—Yes. I table a report by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003. The purpose of the bill is to provide for indexation of Commonwealth funds to the states and territories for vocational education and training pursuant to the current ANTA agreement. The bill would also appropriate funds for 2004 in line with the Commonwealth's proposal for the next ANTA agreement covering the period 2004-06. Yesterday I spoke to another bill relating to vocational education and training, the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003, and I would like to continue the themes that I was developing in the debate. At this point, I formally move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name:
	At the end of the motion, add:
		“But the Senate condemns the Government for:
	(a)	its neglect of vocational education and training since it came to office in 1996; and
	(b)	making misleading statements about the future funding levels for the new Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) agreement; and
calls on the Government to amend the Bill to provide appropriate funding levels for the new ANTA agreement, and provide funds for 20,000 additional TAFE places.” 
It is a surprise to me that these two bills were not debated in a cognate form yesterday, but I presume that is a question for the government in the management of the program. I noted yesterday that the government is opposed to vocational education and training and that the VET sector has been characterised by delay, stagnation and neglect. This is not a carping or petty criticism. I believe it to be a major issue because the needs are urgent and pressing. Australia simply cannot afford to drag its feet. The world is changing too fast and we run the risk of being left behind in the global economy. Other countries are pouring funds into new policies to upskill their work forces. We must match them. Equally, we have to make a concerted effort to upgrade the productivity and the skills of each and every member of the labour force. We have to do this because of our changing demography. 
Over the next 20 years or so, the ratio of working people to non-working people will fall from six to one, as it is today, to three to one—that is, half the current level. So, theoretically, to maintain our standard of living, every working person will need to increase their productivity quite dramatically. This will happen, in part, through improvements in technology. It would be facilitated if we were to have a serious national research strategy, which would provide for the necessary R&D within this country. It would also be accompanied by higher levels of skill, and particularly new skills, which, of course, the vocational and education system would be more than able to provide, if it were given the opportunity to do so. The government is admitting that lifting education and training skills is crucial to our collective future. Budget Paper No. 1 of 2003 states:
Investment in education and skills is critical to improving productivity and participation levels throughout the economy.
It goes on to say:
Improving education and training outcomes can increase productivity directly by increasing the skills and abilities of individual workers and indirectly by raising the flexibility of workplace teams. It also allows more rapid utilisation and transmission of new skills and production technologies, having a dynamic effect in increasing productivity.
The paper goes on to make a few other points about the implications of an ageing work force, a proposition which I think has particular merit. It states:
An ageing population, with an older labour force, will need to engage increasingly in lifelong learning to improve labour force participation choices. The education and training system will need to be flexible and responsive enough to adapt to changes in the ages of its key clients, as well as to continual change in the skills required as the economy evolves.
So despite these admissions, the government has failed our national vocational education sector. None of the necessary changes will happen unless an agenda for a national training reform is pursued. Such an agenda has to be led and driven, in my judgment, by the Commonwealth, working in partnership with the states but with the Commonwealth playing a critically important role. It is unfortunate that we have the misfortune to have a Commonwealth government that is apparently, under the present minister, not prepared to show the necessary leadership in that regard.
In 2002 the Senate produced a landmark report on the future of our national vocational education system entitled Aspiring to excellence. Some people, including some senators here, regarded this title as a little bit too grandiose: too grand for the subject, too grand for blue-collar workers and too grand for technical workers. It is obviously not a sentiment that I share. I argued then, as I argue now, that excellence is precisely what we need in our skilled work force and what we should be striving for. A failure to appreciate this fact has been endemic in this government's policy approach and the disastrous coalition government policy of growth through efficiencies, set in place since 1997, which saw a significant cut to the system and seriously undermined the quality of the system as a whole. Since then we have seen modest funding for growth, and it was not restored until the stand-off between the states in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election, when the Howard government sought to buy votes by attempting to appear generous to TAFE colleges. However, the government, under Minister Kemp and now Minister Nelson, has lacked the political will to implement the agenda envisaged in the report Aspiring to excellence. It has not responded to the debates that raged throughout that period, and the concerns that continue to be expressed demonstrate to me a fundamental lack of vision and a lack of action. 
If we compare that with the higher education sector, the contrast could not be more stark. The neglect of the TAFE system can be seen sharply in contrast with the government's obsession with the draconian, radical reforms in higher education. My colleagues Jenny Macklin and Anthony Albanese have had a good deal to say about these matters in the other chamber, and I do not want to detract from that in any way. I point out, however, that it is no accident that this conservative government's obsession with making higher education more expensive and less accessible for ordinary working families means, in many respects, that those who participate in the TAFE sector, and the vocational education sector as a whole, have been disadvantaged. The government has an obsession with an elitist concept of education: an obsession with pouring additional money into wealthy private schools, which are often patronised by extremely wealthy people, at the great expense of the public education system. That has been followed through with its approach to the more exclusive end of the university spectrum, the `great eight'. We see this approach in the TAFE system, with the exclusion of many people amongst the 1.8 million Australians who participate in that system—13 per cent of the work force. There has been a neglect by the government to address the concerns of the vocational education system.
It is quite clear to me that we have a number of people in this country who do value the importance of the vocational education system. They are prepared to work hard in ensuring that the TAFE system is productive and that it keeps its critical role in our national economy. It is unfortunate that the government does not seem to share that particular vision. In this bill we see that there are no new funds being provided for the system. There are a few additional dollars overall, essentially in matters that have already been canvassed in the forward estimates in previous years. The bill provides for indexation—we understand that—but under terms and conditions that seriously disadvantage the TAFE system.
The indexation arrangement for schools—and I made a point similar to this yesterday—is running at the moment at 5.6 per cent. We see for universities an obviously inadequate amount of 2.2 per cent and in the vocational education system I think the figure stands at about 1.6 per cent. That is essentially what we are being told through the Senate estimates process. The additional funds from the base figure of $957 million for 2003 provide for an additional funding arrangement of $22 million. There is no way in the world you could seriously argue that this is effective compensation for the increases in the costs that are being experienced by people who are required to participate in the vocational education system. 
The average age of full-time TAFE teachers is well over 50. I am told that in Western Australia the average age is now 56. At a time when we need to rebuild and reinvigorate our teaching work force, we simply cannot allow the system to be run down in this way. I think there is a crisis approaching within the TAFE teaching work force, and it seems to me that this government has failed to turn its attention to that issue. It is striking that the government's indexation of funds is basically calculated on a cocktail of factors and was essentially set by the Treasury. It is not subject to public debate, but it ought be. When the universities argue their case in regard to indexation they are given considerable attention despite the fact that the government will not acknowledge the claims being made, but the VET sector does not get any share of the public debate on these issues. I think that ought to change.
What I see in this bill is that the government has not provided the necessary resources to allow that agenda to go forward at a time when the system seems to me to be developing serious indications of decay. The VET in Schools program has been working since 1996, and I acknowledge that the government introduced this particular program under the former minister, Dr Kemp. It was initially funded at $20 million per annum. It is a very good initiative. The annual funding from the Commonwealth is now $51 million, despite the fact that the growth in the system has been astronomical—three in four year 11 and 12 students ought be undertaking VET in School subjects next year, if the department's estimates are right in that regard. You have a situation here where a program has been introduced but has suffered serious defects from the very beginning, particularly around issues of quality. I do not believe that has been seriously attended to in the eight or so years that this program has been running.
I recall that a review of the program was undertaken in 2000 by the Allen Consulting Group. They demonstrated in their report that there were fundamental difficulties in the core issues about the purpose of the program and the quality assurance regime. Those issues still remain central to this debate but are not attended to in the current government policy framework. The Australian national training framework has failed to take into account just how critical this issue is in regard to the VET in Schools program. Some 250,000 students are now enrolled in this course. We simply cannot allow this situation to continue. I think we have to look at the arrangements in regard to costings, which are at the core of these quality problems. I note in the recent review, indicated by the cost of VET in Schools, that these questions are starting to come to the fore within the system as a whole.
The previous review from the Allen Consulting Group in 2000 was flawed in the sense that, while the group identified the key problems, it failed to consult widely about the solutions to those. During the review, parents, teachers, employers and unions were not spoken to about the difficulties. The current report from the consultancy let by DEST on the cost of VET in Schools still remains a long way short on any reasonable arrangements in terms of the total cost of running the program. The report is, again, based on a relatively small sample of schools—some 48. It is not clear how representative those schools are. The financial information they have provided seems to me to be somewhat limited and raises serious questions about whether or not an effective review has actually been undertaken.
We see in the report that the set-up costs for the VET in Schools program can vary considerably from school to school, ranging from $137,779 to $860,000 per school. The two alternative funding estimates provided in this report seem to be based on different conclusions. One is based on a 38-hour teaching week and the other on a 32-hour teaching week—a model which always seems to give the lowest hourly running cost within any of the estimates that were made. The 38-hour model, of course, applies in Victoria and the 32-hour model is the average throughout the rest of the system. Notwithstanding this, the 38-hour model has been designated as the national model, despite the fact that it is built upon the practice of only one state. 
It seems to me an example yet again of the way in which the cost estimate is always driven down to the lowest common denominator and may not measure anything other than what is occurring in a very small minority of schools. I say this particularly in the context of the VET in Schools program in Victoria, which does not have the same take-up rate that it does in other states. The report states that the cost estimates take into account the outcomes achieved and the quality of VET in Schools delivery. But, in terms of the expenditure data, the measurements being taken into account have no relationship to the quality of the training outcomes. So it does strike me that we have another example of the government failing to pick up what is required in terms of Commonwealth leadership. It has tried to present to this parliament yet another report which does not deal with the key issues in regard to a program which is, I repeat, affecting three out of four students at the year 11 and 12 stages of school.
If you look at VET in Schools and the other major failure of policy at the moment—the national consistency for quality assurance—you will see a situation where the government's priorities are falling way short in its rhetoric and its practice. It seems to me that we have a situation where second-best approaches are going on for far too long. For that reason, while we will be supporting this bill, I have moved a second reading amendment which condemns the government for its neglect of the vocational education and training system since it came to office in 1996 and for making misleading statements about the future funding of the new Australian national training agreement. It calls on the government to amend the bills to provide appropriate funding levels for the new ANTA agreement and to provide funds for an additional 20,000 TAFE places. This, in my judgment, would move considerably towards meeting the unmet demand in this country at the moment for TAFE places and is, I might point out, Labor Party policy.",SENATE,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-09-11,"—In concluding this debate, I will mention for those who are following the debate and who, after hearing Senator Carr, are confused as to what the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 is about, that the bill provides for the continuing operation and essential maintenance of the Australian government's key instrument of support for the vocational education and training system in Australia. The bill will provide ongoing funding support for the states and territories, supplementing 2002 funding by some $24.4 million to provide for normal price movements as required by the ANTA agreement.
The bill will also provide $1.1 billion for vocational education and training in 2004. That, of course, will be provided by the states and territories. The Australian government is working collaboratively with the states and territories on developing a new forward looking agreement for 2004 to 2006. The bill will help ensure that funding continuity is maintained in the national vocational education and training systems in 2004, after the 2001-03 agreement expires. This bill underpins the ongoing funding and development of the world-class vocational education and training sector that supports the competitiveness of our industries and Australia's economic and social development. 
A second reading amendment to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 has been moved. Without boring any listeners on the technicalities, it is rather an unusual approach to move an amendment to a bill being dealt with at this time of day. All parties have been consulted in relation to this particular piece of legislation and all parties have agreed that they support the bill; therefore, it was listed for debate at this time on a Thursday, which is the time for dealing with non-controversial legislation. That means that divisions will not be called and that senators can attend committee meetings and do other work that senators are always called upon to do. In contradiction of that convention, the Labor Party has moved a second reading amendment. It is an amendment that the government certainly does not agree with but, because we want to get this bill through, because it was listed to be dealt with today as non-controversial legislation and because senators are busy doing other things and will not be available to vote, we will not be calling for a division.
I am assured by Senator Carr that the Democrats and the Greens support his amendment, although their support, if it is such, is not very obvious. Senator Allison was listed to speak in this debate, but she is noticeable by her absence, having withdrawn her name from the speaking list. I will do an unusual thing in this instance—that is, accept that Senator Carr is being truthful when he says that the Democrats and the Greens would have supported his amendment—but it is all very irregular and it does call into question the arrangements that the whips and the government and opposition business managers in this chamber work so hard to deal with. Even though we will not be calling for a division, we do want to record that the government does not agree with the proposed second reading amendment. We oppose the amendment and reject the sentiments behind it, because record levels of funding have contributed to the government's achievements in the vocational education and training sector.
Over the next four years, the Australian government will spend over $8.4 billion on vocational education and training, of which $5.04 billion will go to the vocational education and training sector and most will be for distribution to the states and territories through the Australian National Training Authority. Nearly $3 billion will go to employer incentives, New Apprenticeships support services and other New Apprenticeships costs of the Australian government; and $0.4 billion will go to other vocational education and training programs funded by the government. In 2003-04, the Australian government will provide a total of $2.1 billion for vocational education and training, including an estimated $1.167 billion to the states and territories and an estimated $682.4 million to support the New Apprenticeships arrangements, including employer incentives.
Senator Carr calls for greater funding through the ANTA agreement. I would point out to honourable senators that the additional funds offered by the Howard government to the states include quite a number of items. The offer includes funding of around $3.6 billion over the life of the new agreement, with indexation. Compared to 2003 funding, the offer provides an additional $220 million to the states and territories. Growth funding will be indexed over the period of the agreement and, with indexation, will total $325.5 million over the period of the new agreement. Compared to $230 million in the current agreement, this reflects a $95 million increase, which is substantial in anyone's language. There is also $119.5 million over three years for additional places in Australian government priority areas such as mature age workers and people with a disability. This is average real growth in recurrent funding of 2.5 per cent per annum, and the total increase in funding over three years is 12.5 per cent compared to total funding in the current 2001-03 agreement. 
Senator Carr's amendment calls for an additional 20,000 TAFE places. Senator Carr tells us that it is Labor Party policy. That is again an unusual statement. I was not aware that they had any policies, except the one that I heard Mr Crean giving at budget time: he was going to fix the Murray-Darling Basin by stopping droughts. That is a pretty good election policy to have, and I might almost vote for him myself if he can simply stop droughts. I know some in the Labor Party think he is a god-like figure; I know others do not. But how you have a policy to stop droughts is very interesting and intriguing. He did explain that by saying that he was going to sign the Kyoto agreement and that, by signing the Kyoto agreement, he would be able to stop droughts and fix the Murray-Darling Basin—a great policy. No wonder so many people on the Labor side want to get rid of Mr Crean when that is an element of his policy approach. Having said that and indicated our opposition to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr, I commend the bill to the Senate and thank the Democrats and the Greens—and, indeed, the Labor Party—for supporting the thrust of this important bill.
 (Senator Hutchins)—I remind honourable senators that, under a sessional order agreed to on 20 June 2002, after the second reading of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 I shall call on the minister to move the third reading unless any senator requires that the bill be considered in the Committee of the Whole.",SENATE,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-09-11,"—by leave—I would like to make a very short statement. The minister at the table, the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Ian Macdonald, implied that the opposition had behaved in a dishonest way with the second reading amendment. I want to state explicitly that that is totally untrue. The opposition has always proposed that there be a second reading amendment. A second reading amendment was moved in the House of Representatives. Even a person with as limited command of this material as the minister at the table would have understood that if he had been properly advised. I would like to reiterate that we do not behave dishonestly in these matters. This is a position we have stated from the very beginning of this debate.

Is the minister aware of the recommendations of the report into the Jenkins case undertaken by Tony Blunn for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, and in particular the recommendation at paragraph 40 that departments and agencies must report major security breaches to ASIO in accordance with the provisions of the Protective Security Manual? Has ONA reported the leak of the top-secret AUSTEO ONA document to ASIO and, if so, when?

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-11,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. I ask the minister whether he could confirm that the Blunn report into the Jenkins case states at paragraph 90:
... the requirement to report [security breaches to ASIO] only makes sense if the intention is that it is done as soon as the decision has been made that the incident alleged or actual would constitute or is a serious security breach.
I would like to ask the minister in a general sense whether the recommendations of the Blunn report were comprehensively implemented in relation to the issue that I raised in my earlier question to the minister. If he is checking this matter, he could perhaps inform the Senate of the time when ASIO was informed of the Bolt security breach.

The minister would be aware that that question on notice has now been due for 436 days.
—Was that 436 days?
—It was 436 days. Given that the minister encouraged us, rather than going through the Parliamentary Library, to use questions on notice as a vehicle for gaining information, I point out to him that I think I have had a reasonable wait, in waiting 436 days. I have been extremely patient. I wrote to the minister some weeks ago, asking him to turn his attention to this matter. I concede he is very busy, but I would appreciate it if he could provide an answer to that question, which, as I say, is now 436 days overdue.

—It is just your normal inefficiency!
—You mean it is incompetence.
—No, I think he could have also recognised in making his point that literally hundreds of questions have been answered by me to him on time, and many of those questions are multipart questions and many are in great deal. He obviously has somebody in his office who does nothing else but sit there all day writing very detailed questions. Despite the enormous amount of Defence officials' time that is taken up in answering them, it is obviously part of the democratic process.

It is true, I regret to say, that this one fell through the cracks and it did so because it involved a range of different ministers.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today. 
This issue has arisen as a result of a visit that I undertook to the dockyards last week. Of course, these are the dockyards where the Anzac class frigates are currently being constructed. They are on the last vessel. The last keel was laid earlier in the year. This visit followed a meeting of a delegation of western region mayors from Melbourne. These mayors met with opposition spokespeople and with government ministers about their grave concerns for the future of the Melbourne shipyards. The workers and management at the shipyard in Williamstown have produced some of the finest work of naval service shipbuilding in the country at the moment. They play a vital role in the industrial infrastructure of Melbourne. They make a very substantial contribution to the western suburbs both in direct employment at the shipyards and in subcontracting. They are generating some $406 million annually in economic activity for the region. This has huge flow-on consequences for Melbourne and impacts hugely in value-adding and in providing opportunities for employment in the skilled trades.
The social and economic consequences of the dockyards are profound—they range right through, from the universities and the TAFE colleges of the region to the hospitals and the housing markets of the west of Melbourne. Eighty to 90 per cent of the employees on the dockyards are in fact residents of the western region of Melbourne. These shipyards, I repeat, are a critical part of the region's social and economic infrastructure, and the loss of industrial capacity that may well flow from government decisions needs to be registered and understood here. The social vandalism that would arise in such circumstances needs to be understood.
The shipyards in Melbourne are facing a further round of lay-offs later this year—60 to 70 employees will be laid off before Christmas, and a similar number again will be laid off in May next year. The work force has already been slashed by 60 per cent, and the government's dithering will lead to a further reduction of 15 per cent by early next year. These dockyards are in desperate need of new contracts. They are reliant upon the government for shipbuilding work—and, of course, naval shipbuilding work at that. If they do not secure another contract within a year, it is my information that those dockyards will effectively be mothballed. 
The situation here may well lead to an irreversible loss of capacity for the shipyards in Melbourne. Grave concerns about the future have been expressed by the government in Victoria, and they reflect the views of local government right throughout the region. It is time for this government to make clear what its position is regarding the future of those facilities. As I understand it, the Premier of Victoria has taken up the concerns of the people of Victoria directly with the Prime Minister. Senior ministers in this government have also been approached on this question. I understand that the Prime Minister has said that the decisions of the government will be made on a fair and transparent basis. We are yet to see any evidence that that assurance will be vindicated.
This is a very impressive facility with a highly skilled work force that is in the process of completing the 10 frigates for the Australian and New Zealand navies. They are able to produce work that, I would suggest, is state of the art in manufacturing arrangements in this country. They are the pre-eminent naval surface shipbuilder in the country.
—Good company, Tenix.
—You mention Tenix, and I trust that their major problem has not been the political mistake of employing the former Minister for Defence. I trust that these issues will be dealt with in a fair and reasonable way and that the government will not be acting to discriminate against them because of their hostility to the former defence minister. I trust that the minister is not going to act in this way. Shipbuilding rationalisation plans were announced by the government in August 2002. We have yet to see any response.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-09-11,"—Senator Carr comes before the Senate like one of the great illusionists in many guises. Sometimes he appears as the defender of totalitarian regimes, sometimes he appears as the man who attacks quality and standards in the Australian tertiary education system, sometimes he appears in the guise of the man who attacks Australia's most distinguished public servants, like Dr Shergold, in estimates and in Senate hearings; but today we see Senator Carr in a new and different guise—a most surprising guise. We see Senator Carr in the guise of the defender of Australian defence industries. What a surprising guise for Senator Carr to appear in before us today.
If you boil it down, there were two complaints in Senator Carr's speech. The first complaint was of loss of jobs in the shipbuilding industry and, secondly, the complaint of the desperate need for new defence contracts for Australian shipbuilding companies, particularly the Williamstown naval dockyard. Has the irony escaped any senator in this chamber that this complaint about loss of jobs in the shipbuilding sector comes within three hours of the announcement that unemployment in Australia today, as a result of the policies of the Howard government and as a result of the outstanding economic management of the Treasurer, Peter Costello, has fallen to its lowest level in 13 years? For years we have been saying that, if we keep the economic policy settings right, if we do not take our eye off the ball, if we maintain fiscal discipline, the day will come before long when we will see the unemployment figure with a five in front of it. That claim was ridiculed by our friends on the Labor Party benches, it was ridiculed by Senator Carr and I wouldn't be surprised, Senator Marshall, if it was ridiculed by you.
—I am sorry, Senator Marshall, I misrepresent you. It was not ridiculed by you. I am pleased to see that it was not. That day has come to pass, because at noon today the figures were announced and unemployment in this country has a number with a five in front of it, 5.8 per cent—the lowest level of unemployment in this country since the recession we had to have in 1990, the lowest level of unemployment in this country in the living memory of anyone in the work force under the age of 30, the lowest level of unemployment of almost any OECD economy and that, in the circumstances described by Senator Minchin in his answer to a question from Senator Colbeck, in the most unfavourable international economic climate.
Yet here comes Senator Carr, the great illusionist, with the effrontery to say that this government is responsible for the loss of jobs in the defence contracting industry. The great vandal—the great, to use Senator Carr's words, social vandal—when it came to employment prospects in this country was the Hawke and Keating government. Why is it that we have unemployment today in Australia, for the first time in a decade and a half, below six per cent? I will tell you why, Mr Deputy President: because we have not maintained inefficient industries, we have not allowed industries to hide their inefficiencies behind tariff walls; we have pursued a process of economic rationalisation, as a result of which our economy is now productive. Productivity generates wealth, wealth generates profitability, profitability generates more investment and more investment generates more jobs. That is the very thing about which socialists like Senator Carr complain. They lament profitability, they lament wealth and they lament investment, and they cannot see that those are the very motors that drive economic prosperity.  
So don't come into this chamber, Senator Carr, and talk about social vandalism, don't come and cry your crocodile tears about the loss of jobs when you were a member of a government that presided over the highest levels of unemployment seen in this country since the Depression—on the very day, this red-letter day, when the Howard government has brought unemployment below six per cent.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I rise to take note of the answer given to the question I asked of Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence. In the short time that I have been here, it never ceases to amaze me when I witness the ability of government senators to rewrite history in the space of five minutes, with an absolute disregard to the facts of the matter or the historical truth and reality. But that is not the issue that I wanted to raise today. It probably should not surprise any senators who have taken an interest in the Defence portfolio that I rise again to talk about another economic debacle in that portfolio—an issue that has been an absolute debacle from start to finish. 
We have had a process in Defence where, as the minister said, the government wanted to test the economic viability of all the areas in Defence, including health services. Defence go through a process of asking for tenders to provide health services in the defence forces. All the tenders come in over the price that Defence currently provides that service for. You would think that to all normal people that would tell you something. It would tell you that the services that Defence are providing in health are obviously within the market range and that they are in fact providing them economically and efficiently. Not one private tender could come in below the cost that health is now provided for by Defence—not in this ministry, the ministry that is full of economic wonders and miracles. We have had all sorts of criticisms in the ASPI reports and from the Auditor-General, we have had the ridiculous scenario of the land and property sales and leaseback which cost Defence twice the amount over a 20-year period for the properties that they need to use and described as an economic miracle, yet here is another one. 
So they send the tenderers away to try again. Their ideological perspective is that it does not matter what the economic reality is: `We want these services absolutely privatised and outsourced, even if it is going to cost us more.' So Mayne Health gets cajoled into entering into tortuous and long negotiations to try to be a successful tenderer. In doing so, Minister Danna Vale prematurely closes down RAAF6 in a fit of excitement, waiting for Mayne to arrive to take over Defence Health Services. RAAF6 was one of only six deployable field hospitals that the Australian defence forces had. It rotated twice to East Timor and was an excellent training facility for reservists who seek to develop specialist military medicine skills for use in operations. Yet after 12 months of painful and expensive negotiations RAAF6 is now closed and Mayne still have not signed. 
So the government decide that they need to offer some inducements. What do they offer? To try to get Mayne Health over the line so they can do away with an already economic and efficient service being provided by Defence, they offer them, at taxpayers' expense, free gas, free power, free phones, free computer links, free maintenance, free pharmaceuticals and free transport of patients. You would think, `How could that not be enough to get them over the line?' but there is more. They offer them $1 rent for nine hospitals and health facilities; yet it was still not enough to get them over the line. Even with these massive taxpayer funded inducements, Mayne still walked away from the contract. They still could not make money on it. This is another absolute demonstration that the services that are being provided now in the health area of Defence are economic, viable, competitive and beat the private sector. 
So here we are today in this shameful situation with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars spent, the RAAF6 base gutted and closed and medical staff posted all over the country out of Victoria, with Defence and the government trying to convince all these people to come back, so we can continue to provide health services for Defence. Sometimes I feel sorry for this particular minister, because I know this government finds good help hard to get, and his helper in this case is Minister Danna Vale, who certainly has not been any help to him in this situation. If we look at Minister Vale's press release, it states:

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2003-09-11,"—I am always disappointed when I hear—and I hear it more prevalently these days than ever before in my political career—the opposition's railing against the defence forces which obviously induces insecurity within the Defence Force staff. The defence forces used to be viewed as being sacred and immune from the criticism that the Australian Labor Party offer these days by way of a perceived legitimate debate and tools to use against the coalition government. In generic terms, the facts are that the Australian defence forces have never been better off. Under this government, there has been growth both in the expertise to which the defence forces have access and in the three main services of the defence forces: the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. A white paper was released by the government last year that set out a potential record for spending on the Australian defence forces. Unfortunately, the opposition has a history of not looking after Australian Defence Force personnel. By and large, the Australian defence forces support a coalition government, because over the hundred years federation has existed it has always been coalition or conservative governments that have looked towards Defence Force personnel as being a priority with respect to spending and providing those supplies which make their lives and their conditions among the best in the world.
Senator Marshall talked of the Mayne Group, which notified Defence recently of its withdrawal from negotiations as one of the preferred tenderers for provisions of Defence Force health services in Victoria. The fact that one preferred tenderer is withdrawing from it does not mean there will be a diminution of it. It may come back again. It has given no indication it will not tender again or will not in fact assist the government wherever it can or wherever it is feasible for it to do so. The developments with the present contractor are disappointing. They were expected to include a more rational and productive use of Australian Defence Force health assets and cost savings as a result of the improved delivery of services to those Defence Force personnel in Victoria.
I recall when the Vietnam veterans who had not already returned to Australia from Vietnam were sent home in 1975. As a consequence, they suffered tremendous psychological problems, and other problems they brought with them from the Vietnam War. I recall when our Defence Force personnel went to East Timor that they did not get a rousing send-off from the opposition at that stage. I recall when our Defence Force personnel went off to the Middle-East. Every one of them, I am proud to say, came back from the Middle-East, but when they were sent off they were not sent off with the best wishes of the federal opposition. 
There is too much of a history of the opposition not supporting our Defence Force men and women, who are among the finest in the world. It is a continuing source of annoyance and concern to me that the opposition continues not only to pick away and cause insecurity among not just the Australian Defence Force personnel—who are, as I said, amongst the finest in the world—but to pick away so that the people of Australia are often induced to believe there is something wrong and that the government is not giving its top priority to them. History and statistics bear that out. They bear out that the government spends more on defence per capita than the previous 13 years of hard Labor did between the early eighties and the mid-nineties when this government took office. To say that this government neglects the Australian Defence Force personnel in any manner, in any sphere, defies logic and defies history. We know that the government is proud of its Australian Defence Force personnel—(Time expired).",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,26,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-09-11,"—In taking note of the answer to the question that I asked of Senator Hill today, I just want to place on record a correction to Senator Lightfoot's meagre and poor contribution to our motion to take note of answers this afternoon. When our troops were sent off to the Iraq war earlier this year it is absolutely not correct to say that they were not sent off with the best wishes of the opposition. That is blatantly untrue. It is not at all a correct representation of the position of the Australian Labor Party. It ought to be put on record that that was not, and never will be, the position of the Australian Labor Party. I want to correct that because I think it is very wrong indeed. I want to ensure that our position is represented correctly and not misrepresented in the way Senator Lightfoot chose to.
I asked Senator Hill this afternoon a question about Defence Force personnel—nearly 580 around this country—who are about to have a severe pay cut as a result of an administrative bungle by the Defence Force. This is not the first time that our troops have had to put up with inconsistent advice on their pay and conditions. It happened back in July and August with advice about income tax exemptions in relation to allowances that were paid to officers in East Timor. It has come to our attention that back in 1999 there were a number of clerical and storeman troops in the trades area who were paid at the same pay rate, in the same pay group, as the rifleman's trades. I understand that was in a discussion, a review, that was held back in 1999. As a result of that, we had an agreement in 2001 that the RA infantry clerks and storemen would be paid at a higher rate than the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal would have determined. I suppose that was a handshake or an agreement—whatever you call it in the Army. It certainly was not a Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal determination. Nothing was done back in 2001 to correct that, to ensure it was a determination or to put any legality into that agreement at all. So, after the best part of three or four years, the 580 troops who are affected by this decision have now been told: `Oops, sorry, we have made a mistake here, we cannot actually keep paying you at this rate. As soon as possible you will have your pay cut.'
—I thought I would get some benefit from this.
—You need to get some benefit from this, Minister, because when I asked you about this you seemed to have a `don't know, don't care' attitude and you were going to handball it off to Ms Danna Vale.
—I thought I might get a bit of information.
—Minister, if you listen, you might find out.
—It is an issue that does need your attention; it does need to be rectified.
—Who told them?
—They were informed of this by one of the major generals in a memo dated 2 September 2003, so it is an official communication that has been sent to these people. It says that at a recent meeting:
The resulting position was ... soldiers employed outside the terms of the determination and outside of the 2001 agreement should revert as soon as possible (48 soldiers)—
to a lower pay level. It continued:
Soldiers employed outside the terms of the determination but in accordance with 2001 agreement should revert on 31 Dec 03 (~530 soldiers).
What we have got here, though, is a case of simply mishandling, once again, the pay and conditions of the foot soldiers in our Army. As someone said to me on the telephone yesterday, these are the grunts, basically—these are the people who are actually part of the engine room of the Army. Rather than simply saying to these people, `We have made an administrative mistake; we will put a fence around you and you will stay on the pay level you are on and we will seek to rectify it.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-09-11,"—The management of fish stocks in this country should be of great concern to all Australians. It was clear from the AFMA report that some serious problems have been developing in commercial fisheries managed by the Commonwealth and also with regard to the stock numbers of 74 commercially fished fish species. What is interesting about this report is that it points out that research is a long way from where it needs to be to make certain assessments for us to be assured that the management practices being employed and the catch levels being applied will ensure a sustainable fishery.
It is interesting that, as a result of the QFJA report, a set of data collecting methods have now been put in place which I hope will very quickly bring to the fore information that is required to make a better assessment of some of the fish species that have been targeted in particular. It is interesting to note at page 5 of the report a table of commercial catches of fin fish by calendar year from 1997 to 2001. The important point about this is that we are now in 2003 but in some species there has been an increased catch capacity which I think in some respects is quite worrying because of the technology available. I am certainly looking forward to the next report so that the parliament can make a better assessment of whether or not the fisheries management practices being employed around this country, particularly in respect of Commonwealth fisheries, are sufficient.

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I move:
That the following amendments to the resolutions relating to senators' interests and declaration of gifts to the Senate and the Parliament be agreed to:
Resolution 1—Registration of senators' interests
Paragraph (1), omit—
“Within 14 sitting days after the adoption of this resolution by the Senate and 28 days of making and subscribing an oath or affirmation of allegiance as a senator”,
substitute—
“Within:
	(a)	28 days after the first meeting of the Senate after 1 July first occurring after a general election; and
	(b)	28 days after the first meeting of the Senate after a simultaneous dissolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives; and
	(c)	28 days after making and subscribing an oath or affirmation of allegiance as a senator for a Territory or appointed or chosen to fill a vacancy in the Senate”.
Resolution 3—Registrable interests
Paragraph (i), omit “$5,000”, substitute “$7,500”.
Paragraphs (k), (l) and (m), omit “$500” wherever ocurring, substitute “$750”; omit “$200” wherever occurring, substitute “$300”.
Resolution 4—Register and Registrar of Senators' Interests
Paragraph (3), omit “the commencement of each Parliament”, substitute “receipt of statement of registrable interests in accordance with resolution 1(1)”.
[Consequential on amendment to paragraph 1(1)] 
Resolution 5—Declaration of interest in debate and other proceedings
To be omitted.
Resolution relating to declaration of gifts to the Senate and the Parliament
Paragraph (1)(a), omit “practical”, substitute “practicable”.
Sub-paragraph (ba), omit “$500”, substitute “$750”; omit “$200” substitute “$300”.
Sub-paragraph (d), line 2, omit “is to”, substitute “may”.
After sub-paragraph (h), insert—
	(i)	When a senator who is using or displaying a gift ceases to be a senator, the senator may retain the gift: 
	(i)	if its value does not exceed the stated valuation limits of $750 for a gift received from an official government source, or $300 from a private person or non-government body; or
	(ii)	if the senator elects to pay the difference between the stated valuation limit and the value of the gift, as obtained from an accredited valuer selected from the list issued by the Committee for Taxation Incentives for the Arts. The Department of the Senate will be responsible for any costs incurred in obtaining the valuation.
	(j)	If the senator does not retain the gift in accordance with paragraph (i), the senator must return the gift to the registrar, who shall: 
	(i)	dispose of it in accordance with instructions from the Committee of Senators' Interests, as set out in paragraph 1(d) of this resolution; or
	(ii)	arrange its donation to a nominated non-profit organisation or charity, at the discretion of the senator who has returned the gift and the Committee of Senators' Interests.
	(k)	Any senator subject to paragraph (j) must formally acknowledge relinquishment of the senator's claim to ownership of any surrendered gifts.
The motion before the Senate arose from recommendations made in report 2/2002 of the Committee of Senators' Interests tabled on 20 June 2002. Notice of this motion has been on the Notice Paper for over 12 months while informal consultations amongst senators took place. The committee subsequently agreed to amend the notice of motion in respect of the value of gifts and assets required to be declared, and it is in the amended form that it appears on today's Notice Paper. The thresholds of the amended motion are lower than originally proposed and in most cases represent a 50 per cent increase from 1994 values rather than a 100 per cent or greater increase. 
I remind honourable senators that the motion also provides (1) for all senators to make a full declaration of interests at least once in each parliament and (2) for the requirements for each senator to declare relevant interests when first speaking or voting on a notice before the Senate to be removed. The committee recommended that the requirements to declare interests orally be omitted on the basis that each senator's statement of registerable interests is already published. As the report notes, it is up to the individual senators if they decide it is necessary to alert the Senate to any particular conflict of interest relating to the private section of the statement concerning their spouses, partners or dependent children, or for senators who have not yet lodged statements of registerable interests to declare their interests publicly if appropriate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-11,"—I thank Senator Denman for informing us about the motion, and I move an amendment to the motion:
Omit:
Resolution 5—Declaration of interest in debate and other proceedings
	To be omitted.
This is a very important matter. It goes to the heart of transparency in our dealings with all the public matters that come before this Senate. Since 1985, some 3,000 bills have come through the Senate, but there have been only about 120 declarations of interest on the floor of the Senate during that period. I know that that has irked some senators and that there is a certain sense of fragility about the requirement that we declare interest. But in practice it is a rare occasion when there is an interest which is sufficient to require a senator to declare it.
The need for that declaration is very great. There is a register of senatorial interests, but it is out of view and very often out of mind. There are two good reasons why the oral declaration in the Senate during a debate on a matter in which a senator has an interest should be made. The first reason is that it brings into the mind of that senator the fact that they have a pecuniary interest or that a spouse or partner has a pecuniary interest. It also brings it freshly to the mind of the rest of the Senate. That is very important. The other reason is that we are elected members from the Australian community and we cannot absent ourselves from a debate or a vote in this parliament. That is manifestly different from the situation which pertains in local government, where, if a councillor has a pecuniary interest, they are expected to absent themselves from the debate and from the vote. It is manifestly different from the situation in corporate Australia, where, under law, those on the board of a corporation are required to remove themselves from the board if they have a direct pecuniary interest—there are some exceptional circumstances—and not take part in the debate or the vote.
If senators look at our own standing orders—and many may not know this—they will see that in committees of this Senate it is expected that senators will not take part in a committee inquiry if they have a pecuniary interest. It is expected that they will absent themselves from it. That is not the case when the matter comes before the Senate itself. We cannot absent ourselves or fail to vote, because our voters have put us here to do that. Therefore, it is critical that the oral declaration of interest be made during the debate on the floor of the Senate.
The rule came into the Senate in 1994, having first been brought before it by former Senators Gareth Evans and Button in 1987. It came in after a lot of consideration, for the reasons I have just outlined. The whole of the pecuniary interest legislation, including the register, was, you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, vociferously opposed by the then members of the opposition. Senator Button referred to `the lassitude, indifference, obfuscation and neglect of opposition senators who on numerous occasions previously have sought to oppose this motion'.
On the occasion of the introduction of the rule in 1994, Democrat Senators Macklin and Coulter pointed to their concern that the oral declaration would be onerous for members of the Senate. I would have thought that the committee recommendation, and therefore the motion before the Senate tonight, could have dealt with that difficulty, if indeed it is there. It seems sensible to me that a single declaration of an interest in the course of debate on a bill would suffice. But to remove it altogether is unforgivable. Are we to go back two decades by effecting an advantage, through the debate and the vote we make, by removing the requirement that we as parliamentarians, when debating a matter in which we have a pecuniary interest—in which we have shares, real estate interests or financial interests of some sort, right across the board—declare that interest? It is wrong that we should not have to declare that interest during that debate. 
There has been no adequate explanation for the removal of section (5) of the part of the standing orders dealing with the registration and declaration of senators' interests, which requires that senators make an oral declaration. That is because there is no good reason for it. That is because there is no excuse. I know that there are senators here who have been embarrassed, annoyed and frustrated—and I have drawn attention to it—by the requirement on occasions to declare interests that they may have. I am talking about declaring interests in woodchip companies if we are dealing with logging legislation like the regional forest agreement, in mining corporations or coal companies if we are dealing with bills which give enormous corporate welfare and billions of dollars of it. That is the exact reason why we should have to declare it—and declare it here on the floor of the Senate so that, in a situation where the senator cannot be asked to leave the debate or not vote, it is clear to everybody that that senator has that interest.
It is most important that the senators themselves reflect upon their duty not to allow that interest to intrude or influence their participation in the debate or the vote that comes at the end of it. How can you do that in a debate if no declaration is made? I repeat that the register is there, but it is not readily available and is certainly not called to mind in this place when a debate takes place. The register has a very important function, but it does not replace the importance of making oral declarations when we come into this place.
I am astounded that the Senate is moving towards omitting section (5). I am astounded that, in a situation where no senator can forgo participation in a debate or a vote on a matter in which they have a pecuniary interest, we are saying through this amendment, `But we won't declare it. We won't have to declare it in debate in the Senate.' We will go back 20 years to the bad old days when it was considered that a senator's own wealth or commercial interest was not a matter for anybody but themselves.
We live in an age when there is enormous influence on senators—on all parliamentarians—by vested interests. That influence is heightened when one has a direct personal gain to make from voting for a piece of legislation which advances that interest. What logic can there be in not having a requirement that a senator declare such an interest in the debate? It is absolutely basic to transparency and good governance. The alternative is that we legislate so that no senator may have a pecuniary interest—certainly not in the corporate sector, which is benefited so often by the laws that we bring in through this place. You cannot do that, so you require the declaration. It could be improved but it cannot be abolished. That would go against the interests of good democracy and of transparency by all of us representing the Australian people in this place.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Senators' Interests Committee</title>,Committees,32,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-09-11,"—I have been speaking today with some of my colleagues who are members of local councils in New South Wales. If you are a local councillor in New South Wales you need to declare a pecuniary interest. You do not just declare a pecuniary interest by putting it down on a register of local councillors' interests; where you have a direct pecuniary interest, you need to declare it within the debate and state the nature of the interest. In a local council it may relate to your property being near the property the development application you are discussing is located, or it may relate to a cousin or a brother and their relationship with the development application that is being discussed. 
You declare the interest in the local council meeting, you state the nature of the interest you have in the issue and then you do not participate in the debate. In fact, in New South Wales you go outside the chamber where the issue is being debated. It is not just a declaration you make by writing on a form that goes into the ether of bureaucracy, where nobody understands how to find it or remembers it when the debate is on. My colleagues who are councillors in New South Wales have made it clear to me that it is much more extensive than that. You declare the interest, you state its nature, you do not participate in the debate and you leave the chamber where the debate is occurring.
I do not know why the Senate seems to believe that it is above this process of having to declare pecuniary interests and having to make it clear what the issues being discussed are. I think it is really important that we put this in the context of the views of the general Australian population on parliamentarians and their pecuniary interests. What are the attitudes? What is the cynicism that exists throughout Australian society in relation to parliamentarians in chambers like this? It is extremely important that we put this debate within that context, and I will get to that later. 
Going back to my home state of New South Wales, some local councils have a code of conduct—not a law but a code of conduct—whereby councillors have to declare any non-pecuniary interest as well. For example, if an issue being debated relates to a close friend of theirs or to a close colleague within the same political party, or if for some other reason there is a non-financial interest, they also need to declare that within the debate. This has been an extremely important issue of public debate in my home state, particularly in relation to local councils. Senators will remember the media attention—it has been all over the front pages of the Sydney Morning Herald—given to Rockdale City Council in my electorate.
As a result of the public debate about Rockdale council and the discussion around these issues there was an inquiry by ICAC, the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales. As a result of that discussion, one of the things that appeared to be the case in the instance of the Rockdale council was that councillors with a pecuniary interest might have excluded themselves from the debate on the floor of the chamber but there was nothing to disallow them from being involved in caucus decisions that determined how their colleagues voted on an issue in which they had a pecuniary interest. They did not involve themselves in the debate or the vote but they were perfectly entitled to be involved in the caucus decision on the position all of their party colleagues in the local council would take on that issue. So one of the recommendations made by ICAC as a result of the referral of the Rockdale council incident was that local councillors should not have the capacity to be involved in caucus discussion on an issue in which they have a pecuniary interest. It actually went further than that to say that they should not be caucusing on local council matters before voting on them. It has been very interesting to watch the effects on Marrickville Council, the local council in the area I live in, and how the way in which the ALP councillors in particular have been voting has changed since that ICAC recommendation came into play.
That is where the public debate is in New South Wales, my home state, in relation to local councils. Why then do I come into the Senate and find that, as Senator Brown said, the debate is several decades behind that public debate in New South Wales? Going back to what I was saying about the context in which this debate is occurring, I know that people in this chamber recognise the cynicism that exists in relation to parliamentarians in this country. In the attitudes and the conversations people in the community have about parliamentarians there are perceptions of bias and financial interest and there are a whole range of different criticisms. Here, in the debate on this motion, we have the Senate trying to slip through the removal from the guidelines of one of the few checks and balances that exists within our system to keep parliamentarians accountable. 
What we need to be doing, and what the public debate in Australia is about at the moment, is tightening requirements for scrutiny of parliamentarians. The debate that has been taking place in this chamber and in the other place in relation to Minister Tony Abbott and the funds that parliamentarians are involved in reflect the general public's perception of parliamentarians. The public debate is about tightening those rules and bringing in greater scrutiny and accountability for parliamentarians, not weakening the process like we are seeing the Senate try to do at half past six on a Thursday afternoon.
This proposal being put forward damages the democratic process. It creates greater cynicism when the public hear that, on a Thursday afternoon when most of the people had left the building, a proposal came up to take away the requirement for parliamentarians to declare their pecuniary interests when we come to these debates. This is what is being proposed. I am aware—and I am sure that many other people here are aware—that, when we talk to people in the general community, the cynicism that they have about parliamentarians and the role that we play come straight back at us. When things like this are occurring in the Senate, how can one defend those accountability measures and guidelines—as limited as they are—that are put in place?
Senator Brown talked about the capacity for there to be changes made to the current systems that we have. The Australian Greens are very strong supporters of making changes to the types of accountability that we have for parliamentarians. These relate to a whole range of issues and these are the same issues on which parliamentarians are accused of having their snouts in the trough over—for example, parliamentarians' pay. Why can't we have parliamentarians' base rate pay increases linked to total average weekly earnings? Why can't we have a superannuation scheme for parliamentarians that is based on the same scheme that other public servants have? We are public servants, why can we not have the same superannuation scheme as public servants across the board? Why do we not have to disclose how things like electoral allowances are used? Why can electoral allowances, if they are not spent, become a part of a parliamentarian's pay? That greatly increases the cynicism in the capacity for parliamentarians to increase electoral allowances without having to increase their pay and therefore not face the same level of public scrutiny as if they are putting through a pay increase. 
Why can't we have public submissions to remuneration tribunals that make decisions about the entitlements that parliamentarians get? Why can't we have these changes to help increase people's recognition of the validity of the democratic process that we are involved in? Why can't we have changes, like banning corporate donations to political parties, so that parliamentarians are not seen as being part of a snouts in the trough process, which is people's perception of what happens in parliament? We have an opposition in this parliament focusing on the Howard government's ministerial code of conduct and focusing on the behaviour of parliamentarians, ministers and ministerial officials in relation to these matters—behaviour such as lying to the Australian public. That is why we must have a public debate around these issues—because of the public questioning the accountability of parliamentarians.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-09-11,"—I rise to indicate support for the resolutions that Senator Denman introduced. I am a member of the Standing Committee of Senators' Interests and, like other members, I discussed the issues involved in the resolutions at length and feel comfortable in supporting the resolutions. Of course, the committee consists of a number of members from government and the opposition and a representative of the Democrats. There is not a representative of the Greens. I am distressed that they have reacted in the way that they have to the provisions, which were put forward consensually to the chamber for decision today on behalf of the whole committee.
The decision that the committee made in recommending that resolution 5 be removed is based, I think, on a question of practicality and how the effect of resolution 5 might be interpreted in the operation of parliamentary debates. I think that resolution 5 can be seen as a belts and braces kind of provision. The resolutions relating to declaration of senators' interests are quite extensive. They go much further than any equivalent organisation that I could readily name. The requirement to declare a whole range of matters to do with a senator's personal interests, pecuniary and otherwise, is a very extensive requirement. I am not aware that similar requirements exist in related or equivalent organisations. Senator Nettle has described to the Senate this afternoon how there are requirements in certain councils that she is aware of for certain things to be declared orally. That may be the case. I would be surprised if any council at the third tier of Australian government had provisions which were more extensive in terms of the written declarations that senators are required to make when they come into this place and on a regular basis thereafter.
The written declarations are added to in resolution 5 by a supplementary requirement to orally declare the senator's interests at the beginning of speeches in debates and in certain circumstances in relation to divisions held at the end of debates. I have to say that I disagree with Senators Brown and Nettle in characterising the removal of the braces when the belt is still very much in place as a major assault on democratic values. The fact is that, under these provisions, a senator must still declare an interest which could be perceived to be an issue in respect of their participation in a particular matter or on a particular vote in this place.
A senator who fails to do that either in their written declaration or orally is clearly guilty of a fairly major error of judgment and would be held to account for that failure. A senator may satisfy that requirement, however, by completing and keeping up to date their written declaration of interests and, if necessary under the proposal put forward by the committee, supplementing that with an oral declaration in the course of a debate where a perceived conflict of interest may arise. But a requirement to do that automatically in every case, which appears to be the effect of resolution 5, would be unnecessary. The removal of resolution 5 requires that senators exercise judgment about when it is appropriate to bring forward a potential conflict of interest in respect of a particular matter or debate. I think that that is an appropriate judgment to exercise.
If a senator were to take part in a debate without having declared that interest in the register and without having brought the matter orally to the attention of the Senate, then that senator would be making a major error of judgment and would have to pay the consequences for that error of judgment. I think it is exceedingly unlikely, given the vigorous nature of public scrutiny in this place, that a senator's decision to sweep under the carpet that conflict of interest would remain undiscovered. The fact that the declaration was not made orally in the course of the debate would be quite immaterial to that circumstance. 
Senator Brown put forward an argument that I am not entirely sure I understand. I think his argument was that senators have a particular problem if they cannot absent themselves on divisions where they may have a conflict of interest, that they are required to vote on every matter that comes before the Senate. I am not sure of the basis for that argument and I cannot see anything in the standing orders that requires a senator to vote on every division. If there were such a standing order, I wonder how many times each week it is breached in this place. Senators miss divisions for a variety of reasons—sometimes because they are paired, sometimes because they do not consider it necessary to come to a division where the numbers are most disproportionate on one side of the chamber and participating would be unnecessary to influence the outcome, and occasionally because they are engaged in other things and miss the division. But I am at a loss to understand why it is that senators would be unable to absent themselves in a circumstance where there might be a conflict of interest.
—Would you do that if you were aware that that single vote made a difference? Senators do not cross the floor and they do not abstain.
—I imagine that, if a senator were to find themselves in a position of conflict and felt unable to take part in the debate, they would go to their party whips and draw it to their attention and make suitable arrangements for that conflict to be obviated. Although I cannot speak for the whips, I would be very surprised if the whips, in those circumstances, were not prepared to take the necessary steps to accommodate that senator's perceived conflict of interest.
—See how you get on.
—I hope to not be in that position at any stage, Senator Brown, but I would certainly be prepared to test the waters on that proposition. The fact remains that what the committee has recommended and what Senator Denman has moved this afternoon does not remove the requirement for senators to properly declare conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest when they arise. That is still required; it is still certainly required to be in writing in the declaration of senators' interests; and it is still, in some circumstances, appropriate to put it orally to the Senate, but not in every circumstance. The requirement to declare a possible conflict of interest in every circumstance could be seen as cumbersome, burdensome and unnecessary. What the committee is doing by virtue of this motion is to squarely focus on the responsibility that lies on the shoulders of every senator to avoid the reality or the perception of a conflict of interest and to put onto their shoulders the need to appropriately declare such an eventuality if it arises.
In those circumstances it is quite appropriate and in no way an attack on democratic values or principles to support this resolution tonight. It may be that this differs from arrangements in other places but I would be very doubtful that there would be many parliaments or equivalent bodies where public interest plays a role that would have such extensive requirements for the declaration of interests as is the case in this Senate. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Senators' Interests Committee</title>,Committees,32,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I am on my feet tonight to support the motion that has been moved by Senator Denman on behalf of the Standing Committee of Senators' Interests. I do so in the context of this matter being raised in the order of business in circumstances that some senators would like to present as controversial. That is their right; they are entitled at any point in the proceedings to argue a case different from the majority of senators. I do not dispute that right; in fact, I think it is one of the great strengths of our system. But I also say this: the majority are entitled to have a view as well. Because we are on broadcast tonight and because everyone has gone home from the other place, I think it is appropriate that these sorts of issues be canvassed and that we understand them for what they are.
There is no doubt in my mind that there can be no division on this tonight, there can be no vote on this tonight. We have a circumstance where, under the standing orders, we cannot have divisions after 6 p.m. We are talking about people putting a view; that is all we are doing. There is not going to be a vote on this matter. I think that those who might be fortunate enough to listen to this tonight should understand the procedures in the Senate as they actually are. If people want to grandstand on this question I think they are entitled to do that but, equally, I say that they have to understand what is being discussed here.
—You are catching up fast.
—The standing orders of the Senate, as they currently stand, do require senators to make a declaration of pecuniary interests before any speech or before any vote at any stage in the proceedings before the chamber. This is in a context where we have quite detailed and extensive registrations of interests which, I might say, are well read, are well understood in this place, are available for scrutiny at all times and in fact are the subject of considerable publicity. So it is not as if an attempt is being made here by the committee to reduce the level of scrutiny, given the practicalities of how this place actually works.
I think we ought to understand precisely what does go on here. It is not as if we come into the Senate as members of the major parties with individual positions, able to vote individually, because we do not do that. The fact remains that, on both sides of this chamber, senators work on the basis of caucus positions. I do not complain about that. I say that is part of our political system. It is a reality and it is the basis on which I came in and joined the Labor Party. I work on the basis that I have an opportunity to put a view in the internal processes of the Labor Party. I win some of them; I lose some of them. But I do not complain about the process by which we make decisions.
I also know that there are occasions—and yes, Senator, I have been the manager in this chamber on other occasions for the opposition—when senators are faced with the situation where they are required to vote for circumstances which they find objectionable. I also know, as Senator Humphries has indicated, that arrangements are made whereby senators absent themselves from votes by pairing—a simple arrangement. That happens and it has happened for many years.
—On pecuniary interests?
—Even on questions of pecuniary interest. Where people suggest that there is a conflict of interest, and despite the fact that they are required to vote in the circumstances, I know there are circumstances where people do not participate in votes and pairing arrangements are made. Notwithstanding that, the substantive issue here is not whether there is conflict of interest. We understand that occurs time and time again when people are faced with a situation. I have raised questions here about the way in which we vote on issues of concern where we have a conflict of interest.  
It does not necessarily affect me because anyone who wants to look at my pecuniary interests will notice that I own bugger all. I do not particularly think that that is something that we should run away from. I think that most of my colleagues on this side of the chamber do not have extensive personal wealth. I know that to be the case. I know that the declarations in that regard reflect that because it is a statement of fact. Members of the Labor Party are not personally wealthy, by and large.
On the other side of the chamber there are examples of people with significant personal wealth. I cannot say in every circumstance that they have voted properly in that regard, but I will say this: the critical issue to me is whether or not persons who have conflicts of interest are able to exercise significant influence in the decision-making processes that lead to a political party adopting a position. That is the critical question that needs to be highlighted. I have never seen a circumstance on our side where that has occurred. 
On the other hand, I have seen Senator Hogg and many other senators say ad nauseam that they are former trade union officials—in fact, that some of them are current trade union officials. They declare their position on a regular basis. That is also declared in their pecuniary interests. Frankly, I do not believe that Senator Hogg should have to stand here on every single vote and indicate that he is a current official of one of our major industrial organisations in this country. It is well known. He is not ashamed of it. He is in fact very proud of it and he performs a very important function in that organisation. What is being proposed to us is that, under these standing orders, every time Senator Hogg gets up to speak or vote he should declare his position because most of the things we vote on in here affect the welfare of working people and directly affect the welfare of shop assistants. Under this proposal that the committee has brought forward the suggestion should be made—and the Labor Party will be supporting the suggestion—that that is not required. 
—Senator Button brought it in!
—I come back to this simple proposition: these declarations of pecuniary interests are well read. They are the subject of extensive public debate—so they should be. There are ways in which they could be tightened—I acknowledge that. The issue of trusts, for instance, is one where I think people are able to disguise their wealth; they are able to disguise their influence in the economic sphere of this country. That does not mean, however, that the proposition brought before us by the Standing Committee on Senators' Interests is invalid. That proposition goes to some practical considerations that go to the effective working of this chamber. At no point does this seek to minimise public scrutiny or public morality or ethics or the way in which we behave. 
I would suggest that to come here at this time of the night, with the broadcast running, and to try to present us in the Labor Party—because it has been said on numerous occasions—and other parties in this chamber as acting improperly is wrong. It is not based on the facts as they are before us. Given there is no division tonight, I expect at any point now someone is going to be able to move that this matter be adjourned so that we can have a proper debate about it and a vote. That is going to be the way to finally resolve this matter. Grandstanding here at quarter to seven on a Thursday night is not the way to do it. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Senators' Interests Committee</title>,Committees,32,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I was not going to buy into this. But I think there are a couple of things that need to be said about it. There was an incorrect impression given in the address by Senator Nettle that this was brought on late on a Thursday afternoon for some obscure reason. Let us say, firstly, that it was brought on where it was because that is the order of business. That was not in anyone else's control other than the standing orders of this parliament.
—Senator Brown, you had your go, so give someone else a go. The second thing is that there is no opportunity for a division to take place in this chamber post 6 p.m. on a Thursday. The matter was introduced in accordance with the order of business of this place—and there is an order of business—as it properly should have been. Senator Denman has properly delivered her report. Given the amendment proposed by Senator Brown—which I acknowledge, Senator Brown, you are quite entitled to move; I am not trying to deny you that—the proper course of action is for this matter to be adjourned at the end of this debate for determination when divisions can take place.
Having said that, I want to support the comments in this debate of Senator Humphries and Senator Carr and I want to make a few myself. Senator Carr was quite right in saying that one of the most read documents in this place is the Register of Senators' Interests. It is not something that is hidden from view. When I became aware that this debate in the chamber was picking up some legs, I went into my room and pulled out my copy of the Register of Senators' Interests. It would not be beyond me to read everyone's interests into the Hansard this evening, but of course I have no intention of doing that. That is the good point! So that the public out there—and there are members of the public out there listening—understand what we are talking about, I will take the chamber briefly through what is contained in the declaration that a senator makes. Every senator signs this in good faith. Where a senator alters something that should be noted in the register of interests, it has to be notified within 28 days. Every time a senator is freshly elected to this place, a senator goes through the process of filling out a new declaration. There is a committee of this parliament that oversights the operation. I will read from my declaration so that no other person can worry about any of their details—if they want to declare them, they can. It reads:
1. SHAREHOLDINGS IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES (INCLUDING HOLD-ING COMPANIES) INDICATING THE NAME OF THE COMPANY OR THE COMPANIES.
In my case it says, `Self' and my declaration says, `NIL'. Then it reads:
2. FAMILY AND BUSINESS TRUSTS AND NOMINEE COMPANIES—
(i) in which a beneficial interest is held, indicating the name of the trust and the nature of its operation and beneficial interest;
There are four columns, but only three are of any import. One says:
Name of trust/nominee company.
The next says:
Nature of its operation.
The last says:
Beneficial interest.
In my case it reads, `Self' and there is no entry—it reads `N/A' because it is not applicable. Then the second part is:
(ii) in which the Senator, the Senator's spouse or partner, or a child who is wholly or mainly dependent on the Senator for support, is a trustee (but not including a trustee of an estate where no beneficial interest is held by the Senator, the Senator's spouse or partner or dependent children), indicating the name of the trust, the nature of its operation and the beneficiary of the trust. 
There are the same headings as in the previous part. Again it reads: `Self' and `N/A'. Next is:
3. REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING THE LOCATION (SUBURB OR AREA ONLY) AND THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS OWNED.
In my case it reads, `Self' and `CARINDALE', which is the suburb in Queensland I live in, and after it I have `(CO-OWNER)' which means I co-own it with my wife—and, more likely, with the bank—and under `Purpose for which owned' I have put: `FAMILY HOME.' So we are going through some real riveting stuff!
4. REGISTERED DIRECTORSHIPS OF COMPANIES.
The headings are `Name of company' and `Activities of company'. Underneath it reads: `Self' and `N/A'. I am pretty dull and boring!
5. PARTNERSHIPS, INDICATING THE NATURE OF THE INTERESTS AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP.
The headings are `Name', `Nature of interest' and `Activities of partnership'. Underneath it reads, `Self' and `N/A'.
6. LIABILITIES, INDICATING THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY AND THE CREDITOR CONCERNED.
In my case it says, `Mortgage' and `Westpac'. Everyone now knows I bank with Westpac, which would be no secret if you had seen me go to the Westpac teller.
7. THE NATURE OF ANY BONDS, DEBENTURES AND LIKE INVESTMENTS.
Then there are two columns: `Type of investment' and `Body in which investment in held'. Underneath it reads, `Self' and `N/A'.
8. SAVING OR INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS, INDICATING THEIR NATURE AND THE NAME OF THE BANK OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS CONCERNED.
The columns below are headed `Nature of account' and `Name of bank/institution'. I have a savings account—and I have declared that—with the Queensland Teachers Credit Union. That is not something you would not suspect, given that at some stage in my life I was a teacher. And I have declared a savings account—surprise, surprise!—with Westpac. Then we go to:
9. THE NATURE OF ANY OTHER ASSETS (EXCLUDING HOUSEHOLD AND PER-SONAL EFFECTS) EACH VALUED AT MORE THAN $5,000.
Then, where I have to list the nature of any other investment, I have written: `PERPETUAL INVESTMENTS (PRE-SERVED SUPERANNUATION)'. Then there is:
10. THE NATURE OF ANY OTHER SUBSTANTIAL SOURCES OF INCOME.
The heading under that is `Nature of income' and underneath it reads, `Self' and `N/A'. People might be becoming a little bit bored with my personal history, but it goes to show that people in this chamber make a fairly rigorous declaration. I could go on. There are only four headings left, but I do not think I am going to have the time to do that. Maybe at another time and another place I could. What I am saying to the Australian public is that the people in this place are transparent and accountable in the way in which they handle both themselves and their business. As Senator Carr alluded to—and I agree with him on some occasions—the nature of trusts and how those trusts operate leave a lot to be desired. But the information is clearly available and clearly declared and it is, as Senator Carr said, one of the most well-read documents that one could hope to find. There are a couple of other things on this declaration I should go through. One is:
12. ANY SPONSORED TRAVEL OR HOSPITALITY RECEIVED WHERE THE VALUE OF THE SPONSORSHIP OR HOSPITALITY EXCEEDS $200. 
This is not hospitality or sponsored travel but, because I am an elected delegate of the national council of my union—which is a properly held position, elected through the Australian Electoral Commission—I am entitled to attend the national conference of that union on an annual basis. And what do we find? I have declared that I am a delegate to the National Council of the SDA—that is the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association—wherever held.
—A fine union.
—A fine union, as Senator Ludwig interjects. Then I go to item 13, which says:
13. BEING AN OFFICE HOLDER OR A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR DONATING $200 OR MORE IN ANY SINGLE CALENDAR YEAR TO ANY ORGANISATION
I have named the organisations. They are the All Hallows Foundation Ltd, which is the school where my two young daughters went, and St Joseph's College Gregory Terrace Foundation, which is the school where my son went. I am a member of the Catholic Church—I donate to it—so I have declared that. I have declared St Vincent de Paul, because I believe in looking after the poor. I am the President of the SDA Queensland Branch and I have declared that. What conflict I have there I do not know. I have also declared the fact that my sister-in-law is on the board of a number of companies, but I do not see how that would interfere with what I do here. I think what has been trotted out here tonight has been nonsense indeed. (Time expired)
 (Senator Chapman)—I should point out that there has been some comment that this matter cannot be determined tonight, but in fact it can be, provided there is no call for a division; it can be determined on the voices.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Senators' Interests Committee</title>,Committees,32,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-09-11,"—I think it appropriate to make some comments on this matter. It is a matter that goes to issues of accountability and transparency in the Senate. It is fair to say that, more than any other party, the Democrats have a record of trying to improve transparency in parliamentary, electoral, political and corporate processes.
There are a few things that need to be highlighted in relation to this debate. For those people who have been following it to this stage, it is important that we put this in context. I should say at the outset that I support Senator Brown's amendment to prevent the removal of section 5. I have to say, however, that I think he and Senator Nettle have rather overstated their case in a lot of aspects. I understand why it happens—and the Democrats no doubt have done it as well. Whilst we talk a lot about the need for removing cynicism from people's perceptions of politicians, I think if we occasionally exaggerate the impression that there is evil under every rock then we help to reinforce that cynicism unnecessarily. Some of the inferences that could be drawn from the contribution of the Greens this evening overstate the suggestion that there is evil under every rock—or perhaps under every senator's seat.
The Democrats were part of ensuring that the components in these standing orders to do with the declaration of senators' interests came into force. The context in which this motion has come before us does need to be emphasised. Indeed, the suggestion that somehow this has been slipped in without notice on Thursday night is a bit unfortunate because, as Senator Denman said, the motion has been around for more than a year. The motion came into this chamber before Senator Nettle came into this chamber. The report that the committee brought down at that time gave its rationale for why it wished to do what it wanted to do. People are free to disagree with that, and I am suggesting that I disagree with it as well.  
After things such as the Register of Senators' Interests have been in place for a time, it is appropriate to review how they are going—whether they can be improved, whether there are parts that are unnecessary and whether there are parts that are not working. I would say that a part that is not working is the part that we are talking about tonight. The key issue is whether we say, `It's not working; let's get rid of it—it's unnecessary,' which is what the committee suggested, or whether we say, `It's not working—let's see whether we can make it work in a way that meets its intention.' I certainly think that would be the better path to go down. As Senator Brown said, there have been 3,000 pieces of legislation since 1984—when this came in—and only 120 declarations of interest. I think that is what he said; it is what I have jotted down, so I hope I am repeating him correctly.
I think what that says is that it has not worked. Depending on how you define a pecuniary interest or a non-pecuniary interest, with some of the things that Senator Nettle was suggesting about non-pecuniary interests such as issues affecting friends or relatives or organisations you are involved in, you would be faced with a situation where people would be required to verbally declare an interest in at least every second piece of legislation. If everybody were required to do that for every division on legislation, all 76 of us would be standing up. It could involve tax legislation, superannuation legislation, in some cases family law legislation, social security legislation and legislation to do with clubs, schools and unions. It is not just about businesses and corporations; it is about other parts of society that are continually affected by legislation that is passed through this place.
In his contribution, Senator Humphries said that the committee felt that it is just not a practical approach and, given the transparency and comprehensiveness of the Register of Senators' Interests, that it is not necessary. I am not convinced that that is the case. I do see the rationale that if we had 76 people all standing up and verbally declaring an interest before every second division—which is technically what could be required, depending on how tightly you wish to define an interest—it would not be practical or workable and it would be counterproductive. But I do think it is possible to look at ways to refine the measure rather than just chuck it out. We need to look at how we define an interest—what is an interest and how broadly do people expect us to acknowledge interests?
From Senator Hogg's contribution, it does not sound as though he is interested in very much at all. But, even from the ones he did declare at the end, while he might not have many interests in the financial world he has interests in church organisations, in charities and in schools. They are affected by a lot of legislation, including some we have debated today.
The question I asked today about the migration sponsorship legislation, which potentially can affect MPs who wish to sponsor temporary visitors to this country, is an issue that can affect and is of interest not just to individual MPs but also to us in terms of family and other people who we may know. The concern that I have with the amendment the Greens have put forward is its extremely purist approach. If we are going to be purist and we keep the standing order in place then we would have all 76 senators declaring interest on virtually every piece of legislation. That is not practical and I do not think that it is terribly helpful. 
It does need to be said that the Register of Senators' Interests is comprehensive and it is publicly available, so I do object to the very strong inference that somehow there is a lot of skulduggery and everybody is trying to hide something. That is not the case. It is quite open and public—
—You read it often—I bet.
—There are too many people with no interests and I do not find the Register of Senators' Interests very interesting. At the same time, leaving aside all the politics and the other aspects, the principle of specifically acknowledging an interest in an area when it is before the chamber in debate is an important one. It is one I would not like to give up on just yet. A lot of us do it informally in any case when an issue is before the chamber. I think we all have an interest in electoral law but I do not recall all of us standing up and declaring that interest every time we have a division or amendments to the Electoral Act, for example.
There is a case for seeing if the principle can be made to operate effectively. I say that because I do not think it has operated effectively, and Senator Brown's own statistics show that it has not operated effectively if there were only that many declarations of interest over that period of time with such a large number of pieces of legislation. Those senators who want to get rid of the standing order are saying that it is not operating effectively and therefore it is pointless. I would say that the principle is still important, so let us see whether we can try to make it operate effectively. That is the approach that I would like to see the Senate take.
 (Senator Chapman)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Brown be agreed to. On the voices a division is required. I remind honourable senators that if a division is called for on a Thursday after 6 p.m. the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned, pursuant to standing order 57(3), until the next day of sitting at a time to be fixed by the Senate. Accordingly, the matter is adjourned.

	(ii)	arrange its donation to a nominated non-profit organisation or charity, at the discretion of the senator who has returned the gift and the Committee of Senators' Interests.
	(k)	Any senator subject to paragraph (j) must formally acknowledge relinquishment of the senator's claim to ownership of any surrendered gifts.
The motion before the Senate arose from recommendations made in report 2/2002 of the Committee of Senators' Interests tabled on 20 June 2002. Notice of this motion has been on the Notice Paper for over 12 months while informal consultations amongst senators took place. The committee subsequently agreed to amend the notice of motion in respect of the value of gifts and assets required to be declared, and it is in the amended form that it appears on today's Notice Paper. The thresholds of the amended motion are lower than originally proposed and in most cases represent a 50 per cent increase from 1994 values rather than a 100 per cent or greater increase. 
I remind honourable senators that the motion also provides (1) for all senators to make a full declaration of interests at least once in each parliament and (2) for the requirements for each senator to declare relevant interests when first speaking or voting on a notice before the Senate to be removed. The committee recommended that the requirements to declare interests orally be omitted on the basis that each senator's statement of registerable interests is already published. As the report notes, it is up to the individual senators if they decide it is necessary to alert the Senate to any particular conflict of interest relating to the private section of the statement concerning their spouses, partners or dependent children, or for senators who have not yet lodged statements of registerable interests to declare their interests publicly if appropriate. I commend the motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Proposed Variation</title>,Committees,32,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-11,"—I thank Senator Denman for informing us about the motion, and I move an amendment to the motion:
Omit:
Resolution 5—Declaration of interest in debate and other proceedings
	To be omitted.
This is a very important matter. It goes to the heart of transparency in our dealings with all the public matters that come before this Senate. Since 1985, some 3,000 bills have come through the Senate, but there have been only about 120 declarations of interest on the floor of the Senate during that period. I know that that has irked some senators and that there is a certain sense of fragility about the requirement that we declare interest. But in practice it is a rare occasion when there is an interest which is sufficient to require a senator to declare it.
The need for that declaration is very great. There is a register of senatorial interests, but it is out of view and very often out of mind. There are two good reasons why the oral declaration in the Senate during a debate on a matter in which a senator has an interest should be made. The first reason is that it brings into the mind of that senator the fact that they have a pecuniary interest or that a spouse or partner has a pecuniary interest. It also brings it freshly to the mind of the rest of the Senate. That is very important. The other reason is that we are elected members from the Australian community and we cannot absent ourselves from a debate or a vote in this parliament. That is manifestly different from the situation which pertains in local government, where, if a councillor has a pecuniary interest, they are expected to absent themselves from the debate and from the vote. It is manifestly different from the situation in corporate Australia, where, under law, those on the board of a corporation are required to remove themselves from the board if they have a direct pecuniary interest—there are some exceptional circumstances—and not take part in the debate or the vote.
If senators look at our own standing orders—and many may not know this—they will see that in committees of this Senate it is expected that senators will not take part in a committee inquiry if they have a pecuniary interest. It is expected that they will absent themselves from it. That is not the case when the matter comes before the Senate itself. We cannot absent ourselves or fail to vote, because our voters have put us here to do that. Therefore, it is critical that the oral declaration of interest be made during the debate on the floor of the Senate.
The rule came into the Senate in 1994, having first been brought before it by former Senators Gareth Evans and Button in 1987. It came in after a lot of consideration, for the reasons I have just outlined. The whole of the pecuniary interest legislation, including the register, was, you will remember, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, vociferously opposed by the then members of the opposition. Senator Button referred to `the lassitude, indifference, obfuscation and neglect of opposition senators who on numerous occasions previously have sought to oppose this motion'.
On the occasion of the introduction of the rule in 1994, Democrat Senators Macklin and Coulter pointed to their concern that the oral declaration would be onerous for members of the Senate. I would have thought that the committee recommendation, and therefore the motion before the Senate tonight, could have dealt with that difficulty, if indeed it is there. It seems sensible to me that a single declaration of an interest in the course of debate on a bill would suffice. But to remove it altogether is unforgivable. Are we to go back two decades by effecting an advantage, through the debate and the vote we make, by removing the requirement that we as parliamentarians, when debating a matter in which we have a pecuniary interest—in which we have shares, real estate interests or financial interests of some sort, right across the board—declare that interest? It is wrong that we should not have to declare that interest during that debate. 
There has been no adequate explanation for the removal of section (5) of the part of the standing orders dealing with the registration and declaration of senators' interests, which requires that senators make an oral declaration. That is because there is no good reason for it. That is because there is no excuse. I know that there are senators here who have been embarrassed, annoyed and frustrated—and I have drawn attention to it—by the requirement on occasions to declare interests that they may have. I am talking about declaring interests in woodchip companies if we are dealing with logging legislation like the regional forest agreement, in mining corporations or coal companies if we are dealing with bills which give enormous corporate welfare and billions of dollars of it. That is the exact reason why we should have to declare it—and declare it here on the floor of the Senate so that, in a situation where the senator cannot be asked to leave the debate or not vote, it is clear to everybody that that senator has that interest.
It is most important that the senators themselves reflect upon their duty not to allow that interest to intrude or influence their participation in the debate or the vote that comes at the end of it. How can you do that in a debate if no declaration is made? I repeat that the register is there, but it is not readily available and is certainly not called to mind in this place when a debate takes place. The register has a very important function, but it does not replace the importance of making oral declarations when we come into this place.
I am astounded that the Senate is moving towards omitting section (5). I am astounded that, in a situation where no senator can forgo participation in a debate or a vote on a matter in which they have a pecuniary interest, we are saying through this amendment, `But we won't declare it. We won't have to declare it in debate in the Senate.' We will go back 20 years to the bad old days when it was considered that a senator's own wealth or commercial interest was not a matter for anybody but themselves.
We live in an age when there is enormous influence on senators—on all parliamentarians—by vested interests. That influence is heightened when one has a direct personal gain to make from voting for a piece of legislation which advances that interest. What logic can there be in not having a requirement that a senator declare such an interest in the debate? It is absolutely basic to transparency and good governance. The alternative is that we legislate so that no senator may have a pecuniary interest—certainly not in the corporate sector, which is benefited so often by the laws that we bring in through this place. You cannot do that, so you require the declaration. It could be improved but it cannot be abolished. That would go against the interests of good democracy and of transparency by all of us representing the Australian people in this place.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Proposed Variation</title>,Committees,32,2,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-09-11,"—I have been speaking today with some of my colleagues who are members of local councils in New South Wales. If you are a local councillor in New South Wales you need to declare a pecuniary interest. You do not just declare a pecuniary interest by putting it down on a register of local councillors' interests; where you have a direct pecuniary interest, you need to declare it within the debate and state the nature of the interest. In a local council it may relate to your property being near the property the development application you are discussing is located, or it may relate to a cousin or a brother and their relationship with the development application that is being discussed. 
You declare the interest in the local council meeting, you state the nature of the interest you have in the issue and then you do not participate in the debate. In fact, in New South Wales you go outside the chamber where the issue is being debated. It is not just a declaration you make by writing on a form that goes into the ether of bureaucracy, where nobody understands how to find it or remembers it when the debate is on. My colleagues who are councillors in New South Wales have made it clear to me that it is much more extensive than that. You declare the interest, you state its nature, you do not participate in the debate and you leave the chamber where the debate is occurring.
I do not know why the Senate seems to believe that it is above this process of having to declare pecuniary interests and having to make it clear what the issues being discussed are. I think it is really important that we put this in the context of the views of the general Australian population on parliamentarians and their pecuniary interests. What are the attitudes? What is the cynicism that exists throughout Australian society in relation to parliamentarians in chambers like this? It is extremely important that we put this debate within that context, and I will get to that later. 
Going back to my home state of New South Wales, some local councils have a code of conduct—not a law but a code of conduct—whereby councillors have to declare any non-pecuniary interest as well. For example, if an issue being debated relates to a close friend of theirs or to a close colleague within the same political party, or if for some other reason there is a non-financial interest, they also need to declare that within the debate. This has been an extremely important issue of public debate in my home state, particularly in relation to local councils. Senators will remember the media attention—it has been all over the front pages of the Sydney Morning Herald—given to Rockdale City Council in my electorate.
As a result of the public debate about Rockdale council and the discussion around these issues there was an inquiry by ICAC, the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales. As a result of that discussion, one of the things that appeared to be the case in the instance of the Rockdale council was that councillors with a pecuniary interest might have excluded themselves from the debate on the floor of the chamber but there was nothing to disallow them from being involved in caucus decisions that determined how their colleagues voted on an issue in which they had a pecuniary interest. They did not involve themselves in the debate or the vote but they were perfectly entitled to be involved in the caucus decision on the position all of their party colleagues in the local council would take on that issue. So one of the recommendations made by ICAC as a result of the referral of the Rockdale council incident was that local councillors should not have the capacity to be involved in caucus discussion on an issue in which they have a pecuniary interest. It actually went further than that to say that they should not be caucusing on local council matters before voting on them. It has been very interesting to watch the effects on Marrickville Council, the local council in the area I live in, and how the way in which the ALP councillors in particular have been voting has changed since that ICAC recommendation came into play.
That is where the public debate is in New South Wales, my home state, in relation to local councils. Why then do I come into the Senate and find that, as Senator Brown said, the debate is several decades behind that public debate in New South Wales? Going back to what I was saying about the context in which this debate is occurring, I know that people in this chamber recognise the cynicism that exists in relation to parliamentarians in this country. In the attitudes and the conversations people in the community have about parliamentarians there are perceptions of bias and financial interest and there are a whole range of different criticisms. Here, in the debate on this motion, we have the Senate trying to slip through the removal from the guidelines of one of the few checks and balances that exists within our system to keep parliamentarians accountable. 
What we need to be doing, and what the public debate in Australia is about at the moment, is tightening requirements for scrutiny of parliamentarians. The debate that has been taking place in this chamber and in the other place in relation to Minister Tony Abbott and the funds that parliamentarians are involved in reflect the general public's perception of parliamentarians. The public debate is about tightening those rules and bringing in greater scrutiny and accountability for parliamentarians, not weakening the process like we are seeing the Senate try to do at half past six on a Thursday afternoon.
This proposal being put forward damages the democratic process. It creates greater cynicism when the public hear that, on a Thursday afternoon when most of the people had left the building, a proposal came up to take away the requirement for parliamentarians to declare their pecuniary interests when we come to these debates. This is what is being proposed. I am aware—and I am sure that many other people here are aware—that, when we talk to people in the general community, the cynicism that they have about parliamentarians and the role that we play come straight back at us. When things like this are occurring in the Senate, how can one defend those accountability measures and guidelines—as limited as they are—that are put in place?
Senator Brown talked about the capacity for there to be changes made to the current systems that we have. The Australian Greens are very strong supporters of making changes to the types of accountability that we have for parliamentarians. These relate to a whole range of issues and these are the same issues on which parliamentarians are accused of having their snouts in the trough over—for example, parliamentarians' pay. Why can't we have parliamentarians' base rate pay increases linked to total average weekly earnings? Why can't we have a superannuation scheme for parliamentarians that is based on the same scheme that other public servants have? We are public servants, why can we not have the same superannuation scheme as public servants across the board? Why do we not have to disclose how things like electoral allowances are used? Why can electoral allowances, if they are not spent, become a part of a parliamentarian's pay? That greatly increases the cynicism in the capacity for parliamentarians to increase electoral allowances without having to increase their pay and therefore not face the same level of public scrutiny as if they are putting through a pay increase. 
Why can't we have public submissions to remuneration tribunals that make decisions about the entitlements that parliamentarians get? Why can't we have these changes to help increase people's recognition of the validity of the democratic process that we are involved in? Why can't we have changes, like banning corporate donations to political parties, so that parliamentarians are not seen as being part of a snouts in the trough process, which is people's perception of what happens in parliament? We have an opposition in this parliament focusing on the Howard government's ministerial code of conduct and focusing on the behaviour of parliamentarians, ministers and ministerial officials in relation to these matters—behaviour such as lying to the Australian public. That is why we must have a public debate around these issues—because of the public questioning the accountability of parliamentarians.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-09-11,"—I rise to indicate support for the resolutions that Senator Denman introduced. I am a member of the Standing Committee of Senators' Interests and, like other members, I discussed the issues involved in the resolutions at length and feel comfortable in supporting the resolutions. Of course, the committee consists of a number of members from government and the opposition and a representative of the Democrats. There is not a representative of the Greens. I am distressed that they have reacted in the way that they have to the provisions, which were put forward consensually to the chamber for decision today on behalf of the whole committee.
The decision that the committee made in recommending that resolution 5 be removed is based, I think, on a question of practicality and how the effect of resolution 5 might be interpreted in the operation of parliamentary debates. I think that resolution 5 can be seen as a belts and braces kind of provision. The resolutions relating to declaration of senators' interests are quite extensive. They go much further than any equivalent organisation that I could readily name. The requirement to declare a whole range of matters to do with a senator's personal interests, pecuniary and otherwise, is a very extensive requirement. I am not aware that similar requirements exist in related or equivalent organisations. Senator Nettle has described to the Senate this afternoon how there are requirements in certain councils that she is aware of for certain things to be declared orally. That may be the case. I would be surprised if any council at the third tier of Australian government had provisions which were more extensive in terms of the written declarations that senators are required to make when they come into this place and on a regular basis thereafter.
The written declarations are added to in resolution 5 by a supplementary requirement to orally declare the senator's interests at the beginning of speeches in debates and in certain circumstances in relation to divisions held at the end of debates. I have to say that I disagree with Senators Brown and Nettle in characterising the removal of the braces when the belt is still very much in place as a major assault on democratic values. The fact is that, under these provisions, a senator must still declare an interest which could be perceived to be an issue in respect of their participation in a particular matter or on a particular vote in this place.
A senator who fails to do that either in their written declaration or orally is clearly guilty of a fairly major error of judgment and would be held to account for that failure. A senator may satisfy that requirement, however, by completing and keeping up to date their written declaration of interests and, if necessary under the proposal put forward by the committee, supplementing that with an oral declaration in the course of a debate where a perceived conflict of interest may arise. But a requirement to do that automatically in every case, which appears to be the effect of resolution 5, would be unnecessary. The removal of resolution 5 requires that senators exercise judgment about when it is appropriate to bring forward a potential conflict of interest in respect of a particular matter or debate. I think that that is an appropriate judgment to exercise.
If a senator were to take part in a debate without having declared that interest in the register and without having brought the matter orally to the attention of the Senate, then that senator would be making a major error of judgment and would have to pay the consequences for that error of judgment. I think it is exceedingly unlikely, given the vigorous nature of public scrutiny in this place, that a senator's decision to sweep under the carpet that conflict of interest would remain undiscovered. The fact that the declaration was not made orally in the course of the debate would be quite immaterial to that circumstance. 
Senator Brown put forward an argument that I am not entirely sure I understand. I think his argument was that senators have a particular problem if they cannot absent themselves on divisions where they may have a conflict of interest, that they are required to vote on every matter that comes before the Senate. I am not sure of the basis for that argument and I cannot see anything in the standing orders that requires a senator to vote on every division. If there were such a standing order, I wonder how many times each week it is breached in this place. Senators miss divisions for a variety of reasons—sometimes because they are paired, sometimes because they do not consider it necessary to come to a division where the numbers are most disproportionate on one side of the chamber and participating would be unnecessary to influence the outcome, and occasionally because they are engaged in other things and miss the division. But I am at a loss to understand why it is that senators would be unable to absent themselves in a circumstance where there might be a conflict of interest.
—Would you do that if you were aware that that single vote made a difference? Senators do not cross the floor and they do not abstain.
—I imagine that, if a senator were to find themselves in a position of conflict and felt unable to take part in the debate, they would go to their party whips and draw it to their attention and make suitable arrangements for that conflict to be obviated. Although I cannot speak for the whips, I would be very surprised if the whips, in those circumstances, were not prepared to take the necessary steps to accommodate that senator's perceived conflict of interest.
—See how you get on.
—I hope to not be in that position at any stage, Senator Brown, but I would certainly be prepared to test the waters on that proposition. The fact remains that what the committee has recommended and what Senator Denman has moved this afternoon does not remove the requirement for senators to properly declare conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest when they arise. That is still required; it is still certainly required to be in writing in the declaration of senators' interests; and it is still, in some circumstances, appropriate to put it orally to the Senate, but not in every circumstance. The requirement to declare a possible conflict of interest in every circumstance could be seen as cumbersome, burdensome and unnecessary. What the committee is doing by virtue of this motion is to squarely focus on the responsibility that lies on the shoulders of every senator to avoid the reality or the perception of a conflict of interest and to put onto their shoulders the need to appropriately declare such an eventuality if it arises.
In those circumstances it is quite appropriate and in no way an attack on democratic values or principles to support this resolution tonight. It may be that this differs from arrangements in other places but I would be very doubtful that there would be many parliaments or equivalent bodies where public interest plays a role that would have such extensive requirements for the declaration of interests as is the case in this Senate. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Proposed Variation</title>,Committees,32,2,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I am on my feet tonight to support the motion that has been moved by Senator Denman on behalf of the Standing Committee of Senators' Interests. I do so in the context of this matter being raised in the order of business in circumstances that some senators would like to present as controversial. That is their right; they are entitled at any point in the proceedings to argue a case different from the majority of senators. I do not dispute that right; in fact, I think it is one of the great strengths of our system. But I also say this: the majority are entitled to have a view as well. Because we are on broadcast tonight and because everyone has gone home from the other place, I think it is appropriate that these sorts of issues be canvassed and that we understand them for what they are.
There is no doubt in my mind that there can be no division on this tonight, there can be no vote on this tonight. We have a circumstance where, under the standing orders, we cannot have divisions after 6 p.m. We are talking about people putting a view; that is all we are doing. There is not going to be a vote on this matter. I think that those who might be fortunate enough to listen to this tonight should understand the procedures in the Senate as they actually are. If people want to grandstand on this question I think they are entitled to do that but, equally, I say that they have to understand what is being discussed here.
—You are catching up fast.
—The standing orders of the Senate, as they currently stand, do require senators to make a declaration of pecuniary interests before any speech or before any vote at any stage in the proceedings before the chamber. This is in a context where we have quite detailed and extensive registrations of interests which, I might say, are well read, are well understood in this place, are available for scrutiny at all times and in fact are the subject of considerable publicity. So it is not as if an attempt is being made here by the committee to reduce the level of scrutiny, given the practicalities of how this place actually works.
I think we ought to understand precisely what does go on here. It is not as if we come into the Senate as members of the major parties with individual positions, able to vote individually, because we do not do that. The fact remains that, on both sides of this chamber, senators work on the basis of caucus positions. I do not complain about that. I say that is part of our political system. It is a reality and it is the basis on which I came in and joined the Labor Party. I work on the basis that I have an opportunity to put a view in the internal processes of the Labor Party. I win some of them; I lose some of them. But I do not complain about the process by which we make decisions.
I also know that there are occasions—and yes, Senator, I have been the manager in this chamber on other occasions for the opposition—when senators are faced with the situation where they are required to vote for circumstances which they find objectionable. I also know, as Senator Humphries has indicated, that arrangements are made whereby senators absent themselves from votes by pairing—a simple arrangement. That happens and it has happened for many years.
—On pecuniary interests?
—Even on questions of pecuniary interest. Where people suggest that there is a conflict of interest, and despite the fact that they are required to vote in the circumstances, I know there are circumstances where people do not participate in votes and pairing arrangements are made. Notwithstanding that, the substantive issue here is not whether there is conflict of interest. We understand that occurs time and time again when people are faced with a situation. I have raised questions here about the way in which we vote on issues of concern where we have a conflict of interest.  
It does not necessarily affect me because anyone who wants to look at my pecuniary interests will notice that I own bugger all. I do not particularly think that that is something that we should run away from. I think that most of my colleagues on this side of the chamber do not have extensive personal wealth. I know that to be the case. I know that the declarations in that regard reflect that because it is a statement of fact. Members of the Labor Party are not personally wealthy, by and large.
On the other side of the chamber there are examples of people with significant personal wealth. I cannot say in every circumstance that they have voted properly in that regard, but I will say this: the critical issue to me is whether or not persons who have conflicts of interest are able to exercise significant influence in the decision-making processes that lead to a political party adopting a position. That is the critical question that needs to be highlighted. I have never seen a circumstance on our side where that has occurred. 
On the other hand, I have seen Senator Hogg and many other senators say ad nauseam that they are former trade union officials—in fact, that some of them are current trade union officials. They declare their position on a regular basis. That is also declared in their pecuniary interests. Frankly, I do not believe that Senator Hogg should have to stand here on every single vote and indicate that he is a current official of one of our major industrial organisations in this country. It is well known. He is not ashamed of it. He is in fact very proud of it and he performs a very important function in that organisation. What is being proposed to us is that, under these standing orders, every time Senator Hogg gets up to speak or vote he should declare his position because most of the things we vote on in here affect the welfare of working people and directly affect the welfare of shop assistants. Under this proposal that the committee has brought forward the suggestion should be made—and the Labor Party will be supporting the suggestion—that that is not required. 
—Senator Button brought it in!
—I come back to this simple proposition: these declarations of pecuniary interests are well read. They are the subject of extensive public debate—so they should be. There are ways in which they could be tightened—I acknowledge that. The issue of trusts, for instance, is one where I think people are able to disguise their wealth; they are able to disguise their influence in the economic sphere of this country. That does not mean, however, that the proposition brought before us by the Standing Committee on Senators' Interests is invalid. That proposition goes to some practical considerations that go to the effective working of this chamber. At no point does this seek to minimise public scrutiny or public morality or ethics or the way in which we behave. 
I would suggest that to come here at this time of the night, with the broadcast running, and to try to present us in the Labor Party—because it has been said on numerous occasions—and other parties in this chamber as acting improperly is wrong. It is not based on the facts as they are before us. Given there is no division tonight, I expect at any point now someone is going to be able to move that this matter be adjourned so that we can have a proper debate about it and a vote. That is going to be the way to finally resolve this matter. Grandstanding here at quarter to seven on a Thursday night is not the way to do it. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Proposed Variation</title>,Committees,32,2,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-11,"—I was not going to buy into this. But I think there are a couple of things that need to be said about it. There was an incorrect impression given in the address by Senator Nettle that this was brought on late on a Thursday afternoon for some obscure reason. Let us say, firstly, that it was brought on where it was because that is the order of business. That was not in anyone else's control other than the standing orders of this parliament.
—Senator Brown, you had your go, so give someone else a go. The second thing is that there is no opportunity for a division to take place in this chamber post 6 p.m. on a Thursday. The matter was introduced in accordance with the order of business of this place—and there is an order of business—as it properly should have been. Senator Denman has properly delivered her report. Given the amendment proposed by Senator Brown—which I acknowledge, Senator Brown, you are quite entitled to move; I am not trying to deny you that—the proper course of action is for this matter to be adjourned at the end of this debate for determination when divisions can take place.
Having said that, I want to support the comments in this debate of Senator Humphries and Senator Carr and I want to make a few myself. Senator Carr was quite right in saying that one of the most read documents in this place is the Register of Senators' Interests. It is not something that is hidden from view. When I became aware that this debate in the chamber was picking up some legs, I went into my room and pulled out my copy of the Register of Senators' Interests. It would not be beyond me to read everyone's interests into the Hansard this evening, but of course I have no intention of doing that. That is the good point! So that the public out there—and there are members of the public out there listening—understand what we are talking about, I will take the chamber briefly through what is contained in the declaration that a senator makes. Every senator signs this in good faith. Where a senator alters something that should be noted in the register of interests, it has to be notified within 28 days. Every time a senator is freshly elected to this place, a senator goes through the process of filling out a new declaration. There is a committee of this parliament that oversights the operation. I will read from my declaration so that no other person can worry about any of their details—if they want to declare them, they can. It reads:
1. SHAREHOLDINGS IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES (INCLUDING HOLD-ING COMPANIES) INDICATING THE NAME OF THE COMPANY OR THE COMPANIES.
In my case it says, `Self' and my declaration says, `NIL'. Then it reads:
2. FAMILY AND BUSINESS TRUSTS AND NOMINEE COMPANIES—
(i) in which a beneficial interest is held, indicating the name of the trust and the nature of its operation and beneficial interest;
There are four columns, but only three are of any import. One says:
Name of trust/nominee company.
The next says:
Nature of its operation.
The last says:
Beneficial interest.
In my case it reads, `Self' and there is no entry—it reads `N/A' because it is not applicable. Then the second part is:
(ii) in which the Senator, the Senator's spouse or partner, or a child who is wholly or mainly dependent on the Senator for support, is a trustee (but not including a trustee of an estate where no beneficial interest is held by the Senator, the Senator's spouse or partner or dependent children), indicating the name of the trust, the nature of its operation and the beneficiary of the trust. 
There are the same headings as in the previous part. Again it reads: `Self' and `N/A'. Next is:
3. REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING THE LOCATION (SUBURB OR AREA ONLY) AND THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS OWNED.
In my case it reads, `Self' and `CARINDALE', which is the suburb in Queensland I live in, and after it I have `(CO-OWNER)' which means I co-own it with my wife—and, more likely, with the bank—and under `Purpose for which owned' I have put: `FAMILY HOME.' So we are going through some real riveting stuff!
4. REGISTERED DIRECTORSHIPS OF COMPANIES.
The headings are `Name of company' and `Activities of company'. Underneath it reads: `Self' and `N/A'. I am pretty dull and boring!
5. PARTNERSHIPS, INDICATING THE NATURE OF THE INTERESTS AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP.
The headings are `Name', `Nature of interest' and `Activities of partnership'. Underneath it reads, `Self' and `N/A'.
6. LIABILITIES, INDICATING THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY AND THE CREDITOR CONCERNED.
In my case it says, `Mortgage' and `Westpac'. Everyone now knows I bank with Westpac, which would be no secret if you had seen me go to the Westpac teller.
7. THE NATURE OF ANY BONDS, DEBENTURES AND LIKE INVESTMENTS.
Then there are two columns: `Type of investment' and `Body in which investment in held'. Underneath it reads, `Self' and `N/A'.
8. SAVING OR INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS, INDICATING THEIR NATURE AND THE NAME OF THE BANK OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS CONCERNED.
The columns below are headed `Nature of account' and `Name of bank/institution'. I have a savings account—and I have declared that—with the Queensland Teachers Credit Union. That is not something you would not suspect, given that at some stage in my life I was a teacher. And I have declared a savings account—surprise, surprise!—with Westpac. Then we go to:
9. THE NATURE OF ANY OTHER ASSETS (EXCLUDING HOUSEHOLD AND PER-SONAL EFFECTS) EACH VALUED AT MORE THAN $5,000.
Then, where I have to list the nature of any other investment, I have written: `PERPETUAL INVESTMENTS (PRE-SERVED SUPERANNUATION)'. Then there is:
10. THE NATURE OF ANY OTHER SUBSTANTIAL SOURCES OF INCOME.
The heading under that is `Nature of income' and underneath it reads, `Self' and `N/A'. People might be becoming a little bit bored with my personal history, but it goes to show that people in this chamber make a fairly rigorous declaration. I could go on. There are only four headings left, but I do not think I am going to have the time to do that. Maybe at another time and another place I could. What I am saying to the Australian public is that the people in this place are transparent and accountable in the way in which they handle both themselves and their business. As Senator Carr alluded to—and I agree with him on some occasions—the nature of trusts and how those trusts operate leave a lot to be desired. But the information is clearly available and clearly declared and it is, as Senator Carr said, one of the most well-read documents that one could hope to find. There are a couple of other things on this declaration I should go through. One is:
12. ANY SPONSORED TRAVEL OR HOSPITALITY RECEIVED WHERE THE VALUE OF THE SPONSORSHIP OR HOSPITALITY EXCEEDS $200. 
This is not hospitality or sponsored travel but, because I am an elected delegate of the national council of my union—which is a properly held position, elected through the Australian Electoral Commission—I am entitled to attend the national conference of that union on an annual basis. And what do we find? I have declared that I am a delegate to the National Council of the SDA—that is the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association—wherever held.
—A fine union.
—A fine union, as Senator Ludwig interjects. Then I go to item 13, which says:
13. BEING AN OFFICE HOLDER OR A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR DONATING $200 OR MORE IN ANY SINGLE CALENDAR YEAR TO ANY ORGANISATION
I have named the organisations. They are the All Hallows Foundation Ltd, which is the school where my two young daughters went, and St Joseph's College Gregory Terrace Foundation, which is the school where my son went. I am a member of the Catholic Church—I donate to it—so I have declared that. I have declared St Vincent de Paul, because I believe in looking after the poor. I am the President of the SDA Queensland Branch and I have declared that. What conflict I have there I do not know. I have also declared the fact that my sister-in-law is on the board of a number of companies, but I do not see how that would interfere with what I do here. I think what has been trotted out here tonight has been nonsense indeed. (Time expired)
 (Senator Chapman)—I should point out that there has been some comment that this matter cannot be determined tonight, but in fact it can be, provided there is no call for a division; it can be determined on the voices.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Proposed Variation</title>,Committees,32,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-09-11,"—I think it appropriate to make some comments on this matter. It is a matter that goes to issues of accountability and transparency in the Senate. It is fair to say that, more than any other party, the Democrats have a record of trying to improve transparency in parliamentary, electoral, political and corporate processes.
There are a few things that need to be highlighted in relation to this debate. For those people who have been following it to this stage, it is important that we put this in context. I should say at the outset that I support Senator Brown's amendment to prevent the removal of section 5. I have to say, however, that I think he and Senator Nettle have rather overstated their case in a lot of aspects. I understand why it happens—and the Democrats no doubt have done it as well. Whilst we talk a lot about the need for removing cynicism from people's perceptions of politicians, I think if we occasionally exaggerate the impression that there is evil under every rock then we help to reinforce that cynicism unnecessarily. Some of the inferences that could be drawn from the contribution of the Greens this evening overstate the suggestion that there is evil under every rock—or perhaps under every senator's seat.
The Democrats were part of ensuring that the components in these standing orders to do with the declaration of senators' interests came into force. The context in which this motion has come before us does need to be emphasised. Indeed, the suggestion that somehow this has been slipped in without notice on Thursday night is a bit unfortunate because, as Senator Denman said, the motion has been around for more than a year. The motion came into this chamber before Senator Nettle came into this chamber. The report that the committee brought down at that time gave its rationale for why it wished to do what it wanted to do. People are free to disagree with that, and I am suggesting that I disagree with it as well.  
After things such as the Register of Senators' Interests have been in place for a time, it is appropriate to review how they are going—whether they can be improved, whether there are parts that are unnecessary and whether there are parts that are not working. I would say that a part that is not working is the part that we are talking about tonight. The key issue is whether we say, `It's not working; let's get rid of it—it's unnecessary,' which is what the committee suggested, or whether we say, `It's not working—let's see whether we can make it work in a way that meets its intention.' I certainly think that would be the better path to go down. As Senator Brown said, there have been 3,000 pieces of legislation since 1984—when this came in—and only 120 declarations of interest. I think that is what he said; it is what I have jotted down, so I hope I am repeating him correctly.
I think what that says is that it has not worked. Depending on how you define a pecuniary interest or a non-pecuniary interest, with some of the things that Senator Nettle was suggesting about non-pecuniary interests such as issues affecting friends or relatives or organisations you are involved in, you would be faced with a situation where people would be required to verbally declare an interest in at least every second piece of legislation. If everybody were required to do that for every division on legislation, all 76 of us would be standing up. It could involve tax legislation, superannuation legislation, in some cases family law legislation, social security legislation and legislation to do with clubs, schools and unions. It is not just about businesses and corporations; it is about other parts of society that are continually affected by legislation that is passed through this place.
In his contribution, Senator Humphries said that the committee felt that it is just not a practical approach and, given the transparency and comprehensiveness of the Register of Senators' Interests, that it is not necessary. I am not convinced that that is the case. I do see the rationale that if we had 76 people all standing up and verbally declaring an interest before every second division—which is technically what could be required, depending on how tightly you wish to define an interest—it would not be practical or workable and it would be counterproductive. But I do think it is possible to look at ways to refine the measure rather than just chuck it out. We need to look at how we define an interest—what is an interest and how broadly do people expect us to acknowledge interests?
From Senator Hogg's contribution, it does not sound as though he is interested in very much at all. But, even from the ones he did declare at the end, while he might not have many interests in the financial world he has interests in church organisations, in charities and in schools. They are affected by a lot of legislation, including some we have debated today.
The question I asked today about the migration sponsorship legislation, which potentially can affect MPs who wish to sponsor temporary visitors to this country, is an issue that can affect and is of interest not just to individual MPs but also to us in terms of family and other people who we may know. The concern that I have with the amendment the Greens have put forward is its extremely purist approach. If we are going to be purist and we keep the standing order in place then we would have all 76 senators declaring interest on virtually every piece of legislation. That is not practical and I do not think that it is terribly helpful. 
It does need to be said that the Register of Senators' Interests is comprehensive and it is publicly available, so I do object to the very strong inference that somehow there is a lot of skulduggery and everybody is trying to hide something. That is not the case. It is quite open and public—
—You read it often—I bet.
—There are too many people with no interests and I do not find the Register of Senators' Interests very interesting. At the same time, leaving aside all the politics and the other aspects, the principle of specifically acknowledging an interest in an area when it is before the chamber in debate is an important one. It is one I would not like to give up on just yet. A lot of us do it informally in any case when an issue is before the chamber. I think we all have an interest in electoral law but I do not recall all of us standing up and declaring that interest every time we have a division or amendments to the Electoral Act, for example.
There is a case for seeing if the principle can be made to operate effectively. I say that because I do not think it has operated effectively, and Senator Brown's own statistics show that it has not operated effectively if there were only that many declarations of interest over that period of time with such a large number of pieces of legislation. Those senators who want to get rid of the standing order are saying that it is not operating effectively and therefore it is pointless. I would say that the principle is still important, so let us see whether we can try to make it operate effectively. That is the approach that I would like to see the Senate take.
 (Senator Chapman)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Brown be agreed to. On the voices a division is required. I remind honourable senators that if a division is called for on a Thursday after 6 p.m. the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned, pursuant to standing order 57(3), until the next day of sitting at a time to be fixed by the Senate. Accordingly, the matter is adjourned.
Senator TROETH (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (7.03 p.m.)—I move:
That the votes be taken immediately after prayers on the next day of sitting.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Proposed Variation</title>,Committees,32,2,speech
"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2003-09-11,"—Yesterday in the Mural Hall of Parliament House, I was a happy witness when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, in company with the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, launched a portrait of the Australian community at the 2001 census called The people of Australia. This is a publication by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs based on the 2001 Australian population and household census conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
These statistics in themselves make fascinating reading. For example, as a result of migration, we now have 64,000 more New Zealanders, 32,000 more Chinese and 24,000 more South Africans in 2001 than we did in the 1996 census. Also, largely through our humanitarian resettlement program, in 2001 we had almost 2,500—an increase of 103 per cent—more Sudanese and 10,000—an increase of 75 per cent—more Bosnians than we did in 1996. This is an achievement that very few of those who denigrate our strict but fair border protection measures are ready to acknowledge. 
Statistics, however, make for a boring topic. More importantly, this publication—as Minister Ruddock noted in his address at the launch—emphasises how lucky we all are to be living in a country that is as culturally diverse, tolerant and friendly as Australia. Indeed, since the end of World War II when our immigration program started in earnest, we have through migration created a society in Australia that is home to people from over 200 countries, who practise more than 100 religions and who speak over 200 different languages. Anywhere else in the world, as recent history shows, sadly this outcome could have been a recipe for disaster. Yet, in Australia, the presence of people from such diverse backgrounds has produced, as the 20th century has ended and the 21st century has begun, a vibrant and interesting place for all to live.
This makes Australia the success story of human and humane society since recorded history. It is a success that is made possible through the conception and adoption of a positive, pluralistic, multicultural and communal nation-building ideal. The willingness by the Australian people to accept and to incorporate the ideas and cultures brought here by all its citizens has ensured this success. We benefit from this diversity in many ways. Our new citizens from other lands bring with them many skills, talents and commercial contacts. These attributes contribute significantly to the economic wellbeing of this country.
Research by the department, quoted yesterday by Minister Ruddock, has shown that such a new citizen, a skilled migrant, on average would make a net contribution to the Commonwealth's budget of around $26,000 over the first four years and around $75,000 over the first 10 years. The presence of new cultures, new ideas and new ways of seeing the world helps our society to become more mature, more considerate and more skilful in dealing with other people of the world, which, as we are constantly reminded, is a shrinking place. In this regard the links that migrants continue to maintain with their home countries are especially important to this nation in our dealings with other nations. These links have strengthened our connections with our Asian neighbours and our more distant, more traditional, source countries. 
The Prime Minister recently made his fourth visit to China and in return we expect the Chinese President to visit Australia in October. At the same time the US President will also be visiting Australia. Such historic events are a clear demonstration of Australia's ability to punch above our weight in the international arena. That is an ability that can only come from our internal strengths, derived from our vibrantly diverse and productively cohesive society. I am pleased to participate in the launch of this source book that is also a celebration of Australian multicultural society. 
The census statistics provided in The People of Australia also show us something else: we are reminded that while societal diversity has benefited all of us it also brings with it some responsibilities. The early post Second World War migrants, people from Italy and many other European countries, played an important part in building modern Australia. They came here as young men and young women and helped build the Australia we have today. More than 50 years on, however, these migrants are mostly in their sixties and seventies, and some are older. The demographic reality is that migrants age like the rest of us. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, almost 30 per cent of our elderly population will be from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds within 10 years. Clearly, this projected situation will add to the challenges of an ageing population. 
As Minister Ruddock noted, to face this added challenge of providing culturally appropriate services we need close partnerships between communities, aged care providers and governments at Commonwealth, state and local levels. I will use an example which Minister Ruddock also used. In the local area of Port Adelaide, approximately one in five people was born in non-English-speaking countries. Of these, around 5,000 do not speak good English. For some of these 5,000 people this may not be an issue. Some could be recent migrants who are undertaking English language tuition as part of the Adult Migrant English Program, which is a Commonwealth responsibility. Nevertheless, a significant number would be children who would be expected to go to school. Delivery of language services to these children is a state responsibility—and sometimes in private schools it is a community responsibility.
But the data from The People of Australia show more than just where Australians have come from. One of the issues these data highlight is the drift from rural and regional Australia to our capital cities and to coastal regions. The loss of population in these regions can be accompanied by a decline in essential services and skills. Left unremedied this can lead to a general lowering of opportunities, expectations and living standards for the people left behind and an inability to attract and retain new people. These are problems that the Howard government has addressed for seven years and will continue to remedy.
These are problems of far more concern than the drought that was the subject of Senator O'Brien's urgency motion debated earlier today. The drought was last year's problem. It is a problem which the Howard government has already put in place long-term strategies to ameliorate—as senators on this side comprehensively demonstrated during the debate. 
I was reminded how out of touch the Labor Party and Labor Party politicians really are when I had the great pleasure of attending the presentation of the National Youth Roundtable 2003 projects this morning. The National Youth Roundtable is a youth initiative of the Howard government, providing young Australians with an open channel for dialogue with the government and an opportunity to directly participate in the policy formulation process. The roundtable brings together some 50 young people—but on this occasion 49—aged between 15 and 24 who meet with the Australian government to discuss issues that affect their generation. Roundtable members include young people from all states and territories, from metropolitan and regional areas and from various cultural backgrounds. The members, whether they are studying, caring for others, looking for work or working, bring to the roundtable a wide range of experiences and viewpoints. Members' experiences from being involved in local community activities and their knowledge of local youth issues are also assets to the roundtable. I was extremely impressed, as I have been in previous years, by the quality of the young people who attended this roundtable. I seek leave to table and incorporate a list of the participants in this year's roundtable together with brief biographical details. It is a public document.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

John is interested in Aboriginal youth and homelessness and has focused on the Tasmanian Aboriginal community. John would like to establish an Aboriginal drop-in centre in Hobart to combat the high rates of Aboriginal homelessness he has observed there.
Jessica Mouthaan
Casuarina, NT
At 24, Jessica is a full-time youth and education services coordinator for the Australian Red Cross in Darwin. She assists in the coordination of a range of youth services, including the SHAK youth drop-in centre, which has given her an insight into the challenges faced by young people in the Northern Territory. As the carer for her older sister, Jessica is committed to living in the Territory and further building local networks. During her time on the Roundtable, Jessica has looked at how young people with mental health issues access independent living in Darwin.

The Government has no plans to indemnify the family of Rolah McCabe against possible orders as to costs in the family's action against British American Tobacco.
The Attorney-General's Department administers a range of financial assistance schemes that make provision for legal and financial assistance in particular circumstances. Where a person is eligible for assistance under one of those schemes, a grant of assistance does not, as a general rule, extend to an indemnity for costs.
It is open to an individual to make an application for financial assistance to my Department. Each application is considered in accordance with the guidelines of the appropriate scheme. In accordance with a long standing practice, endorsed by successive Attorneys-General, to treat applications for financial assistance in confidence, it is not appropriate for me to provide information in relation to any individual application for financial assistance.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Attorney-General's: Legal Assistance</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,35,1,answer
