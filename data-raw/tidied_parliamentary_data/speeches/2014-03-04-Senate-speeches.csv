Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:31):  In my concluding remarks yesterday on why the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 should not be passed, I was sharing with my colleagues some of the very moving comments I have received from people who have a very clear understanding of how important the carbon tax is and why we need to retain it and build with real carbon action. I just want to share a few more of those comments. Lynnette Oakley is one of the more than 6,000 people who signed just one of the petitions calling for these bills to be retained. Interestingly, she spoke of her concerns about the people of Kiribati. She said: 'I have been visiting the nation of Kiribati on the equator for 10 years. Over that time there have been very noticeable changes.' She went on to detail how disturbing she found the impacts that climate change is having on people.


Noela Kelman came to one of the recent rallies about the importance of these bills. She said:


The future of my children and grandchildren and the wellbeing of all future generations are in our hands—such responsibility must be shouldered and fought for. I have recycled, reduced, reused for decades but much more is needed.


And someone many of my colleagues would know very warmly is Gosta Lynga. He is now living in Canberra. He is a former Swedish parliamentarian who historically was part of the introduction of a carbon tax in his native city over 12 years ago. He said:


I have been able to follow the effect in Sweden on the use of less polluting fuels, on the move towards more sustainable energy … and consequently on the decrease in atmospheric pollution due to carbon dioxide from Swedish sources. This has been encouraging.


I have also seen how ever more countries around the world are taking their share of responsibility for what is a global problem with possibly devastating consequences. There can no longer be any doubt that the observed increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is causing dangerous global warming and that the increase is caused by human pollution sources.


Based on these facts I am sad that the Australian government is now contemplating backwards steps. 


And that sums up so many of the comments that my offices receive and that people raise with me formally and informally. People are very distressed about what this government is doing. They understand how important urgent climate change action is. They also know that renewable energy is industrially and commercially viable, that we need a government with courage, with the political will to work with communities across this country on the transition to a clean future that we so urgently need.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:34):  I rise to make my contribution to this debate on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 and related bills. Senator Rhiannon just referred to courage. Why didn't your alliance partners, before the 2010 election, have the courage to say that if they won the election they would introduce a carbon tax, instead of saying, 'We will not introduce a carbon tax'? The Australian people were quite clear, when they voted on 7 September last year, that if the coalition were elected to government the carbon tax would be removed.


Let me make a few points. I find it amazing that a debate that started in the final sitting weeks of 2013 could still be going on here today in 2014, well into March. But the government has been prepared to let Labor and the Greens continue filibustering to delay the inevitable. I have heard some amazing contributions over these weeks, but I would like to quote a section of Senator Ludlam's speech. This is quite amazing. He said:


People like Jon Moylan and others are stepping up to stop the Maules Creek coalmine and protect the Leard State Forest in New South Wales.


I have a question: is this the same Jon Moylan who is facing criminal charges over the fake ANZ bank press release? Is it the same Jon Moylan whose actions temporarily wiped $300 million off Whitehaven's market capitalisation?


Well, Mr Jon Moylan will soon have his day in court. ASIC, to its credit—and I have thrown plenty of criticism at ASIC before today—has brought one charge under the Corporations Act, to which Mr Moylan has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is set down for 20 June. ASIC quite rightly points out that a hoax could have significant market impact, but the fact that mum and dad investors could have lost money does not faze Senator Ludlam—or of course the Greens as a whole. So here is Senator Ludlam giving Mr Moylan a pat on the back—and even Senator Rhiannon tweeted her congratulations at the time. It proves again that, when you are engaged in civil disobedience, the Greens will be there cheering you on.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What did I say, Whacka?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I don't know what you said, Senator Whish-Wilson.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senators, no speaking across the chamber.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Senator Wright referred to the drought package announced last week by Prime Minister Abbott and the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Barnaby Joyce. Sure, it has been dry in many parts of Australia—and of course the Greens start wringing their hands and scream 'climate change'—but there have been droughts every decade and climate change was not even thought or talked of. We can go back to the big drought of 1895 to 1907.


Let's get back to the debate and look at what business says about the carbon tax—to August 2013, in Fernvale Queensland and the business Zanow Sand and Gravel. Manager Brad Zanow said overheads had risen by $15,000 a month and that the carbon tax had led to an increase in electricity bills as well as the cost of oil, cement powder and air-conditioning gas. Mr Zanow said the business had shed five of its 58 staff. In December 2012 Grain Products Australia, based in Tamworth—I visited this factory in recent times, prior to this—went into administration citing increased electricity charges as one of the reasons it was in financial trouble. The $1.2 million increase in energy costs was blamed on network charges, environmental issues and—you guessed it—the carbon tax.


In February 2014 Virgin Australia boss John Borghetti said the best thing the government and Labor could do for airlines would be to scrap the carbon tax. Virgin Australia suffered an $83 million loss to the end of December last year and Mr Borghetti said the carbon tax has cost the airline industry hundreds of millions of dollars. These figures are thrown around—the carbon tax cost Qantas $106 million last year and Virgin Airlines more than $50 million. Isn't it amazing that, when the previous government and their strange alliance brought this tax in, they put it on the airlines in Australia but not those that fly internationally?


I want to make another point. Out in most large rural areas we have crop dusters—small airplanes for spreading fertilizer and often chemical spraying for weeds in crops. I was speaking to a gentleman just recently who owns a crop-dusting business. The carbon tax component of the fuel for his airplanes has cost him $60,000. Here are graziers, spreading fertilizer to encourage growth in our natural pastures and improved pastures, and when they grow they actually absorb CO2, they carry more stock and they grow more food to feed people in Australia and around the world. But this crazy tax we are trying to abolish is taxing this crop-dusting company $60,000 a year. Of course a grazier says, 'Well, I'll budget $30,000 for the spreading of fertilizer this year'—so he or she will spend the $30,000. Because there are higher spreading costs for the fuel for those aircraft, they actually spread less fertilizer.


Tourism Accommodation Australia estimates the cost of the carbon tax on the sector would be $115 million in the first year alone. Macquarie Generation, in the Hunter Valley, which operates the Liddell and Bayswater power stations—I am sure many would be well aware of those generators—had a carbon tax bill to 30 June last year that was a massive $460 million. And what did they do? They just passed it on to the consumer.


This is the broadest, largest price on carbon in the world. Here we are trying to compete in the world markets, with other countries that have nowhere near the costs of these so-called environmental taxes, and we are losing our competitive edge. It is as simple as that.


I am the first to say that the environment is probably the most important thing we have to protect for future generations, especially our lands and our soils that have to grow the food—but this tax goes nowhere near doing any of that. In fact, if you want to look after the environment I suggest you look at a map of Australia. At a guess I would say that 55, 60 or perhaps 65 per cent of our whole nation is in the hands of farmers, graziers and pastoralists. The best way we can look after that environment is to see that the people running those properties actually make a living and have money in their pockets. Without money they are forced, if I can put it this way, to mine their country instead of farm their country—or perhaps overcrop it or overstock it to try to stay financially viable.


The best way we can look after our environment is to see we have strong financial landowners. We had a terrible run with the previous government's ridiculous decision, supported by the Greens, to ban the live export of cattle to Indonesia. Now, thankfully, this government—and I commend Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, for this—have gone back to Indonesia and stimulated the export of cattle once more. In September 2013 OECD research backed the coalition's claims that 'Australia's pioneering carbon pricing is damaging its competitiveness'. So we have the OECD agreeing with what I just said.


Let's talk briefly about the weather—because the Greens have been in here waffling on about heatwaves and droughts. I will quote from an article of 22 October:


The Blue Mountains bushfire crisis was the result of a lack of political leadership and had nothing to do with climate change, one of Australia's foremost disaster management experts said. David Packham, a former Deputy Director of the Australian Counter Disaster College, said linking the NSW fire disaster with global warming was nonsense. Mr. Packham previously accused latte conservationists of having too much influence on forest management. 


This is the argument I have made many times in this place: if you lock up country and leave it in the form of national parks then the grass grows, the lightning strikes, the fires get going and the damage is enormous. It is not conservation; it is destroying those areas that are not managed. Until I leave this place and go to my grave, whenever that is, I will say: you must manage country. This is one of the serious problems we face with the serious bushfires, in national parks especially, with huge fuel loads—and that is not helping our environment one bit. As I said, if we want to help our environment, get our business sector strong and get our farmers financially strong so they can spend the money on the environment.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:44):  I rise to oppose the repeal of the clean energy bills. I do this for a number of reasons, but for the life of me I cannot accept a proposition based on a scare campaign run by the coalition, who are now in government—a scare campaign where we take short-term approaches and do not look at the long-term challenges for this country. I will quote someone I do not normally quote, although I have used this quote before; it is by the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies. In a radio broadcast on 24 July 1942, Sir Robert Menzies had this to say of his Liberal creed:


Nothing could be worse for democracy than to adopt the practice of permitting knowledge to be overthrown by ignorance.


If there has ever been an example of knowledge being overthrown by ignorance, the debate on climate change is ignorance overthrowing knowledge. He went on to say:


If I have honestly and thoughtfully arrived at a certain conclusion on a public question and my electors disagree with me, my first duty is to endeavour to persuade them that my view is right.


I will come to what the current Prime Minister's view was in relation to climate change. I will come to his view on how you best deal with climate change. But let me say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is certainly not taking the advice of Sir Robert Menzies on how you deal with an issue you believe in. Robert Menzies continued:


If I fail in this, my second duty will be to accept the electoral consequences and not to run away from them. Fear can never be a proper or useful ingredient in those mutual relations of respect and good-will which ought to exist between the elector and the elected.


I honestly think that what has happened with the coalition is that fear has been used continually by them in relation to climate change. For short-term political gain, they have used fear as a weapon to try to destroy the scientific base of this issue and to destroy an unarguable environmental case. That is not what the creed of the Liberal Party was and it is certainly not what Sir Robert Menzies was arguing in those days. He went on:


And so, as we think about it we shall find more and more how disfiguring a thing fear is in our own political and social life.


It has not bothered those on the other side that this creed of rejecting fear as a political weapon is the creed that was put forward by Sir Robert Menzies. They have used it mercilessly in pursuit of short-term political gain at the expense of long-term management of what is one of the biggest social, economic and moral issues this country has ever faced.


Menzies went on to say:


Men fear the unknown as children fear the dark. It is that kind of fear which too often restrains experiment and keeps us from innovations which might benefit us enormously.


What could be clearer in terms of benefit than putting a price on carbon to make sure that future generations get a fair go from this generation? What could be clearer? The experiment that was proposed—putting a price on carbon—has just been rejected. It is not so much an experiment—I think it is clear that the majority of environmental scientists and the majority of economists say that that is the way to go.


Sir Robert Menzies said:


It is the fear of knowledge which prevents so many of us from really using our minds, and which makes so many of us ready slaves to cheap and silly slogans and catch-cries.


Doesn't that say it all? Cheap and silly slogans and catchcries in place of critical analysis of the problem, scientific understanding of the problem and environmental understanding of the consequences of global warming.


He said:


It is the fear of life and its problems which makes so many of us yearn for nothing so much as some safe billet from which risk and its twin brother enterprise are alike abolished.


So Sir Robert Menzies, not one of my pin-up boys in politics, really had nailed this position. I suppose if Sir Robert Menzies were around now he would be looking at the cheap and silly slogans and the catchcries from the opposition and shake his head and wonder where his party has gone. I can tell where the party has gone. The party has really gone to the bottom, where it is short-termism over the long term.


My view is that these bills before us now are the triumph of the barbarians in the Liberal Party over those who would want to hold onto that political heritage. The barbarians in the party have rejected the political heritage of Sir Robert Menzies. You just have to look at the Prime Minister's position. As he told Malcolm Turnbull, he is a weathervane on climate change. He will just stick his hand up, see which way the wind is blowing and then take a position. On 18 December 2008 he supported an ETS:


An emissions trading scheme probably is the best way to put a price on carbon …


But seven months later he was supporting a carbon tax. On 10 July he said:


I suspect that a straight carbon tax or charge could be more transparent and easier to change if conditions change or our understanding of the science changes.


Two weeks later, he was back supporting an ETS. He said:


There is much to be said for an emissions trading scheme. It was, after all, the mechanism for emission reduction ultimately chosen by the Howard government. It enables an increasing market price to be set for carbon through capping volumes of emissions.


Then in December 2010 he was against both an ETS and a carbon tax. Something was in the wind. Maybe it was the leadership of the Liberal Party. One minute he was supporting a carbon tax, one minute he was supporting a carbon price, and then in December 2010 he was saying, 'One of the reasons the coalition is so much against carbon taxes and emission trading schemes is that they are not going to help the environment, but, by gee, there'll be a huge whack on everyone's cost of living.' Well, wasn't Sir Menzies right? Here comes the fear campaign. That was the fear campaign starting on behalf of the coalition.


On the same day in July 2009 when he indicated support for an ETS, he said he was unconvinced by climate science. He said:


I am, as you know, hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have significantly increased since the spread of industrialisation, but it seems that noticeable warming has only taken place between the 1970s and 1990s.


Anyone who has had even a very shallow look at the scientific facts would know that that is a political position, not one based on science.


Six months later, suddenly humans do cause climate change. On the ABC Radio 702, he said, 'I think human activity certainly does impact on climate.' A year later he said human activity is still contributing: 'I think climate change is real' and 'humanity makes a contribution to it'. But a week later, on 14 March, he is back to being unsure about climate science. He said:


I don't think we can say that the science is settled here.


There is no doubt that we should do our best to rest lightly on the planet and there is no doubt that we should do our best to emit as few waste products as possible, but, having said that, whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out … is not yet proven.


That is just a nonsense. That is a political argument. It is not based on the science that is before this parliament.


Mr Abbott simply cannot be believed on his climate change policy—and calling Direct Action a policy is probably overstating it. The truth is that many on the Liberal side do not believe in the science. They are antiscience, and Mr Abbott just does not have the courage to tell the public what he really thinks, so he jumps from one position to another continually.


Let's deal with the science. We have heard contributions from coalition senators here over a period of time trying to say, 'I actually believe in the science, but we're not really sure that it is anthropocentric—



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator, that is human caused carbon pollution, and that is what he needs to understand. What do key scientists at the CSIRO say? They say:


Climate change is the greatest ecological, economic, and social challenge of our time.


Those are the people who we pay to provide us with scientific knowledge on the issues confronting Australia. The scientists at the CSIRO have an international reputation. I heard one Liberal senator here saying that the people who are supporting climate change in the scientific community are low-level scientists. You cannot say that about the CSIRO. You cannot say that about the Bureau of Meteorology. You cannot say that about the Australian scientists who are involved in this. They are amongst the best in the world and that is why the world listens to them when they talk on these issues. The only people who are not listening to our scientists are the coalition—the climate sceptics and the climate deniers on the other side.


The Australian Academy of Science has said that this is an issue that has to be dealt with and that we need to deal with it quickly. Global sea levels are currently rising. There is a great deal of evidence that the earth's climate has warmed. Global average temperatures have risen in line with the climate model projections. The models have been done—some of the most sophisticated computer modelling ever in the world—and they are clearly indicating that temperatures are rising. What is happening in practice around the world is consistent with those climate model projections.


So climate change is already visible. That is the message. Southern and eastern Australia's water supply reliability is expected to decline. It is the CSIRO saying this. It is not some politician standing here saying that this is what is going to happen; it is our scientific community—the experts in the science of climate change. They say 'development and population growth in Australia’s coastal regions will exacerbate risks from sea-level rise' and that there will be 'significant loss of unique Australian animal and plant species' across the country. They say there is a risk to infrastructure, including the failure of urban drainage and sewerage systems, and that more blackouts, transport disruption and greater building damage will all have to be dealt with.


These are not scare campaigns as they are dressed up by the tactics group of the coalition; this is what the scientists are telling us about climate change. I want my grandkids to have the same rights and privileges I had. That is the right to have a country where we are not facing these calamitous environmental issues.


The scientists go on to say that:


Heatwaves, storms and floods are likely to have a direct impact on the health of Australians … Moderate warming in the absence of rainfall declines can be beneficial to some agricultural crops … However, these positive effects can be offset by changes in temperature, rainfall, pests, and the availability of nutrients. Production from cropping and livestock is projected to decline over much of southern Australia, as is the quality of grain, grape, vegetable, fruit, and other crops.


What I just cannot believe is when the National Party in this place, the people who should be warning their constituencies about the effects of climate change, deny that it is happening and go out and perpetrate the lies and nonsense that we have seen in the political debate in this country. I cannot understand why, if you are depending on the land, you would not accept the science. But that seems to be what is happening.


The other argument we hear is that it is all going to send industry broke. There is a document called Cleaning up: Australia's readiness for a low-carbon future. This was done in 2012. It was not done by the Greens. It was not done by the Labor Party. It was done by the Economist Intelligence Unit ofThe Economist—the bible for the economic dries around the world. It did a case study on Wesfarmers. Wesfarmers, it said:


… will be among the companies most heavily affected by the new carbon price scheme.


Aside from power stations, Wesfarmers is Australia's sixth biggest carbon emitter, producing 2.7m tonnes of direct emissions.


It was incurring:


… a A$100m net annual cost in the first year of the scheme as a result of the initial carbon price of A$23 per tonne.


But its revenue in 2011 was $56 billion. So it had a revenue of $56 billion, and the cost to deal with carbon was $100 million a year. What did Wesfarmers say? It said:


… it can maintain its margins by taking steps to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency.


…   …   …


Apart from the investment to improve energy efficiency, much of the group's focus in the last year has been on intensive emissions reduction, particularly in the chemicals business.


The document went on to say that Wesfarmers is:


… developing internal policies to guide employees as they prepare greenhouse and energy reports and deal with customers and suppliers on issues to do with carbon pricing—


and that is an important aspect of that company's work.


It went on to say:


Though the carbon cost is significant, Wesfarmers believes it can mitigate it to a large extent with top line growth and increased organisational efficiency.


This is a company that has one of the highest carbon prices that has to be paid, a company that is a big employer, a company that has taken the steps to deal with the issue of carbon pricing—and it says it will not affect its bottom line because it is going to deal with it.


Who was the sponsor of this report? It was General Electric. General Electric sponsored this report for The Economist. There is another case study in here on Shell. Shell said a cap-and-trade system is the right way to go and that it is 'the right mix at the right time'. So no-one agrees with this nonsense of Direct Action that the coalition are putting up. The Minister for Communications, Malcolm Turnbull, clearly does not like it. He belled the cat when he said it was a nonsense and a short-term approach. We have to take long-term approaches in the interests of our grandkids and in the interests of the planet. That is the challenge the coalition are failing to meet.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2014-03-04,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (13:04):  I rise to speak on this package of bills, debating what many Australians hope will be the final chapter and effectively the nail in the coffin of the disastrous carbon tax. It is a tax that, of course, was not even meant to exist and it is one of the most damaging and ridiculous policies that has ever traversed through both houses of parliament. It is a tax that has been a blight on this country's economy and a burden on the budget of every Australian family and every Australian business. It has put pressure on the cost of living, it has increased the costs of doing business within Australia and it has damaged our international competitiveness overseas. In fact, it was in its very first year a $7.6 billion hit to our economy. It had a direct impact on over 75,000 Australian businesses.


After all of this, how much did the carbon tax reduce carbon dioxide emissions by? Just 0.1 per cent. It cost $7.6 billion and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by barely 0.1 per cent. I could sum it up in another way. It has not worked. Only the Labor Party and their alliance partners in the Greens could impose a tax on the country to save the environment that actually made next to no difference.


But while the carbon tax was doing its damage to the wallets of Australians, it was also—I remind you, Acting Deputy President Furner, and the people of Australia—doing untold damage to those in the Labor Party. No other policy in recent memory has claimed such high-level political scalps or damaged so many political reputations. Let's take a walk down memory lane. It originally started with Mr Rudd walking away from his emissions trading scheme, which helped lead the way to him being dumped as leader and Prime Minister in 2010. Then Ms Gillard, after plunging the knife into Mr Rudd's back, tried to make her mark on the policy, misleading the Australian people in the most blatant manner that I have ever seen from a sitting Prime Minister. Just days before the election Ms Gillard promised on national television in front of millions of Australians:


There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.


She took that promise to the election, as did all the Labor Party. She scraped into government with the help of a handful of Independents and then turned her back on the clear will of the Australian people by doing the exact thing she promised not to do. The question remained—and it remained a black stain over Ms Gillard's prime ministership—how could anyone trust anything she said after she had backflipped on such a flagrant election promise? That did, indeed, haunt her throughout her prime ministership and eventually it helped lead to her downfall.


Mr Rudd then made a comeback and tried to smooth things over. In his eagerness to win the election at whatever cost, he admitted the carbon tax was a huge burden for all Australians. He said:


The government has decided to terminate the carbon tax to help cost-of-living pressures for families and to reduce costs for small business.


Let me read the opening line of that again: 'The government has decided to terminate the carbon tax'. That was Mr Rudd and the Labor Party before the last election. But that did not save him, because by then the Australian people had had a gutful. They were sick of paying another tax that Labor had lumped them with and that was achieving no beneficial outcome. They were sick of forking out for Labor's and the Green' ideological bent of putting a price on carbon dioxide—that odourless and colourless gas that is actually vital for life on earth. So the Australian people categorically rejected what Labor had put forward—and their policies—at the last election. They wanted change and they did not trust the then Labor government to fulfil their promise of abolishing the carbon tax. So they left it to the coalition to abolish the carbon tax—and that is exactly what we are trying to do.


This is about making things better for the Australian people. It is about removing a toxic tax that does nothing to help the environment but hurts everyone's household budgets. The quarterly CPI figures which were released on 24 October last year, the first CPI figures since the carbon tax was introduced, showed the largest quarterly increase ever. About two-thirds of this increase, on average, was due to the carbon tax. There was a 15.3 per cent rise in electricity and household gas, and a 14.2 per cent rise in miscellaneous fuels. Electricity companies are now being slugged to the tune of $3.5 billion and these higher costs are being passed on to consumers. It was extraordinary to read an opinion piece in the local paper today by Mr Paul Howes, the man who basically said he would quit the Labor Party and quit supporting the Labor Party if one job were lost due to the carbon tax. He was lamenting the cost of electricity for businesses and saying that that was what was making manufacturing uncompetitive. But in his about-face in his opinion piece he failed to once mention the impact of the carbon tax on electricity costs and how that was threatening our manufacturing competitiveness in this country.


We see even more proof with the Clean Energy Regulator's report that tells us 16 of the 20 biggest carbon tax bills went to electricity companies. The additional costs for the power industry overall equate to $4.1 billion. That, of course—and I will say it again—means higher electricity and utility bills for Australian families. Businesses are crying out for relief as well. Labor's tax has been a $1.1 billion burden for our manufacturing sector. Industry groups have said that:


…Australia's high carbon tax raises business costs unnecessarily, hitting industry competitiveness and investment confidence.


The Business Council of Australia agrees, saying the carbon tax:


…places excessive costs on business and households because the carbon charge under the legislation is now one of the highest in the world.


In recent days, Virgin Australia boss John Borghetti singled out the carbon tax for its damaging impact on airlines. I know his words have already been mentioned, but they are worth repeating. He said:


…the best assistance the government and the opposition can provide is the removal of the carbon tax, which has cost this industry hundreds of millions of dollars…


The cost of the carbon tax to this one company alone is $27 million. All this damage is from a tax we were never meant to have in the first place. What Labor and the Greens seem to forget is that the most important poll on the carbon tax was taken on 7 September last year. The people had their say, yet those on the other side of the chamber are still confused. The party that vowed to terminate the carbon tax, as the Labor Party did, is now fighting to keep it. Quite frankly, those on the other side appear to have very little interest in easing the cost-of-living pressures on families. I would suggest that they do not have any, because they were the ones who implemented this tax whose entire aim was to increase costs. That, indeed, was the whole point of it.


In contrast to the continuing Labor chaos, the government has listened. We warned about the destructive nature of this tax before it was implemented. We took our considered and consistent position to the Australian people at the election and we fought to remove the carbon tax. Doing so will have positive consequences. As Rod Sims from the ACCC said last year:


What went up will clearly come down when you take away the carbon price.


According to Treasury modelling, removing the carbon tax in 2014-15 will leave average costs of living across all households around $550 lower than they otherwise would have been in 2014-15. It is estimated that retail electricity will be around nine per cent lower and retail gas prices around seven per cent lower than they would otherwise have been. This means that average electricity bills will be around $200 lower than they otherwise would have been for households. It also means that average household gas bills will be around $70 lower than they would otherwise have been. For business, it is estimated that compliance costs will decrease by around $87.6 million per year. The burdens pushed onto Australian business and families will be eased and taxpayers will no longer have to foot the bill for Labor's reckless spending and misguided ideological vendetta against carbon dioxide.


All this goes to show the level of deception and nonsense that has been attached to this carbon tax. Mr Rudd called the carbon tax—or its previous incarnation—the great moral challenge of our generation, and yet twice he denounced policies that his party was pursuing.


Ms Gillard made a fundamental error of judgement in breaking her promise to all Australians. Dr Bob Brown, a former senator, blamed the Queensland floods on coal companies and climate change. Speaking about the Murray Darling Basin in 2009, Senator Wong said:


… this severe, extended drought is clearly linked with global warming.


And now the Leader of the Opposition, after sitting back and watching his colleagues self-destruct over this, is providing only more chaos for the Labor Party and for the Australian people by holding up the repeal of the carbon tax.


Senators on the other side of the chamber are the prophets of doom, always seeking to fundamentally change our economy to pursue an extreme agenda. The climate change alarmists want us to believe what they tell us, at any cost. It is all about the price they are willing for others to pay. And, quite frankly, it is not simply the impact that something like the carbon tax has on our economy that we should be considering; we all have to pay for the extras that come with these policies. Almost $1.5 million was spent by the Rudd government on travel costs to send 68 people to that ill-famed Copenhagen conference in 2009; a conference that achieved basically nothing.


Taxpayers also forked out another $360,000 for a delegation to be sent to a Mexico climate change conference. And how can we forget the clauses within the draft of the mooted Copenhagen treaty that sought to establish an unelected and virtually unaccountable world body that would have required Australia to transfer billions of dollars each and every year to developing countries, all in the name of combating climate change? Those are just a few examples of how easy it was for the previous government to spend taxpayers' money to pursue their green dreams and socialist agenda. 


Rather than seeking to strike a balance between protecting the environment and the economic challenges we already face, Labor and the Greens were happy for taxpayers to bear the financial burden because it is the only way they know how to govern: taxes and more taxes. Their idea is to keep levelling taxes on other people without bothering about the real costs to our community. It is time for us to end this terrible part of our recent history. It is time for us to move on with getting our economy back on track. While those on the other side, along with their friends the Greens, sit and watch the death throes of their disastrous policy experiment, whose legacy we are living with today, the government is getting on with the job of governing.


We are making the tough decisions that protect the interests of this country, doing what is necessary to ensure that families and businesses have the best chance to succeed. We are working to implement the will of the Australian people, who want to see this carbon tax gone. We will not tax the Australian economy to achieve our environmental goals, unlike Labor and the Greens, who will tax the economy without achieving any environmental goals. We will work towards a sustainable environment through low-cost, effective opportunities to improve the environment.


The people of Australia know where we stand. They knew where we stood before the election; they know where we now stand. It is now up to the other side to respect the wishes of the people and vote to repeal the carbon tax and free this country from this damaging and ridiculous policy that was never designed to achieve any meaningful environmental outcome. I will be supporting this bill.

Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (13:18):  Over the centuries, there has been a colourful history of groups incorporating under the common belief that planet Earth is flat—despite a mounting wealth of scientific evidence to the contrary. While this idea can trace its origins back to ancient civilisations, it has been revived many times in recent decades across the globe. The philosophy reached a peak in the 1970s when the International Flat Earth Research Society of America was reported to have a following of around 3,000 people.


A newsletter by society President Charles Johnson declared the goal of the organisation was to 'replace the science religion with sanity'. He contended that science is nothing more than 'a weird, way-out occult concoction of gibberish theory-theology' and that scientists are 'the same old gang of witchdoctors, sorcerers and tellers of tales'. Even today, in the age of Google maps and satellite tracking, the flat-earth cause continues from a base in California and boasts around 420 members. For those interested, it has an active internet presence at theflatearthsociety.org.


While flat-earth theories and the like provide a rich seam for ridicule in internet memes and weird-and-wacky columns for slow news days they are generally regarded as harmless, if unconventional, additions to the world of ideas. We have come to accept that, regardless of how hefty the weight of evidence at their disposal, some people will always cling to curious, if not completely absurd, beliefs.


However, this phenomenon can result in more sinister outcomes if these same people are invested with the power to use their strange thoughts as the basis of public policy. In the area of climate change, I fear that some of these people are our nation's elected representatives and that some of their unfounded beliefs form the foundation of bills like the one before us today. Of course, most members of this coalition government will tell you that there is no question that they believe in climate change and that their commitment to combat it is sincere.


They would assert that they agree with the 97 per cent of scientists who say that climate change represents a very real and present danger to the planet and the quality of our life on it. But the truth is that we hear a lot of words in this place. And Australians are not foolish. Australians understand that the only way to judge elected representatives is not on professionally-crafted rhetoric, but on actions. And therein we have the rub.


Perhaps we can forgive the Prime Minister for misspeaking when he put on the public record his belief that climate change is 'crap', during the now infamous interview in The Australian. After all, we cannot forget that the Prime Minister himself has cautioned us not to believe everything he says in the heat of discussion and that we should only take heed of his prepared, scripted remarks. So, maybe, in this case Mr Abbott got carried away with political pointscoring. It certainly would not be the first time he has let political convenience come before the truth. After all, the Prime Minister has also said in the past that it makes sense to have an ETS 'to take precautions against significant risks', so it is difficult to determine what he actually believes.


But, before we give the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt, we need to ask ourselves a few questions. Firstly, would a government that truly believed in climate change make it one of its first priorities in power to abolish the Climate Commission, which was established to provide the nation with vital information on the effects of and potential solutions to global warming? Would a government that is truly committed to reversing climate change turn its back on the United Nations climate change conference, which contributed to Australia winning the 2013 'Colossal Fossil' award from the Climate Action Network? And would a government that accepts the serious risks that face the globe if we do not act on climate change attempt to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation? This body, as has been said here previously, has leveraged an impressive $1.5 billion worth of private sector investment in clean energy projects and, in doing so, has cut 3.9 million tonnes of damaging carbon from our atmosphere. Even more importantly—and this is the kicker—this activity has also brought a return of seven per cent to government coffers. This would result in $200 million a year of pure profit. But, despite all common sense and, indeed, fiscal responsibility, the government persists in its bloody-minded plan to shut down this important body. Finally, we need to ask whether a government that is honest about its intention to cut carbon output would replace the almost universally accepted mechanism of pricing carbon with a direct action scheme that has been recognised as a dud by policymakers, scientists and economists alike. These questions are exactly what we are considering today in the bill that is before us.


We also need to consider this 'policy' of direct action, because what the government have given us to date barely qualifies for this description. Despite the fact that the government first announced Direct Action in 2010, in the intervening three years it came up with little more than thought bubbles as to how it could funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to polluters and rip away all the economy-wide incentives for investment in green, energy efficient projects. In order to cover up this lack of policy, Mr Hunt tried to slip out a vague, undetailed 'green paper' on the Friday afternoon before Christmas. Presumably he hoped it would fly under the media radar and public scrutiny could be avoided.


Currently, I serve as the Chair of the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee, which has recently been charged with considering the impacts of the government's direct action policy. The inquiry has received more than 100 submissions from across the country, and the overwhelming message we are getting is that the Direct Action Plan is simply not up to the task; it is expensive, is riddled with design problems and will not come close to meeting Australia's carbon emission reduction targets. In fact, the committee is yet to hear evidence from one single witness who is willing to support direct action as an effective or appropriate stand-alone solution to address climate change.


To meet our commitment of reducing Australia's carbon output by five per cent by 2020, the government has allocated $1.55 billion over three years, but modelling by SKM MMA and Monash University has shown that this falls $4 billion short of what will be needed. This leaves the government with three options: change the policy to a more cost-effective one, increase funding or fail at meeting the five per cent reduction target. The government has been very clear that it will not change the policy and even clearer that there will not be any more money on the table. Unfortunately, this all but guarantees that Australia will not meet its carbon reduction target.


One key failing of Direct Action is that it throws away the widely accepted market based model of 'polluter pays', in favour of an underresourced 'taxpayer pays the polluter' plan. This is very curious when you consider that the environment minister himself penned a graduate thesis entitled 'A tax to make the polluter pay', proving he fully understands the effectiveness of a broad based market pricing that places the burden of pollution on the polluter, rather than on the taxpayer. When interviewed on the topic in 2010, Minister Hunt reiterated this position, saying:


My support has always been for two things. And this is a life-long commitment back to my thesis. And that is firstly, to reduce emissions. And secondly, to use economic instruments to do that.


Despite this, Minister Hunt seems to have turned his back on years of learning to champion the Emissions Reduction Fund, where the government will pay organisations to undertake projects intended to reduce carbon emissions.


Pollution is a waste output of business like any other. Just as we would not expect someone else to pay to dispose of the skip bins of rubbish that any business generates, it is quite unfair to require the taxpayer to pick up the tab for big business and their carbon outputs. Unfortunately, this direct action policy also has some serious design flaws which open it up to being 'gamed' by big polluters. Firstly, it is very difficult to determine what a business would have done anyway as part of its normal operations. It is easy to envisage a scenario where a company could secure government funds to do something that it planned to do all along. And, perversely, businesses that have already reduced their carbon output could be penalised because they will be starting from a lower baseline, despite taking responsible and very effective action earlier. But, worse than this, the government has already pointed to a 'flexible' approach where there will be no penalties for not meeting the required carbon abatement. It has been made clear that the government will not penalise organisations for 'business as usual' operations—even if 'business as usual' pumps out tens of thousands of tonnes of polluting carbon dioxide.


In this context, it is not surprising that the government has completely done away with the national cap on emissions, as there is no chance of meeting any meaningful target through Direct Action. In fact, the Climate Institute tells us that, far from helping to mitigate climate change, Direct Action will actually result in an increase in carbon emissions of eight to 10 per cent on year 2000 levels. According to Climate Institute modelling, if other countries followed the Abbott government's policy lead, the world would be on track for a catastrophic rise of up to 6.5 degrees Centigrade by the end of the century. For Australia, this would mean a five-fold increase in droughts in southern Australia, the virtual destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, forced abandonment of many coastal communities and a 90 per cent reduction in agricultural production from the Murray-Darling region. Another problem of Direct Action is that it is completely silent on what will happen post 2020. We simply do not know. This creates serious uncertainty in the business community and threatens the viability of long-term investment planning, particularly as many projects would have a time line extending well beyond that of the policy itself. 


With the removal of the broad based carbon price, the government is removing the financial incentive for businesses to invest in low-carbon solutions. By doing this, it is essentially subsidising fossil fuels at the expense of clean, renewable energy. While the rest of the world is embracing the transition to low-carbon economies, Australia may find itself an economic and environmental backwater through the government's determination to cling to last century's technology. In fact, the GLOBE Climate Legislation Study which was released last week highlighted how far Australia is falling behind the rest of the world in this area. This study of 66 countries across the globe found Australia is the only country to be taking negative legislative action on climate policy. Only three months ago, China's second-largest province, which has a population of over 100 million, introduced the world's second-largest emissions trading scheme. Meanwhile, Australia stands alone as the only country currently that is dismantling a market based approach to minimising climate change. It is very hard to believe that these are the actions of a government that is truly committed to avoiding the damaging environmental and economic impacts of climate change.


Today, we are looking at a bill that threatens to turn back the clock on the advances this country has made toward meeting our ethical obligations to future generations and replace them with a widely derided option that will do nothing but line the pockets of big polluters. This is a bill that, if passed, will undoubtedly set us on a reckless path and abrogate our responsibility to protect the planet from the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. Well, I refuse to stand with this government on the wrong side of history. Instead, I will stand with the 87 per cent of Australians who believe that the target to reduce Australia's carbon emissions by five per cent by 2020 is either on the mark or does not go far enough. And I will stand on the side of the sheer weight of scientific evidence which tells us that we are heading down a perilous road if we ignore it. This is why I refuse to support this bill. Instead, I support replacing the carbon tax with an emissions trading scheme, which will help us to fulfil our responsibility to the international community and generations to come.


It is important to point out at this stage that the current government has long engaged in irresponsible myth-making about carbon pricing. Despite the Prime Minister's rantings about the carbon tax in recent years, it did not 'take a wrecking ball to the economy'. In fact, the economic impact of the carbon tax was determined by experts to be less than 0.7 per cent. And, even though we had a carbon tax, the economy continued to grow, jobs continued to be created and we registered an impressive growth in national wealth. At the same time, a fair compensation package was put in place to ensure that Australians earning under $80,000 a year would suffer no negative financial impacts as a result of the carbon tax. That is hardly a wrecking ball, from anyone's perspective.


At the same time, the carbon tax resulted in an 8.4 per cent drop in carbon emissions from the electricity sector in its first six months. That is a very tangible drop of 7.5 million tonnes of carbon when compared to the same half of 2011. However, in Labor we recognise that the economy may have some difficult times ahead. This is why we believe that an emissions trading scheme will strike the right balance between protecting the economy and meeting our obligations to reduce carbon output. The proposed scheme would put a floating price on carbon from 1 July. Notably, it would also reduce the economic imposts on business, industry and Australian families, as the carbon price would drop from the current $25.40 a tonne to the standard European floating price, which is around $6 a tonne.


As policymakers, one of our primary responsibilities is to recognise problems and find sensible, evidence based solutions to them. At the moment, we have a very serious problem facing us. We only need to look at the serious weather events occurring across the globe to realise that lip-service and token gestures from those opposite simply will not cut it. From the heartbreaking bushfires in New South Wales to the devastation wrought on the Philippines by Typhoon Haiyan, there is little doubt that the weather is changing. Experts across the globe who have devoted their lives to the study of climate are unanimous in warning us that if we do not act to decrease carbon emissions, these sorts of extreme weather events will only escalate in scale and regularity. Experts have also told us that the most sensible, effective policy solution to the problem is to put a price on carbon and that so-called direct action schemes are expensive and ineffective.


So we stand here at an important junction in history. Do we take the responsible path of putting an effective, evidence based response to the problem of climate change in place? I have worked closely with people on both sides of this place, and I have to say that there are many on the other side that I believe to be rational, intelligent and ethical. I know where I stand on this, and I urge these more sensible members of the government to lobby their short-sighted leader to reconsider this regressive, irresponsible action so future generations do not have to pay the price for their flat-earth-type thinking.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (13:37):  I am proud to stand here today and say as the last speaker that, like the rest of my party room, I will not be voting for these carbon tax bills. What we are voting on today is one of the bravest, most significant and most necessary structural reforms this country has seen in decades. We are taking a leadership role and the rest of the world will follow suit if we can reduce global emissions. It is at times like these that I cannot help but reflect on the fact that six years ago I was sitting in front of a computer at the University of Tasmania after I was asked to put together a course in environmental finance. At that stage no other university had looked at doing a specific course in environmental finance and how we could use financial markets to help mitigate environmental damage. It is quite ironic that I am standing here in the Senate today, having taken 12 months to pull together all the simple things to teach students how we can counteract a problem such as global warming, and all the best policy advice available is being thrown out the door by a government that is supposed to understand markets and understand business.


Let me start at the beginning. Carbon dioxide, like other greenhouse gases, is pollution. That might be the very first line you type on your first slide that you are going to show your students. If you do not believe that, if you do not get passed that first line, then there is no point progressing with the rest of the course. Carbon dioxide is pollution.


It was interesting hearing Senator Eggleston yesterday talk about historical instances of carbon dioxide pollution leading to periods of global warming. We are well aware of that from climate records, but that does not abrogate the importance of carbon dioxide in today's age. It actually supports the argument that CO2 is a greenhouse gas that can lead to runaway climate change and all the negative impacts we see on our ecosystems and on our future economy.


If it is pollution, it is what economists call an externality—that is, something produced by a company that is having a negative impact is not being reflected in the costs of production of that good. We also know from well-established theory that markets fail. Markets do not always price things well. They do price some things well, but they do not price things like pollution well, so there is an important role for government to step in and fill the externality gap by levering things such as taxes or excises on pollution.


In the last two days we have heard a lot from the CEO of Virgin talking about the impact of the carbon tax. Apart from the fact that he and Qantas signed up lobbying to be included in the price on carbon scheme, we have not heard anything about the excise that has long been levied on aviation fuel or other fuels in this country. What we hear about is the so-called carbon tax and the damage that has done to the profits of a company like Virgin. It was interesting also to see in estimates last week Qantas very clearly saying that the carbon tax was not the issue, whereas we have seen the Prime Minister and our Liberal cohorts in the last two days running the populist line that somehow the carbon tax has destroyed Qantas. I will get back to that in a minute.


This price on carbon, and its accepted theory to price pollution, is designed to transition industries away from pollution to cleaner forms of production. It does not just have to be electricity; there are a lot of other things that we leverage market based instruments on. That is why we call them market based instruments. We are transitioning in this country, and certainly in my state of Tasmania, which has 86 per cent renewable energy, from dirty energy to clean energy. Along the way we have created tens of thousands of new jobs in investment and innovation in this country. I have not heard that mentioned once by anyone on the other side of the chamber in all of the debate.


Yes, a scheme like this will have its costs and it may have design flaws that need to be changed. It will also have risks. It is our job in government to manage those costs and to manage those risks. Getting back to the first line that I am typing for my students, if you do not accept that CO2 is pollution then I can say to you—and I did say this to some students—you do not have to have proof to be prudent in finance. That is what the insurance industry is based on. I do not know if I am going to be run over by a car and killed but I have life insurance anyway because, if I do, it will be catastrophic for my family. I insure my house in case someone breaks in and I insure my car in case I have an accident. It is called managing risk. It is the insurance industry that has driven action on climate change since the 1980s, because it is the only industry pricing the risk of climate change, not just to households and individuals but to businesses and industries.


So taking strong and effective action on climate change—and I emphasise action that is effective—is an insurance policy in itself. That is what climate action is. I say to people who do not necessarily believe in CO2 being pollution that leads to global warming, where does the balance of risks lie? Would you put your money on it if you had to make a bet based on the available evidence? Isn't it prudent to manage our risks? Yes, it is. We need strong action on climate change because it is an insurance policy for the future of our grandchildren, as Senator Cameron so eloquently pointed out. But it is a lot more than that; it is also important for our economy.


So the crisis we face today—and I stress it is a crisis—could not have been more clearly highlighted than by CSIRO this morning when they put out their definitive report on observed changes in the long-term trends in Australia's climate. I will read to you from the section 'Future climate scenarios for Australia'. It says:


Australian temperatures are projected to continue to increase, with more hot days and fewer cool days.


Interestingly, the CSIRO's conclusion is the same as that of the Bureau of Meteorology in answer to a question from Senator Ruston during estimates. According to the report:


Seven of the ten warmest years on record have occurred since 1998.


Over the past 15 years, the frequency of very warm months has increased five-fold and the frequency of very cool months has declined by around a third, compared to 1951–1980.


The report goes on:


A further increase in the number of extreme fire-weather days is expected in southern and eastern Australia, with a longer fire season in these regions.


Average rainfall in southern Australia is projected to decrease, with a likely increase in drought frequency and severity.


The frequency and intensity of extreme daily rainfall is projected to increase.


Tropical cyclones are projected to decrease in number but increase in intensity.


Projected sea-level rise will increase the frequency of extreme sea-level events. 


When I read that I understand that it is talking about the future—my future and the future of my kids. When I read that I see that it spells cost—the cost of living in this country under climate change, not the cost of my bloody electricity bills this month or next month. This is the CSIRO talking about the potential catastrophe under a future of climate change if we do not take action. We have just given billions of dollars to farmers because of drought. I have no doubt they need it, but how many more billions of dollars will go to them? How many more billions of dollars are we going to have to spend on mitigation strategies for bushfire risk or for rising sea levels? It is interesting, I have never heard the cost of climate change mentioned by the other side of the chamber in this debate. But there it is; that is what we have to do something about, folks. It is clear as daylight.


So why are we standing here today debating whether these bills should be scrapped? There are three good reasons that I can identify. The first is the zombie spin that we saw from the Abbott government in the lead-up to the last election. Once again, Senator Cameron pointed out very eloquently the impact that the short-sighted, offensive, cynical, political opportunism of Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, has had on the debate. I cannot think of a better example than that of Qantas. Qantas is in trouble, workers jobs are at risk, and it is the fault of the carbon tax again! The second thing I can identify is ideology, pure and simple. I was reading the IPA website last night, looking at its freedom index. I have no doubt that that is now a layer that we have to deal with under this new government: how well new regulations or policies impact the IPA's freedom index. Sometimes I cannot help thinking that their ideology has bred pure spite in the attempt to cancel some of these bills, especially that dealing with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Lastly, it is about special interests, about the big end of town, about being puppets on a string, having the IPA, the Business Council of Australia and the other large, vested interests in this country dictating your policy.


Let us consider the carbon tax bills specifically. The cheer squad—the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and the Minerals Council of Australia—is very clear. The Australian says, 'Industry calls for swift repeal of carbon tax.' I wonder why, considering that only 0.1 per cent of Australian businesses are liable to pay the carbon price and that four companies, concentrated in a very small number of industries, alone pay nearly 50 per cent of Australia's carbon liability! This demonstrates how the big polluters, as Al Gore recently in Australia articulated so clearly on 7.30 Report, have hijacked our democracy. They are driving the government's agenda and, sadly, potentially our national legislation. I would like to quote from an article by Ross Gittins, in the Sydney Morning Herald, that I really enjoyed. It is entitled 'We're now a nation of rent-seekers.' He says:


Professor Ross Garnaut has argued that Australia is unlikely to see another era of extensive micro-economic reform because of the growth in rent-seeking behaviour since the days of the Hawke-Keating government.


…   …   …


What gets me is how blatantly self-seeking our lobby groups have become. It is as if the era of economic rationalism - with its belief that the economy is driven by self-interest - has sanctified selfishness and refusal to co-operate for the common good.


He goes on to say:


It's finally dawning on people that major and genuine reform—


which the carbon-pricing scheme is—


requires a degree of bipartisanship at the political level and a spirit of give and take on the part of powerful interest groups. But these prerequisites are further away than ever.


Instead what we get is lowest-common-denominator politics from the pollies and rent-seeking posing as ''reform'' from the interest groups.


He goes on to mention the various business lobbies that have a significant interest in investing to have this legislation changed.


I used to teach the special-interest model and the special-interest effect to students. It is probably a bit difficult to talk about in the time I have remaining, but we all understand that lobby groups play a role in democracy—they get in the ear of decision makers. But they also make the decisions that we as decision makers make very clear. They make the benefits and the costs to us very clear. They can donate to political parties. They can threaten to advertise against you in aggressive advertising campaigns. There is no clearer example of that than with Labor's change of view on the mining tax. I have seen it also with Coca-Cola and the Australian Beverages Council aggressively advertising against national recycling schemes such as a bottle bill. We face these trade-offs. Do we take on special interests and risk getting a backlash from voters? Unfortunately, most voters in this country do not have the time or the energy to invest in fully understanding legislation and how important it is. That is our job as government to do. That is why special interests win. They can concentrate very powerfully the benefits and costs to decision makers, and decision makers know that the general public have lots of things on their mind when they go to the ballot box. That is why it is a con to say that this government has a mandate on the carbon tax, on the mining tax, on turning back the boats or on anything that I have heard in this chamber—you suddenly have a mandate on it. How many Australians go to the polling booth understanding those policies and voting specifically on those? It is my view that people voted for a change at the last election—I do not doubt that—but that was because of the circus that we saw from the Labor Party. I have a very clear view on this—we call it the rational ignorance of voters. There are a multitude of factors that go into decision making when people vote in an election. Unfortunately, once again, it is why special interests get away with dictating government policy. 


What about the positive interests that support renewable energy? The Australian Cleantech Review in 2013 estimated at least 53,000 Australians are currently working in the cleantech sector, with strong growth since 2009. Modelling by several organisations, including Austrade, shows that current renewable energy targets in combination with other elements of the clean energy package, including a price on carbon, will deliver $20 billion of investment in renewable energy by 2020. Tasmania, my state, is nearly 100 per cent renewable and receives a $100 million dividend from the price on carbon. I am yet to see any politician, especially not a politician from Tasmania, say how my state will be compensated. One hundred million dollars a year from a price on carbon—because we export clean energy—is 12½ per cent of non-Canberra revenues to the state government. How are we going to be compensated for that? Solar PV accounts for 18,500 jobs and $8 billion in private investment; it is a growth sector. With traditional industries around this country failing—with the car manufacturing sector pulling out of the country, with farmers needing more handouts and with the collapse and troubles experienced by commodity industries, for example, SPC—how are we going to invest in the new jobs of the future? Where are we going get this innovation from? Senator Conroy is here—at least he has done something for this country with the NBN. How are we going to build the industries of the future? I can tell you we have one here now, and it is called clean energy. 


The government talk about sovereign risk. I have never seen a worse example of sovereign risk than what the Liberal Party has done to the clean energy sector over the last four years. There is nothing business hates more than uncertainty. 




Senator Back:
  You and Labor were in government for the last four years!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Businesses factor in costs and are forward-looking, as you well know, Senator Back. All you have done is pull the carpet out from underneath one of the future growth drivers of this country. How are you going to replace it? The price on carbon acts as a catalyst for transitioning this country to a clean energy future and we are the only party that has shown leadership on this issue. Let us talk a little bit about leadership. Lord Deben, the head of the UK Committee on Climate Change, and a Tory politician, has slammed the Abbott government's push to pull back climate change policies:


It lets down the whole British tradition that a country should have become so selfish about this issue that it’s prepared to spoil the efforts of others and to foil what very much less rich countries are doing … All that pollution which Australia is pushing into the atmosphere is of course changing my climate. It’s a real insult to the sovereignty of other countries … It’s wholly contrary to the science, it’s wholly contradictory to the interests of Australia and I hope that many people in Australia will see when the rest of the world is going in the right direction what nonsense it is for them to be going backwards.


Tory politician! Senator Macdonald is not in here, but I challenged him in the House the other day when he said, 'I have yet to have anyone from that side of the chamber say to me why us cutting our small contribution to global warming is making a difference.' It is making a difference because this country has shown leadership and conviction, and it comes at a very small sacrifice considering what previous generations of this country have had to sacrifice for us. Accepting a $1 or $2 increase on an airfare as a result of the carbon price, or a small increase in my electricity bills, is hardly a sacrifice when we are talking about long-term structural reform. It is long-term structural reform in order to do the right thing for my children and for future generations of this country—not to mention the animals that live in our ecosystem and our oceans and the ecosystem services that support life on this planet.


This is the biggest structural reform this country has seen in decades, and I and the rest of my party will not stand by idly while the government tries to pull the carpet out from under the feet of my children and future generations of Australians.

Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (13:57):  I was the first person who ever queried the carbon tax, when I asked the first question about it on 26 August 2008. How one small voice can change the world if you are persistent! I have sat here for the past three weeks while thousands and thousands of jobs have disappeared, while people on the other side have read speeches presented to them. Those speeches may as well have been in Swahili for all they know about it—they have dutifully read out those speeches word for word, and meanwhile the jobs have been evaporating in front of them. The Labor Party have been filibustering and putting cost on cost on business.




Senator Wong:
  How many jobs have been lost since you got into government?




Senator BOSWELL:
  How you can sit there and say that you are representatives of the working people has got me beat. I can understand the Greens—that is their knitting; that is what they should stick to. But how the Labor Party get sucked into this is beyond me. If you do not believe me, how about believing Paul Howes? Paul Howes has said the cost of energy is killing our manufacturing industry. Do not believe me, believe the president of the AWU, or the ACTU—




Senator Cameron:
  He's something; he's just something!




Senator BOSWELL:
  He is certainly better than you, because he does stand up for something whereas you just bend your knee at the altar of the Greens, Senator Cameron. You have never stuck up for the working man as long as I have been here. For as long as I have been here you have knelt, you have genuflected, you have bowed to the Greens and you have kissed the floor they walk on. That is what you have done.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:31):  In my concluding remarks yesterday on why the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 should not be passed, I was sharing with my colleagues some of the very moving comments I have received from people who have a very clear understanding of how important the carbon tax is and why we need to retain it and build with real carbon action. I just want to share a few more of those comments. Lynnette Oakley is one of the more than 6,000 people who signed just one of the petitions calling for these bills to be retained. Interestingly, she spoke of her concerns about the people of Kiribati. She said: 'I have been visiting the nation of Kiribati on the equator for 10 years. Over that time there have been very noticeable changes.' She went on to detail how disturbing she found the impacts that climate change is having on people.


Noela Kelman came to one of the recent rallies about the importance of these bills. She said:


The future of my children and grandchildren and the wellbeing of all future generations are in our hands—such responsibility must be shouldered and fought for. I have recycled, reduced, reused for decades but much more is needed.


And someone many of my colleagues would know very warmly is Gosta Lynga. He is now living in Canberra. He is a former Swedish parliamentarian who historically was part of the introduction of a carbon tax in his native city over 12 years ago. He said:


I have been able to follow the effect in Sweden on the use of less polluting fuels, on the move towards more sustainable energy … and consequently on the decrease in atmospheric pollution due to carbon dioxide from Swedish sources. This has been encouraging.


I have also seen how ever more countries around the world are taking their share of responsibility for what is a global problem with possibly devastating consequences. There can no longer be any doubt that the observed increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is causing dangerous global warming and that the increase is caused by human pollution sources.


Based on these facts I am sad that the Australian government is now contemplating backwards steps. 


And that sums up so many of the comments that my offices receive and that people raise with me formally and informally. People are very distressed about what this government is doing. They understand how important urgent climate change action is. They also know that renewable energy is industrially and commercially viable, that we need a government with courage, with the political will to work with communities across this country on the transition to a clean future that we so urgently need.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2014-03-04,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (12:34):  I rise to make my contribution to this debate on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 and related bills. Senator Rhiannon just referred to courage. Why didn't your alliance partners, before the 2010 election, have the courage to say that if they won the election they would introduce a carbon tax, instead of saying, 'We will not introduce a carbon tax'? The Australian people were quite clear, when they voted on 7 September last year, that if the coalition were elected to government the carbon tax would be removed.


Let me make a few points. I find it amazing that a debate that started in the final sitting weeks of 2013 could still be going on here today in 2014, well into March. But the government has been prepared to let Labor and the Greens continue filibustering to delay the inevitable. I have heard some amazing contributions over these weeks, but I would like to quote a section of Senator Ludlam's speech. This is quite amazing. He said:


People like Jon Moylan and others are stepping up to stop the Maules Creek coalmine and protect the Leard State Forest in New South Wales.


I have a question: is this the same Jon Moylan who is facing criminal charges over the fake ANZ bank press release? Is it the same Jon Moylan whose actions temporarily wiped $300 million off Whitehaven's market capitalisation?


Well, Mr Jon Moylan will soon have his day in court. ASIC, to its credit—and I have thrown plenty of criticism at ASIC before today—has brought one charge under the Corporations Act, to which Mr Moylan has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is set down for 20 June. ASIC quite rightly points out that a hoax could have significant market impact, but the fact that mum and dad investors could have lost money does not faze Senator Ludlam—or of course the Greens as a whole. So here is Senator Ludlam giving Mr Moylan a pat on the back—and even Senator Rhiannon tweeted her congratulations at the time. It proves again that, when you are engaged in civil disobedience, the Greens will be there cheering you on.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  What did I say, Whacka?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I don't know what you said, Senator Whish-Wilson.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senators, no speaking across the chamber.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Senator Wright referred to the drought package announced last week by Prime Minister Abbott and the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Barnaby Joyce. Sure, it has been dry in many parts of Australia—and of course the Greens start wringing their hands and scream 'climate change'—but there have been droughts every decade and climate change was not even thought or talked of. We can go back to the big drought of 1895 to 1907.


Let's get back to the debate and look at what business says about the carbon tax—to August 2013, in Fernvale Queensland and the business Zanow Sand and Gravel. Manager Brad Zanow said overheads had risen by $15,000 a month and that the carbon tax had led to an increase in electricity bills as well as the cost of oil, cement powder and air-conditioning gas. Mr Zanow said the business had shed five of its 58 staff. In December 2012 Grain Products Australia, based in Tamworth—I visited this factory in recent times, prior to this—went into administration citing increased electricity charges as one of the reasons it was in financial trouble. The $1.2 million increase in energy costs was blamed on network charges, environmental issues and—you guessed it—the carbon tax.


In February 2014 Virgin Australia boss John Borghetti said the best thing the government and Labor could do for airlines would be to scrap the carbon tax. Virgin Australia suffered an $83 million loss to the end of December last year and Mr Borghetti said the carbon tax has cost the airline industry hundreds of millions of dollars. These figures are thrown around—the carbon tax cost Qantas $106 million last year and Virgin Airlines more than $50 million. Isn't it amazing that, when the previous government and their strange alliance brought this tax in, they put it on the airlines in Australia but not those that fly internationally?


I want to make another point. Out in most large rural areas we have crop dusters—small airplanes for spreading fertilizer and often chemical spraying for weeds in crops. I was speaking to a gentleman just recently who owns a crop-dusting business. The carbon tax component of the fuel for his airplanes has cost him $60,000. Here are graziers, spreading fertilizer to encourage growth in our natural pastures and improved pastures, and when they grow they actually absorb CO2, they carry more stock and they grow more food to feed people in Australia and around the world. But this crazy tax we are trying to abolish is taxing this crop-dusting company $60,000 a year. Of course a grazier says, 'Well, I'll budget $30,000 for the spreading of fertilizer this year'—so he or she will spend the $30,000. Because there are higher spreading costs for the fuel for those aircraft, they actually spread less fertilizer.


Tourism Accommodation Australia estimates the cost of the carbon tax on the sector would be $115 million in the first year alone. Macquarie Generation, in the Hunter Valley, which operates the Liddell and Bayswater power stations—I am sure many would be well aware of those generators—had a carbon tax bill to 30 June last year that was a massive $460 million. And what did they do? They just passed it on to the consumer.


This is the broadest, largest price on carbon in the world. Here we are trying to compete in the world markets, with other countries that have nowhere near the costs of these so-called environmental taxes, and we are losing our competitive edge. It is as simple as that.


I am the first to say that the environment is probably the most important thing we have to protect for future generations, especially our lands and our soils that have to grow the food—but this tax goes nowhere near doing any of that. In fact, if you want to look after the environment I suggest you look at a map of Australia. At a guess I would say that 55, 60 or perhaps 65 per cent of our whole nation is in the hands of farmers, graziers and pastoralists. The best way we can look after that environment is to see that the people running those properties actually make a living and have money in their pockets. Without money they are forced, if I can put it this way, to mine their country instead of farm their country—or perhaps overcrop it or overstock it to try to stay financially viable.


The best way we can look after our environment is to see we have strong financial landowners. We had a terrible run with the previous government's ridiculous decision, supported by the Greens, to ban the live export of cattle to Indonesia. Now, thankfully, this government—and I commend Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, for this—have gone back to Indonesia and stimulated the export of cattle once more. In September 2013 OECD research backed the coalition's claims that 'Australia's pioneering carbon pricing is damaging its competitiveness'. So we have the OECD agreeing with what I just said.


Let's talk briefly about the weather—because the Greens have been in here waffling on about heatwaves and droughts. I will quote from an article of 22 October:


The Blue Mountains bushfire crisis was the result of a lack of political leadership and had nothing to do with climate change, one of Australia's foremost disaster management experts said. David Packham, a former Deputy Director of the Australian Counter Disaster College, said linking the NSW fire disaster with global warming was nonsense. Mr. Packham previously accused latte conservationists of having too much influence on forest management. 


This is the argument I have made many times in this place: if you lock up country and leave it in the form of national parks then the grass grows, the lightning strikes, the fires get going and the damage is enormous. It is not conservation; it is destroying those areas that are not managed. Until I leave this place and go to my grave, whenever that is, I will say: you must manage country. This is one of the serious problems we face with the serious bushfires, in national parks especially, with huge fuel loads—and that is not helping our environment one bit. As I said, if we want to help our environment, get our business sector strong and get our farmers financially strong so they can spend the money on the environment.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:44):  I rise to oppose the repeal of the clean energy bills. I do this for a number of reasons, but for the life of me I cannot accept a proposition based on a scare campaign run by the coalition, who are now in government—a scare campaign where we take short-term approaches and do not look at the long-term challenges for this country. I will quote someone I do not normally quote, although I have used this quote before; it is by the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies. In a radio broadcast on 24 July 1942, Sir Robert Menzies had this to say of his Liberal creed:


Nothing could be worse for democracy than to adopt the practice of permitting knowledge to be overthrown by ignorance.


If there has ever been an example of knowledge being overthrown by ignorance, the debate on climate change is ignorance overthrowing knowledge. He went on to say:


If I have honestly and thoughtfully arrived at a certain conclusion on a public question and my electors disagree with me, my first duty is to endeavour to persuade them that my view is right.


I will come to what the current Prime Minister's view was in relation to climate change. I will come to his view on how you best deal with climate change. But let me say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is certainly not taking the advice of Sir Robert Menzies on how you deal with an issue you believe in. Robert Menzies continued:


If I fail in this, my second duty will be to accept the electoral consequences and not to run away from them. Fear can never be a proper or useful ingredient in those mutual relations of respect and good-will which ought to exist between the elector and the elected.


I honestly think that what has happened with the coalition is that fear has been used continually by them in relation to climate change. For short-term political gain, they have used fear as a weapon to try to destroy the scientific base of this issue and to destroy an unarguable environmental case. That is not what the creed of the Liberal Party was and it is certainly not what Sir Robert Menzies was arguing in those days. He went on:


And so, as we think about it we shall find more and more how disfiguring a thing fear is in our own political and social life.


It has not bothered those on the other side that this creed of rejecting fear as a political weapon is the creed that was put forward by Sir Robert Menzies. They have used it mercilessly in pursuit of short-term political gain at the expense of long-term management of what is one of the biggest social, economic and moral issues this country has ever faced.


Menzies went on to say:


Men fear the unknown as children fear the dark. It is that kind of fear which too often restrains experiment and keeps us from innovations which might benefit us enormously.


What could be clearer in terms of benefit than putting a price on carbon to make sure that future generations get a fair go from this generation? What could be clearer? The experiment that was proposed—putting a price on carbon—has just been rejected. It is not so much an experiment—I think it is clear that the majority of environmental scientists and the majority of economists say that that is the way to go.


Sir Robert Menzies said:


It is the fear of knowledge which prevents so many of us from really using our minds, and which makes so many of us ready slaves to cheap and silly slogans and catch-cries.


Doesn't that say it all? Cheap and silly slogans and catchcries in place of critical analysis of the problem, scientific understanding of the problem and environmental understanding of the consequences of global warming.


He said:


It is the fear of life and its problems which makes so many of us yearn for nothing so much as some safe billet from which risk and its twin brother enterprise are alike abolished.


So Sir Robert Menzies, not one of my pin-up boys in politics, really had nailed this position. I suppose if Sir Robert Menzies were around now he would be looking at the cheap and silly slogans and the catchcries from the opposition and shake his head and wonder where his party has gone. I can tell where the party has gone. The party has really gone to the bottom, where it is short-termism over the long term.


My view is that these bills before us now are the triumph of the barbarians in the Liberal Party over those who would want to hold onto that political heritage. The barbarians in the party have rejected the political heritage of Sir Robert Menzies. You just have to look at the Prime Minister's position. As he told Malcolm Turnbull, he is a weathervane on climate change. He will just stick his hand up, see which way the wind is blowing and then take a position. On 18 December 2008 he supported an ETS:


An emissions trading scheme probably is the best way to put a price on carbon …


But seven months later he was supporting a carbon tax. On 10 July he said:


I suspect that a straight carbon tax or charge could be more transparent and easier to change if conditions change or our understanding of the science changes.


Two weeks later, he was back supporting an ETS. He said:


There is much to be said for an emissions trading scheme. It was, after all, the mechanism for emission reduction ultimately chosen by the Howard government. It enables an increasing market price to be set for carbon through capping volumes of emissions.


Then in December 2010 he was against both an ETS and a carbon tax. Something was in the wind. Maybe it was the leadership of the Liberal Party. One minute he was supporting a carbon tax, one minute he was supporting a carbon price, and then in December 2010 he was saying, 'One of the reasons the coalition is so much against carbon taxes and emission trading schemes is that they are not going to help the environment, but, by gee, there'll be a huge whack on everyone's cost of living.' Well, wasn't Sir Menzies right? Here comes the fear campaign. That was the fear campaign starting on behalf of the coalition.


On the same day in July 2009 when he indicated support for an ETS, he said he was unconvinced by climate science. He said:


I am, as you know, hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have significantly increased since the spread of industrialisation, but it seems that noticeable warming has only taken place between the 1970s and 1990s.


Anyone who has had even a very shallow look at the scientific facts would know that that is a political position, not one based on science.


Six months later, suddenly humans do cause climate change. On the ABC Radio 702, he said, 'I think human activity certainly does impact on climate.' A year later he said human activity is still contributing: 'I think climate change is real' and 'humanity makes a contribution to it'. But a week later, on 14 March, he is back to being unsure about climate science. He said:


I don't think we can say that the science is settled here.


There is no doubt that we should do our best to rest lightly on the planet and there is no doubt that we should do our best to emit as few waste products as possible, but, having said that, whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out … is not yet proven.


That is just a nonsense. That is a political argument. It is not based on the science that is before this parliament.


Mr Abbott simply cannot be believed on his climate change policy—and calling Direct Action a policy is probably overstating it. The truth is that many on the Liberal side do not believe in the science. They are antiscience, and Mr Abbott just does not have the courage to tell the public what he really thinks, so he jumps from one position to another continually.


Let's deal with the science. We have heard contributions from coalition senators here over a period of time trying to say, 'I actually believe in the science, but we're not really sure that it is anthropocentric—



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator, that is human caused carbon pollution, and that is what he needs to understand. What do key scientists at the CSIRO say? They say:


Climate change is the greatest ecological, economic, and social challenge of our time.


Those are the people who we pay to provide us with scientific knowledge on the issues confronting Australia. The scientists at the CSIRO have an international reputation. I heard one Liberal senator here saying that the people who are supporting climate change in the scientific community are low-level scientists. You cannot say that about the CSIRO. You cannot say that about the Bureau of Meteorology. You cannot say that about the Australian scientists who are involved in this. They are amongst the best in the world and that is why the world listens to them when they talk on these issues. The only people who are not listening to our scientists are the coalition—the climate sceptics and the climate deniers on the other side.


The Australian Academy of Science has said that this is an issue that has to be dealt with and that we need to deal with it quickly. Global sea levels are currently rising. There is a great deal of evidence that the earth's climate has warmed. Global average temperatures have risen in line with the climate model projections. The models have been done—some of the most sophisticated computer modelling ever in the world—and they are clearly indicating that temperatures are rising. What is happening in practice around the world is consistent with those climate model projections.


So climate change is already visible. That is the message. Southern and eastern Australia's water supply reliability is expected to decline. It is the CSIRO saying this. It is not some politician standing here saying that this is what is going to happen; it is our scientific community—the experts in the science of climate change. They say 'development and population growth in Australia’s coastal regions will exacerbate risks from sea-level rise' and that there will be 'significant loss of unique Australian animal and plant species' across the country. They say there is a risk to infrastructure, including the failure of urban drainage and sewerage systems, and that more blackouts, transport disruption and greater building damage will all have to be dealt with.


These are not scare campaigns as they are dressed up by the tactics group of the coalition; this is what the scientists are telling us about climate change. I want my grandkids to have the same rights and privileges I had. That is the right to have a country where we are not facing these calamitous environmental issues.


The scientists go on to say that:


Heatwaves, storms and floods are likely to have a direct impact on the health of Australians … Moderate warming in the absence of rainfall declines can be beneficial to some agricultural crops … However, these positive effects can be offset by changes in temperature, rainfall, pests, and the availability of nutrients. Production from cropping and livestock is projected to decline over much of southern Australia, as is the quality of grain, grape, vegetable, fruit, and other crops.


What I just cannot believe is when the National Party in this place, the people who should be warning their constituencies about the effects of climate change, deny that it is happening and go out and perpetrate the lies and nonsense that we have seen in the political debate in this country. I cannot understand why, if you are depending on the land, you would not accept the science. But that seems to be what is happening.


The other argument we hear is that it is all going to send industry broke. There is a document called Cleaning up: Australia's readiness for a low-carbon future. This was done in 2012. It was not done by the Greens. It was not done by the Labor Party. It was done by the Economist Intelligence Unit ofThe Economist—the bible for the economic dries around the world. It did a case study on Wesfarmers. Wesfarmers, it said:


… will be among the companies most heavily affected by the new carbon price scheme.


Aside from power stations, Wesfarmers is Australia's sixth biggest carbon emitter, producing 2.7m tonnes of direct emissions.


It was incurring:


… a A$100m net annual cost in the first year of the scheme as a result of the initial carbon price of A$23 per tonne.


But its revenue in 2011 was $56 billion. So it had a revenue of $56 billion, and the cost to deal with carbon was $100 million a year. What did Wesfarmers say? It said:


… it can maintain its margins by taking steps to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency.


…   …   …


Apart from the investment to improve energy efficiency, much of the group's focus in the last year has been on intensive emissions reduction, particularly in the chemicals business.


The document went on to say that Wesfarmers is:


… developing internal policies to guide employees as they prepare greenhouse and energy reports and deal with customers and suppliers on issues to do with carbon pricing—


and that is an important aspect of that company's work.


It went on to say:


Though the carbon cost is significant, Wesfarmers believes it can mitigate it to a large extent with top line growth and increased organisational efficiency.


This is a company that has one of the highest carbon prices that has to be paid, a company that is a big employer, a company that has taken the steps to deal with the issue of carbon pricing—and it says it will not affect its bottom line because it is going to deal with it.


Who was the sponsor of this report? It was General Electric. General Electric sponsored this report for The Economist. There is another case study in here on Shell. Shell said a cap-and-trade system is the right way to go and that it is 'the right mix at the right time'. So no-one agrees with this nonsense of Direct Action that the coalition are putting up. The Minister for Communications, Malcolm Turnbull, clearly does not like it. He belled the cat when he said it was a nonsense and a short-term approach. We have to take long-term approaches in the interests of our grandkids and in the interests of the planet. That is the challenge the coalition are failing to meet.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2014-03-04,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (13:04):  I rise to speak on this package of bills, debating what many Australians hope will be the final chapter and effectively the nail in the coffin of the disastrous carbon tax. It is a tax that, of course, was not even meant to exist and it is one of the most damaging and ridiculous policies that has ever traversed through both houses of parliament. It is a tax that has been a blight on this country's economy and a burden on the budget of every Australian family and every Australian business. It has put pressure on the cost of living, it has increased the costs of doing business within Australia and it has damaged our international competitiveness overseas. In fact, it was in its very first year a $7.6 billion hit to our economy. It had a direct impact on over 75,000 Australian businesses.


After all of this, how much did the carbon tax reduce carbon dioxide emissions by? Just 0.1 per cent. It cost $7.6 billion and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by barely 0.1 per cent. I could sum it up in another way. It has not worked. Only the Labor Party and their alliance partners in the Greens could impose a tax on the country to save the environment that actually made next to no difference.


But while the carbon tax was doing its damage to the wallets of Australians, it was also—I remind you, Acting Deputy President Furner, and the people of Australia—doing untold damage to those in the Labor Party. No other policy in recent memory has claimed such high-level political scalps or damaged so many political reputations. Let's take a walk down memory lane. It originally started with Mr Rudd walking away from his emissions trading scheme, which helped lead the way to him being dumped as leader and Prime Minister in 2010. Then Ms Gillard, after plunging the knife into Mr Rudd's back, tried to make her mark on the policy, misleading the Australian people in the most blatant manner that I have ever seen from a sitting Prime Minister. Just days before the election Ms Gillard promised on national television in front of millions of Australians:


There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.


She took that promise to the election, as did all the Labor Party. She scraped into government with the help of a handful of Independents and then turned her back on the clear will of the Australian people by doing the exact thing she promised not to do. The question remained—and it remained a black stain over Ms Gillard's prime ministership—how could anyone trust anything she said after she had backflipped on such a flagrant election promise? That did, indeed, haunt her throughout her prime ministership and eventually it helped lead to her downfall.


Mr Rudd then made a comeback and tried to smooth things over. In his eagerness to win the election at whatever cost, he admitted the carbon tax was a huge burden for all Australians. He said:


The government has decided to terminate the carbon tax to help cost-of-living pressures for families and to reduce costs for small business.


Let me read the opening line of that again: 'The government has decided to terminate the carbon tax'. That was Mr Rudd and the Labor Party before the last election. But that did not save him, because by then the Australian people had had a gutful. They were sick of paying another tax that Labor had lumped them with and that was achieving no beneficial outcome. They were sick of forking out for Labor's and the Green' ideological bent of putting a price on carbon dioxide—that odourless and colourless gas that is actually vital for life on earth. So the Australian people categorically rejected what Labor had put forward—and their policies—at the last election. They wanted change and they did not trust the then Labor government to fulfil their promise of abolishing the carbon tax. So they left it to the coalition to abolish the carbon tax—and that is exactly what we are trying to do.


This is about making things better for the Australian people. It is about removing a toxic tax that does nothing to help the environment but hurts everyone's household budgets. The quarterly CPI figures which were released on 24 October last year, the first CPI figures since the carbon tax was introduced, showed the largest quarterly increase ever. About two-thirds of this increase, on average, was due to the carbon tax. There was a 15.3 per cent rise in electricity and household gas, and a 14.2 per cent rise in miscellaneous fuels. Electricity companies are now being slugged to the tune of $3.5 billion and these higher costs are being passed on to consumers. It was extraordinary to read an opinion piece in the local paper today by Mr Paul Howes, the man who basically said he would quit the Labor Party and quit supporting the Labor Party if one job were lost due to the carbon tax. He was lamenting the cost of electricity for businesses and saying that that was what was making manufacturing uncompetitive. But in his about-face in his opinion piece he failed to once mention the impact of the carbon tax on electricity costs and how that was threatening our manufacturing competitiveness in this country.


We see even more proof with the Clean Energy Regulator's report that tells us 16 of the 20 biggest carbon tax bills went to electricity companies. The additional costs for the power industry overall equate to $4.1 billion. That, of course—and I will say it again—means higher electricity and utility bills for Australian families. Businesses are crying out for relief as well. Labor's tax has been a $1.1 billion burden for our manufacturing sector. Industry groups have said that:


…Australia's high carbon tax raises business costs unnecessarily, hitting industry competitiveness and investment confidence.


The Business Council of Australia agrees, saying the carbon tax:


…places excessive costs on business and households because the carbon charge under the legislation is now one of the highest in the world.


In recent days, Virgin Australia boss John Borghetti singled out the carbon tax for its damaging impact on airlines. I know his words have already been mentioned, but they are worth repeating. He said:


…the best assistance the government and the opposition can provide is the removal of the carbon tax, which has cost this industry hundreds of millions of dollars…


The cost of the carbon tax to this one company alone is $27 million. All this damage is from a tax we were never meant to have in the first place. What Labor and the Greens seem to forget is that the most important poll on the carbon tax was taken on 7 September last year. The people had their say, yet those on the other side of the chamber are still confused. The party that vowed to terminate the carbon tax, as the Labor Party did, is now fighting to keep it. Quite frankly, those on the other side appear to have very little interest in easing the cost-of-living pressures on families. I would suggest that they do not have any, because they were the ones who implemented this tax whose entire aim was to increase costs. That, indeed, was the whole point of it.


In contrast to the continuing Labor chaos, the government has listened. We warned about the destructive nature of this tax before it was implemented. We took our considered and consistent position to the Australian people at the election and we fought to remove the carbon tax. Doing so will have positive consequences. As Rod Sims from the ACCC said last year:


What went up will clearly come down when you take away the carbon price.


According to Treasury modelling, removing the carbon tax in 2014-15 will leave average costs of living across all households around $550 lower than they otherwise would have been in 2014-15. It is estimated that retail electricity will be around nine per cent lower and retail gas prices around seven per cent lower than they would otherwise have been. This means that average electricity bills will be around $200 lower than they otherwise would have been for households. It also means that average household gas bills will be around $70 lower than they would otherwise have been. For business, it is estimated that compliance costs will decrease by around $87.6 million per year. The burdens pushed onto Australian business and families will be eased and taxpayers will no longer have to foot the bill for Labor's reckless spending and misguided ideological vendetta against carbon dioxide.


All this goes to show the level of deception and nonsense that has been attached to this carbon tax. Mr Rudd called the carbon tax—or its previous incarnation—the great moral challenge of our generation, and yet twice he denounced policies that his party was pursuing.


Ms Gillard made a fundamental error of judgement in breaking her promise to all Australians. Dr Bob Brown, a former senator, blamed the Queensland floods on coal companies and climate change. Speaking about the Murray Darling Basin in 2009, Senator Wong said:


… this severe, extended drought is clearly linked with global warming.


And now the Leader of the Opposition, after sitting back and watching his colleagues self-destruct over this, is providing only more chaos for the Labor Party and for the Australian people by holding up the repeal of the carbon tax.


Senators on the other side of the chamber are the prophets of doom, always seeking to fundamentally change our economy to pursue an extreme agenda. The climate change alarmists want us to believe what they tell us, at any cost. It is all about the price they are willing for others to pay. And, quite frankly, it is not simply the impact that something like the carbon tax has on our economy that we should be considering; we all have to pay for the extras that come with these policies. Almost $1.5 million was spent by the Rudd government on travel costs to send 68 people to that ill-famed Copenhagen conference in 2009; a conference that achieved basically nothing.


Taxpayers also forked out another $360,000 for a delegation to be sent to a Mexico climate change conference. And how can we forget the clauses within the draft of the mooted Copenhagen treaty that sought to establish an unelected and virtually unaccountable world body that would have required Australia to transfer billions of dollars each and every year to developing countries, all in the name of combating climate change? Those are just a few examples of how easy it was for the previous government to spend taxpayers' money to pursue their green dreams and socialist agenda. 


Rather than seeking to strike a balance between protecting the environment and the economic challenges we already face, Labor and the Greens were happy for taxpayers to bear the financial burden because it is the only way they know how to govern: taxes and more taxes. Their idea is to keep levelling taxes on other people without bothering about the real costs to our community. It is time for us to end this terrible part of our recent history. It is time for us to move on with getting our economy back on track. While those on the other side, along with their friends the Greens, sit and watch the death throes of their disastrous policy experiment, whose legacy we are living with today, the government is getting on with the job of governing.


We are making the tough decisions that protect the interests of this country, doing what is necessary to ensure that families and businesses have the best chance to succeed. We are working to implement the will of the Australian people, who want to see this carbon tax gone. We will not tax the Australian economy to achieve our environmental goals, unlike Labor and the Greens, who will tax the economy without achieving any environmental goals. We will work towards a sustainable environment through low-cost, effective opportunities to improve the environment.


The people of Australia know where we stand. They knew where we stood before the election; they know where we now stand. It is now up to the other side to respect the wishes of the people and vote to repeal the carbon tax and free this country from this damaging and ridiculous policy that was never designed to achieve any meaningful environmental outcome. I will be supporting this bill.

"Thorp, Sen Lin",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (13:18):  Over the centuries, there has been a colourful history of groups incorporating under the common belief that planet Earth is flat—despite a mounting wealth of scientific evidence to the contrary. While this idea can trace its origins back to ancient civilisations, it has been revived many times in recent decades across the globe. The philosophy reached a peak in the 1970s when the International Flat Earth Research Society of America was reported to have a following of around 3,000 people.


A newsletter by society President Charles Johnson declared the goal of the organisation was to 'replace the science religion with sanity'. He contended that science is nothing more than 'a weird, way-out occult concoction of gibberish theory-theology' and that scientists are 'the same old gang of witchdoctors, sorcerers and tellers of tales'. Even today, in the age of Google maps and satellite tracking, the flat-earth cause continues from a base in California and boasts around 420 members. For those interested, it has an active internet presence at theflatearthsociety.org.


While flat-earth theories and the like provide a rich seam for ridicule in internet memes and weird-and-wacky columns for slow news days they are generally regarded as harmless, if unconventional, additions to the world of ideas. We have come to accept that, regardless of how hefty the weight of evidence at their disposal, some people will always cling to curious, if not completely absurd, beliefs.


However, this phenomenon can result in more sinister outcomes if these same people are invested with the power to use their strange thoughts as the basis of public policy. In the area of climate change, I fear that some of these people are our nation's elected representatives and that some of their unfounded beliefs form the foundation of bills like the one before us today. Of course, most members of this coalition government will tell you that there is no question that they believe in climate change and that their commitment to combat it is sincere.


They would assert that they agree with the 97 per cent of scientists who say that climate change represents a very real and present danger to the planet and the quality of our life on it. But the truth is that we hear a lot of words in this place. And Australians are not foolish. Australians understand that the only way to judge elected representatives is not on professionally-crafted rhetoric, but on actions. And therein we have the rub.


Perhaps we can forgive the Prime Minister for misspeaking when he put on the public record his belief that climate change is 'crap', during the now infamous interview in The Australian. After all, we cannot forget that the Prime Minister himself has cautioned us not to believe everything he says in the heat of discussion and that we should only take heed of his prepared, scripted remarks. So, maybe, in this case Mr Abbott got carried away with political pointscoring. It certainly would not be the first time he has let political convenience come before the truth. After all, the Prime Minister has also said in the past that it makes sense to have an ETS 'to take precautions against significant risks', so it is difficult to determine what he actually believes.


But, before we give the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt, we need to ask ourselves a few questions. Firstly, would a government that truly believed in climate change make it one of its first priorities in power to abolish the Climate Commission, which was established to provide the nation with vital information on the effects of and potential solutions to global warming? Would a government that is truly committed to reversing climate change turn its back on the United Nations climate change conference, which contributed to Australia winning the 2013 'Colossal Fossil' award from the Climate Action Network? And would a government that accepts the serious risks that face the globe if we do not act on climate change attempt to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation? This body, as has been said here previously, has leveraged an impressive $1.5 billion worth of private sector investment in clean energy projects and, in doing so, has cut 3.9 million tonnes of damaging carbon from our atmosphere. Even more importantly—and this is the kicker—this activity has also brought a return of seven per cent to government coffers. This would result in $200 million a year of pure profit. But, despite all common sense and, indeed, fiscal responsibility, the government persists in its bloody-minded plan to shut down this important body. Finally, we need to ask whether a government that is honest about its intention to cut carbon output would replace the almost universally accepted mechanism of pricing carbon with a direct action scheme that has been recognised as a dud by policymakers, scientists and economists alike. These questions are exactly what we are considering today in the bill that is before us.


We also need to consider this 'policy' of direct action, because what the government have given us to date barely qualifies for this description. Despite the fact that the government first announced Direct Action in 2010, in the intervening three years it came up with little more than thought bubbles as to how it could funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to polluters and rip away all the economy-wide incentives for investment in green, energy efficient projects. In order to cover up this lack of policy, Mr Hunt tried to slip out a vague, undetailed 'green paper' on the Friday afternoon before Christmas. Presumably he hoped it would fly under the media radar and public scrutiny could be avoided.


Currently, I serve as the Chair of the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee, which has recently been charged with considering the impacts of the government's direct action policy. The inquiry has received more than 100 submissions from across the country, and the overwhelming message we are getting is that the Direct Action Plan is simply not up to the task; it is expensive, is riddled with design problems and will not come close to meeting Australia's carbon emission reduction targets. In fact, the committee is yet to hear evidence from one single witness who is willing to support direct action as an effective or appropriate stand-alone solution to address climate change.


To meet our commitment of reducing Australia's carbon output by five per cent by 2020, the government has allocated $1.55 billion over three years, but modelling by SKM MMA and Monash University has shown that this falls $4 billion short of what will be needed. This leaves the government with three options: change the policy to a more cost-effective one, increase funding or fail at meeting the five per cent reduction target. The government has been very clear that it will not change the policy and even clearer that there will not be any more money on the table. Unfortunately, this all but guarantees that Australia will not meet its carbon reduction target.


One key failing of Direct Action is that it throws away the widely accepted market based model of 'polluter pays', in favour of an underresourced 'taxpayer pays the polluter' plan. This is very curious when you consider that the environment minister himself penned a graduate thesis entitled 'A tax to make the polluter pay', proving he fully understands the effectiveness of a broad based market pricing that places the burden of pollution on the polluter, rather than on the taxpayer. When interviewed on the topic in 2010, Minister Hunt reiterated this position, saying:


My support has always been for two things. And this is a life-long commitment back to my thesis. And that is firstly, to reduce emissions. And secondly, to use economic instruments to do that.


Despite this, Minister Hunt seems to have turned his back on years of learning to champion the Emissions Reduction Fund, where the government will pay organisations to undertake projects intended to reduce carbon emissions.


Pollution is a waste output of business like any other. Just as we would not expect someone else to pay to dispose of the skip bins of rubbish that any business generates, it is quite unfair to require the taxpayer to pick up the tab for big business and their carbon outputs. Unfortunately, this direct action policy also has some serious design flaws which open it up to being 'gamed' by big polluters. Firstly, it is very difficult to determine what a business would have done anyway as part of its normal operations. It is easy to envisage a scenario where a company could secure government funds to do something that it planned to do all along. And, perversely, businesses that have already reduced their carbon output could be penalised because they will be starting from a lower baseline, despite taking responsible and very effective action earlier. But, worse than this, the government has already pointed to a 'flexible' approach where there will be no penalties for not meeting the required carbon abatement. It has been made clear that the government will not penalise organisations for 'business as usual' operations—even if 'business as usual' pumps out tens of thousands of tonnes of polluting carbon dioxide.


In this context, it is not surprising that the government has completely done away with the national cap on emissions, as there is no chance of meeting any meaningful target through Direct Action. In fact, the Climate Institute tells us that, far from helping to mitigate climate change, Direct Action will actually result in an increase in carbon emissions of eight to 10 per cent on year 2000 levels. According to Climate Institute modelling, if other countries followed the Abbott government's policy lead, the world would be on track for a catastrophic rise of up to 6.5 degrees Centigrade by the end of the century. For Australia, this would mean a five-fold increase in droughts in southern Australia, the virtual destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, forced abandonment of many coastal communities and a 90 per cent reduction in agricultural production from the Murray-Darling region. Another problem of Direct Action is that it is completely silent on what will happen post 2020. We simply do not know. This creates serious uncertainty in the business community and threatens the viability of long-term investment planning, particularly as many projects would have a time line extending well beyond that of the policy itself. 


With the removal of the broad based carbon price, the government is removing the financial incentive for businesses to invest in low-carbon solutions. By doing this, it is essentially subsidising fossil fuels at the expense of clean, renewable energy. While the rest of the world is embracing the transition to low-carbon economies, Australia may find itself an economic and environmental backwater through the government's determination to cling to last century's technology. In fact, the GLOBE Climate Legislation Study which was released last week highlighted how far Australia is falling behind the rest of the world in this area. This study of 66 countries across the globe found Australia is the only country to be taking negative legislative action on climate policy. Only three months ago, China's second-largest province, which has a population of over 100 million, introduced the world's second-largest emissions trading scheme. Meanwhile, Australia stands alone as the only country currently that is dismantling a market based approach to minimising climate change. It is very hard to believe that these are the actions of a government that is truly committed to avoiding the damaging environmental and economic impacts of climate change.


Today, we are looking at a bill that threatens to turn back the clock on the advances this country has made toward meeting our ethical obligations to future generations and replace them with a widely derided option that will do nothing but line the pockets of big polluters. This is a bill that, if passed, will undoubtedly set us on a reckless path and abrogate our responsibility to protect the planet from the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. Well, I refuse to stand with this government on the wrong side of history. Instead, I will stand with the 87 per cent of Australians who believe that the target to reduce Australia's carbon emissions by five per cent by 2020 is either on the mark or does not go far enough. And I will stand on the side of the sheer weight of scientific evidence which tells us that we are heading down a perilous road if we ignore it. This is why I refuse to support this bill. Instead, I support replacing the carbon tax with an emissions trading scheme, which will help us to fulfil our responsibility to the international community and generations to come.


It is important to point out at this stage that the current government has long engaged in irresponsible myth-making about carbon pricing. Despite the Prime Minister's rantings about the carbon tax in recent years, it did not 'take a wrecking ball to the economy'. In fact, the economic impact of the carbon tax was determined by experts to be less than 0.7 per cent. And, even though we had a carbon tax, the economy continued to grow, jobs continued to be created and we registered an impressive growth in national wealth. At the same time, a fair compensation package was put in place to ensure that Australians earning under $80,000 a year would suffer no negative financial impacts as a result of the carbon tax. That is hardly a wrecking ball, from anyone's perspective.


At the same time, the carbon tax resulted in an 8.4 per cent drop in carbon emissions from the electricity sector in its first six months. That is a very tangible drop of 7.5 million tonnes of carbon when compared to the same half of 2011. However, in Labor we recognise that the economy may have some difficult times ahead. This is why we believe that an emissions trading scheme will strike the right balance between protecting the economy and meeting our obligations to reduce carbon output. The proposed scheme would put a floating price on carbon from 1 July. Notably, it would also reduce the economic imposts on business, industry and Australian families, as the carbon price would drop from the current $25.40 a tonne to the standard European floating price, which is around $6 a tonne.


As policymakers, one of our primary responsibilities is to recognise problems and find sensible, evidence based solutions to them. At the moment, we have a very serious problem facing us. We only need to look at the serious weather events occurring across the globe to realise that lip-service and token gestures from those opposite simply will not cut it. From the heartbreaking bushfires in New South Wales to the devastation wrought on the Philippines by Typhoon Haiyan, there is little doubt that the weather is changing. Experts across the globe who have devoted their lives to the study of climate are unanimous in warning us that if we do not act to decrease carbon emissions, these sorts of extreme weather events will only escalate in scale and regularity. Experts have also told us that the most sensible, effective policy solution to the problem is to put a price on carbon and that so-called direct action schemes are expensive and ineffective.


So we stand here at an important junction in history. Do we take the responsible path of putting an effective, evidence based response to the problem of climate change in place? I have worked closely with people on both sides of this place, and I have to say that there are many on the other side that I believe to be rational, intelligent and ethical. I know where I stand on this, and I urge these more sensible members of the government to lobby their short-sighted leader to reconsider this regressive, irresponsible action so future generations do not have to pay the price for their flat-earth-type thinking.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2014-03-04,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (13:37):  I am proud to stand here today and say as the last speaker that, like the rest of my party room, I will not be voting for these carbon tax bills. What we are voting on today is one of the bravest, most significant and most necessary structural reforms this country has seen in decades. We are taking a leadership role and the rest of the world will follow suit if we can reduce global emissions. It is at times like these that I cannot help but reflect on the fact that six years ago I was sitting in front of a computer at the University of Tasmania after I was asked to put together a course in environmental finance. At that stage no other university had looked at doing a specific course in environmental finance and how we could use financial markets to help mitigate environmental damage. It is quite ironic that I am standing here in the Senate today, having taken 12 months to pull together all the simple things to teach students how we can counteract a problem such as global warming, and all the best policy advice available is being thrown out the door by a government that is supposed to understand markets and understand business.


Let me start at the beginning. Carbon dioxide, like other greenhouse gases, is pollution. That might be the very first line you type on your first slide that you are going to show your students. If you do not believe that, if you do not get passed that first line, then there is no point progressing with the rest of the course. Carbon dioxide is pollution.


It was interesting hearing Senator Eggleston yesterday talk about historical instances of carbon dioxide pollution leading to periods of global warming. We are well aware of that from climate records, but that does not abrogate the importance of carbon dioxide in today's age. It actually supports the argument that CO2 is a greenhouse gas that can lead to runaway climate change and all the negative impacts we see on our ecosystems and on our future economy.


If it is pollution, it is what economists call an externality—that is, something produced by a company that is having a negative impact is not being reflected in the costs of production of that good. We also know from well-established theory that markets fail. Markets do not always price things well. They do price some things well, but they do not price things like pollution well, so there is an important role for government to step in and fill the externality gap by levering things such as taxes or excises on pollution.


In the last two days we have heard a lot from the CEO of Virgin talking about the impact of the carbon tax. Apart from the fact that he and Qantas signed up lobbying to be included in the price on carbon scheme, we have not heard anything about the excise that has long been levied on aviation fuel or other fuels in this country. What we hear about is the so-called carbon tax and the damage that has done to the profits of a company like Virgin. It was interesting also to see in estimates last week Qantas very clearly saying that the carbon tax was not the issue, whereas we have seen the Prime Minister and our Liberal cohorts in the last two days running the populist line that somehow the carbon tax has destroyed Qantas. I will get back to that in a minute.


This price on carbon, and its accepted theory to price pollution, is designed to transition industries away from pollution to cleaner forms of production. It does not just have to be electricity; there are a lot of other things that we leverage market based instruments on. That is why we call them market based instruments. We are transitioning in this country, and certainly in my state of Tasmania, which has 86 per cent renewable energy, from dirty energy to clean energy. Along the way we have created tens of thousands of new jobs in investment and innovation in this country. I have not heard that mentioned once by anyone on the other side of the chamber in all of the debate.


Yes, a scheme like this will have its costs and it may have design flaws that need to be changed. It will also have risks. It is our job in government to manage those costs and to manage those risks. Getting back to the first line that I am typing for my students, if you do not accept that CO2 is pollution then I can say to you—and I did say this to some students—you do not have to have proof to be prudent in finance. That is what the insurance industry is based on. I do not know if I am going to be run over by a car and killed but I have life insurance anyway because, if I do, it will be catastrophic for my family. I insure my house in case someone breaks in and I insure my car in case I have an accident. It is called managing risk. It is the insurance industry that has driven action on climate change since the 1980s, because it is the only industry pricing the risk of climate change, not just to households and individuals but to businesses and industries.


So taking strong and effective action on climate change—and I emphasise action that is effective—is an insurance policy in itself. That is what climate action is. I say to people who do not necessarily believe in CO2 being pollution that leads to global warming, where does the balance of risks lie? Would you put your money on it if you had to make a bet based on the available evidence? Isn't it prudent to manage our risks? Yes, it is. We need strong action on climate change because it is an insurance policy for the future of our grandchildren, as Senator Cameron so eloquently pointed out. But it is a lot more than that; it is also important for our economy.


So the crisis we face today—and I stress it is a crisis—could not have been more clearly highlighted than by CSIRO this morning when they put out their definitive report on observed changes in the long-term trends in Australia's climate. I will read to you from the section 'Future climate scenarios for Australia'. It says:


Australian temperatures are projected to continue to increase, with more hot days and fewer cool days.


Interestingly, the CSIRO's conclusion is the same as that of the Bureau of Meteorology in answer to a question from Senator Ruston during estimates. According to the report:


Seven of the ten warmest years on record have occurred since 1998.


Over the past 15 years, the frequency of very warm months has increased five-fold and the frequency of very cool months has declined by around a third, compared to 1951–1980.


The report goes on:


A further increase in the number of extreme fire-weather days is expected in southern and eastern Australia, with a longer fire season in these regions.


Average rainfall in southern Australia is projected to decrease, with a likely increase in drought frequency and severity.


The frequency and intensity of extreme daily rainfall is projected to increase.


Tropical cyclones are projected to decrease in number but increase in intensity.


Projected sea-level rise will increase the frequency of extreme sea-level events. 


When I read that I understand that it is talking about the future—my future and the future of my kids. When I read that I see that it spells cost—the cost of living in this country under climate change, not the cost of my bloody electricity bills this month or next month. This is the CSIRO talking about the potential catastrophe under a future of climate change if we do not take action. We have just given billions of dollars to farmers because of drought. I have no doubt they need it, but how many more billions of dollars will go to them? How many more billions of dollars are we going to have to spend on mitigation strategies for bushfire risk or for rising sea levels? It is interesting, I have never heard the cost of climate change mentioned by the other side of the chamber in this debate. But there it is; that is what we have to do something about, folks. It is clear as daylight.


So why are we standing here today debating whether these bills should be scrapped? There are three good reasons that I can identify. The first is the zombie spin that we saw from the Abbott government in the lead-up to the last election. Once again, Senator Cameron pointed out very eloquently the impact that the short-sighted, offensive, cynical, political opportunism of Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, has had on the debate. I cannot think of a better example than that of Qantas. Qantas is in trouble, workers jobs are at risk, and it is the fault of the carbon tax again! The second thing I can identify is ideology, pure and simple. I was reading the IPA website last night, looking at its freedom index. I have no doubt that that is now a layer that we have to deal with under this new government: how well new regulations or policies impact the IPA's freedom index. Sometimes I cannot help thinking that their ideology has bred pure spite in the attempt to cancel some of these bills, especially that dealing with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Lastly, it is about special interests, about the big end of town, about being puppets on a string, having the IPA, the Business Council of Australia and the other large, vested interests in this country dictating your policy.


Let us consider the carbon tax bills specifically. The cheer squad—the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and the Minerals Council of Australia—is very clear. The Australian says, 'Industry calls for swift repeal of carbon tax.' I wonder why, considering that only 0.1 per cent of Australian businesses are liable to pay the carbon price and that four companies, concentrated in a very small number of industries, alone pay nearly 50 per cent of Australia's carbon liability! This demonstrates how the big polluters, as Al Gore recently in Australia articulated so clearly on 7.30 Report, have hijacked our democracy. They are driving the government's agenda and, sadly, potentially our national legislation. I would like to quote from an article by Ross Gittins, in the Sydney Morning Herald, that I really enjoyed. It is entitled 'We're now a nation of rent-seekers.' He says:


Professor Ross Garnaut has argued that Australia is unlikely to see another era of extensive micro-economic reform because of the growth in rent-seeking behaviour since the days of the Hawke-Keating government.


…   …   …


What gets me is how blatantly self-seeking our lobby groups have become. It is as if the era of economic rationalism - with its belief that the economy is driven by self-interest - has sanctified selfishness and refusal to co-operate for the common good.


He goes on to say:


It's finally dawning on people that major and genuine reform—


which the carbon-pricing scheme is—


requires a degree of bipartisanship at the political level and a spirit of give and take on the part of powerful interest groups. But these prerequisites are further away than ever.


Instead what we get is lowest-common-denominator politics from the pollies and rent-seeking posing as ''reform'' from the interest groups.


He goes on to mention the various business lobbies that have a significant interest in investing to have this legislation changed.


I used to teach the special-interest model and the special-interest effect to students. It is probably a bit difficult to talk about in the time I have remaining, but we all understand that lobby groups play a role in democracy—they get in the ear of decision makers. But they also make the decisions that we as decision makers make very clear. They make the benefits and the costs to us very clear. They can donate to political parties. They can threaten to advertise against you in aggressive advertising campaigns. There is no clearer example of that than with Labor's change of view on the mining tax. I have seen it also with Coca-Cola and the Australian Beverages Council aggressively advertising against national recycling schemes such as a bottle bill. We face these trade-offs. Do we take on special interests and risk getting a backlash from voters? Unfortunately, most voters in this country do not have the time or the energy to invest in fully understanding legislation and how important it is. That is our job as government to do. That is why special interests win. They can concentrate very powerfully the benefits and costs to decision makers, and decision makers know that the general public have lots of things on their mind when they go to the ballot box. That is why it is a con to say that this government has a mandate on the carbon tax, on the mining tax, on turning back the boats or on anything that I have heard in this chamber—you suddenly have a mandate on it. How many Australians go to the polling booth understanding those policies and voting specifically on those? It is my view that people voted for a change at the last election—I do not doubt that—but that was because of the circus that we saw from the Labor Party. I have a very clear view on this—we call it the rational ignorance of voters. There are a multitude of factors that go into decision making when people vote in an election. Unfortunately, once again, it is why special interests get away with dictating government policy. 


What about the positive interests that support renewable energy? The Australian Cleantech Review in 2013 estimated at least 53,000 Australians are currently working in the cleantech sector, with strong growth since 2009. Modelling by several organisations, including Austrade, shows that current renewable energy targets in combination with other elements of the clean energy package, including a price on carbon, will deliver $20 billion of investment in renewable energy by 2020. Tasmania, my state, is nearly 100 per cent renewable and receives a $100 million dividend from the price on carbon. I am yet to see any politician, especially not a politician from Tasmania, say how my state will be compensated. One hundred million dollars a year from a price on carbon—because we export clean energy—is 12½ per cent of non-Canberra revenues to the state government. How are we going to be compensated for that? Solar PV accounts for 18,500 jobs and $8 billion in private investment; it is a growth sector. With traditional industries around this country failing—with the car manufacturing sector pulling out of the country, with farmers needing more handouts and with the collapse and troubles experienced by commodity industries, for example, SPC—how are we going to invest in the new jobs of the future? Where are we going get this innovation from? Senator Conroy is here—at least he has done something for this country with the NBN. How are we going to build the industries of the future? I can tell you we have one here now, and it is called clean energy. 


The government talk about sovereign risk. I have never seen a worse example of sovereign risk than what the Liberal Party has done to the clean energy sector over the last four years. There is nothing business hates more than uncertainty. 




Senator Back:
  You and Labor were in government for the last four years!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Businesses factor in costs and are forward-looking, as you well know, Senator Back. All you have done is pull the carpet out from underneath one of the future growth drivers of this country. How are you going to replace it? The price on carbon acts as a catalyst for transitioning this country to a clean energy future and we are the only party that has shown leadership on this issue. Let us talk a little bit about leadership. Lord Deben, the head of the UK Committee on Climate Change, and a Tory politician, has slammed the Abbott government's push to pull back climate change policies:


It lets down the whole British tradition that a country should have become so selfish about this issue that it’s prepared to spoil the efforts of others and to foil what very much less rich countries are doing … All that pollution which Australia is pushing into the atmosphere is of course changing my climate. It’s a real insult to the sovereignty of other countries … It’s wholly contrary to the science, it’s wholly contradictory to the interests of Australia and I hope that many people in Australia will see when the rest of the world is going in the right direction what nonsense it is for them to be going backwards.


Tory politician! Senator Macdonald is not in here, but I challenged him in the House the other day when he said, 'I have yet to have anyone from that side of the chamber say to me why us cutting our small contribution to global warming is making a difference.' It is making a difference because this country has shown leadership and conviction, and it comes at a very small sacrifice considering what previous generations of this country have had to sacrifice for us. Accepting a $1 or $2 increase on an airfare as a result of the carbon price, or a small increase in my electricity bills, is hardly a sacrifice when we are talking about long-term structural reform. It is long-term structural reform in order to do the right thing for my children and for future generations of this country—not to mention the animals that live in our ecosystem and our oceans and the ecosystem services that support life on this planet.


This is the biggest structural reform this country has seen in decades, and I and the rest of my party will not stand by idly while the government tries to pull the carpet out from under the feet of my children and future generations of Australians.

How one small voice can change the world if you are persistent! I have sat here for the past three weeks while thousands and thousands of jobs have disappeared, while people on the other side have read speeches presented to them. Those speeches may as well have been in Swahili for all they know about it—they have dutifully read out those speeches word for word, and meanwhile the jobs have been evaporating in front of them. The Labor Party have been filibustering and putting cost on cost on business.

Senator BOSWELL:
  How you can sit there and say that you are representatives of the working people has got me beat. I can understand the Greens—that is their knitting; that is what they should stick to. But how the Labor Party get sucked into this is beyond me. If you do not believe me, how about believing Paul Howes? Paul Howes has said the cost of energy is killing our manufacturing industry.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (14:00):  That is a question you might best ask Qantas. The situation is that Qantas, of course, for the senator's understanding, is a commercially-listed entity in Australia. It is an international carrier in the airline industry and, accordingly, is hostage to the marketplace. It is currently going through a tough time. What the government has sought to do is level the playing field for Qantas. We are not going to give them a blank cheque. We are not going to underwrite debt. We are going to give them a level playing field where they can compete on the open market, as they should. The government has announced that it will move to a single regulatory framework for all Australian airlines. Legislation will be introduced to remove the foreign ownership and operational restrictions in part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act. That, Senator, through you, Mr President, is a very important act—




Senator Conroy:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. I asked the minister a very specific question about the repeal of part 3 and how many jobs were going to be exported by this government. The minister has 40 seconds left to remotely attempt to address the question, and I invite you to ask him to address the question. 



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order at this stage. The minister is to continue. 




Senator JOHNSTON:
  Thank you, Mr President. Qantas as a viable, commercial entity employs a very large number of people. In order for them to continue to be a viable, commercial entity, they must have a level playing field; currently, they do not. They are at the mercy of other airlines that have government capital funding. Senator, you should know that, if we are going to go forward with a reliable, secure working environment for the employees of Qantas, they must have the commercial capacity to borrow on the open market and function commercially.

Any changes to the Qantas Sale Act to assist Qantas require bipartisan support to be passed through this parliament. The best way to protect Australian jobs at Qantas is to put Qantas on an equal footing with its competitors. The government is not about writing blank cheques for commercial entities.

 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:00):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Johnston) and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Sinodinos) to questions without notice asked today.


The government of Australia at the moment is playing politics with Australians' lives. If you look at what has occurred in this country since September last year, we have a litany of failures to support Australian families and Australian jobs, putting pressure on families' mortgages. We have a government that is prepared to goad Holden into announcing it was leaving Australia. Mr Hockey stood on the floor of the other place and goaded Holden. And what did Holden do? They followed Mr Hockey's lead and closed their business. Those opposite stood in silence as Toyota announced they were closing their doors because the ecosystem of the motor industry had collapsed—because of this government's indolence. Then, when it came to the closing of Alcoa, what did we hear? Absolutely nothing. With SPC, they tried to blackmail the company into cutting wages. In Tasmania we have contractors going to the wall, because those opposite, including Senator Bushby, said they were going to build fibre to the home—guaranteed—for every Tasmanian. What have we got? Contractors protesting in the streets of Tasmania and going broke, because this government misled them before the last election. And we have the defence shipping industry saying to this government right now that unless you give us some work thousands more Australians will lose their jobs. But, no, if you are a mate of the former chief of staff of Senator Nash or if you are a mate of Cadbury, you will get government money—lots of government money. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame that they are allowing thousands upon thousands of Australian families, and the jobs that support them, to be smashed on the altar of their free-market ideological rhetoric.


The Minister for Defence knows that there are up to 4,000 jobs on the chopping block unless he gets his act together and starts delivering some work for our defence shipping industry. It is quite extraordinary that a government is going to companies and telling them, 'You are not getting a handout unless you start slashing wages'—because that is what this government really believes. They believe it is the fault of the workers in the enterprises—they are to blame when it comes to why the companies are not doing well.


When those companies talk to the government and need assistance, what do they get? They get free-market, flat-earth ideology. This ideological campaign is putting thousands of workers on the scrap heap, except if you are in Tasmania and you work for Cadbury. When it comes to Qantas, what promises have been made over the last few weeks? What promises have been going on behind closed doors? That is what this government needs to stand up and be honest about. What promises were made to Qantas? What promises did Mr Hockey make? What promises did Mr Truss make? And what happened last night in cabinet when they got rolled? This is what Mr Truss said in December in relation to the Qantas Sale Act:


It would simply be a waste of time and political energy, when it is obvious that I think the majority of the Australian people and certainly the majority of the people elected to the parliament at the present time, especially in the Senate, do not favour that course of action.


And what did the cabinet come up with last night? They want to repeal the Qantas Sale Act. This is just another political stunt.


And here is Senator Bushby, just walking back into the chamber—the man who before the election promised every Tasmanian that they would get fibre to the home. He is the man responsible for contractors losing their jobs today in Tasmania, based on the promise that Senator Bushby made to them. (Time expired)

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (15:06):  If that is supposed to be a confidence booster for Senator Conroy after the debacle of his disgraceful performance in Senate estimates last week, he has a long way to go to redeem himself.


In regard to some of Senator Conroy's comments in respect of Tasmania and the Tasmanian economy, if you want to see an economy that has been devastated by the Labor Party, in partnership with the Greens, have a look at the Tasmanian economy. Tasmania, whose economy has been absolutely done over by the Labor Party over recent years in government, particularly in partnership with the Greens, both at a federal and a state level, is the state that shows how not to operate. Senator Conroy talks about NBN contractors in troub­le in Tasmania. I will tell you why they are in trouble in Tasmania: it is because of the rates they were offered under Senator Conroy's contracts to construct the NBN, rates at which they could not make any money. That is why the contractors have problems. They invested tens of thousands of dollars in equipment to build the NBN and then they could not make money.


Then of course there is the issue of asbestos in pits that Senator Conroy did not contemplate. Talk about a debacle, a mess, that was left behind by Senator Conroy in the previous government and the destruction of the Tasmanian economy by the Labor Party in combination with the Greens over the last four years. Senator Conroy has absolutely no idea. If that is supposed to be a confidence boost with his return after last week, I can tell you it is a pretty poor effort.


With respect to the comments Senator Conroy made about Senator Bushby's commitments in Tasmania, what the coalition committed to in Tasmania was to meet the NBN contract. The issue that we have in Tasmania, as I have just been saying, is that the contractor does not want to meet the contract because they cannot make any money out of the rates that they were forced into under the NBN deal. Senator Conroy tries to portray this as a breach of promise by the coalition, yet it is a failure of the previous government in their set-up of the NBN and a complete misrepresentation of what was going to be offered to the Tasmanian people as part of their rollout of the NBN. It is a complete and utter failure.


With respect to the issue of the day—that is, Qantas—the Labor Party just do not get it. They expect a 21st century business to run on last-century regulation.

Senator COLBECK:
  You might like to go back to those days, Senator Carr. Senator Carr and the Labor Party want a 21st century airline to run on a regulatory environment of last century. They talk a lot about the 21st century and policy for the 21st century, but, when it comes to application, what do they do? They continue to do what they have done in the past; they continue to apply cost and regulation to industry and expect it to thrive. That is the policy of the Labor Party. They will not even listen to people from their own side of politics who understand how the economy works—people like the former member Mr Ferguson who has a commercial understanding—

If you look at what is happening in the Labor Party right now, you will see it will be a long time before any industry or business in this country is going to get any sensible policy out of the Labor Party, because they are still lost in the last century. Despite talking about policy for the 21st century, they are nowhere near it. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:11):  Listening to Senator Colbeck make that pathetic defence of the loss of 60,000 jobs in the economy is just mind-boggling, I must say. It is absolutely pathetic. We get a personal attack from Senator Colbeck when he should be talking about the jobs of workers at Qantas and trying to defend the government's decision about Qantas. I know why he has done what he has done. It is because the decision is absolutely indefensible. Surely you could have done better than that performance, Senator Colbeck?


When you repeal the Qantas Sale Act, you repeal the position of the maintenance of airlines in this country. You destroy the jobs of skilled maintenance workers in this country. We have over 6,000 skilled personnel in the Qantas engineering and maintenance area. The reality is that as soon as that sales act is lifted the engineering and maintenance of Qantas planes will be in Singapore, Hong Kong or elsewhere. They will not be here. They will be there because this government is not prepared to recognise the importance of a strong engineering and maintenance base for the airline industry in this country.


I heard some of the coalition senators talk about having to be competitive—'Just be competitive and everything will be okay.' Qantas said they established their maintenance facility back in 1920. There are 6,000 personnel employed now and over 300 apprentices. It is one of the biggest employers of apprentices in this country—and what did the coalition do? They just wiped them off the face of employment in this country, because they have no strategy for jobs in this country. Qantas say that their engineering standards are world-class, that their safety, quality, reliability and service is world-class. The big issue—and we have heard it time after time from the opposition—is that they do not want unionised workers and they do not want unionised workers earning a decent quid. They would sacrifice the maintenance jobs for the airline industry in this country on the altar of their ideology. There is absolutely no doubt about it. If another organised union shop bites the dust because the government is not prepared to help an icon company, so be it. Six thousand jobs could go to Singapore or Hong Kong—it will not matter; the opportunities for young Australians in the airline industry will be gone.


This is because this government have no idea about the reality of global trade and the global economy. They talk about everything as if it is simply some theoretical economic debate based on the economic philosophies of some right-wing ideologue from centuries ago. That is where they are at.


Let's look at the reality that Qantas is facing in the engineering and maintenance area. Advertised on the Careerjet website today were positions for an airstream technician and an engine technician. The salary was from $2,200 to $2,500 per month. That is the reality of global competition. What do the coalition say? They say, 'You need to match that $2,200 a month.' It is less than the minimum wage in Australia. A skilled technician in Singapore and Hong Kong is earning less than the minimum wage in Australia.


We have an airline that is so important to this country and our future, and they are going to let it go. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2014-03-04,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (15:16):  I rise to take note of answers by Senator Sinodinos and Senator Johnston regarding the aviation industry in Australia and the Australian government's response. A lot of the focus today has been on Qantas, and that is understandable. Qantas has gone from, in the same period last year, a before-tax profit of $140 million to, this year, a loss of $252 million. Nearly half that—$106 million—was due to the carbon tax. Members opposite are very loudly saying, 'Ah, but Qantas are saying that is not important.' If you look carefully you will see that Qantas said, 'What is important to us is levelling the playing field against the competition, because removing the carbon tax benefits all the airlines.' So they did not actually say that the carbon tax was not important. They said that it was not their top priority because they wanted to level the playing field against their competition.


A clearer picture of the impacts of the carbon tax probably comes from Virgin and John Borghetti. Last year they had a before-tax profit of some $25 million. It has decreased now to almost $50 million. Of that, $27 million—over half—is because of the carbon tax. John Borghetti said that the best thing that the government and the opposition could do for airlines is remove the carbon tax. If the ALP and the Greens are really concerned about jobs and the future of the aviation industry, they should get out of the way and let the coalition implement its election promise to scrap the carbon tax.


The aviation industry more broadly is struggling. You have to ask why. It has not come about just in the last few months since the coalition formed government. In fact, the chief financial officer of Rex said that:


The entire aviation industry is financially haemorrhaging right now and approaching collapse.


Indeed, we saw Brindabella Airlines go into receivership in December last year with some $37 million of debt and 140 direct jobs lost, which means for its 12 aircraft there will be a whole raft of flow-on jobs in the maintenance and support sectors lost. That is because the ALP did not actually deliver with their white paper a strategic direction or an effective reform for the regulatory environment that the aviation sector works under. It is those things—in conjunction with things such as the carbon tax—that are helping to create the environment that is making it so difficult for the aviation sector here to get ahead.


That is why I welcome the coalition's promise of reforming the CASA board. We see that the coalition will be increasing the size of board to bring skills of aviation engineering and operations onto that board. We also see reform of the regulatory sector, which is undergoing an inquiry right now.


But this is not only about the aviation sector. The opposition are making lots of comments about loss of jobs in the auto sector. If we look at the time frame for Ford, Holden and Toyota, it was not the coalition at the helm when the conditions were set for those job losses. In fact, Mike Devereux, the then general manager of Holden, said that one of the biggest issues is when global companies like GM start talking about sovereign risk in countries like Australia. The decisions the former government made to introduce things such as the carbon tax as well as reverse policy on programs that the car industry was relying on have resulted in that sovereign risk.


But, more importantly, particularly to the people of South Australia, Labor's approach has impacted on things such as mining. In August 2012, BHP decided to halt their Olympic Dam development despite the fact that, as recently as this year, Andrew McKenzie, their CEO, was reported in the media as showing the graphs demonstrating that copper supply will start decreasing by about 2016 and that demand will increase—so that the whole copper-uranium mine at Olympic Dam had huge potential. Why did it not go ahead? It was because one of the most expensive parts of copper extraction is electricity. That mine has a 100-year life, according to DMITRE. So in 2050, just when BHP could be expected to start to recoup some of their upfront investment, the carbon tax that the ALP brought in was going to go up to $350 a tonne. Clearly if electricity is your highest cost then the carbon tax is going to make that unviable.


As the people of South Australia approach an election on 15 March, they need to have a good look at what the ALP do. They need to make the decision that they will not have four more years of the ALP at a state level because they have seen a very clear example of what the ALP at the federal level have done to jobs in this country through job-destroying taxes such as the carbon tax—not to mention their refusal to get out of the way and let us implement our election commitment now.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:21):  I sit here and wonder sometimes how it all gets to this, but unfortunately that is the game we are in. Politicians are given five minutes to get out there and defend the government, so we have to listen to all sorts of nonsense. But I would like to come back to the issue at hand. I would like to address the answers to questions given by Ministers Johnston and Sinodinos today.


I would like to take a minute to put a personal slant on this. In my past life as an organiser with the Transport Workers Union after my trucking career finished, I got to organise at Qantas. I organised Qantas flight catering with some 400-odd employees in Perth. I also organised the Qantas Chairman's Lounge employees. My heart goes out to Qantas employees. When I think of the 5,000 full-time-equivalent jobs that Qantas announced last Thursday would be lost, the first thing I think is that it is not 5,000—because Qantas has myriad part-time and casual employees. So when they say 5,000 full-time jobs, I have no idea how many people will be affected.


A generic email was sent to all of us by Qantas. It was from a fellow by the name of Andrew Parker, Group Executive Government and International Affairs, who virtually did the standard, 'Dear Senator, Mr Joyce wants you to know things are pretty crook and this is what might happen.' I wrote back to Mr Parker straightaway—and I want to quote my actual words because I want to personalise the thought and the pain of the Qantas workers and the uncertainty of who might go when and where. I said: 'Thanks, Andrew. I have read the Qantas statement and now ask if would you please supply me with a very specific and detailed breakdown of where within the Qantas groups the jobs will go—and what number and when.' I then went on to say: 'Would you also provide me with a comprehensive list of all international and domestic routes that will be slashed and/or replaced with Jetstar or just dropped altogether? Awaiting your reply, Senator Glenn Sterle.' I am still waiting.


You see, this is what brings me round to the Qantas workers and not to the ridiculous politics that gets played in this and the other chamber about who has got the biggest, hairiest chest. I do care about these jobs. I want to know what is going on. My thoughts about the CEO's position, the board and the chairman are very well documented. But I am going to be above that today because I want to see Australian jobs saved. I think it is extremely important that we do everything we can to give our national carrier the opportunity to survive its myriad problems, a number of those problems having arisen from the shocking decisions made by management over the last few years.


But let's not forget what the Qantas Sale Act addressed. It set out that the principal maintenance, catering, head office and other operations must stay in Australia. On the subject of jobs going, I will tell you what happened when I was organising the Qantas flight catering in Perth. This may come as a shock, but when Qantas used to fly direct to Denpasar in Bali, management took the decision that it was cheaper to get the catering done in Denpasar, where the health and safety standards were nowhere near the standard of the Australian operations. If they could double cater from Denpasar back to Perth then up to Denpasar, the people on the planes were thinking, 'We're eating Qantas food made by Qantas workers to Australian standards.' But that was bulldust. It was nowhere near Australian standards.


I fear that there will be a heck of a lot more than the 5,000 jobs that will go—and they will go overseas. But it is important for Australians to understand the deviousness of that suggestion of 5,000 jobs. It was plucked out of the air. No-one can tell me where they are going to come from. The jobs will come back. They will come back. They will not all be Australian, but I guarantee they will be contracted out. If Australians think that they are purchasing Australian food of Australian quality and made to Australian standards, they should think again—because Indonesia is only a couple of hours flight away. 


I am disgusted at some of the quality of the argument here and at the insincerity of the Abbot government saying how wonderful they are going to be by letting Qantas break up the international from the domestic. This is about Australian jobs, Australian apprenticeships and Australian kids having a future in our aviation industry. (Time expired)

The opportunity for all citizens to run for election, either individually or collectively as political parties, regardless of wealth and background, is an absolute cornerstone of our democracy. In recent years there has been an alarming trend across a number of Australian jurisdictions to increase barriers to political participation, in particular barriers that make it more difficult for minor parties to run in elections.


In February of last year, the Coalition and Labor teamed up to pass legislation that doubled nomination fees for candidates running for election to the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Greens strongly opposed this change, alongside other minor party and independent Senators.


At the time, The Greens warned about the consequences these changes would have on minor parties. In the House of Representatives, my colleague and Australian Greens Deputy Leader Adam Bandt noted that these changes were unlikely to have a significant impact on The Greens, but would create a barrier to smaller parties and individuals. Many minor parties would still try and raise the funds necessary to participate in the democratic process, but it would leave them with fewer financial resources to use in their election campaign. Labor and the Coalition – the architects of this proposal – would however be flush with cash from private, corporate donors and face no such impediment. 


In the last federal election we saw a significant number of minor parties, including new parties, register and run. While The Greens may not support the policies of every one of these parties, we absolutely support their right to participate in the democratic process. There has been much media coverage and discussion following the election about the number of minor party Senators who were elected in 2013. Concerns have been raised, rightly in my view, around the lack of transparency around the Senate voting system and the proliferation of secret preference deals that leave voters in the dark. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is looking into those issues, and I look forward to participating in that discussion. The Greens have a clear position on these issues. We strongly support the right of all political parties, and future political parties, to register and run for election without having to pay exorbitant fees, but we don’t support a Senate voting system that forces parties and candidates to enter into secret preference deals that voters have no knowledge of. 


If the legislation passed last year was an attempt to try and lock out minor parties, and it’s hard to see it as anything other than that, it failed. More minor parties than ever contested the election and a  number of new parties were elected to the Senate – some at the expense of Labor and the Coalition. 


There is a growing concern shared by minor parties across the political spectrum that the response from the major parties will not necessarily be a democratic reform of the Senate voting system that will end compulsory, secret preference deals, but will take further steps to limit the role played by minor parties. After all, both Labor and the Coalition have recent form in this area.


In a similar vein to Labor’s doubling of nomination fees last year, the Campbell Newman Liberal National government in Queensland is proceeding with plans to make it more difficult for minor parties to get off the ground and running in that state, by increasing the threshold required before parties become eligible for public funding.


The Greens strongly oppose those reforms, and will oppose any reforms in this Parliament that are designed to protect the interests of the major parties. 


This Bill makes our intentions clear. It seeks to undo the anti-democratic doubling of nomination fees pushed through by the major parties last year. It will revert nomination fees to $1,000 per Senate candidate and $500 per House of Representatives candidate. It will restore some fairness to our electoral processes.

The speech read as follows—



NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT (REFORM) BILL 2014


The Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill 2014 is the third iteration of native title reform proposed by the Australian Greens.


The Bill seeks to address key failures of the Native Title Act 1993 (NTA). We want to provide meaningful rights and a basis for economic and community development to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, something the Act has not adequately achieved in the 20 years since it came into force.


By introducing this Bill and any further reforms we intend to contribute constructively to a debate about native title reform that can ultimately lead to simpler legislation which produces more meaningful outcomes in a more timely fashion for all those involved.


In March 2011, I introduced the Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill 2011. The Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Standing Committee in May last year. Over 35 submissions were received, from a range of stakeholders and government agencies during the course of the inquiry. The majority of these were supportive of the intent of the legislation—many noting the great need for the Native Title Act to be reformed. The submissions contained many useful suggestions on how the Bill might be strengthened and improved.


The Bill I introduced in 2012 built on those suggestions. We closely examined the submissions and incorporated numerous revisions, creating a more robust and effective piece of law.


In the original Bill we sought to address some of the 'low-hanging fruit' of native title reform—by targeting some of the areas of native title law where relatively simple amendments could have far-reaching implications for addressing some of the current barriers to effective native title outcomes. In 2012’s Bill we focused on the most important and most urgent of those areas and drafted amendments which we hope will gain broad support.


As I have said previously if we do not work together to traverse the ""impenetrable jungle""1 that is native title litigation, there is little hope for just outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The second reading speech for the original Bill is still relevant for this current revised Bill:


… nearly two decades after the introduction of the NTA it is clear that native title has failed to deliver on its promises.


The Preamble states that …


""The people of Australia intend:


(a) to rectify the consequences of past injustices by the special measures contained in this Act… for securing the adequate advancement and protection of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders; and


(b) to ensure that Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders receive the full recognition and status within the Australian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire.""


Unfortunately as we marked the twentieth anniversary of the NTA in 2013, there had been no progress on native title reform, and so communities are still waiting for native title to deliver on some of the seemingly forgotten promises contained in the preamble to and objects of the NTA.


In practice, the people who the Act recognises and describes as ""…the most disadvantaged group in society…"" as a consequence of the dispossession of their lands have had to rely on one of the longest and most complex pieces of Australian legislation to try to ""…secure their advancement…"" and to recognise and protect (not establish) their pre-existing rights.


In two decades since its introduction, only a handful of native title claims have been resolved, with many of these being in remote areas which had been of little interest to European colonists. For the majority of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, particularly those in urban areas and regional centres, native title has offered little and delivered less.


Meanwhile the promised complementary measures have also been a grave disappointment—the land fund has only been able to help out a limited number of communities, and the social justice package never eventuated.


It is clear that in the application and judicial interpretation of the NTA a huge gap has emerged between these original promises and intentions, and the on-the-ground experience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities seeking to have their native title rights recognised and protected.


Justice Kirby characterised the barriers to the recognition of native title rights as comparable to an impenetrable jungle, saying:


""It would be easy for the judicial explorer to become confused and lost in the undergrowth to which rays of light rarely penetrate. Discovering the path through this jungle requires navigational skills of a high order. Necessarily, they are costly to procure and time consuming to deploy. The legal advance that commenced with Mabo v Queensland, or perhaps earlier, has now attracted such difficulties that the benefits intended for Australia's Indigenous peoples in relation to native title land and waters are being channelled into costs of administration and litigation that leave everyone dissatisfied and many disappointed.""2


There are many who still believe that the recognition of rights to land, culture and resources through native title could provide a strong and sustainable basis for 'advancement' by underwriting and enabling community and economic development.


The former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, for instance, spoke of the capacity for respect for native title to provide a sturdy foundation for durable economic and social outcomes in his Apology speech.3


It is a tragic shame that neither his government nor its successor did anything to seek to strengthen and facilitate recognition of the native title rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to help make that vision a reality. Instead the only changes to native title laws we have seen recently have been those that either diminished native title rights or at the very least have failed to enhance the capacity of traditional owners to participate in securing meaningful outcomes.


This of course came on the back of over a decade of Coalition Government under John Howard that systematically wound back the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, diminished native title rights, and saw the scrapping of all the existing avenues for representation and decision making with the removal of ATSIC.


The challenge in moving forward is to make the vision of the apology a reality, to actively engage Aboriginal communities in policy development, decision making and community development. This also means recognising, as the Cape York Land Council put it, that ""[m]eaningful respect for native title as a valuable property right is part of the solution … not an impediment"".4




The impetus for reform



The impetus for this Bill arose from the interactions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and native title experts that took place in and around the 2009 inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the Native Title Amendment Bill 2009. A Bill which in and of itself had little to do with reforming native title to deliver better outcomes.


The discussions that took place around that Senate inquiry crystallised many of my long-standing concerns with the NTA which lead to a continuing dialogue on broader native title reform that has ultimately led to these reforms.


At the time of the introduction of the first 2009 Bill, the then Attorney General Robert McClelland stated that the intent of the Australian Government in introducing the Bill was ""… achieving more negotiated native title outcomes in a more timely, effective and efficient fashion"".5


The vast majority of the evidence tendered to that Senate inquiry supported the need for native title reform that would achieve more effective native title outcomes in a more timely and resource efficient manner but disagreed with the Attorney General's suggestion that the Government's reforms came anywhere near achieving those outcomes.


As Tony McAvoy of the National Native Title Council put it at the time:


""…the amendments that are proposed in this amendment Bill are not controversial. They may make some small difference but they are not going to make any vast change in the way in which native title matters are dealt with. There is not going to be any rush of settlement of native title applications as a result of any of these amendments.""6


The submissions to that inquiry identified a number of other possible reforms to the NTA that promised to address the barriers to timely and meaningful native title outcomes and went beyond the narrow agenda of the government's first 2009 Bill. These included addressing the 'burden of proof' through a rebuttable presumption of continuity,7 strengthening the requirements for parties to 'negotiate in good faith', and raising the threshold on extinguishment, among others.


Many of the issues raised in this inquiry were further discussed and developed in the Native Title Report 2009 of the Australian Human Rights Commission by the then Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma. This report made an important series of recommendations for native title reform, many of which have provided the basis for the reforms proposed within this Bill.


I note that this Bill does not cover all of the reforms recommended by Tom Calma, and includes a number of measures that he did not discuss at the time. While many of the good ideas can be attributed to Mr Calma and to others, I take full responsibility for the way they have been interpreted as legislative amendments. I commend the work of the former Commissioner and thank him sincerely for his efforts.


I would also like to thank the native title experts, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, land councils and representative bodies that have contributed their thoughts, ideas and comments to us in response to our inquiries and as part of the consultation process we undertook around the discussion paper and draft amendments proposing these reforms.




The right to negotiate also applies offshore



Item 2 seeks to improve procedural rights over offshore areas for native title holders. In doing so it seeks to address the contradiction between the existing provisions of subsection 26(3) of the NTA (that limits the right to negotiate to acts that relate to a place on the landward side of the mean high-water mark) and the fact that native title rights have been recognised to exist in offshore areas.8


This amendment is consistent with the views expressed by the then Attorney General Robert McClelland, who stated in 2009 that:


""When it comes to behavioural change, I accept that the Australian Government has to lead by example. I believe we are doing just that. For example, last year I announced that the Government will take a more flexible approach to recognising native title in Australia's territorial waters. The Australian Government now accepts that native title can exist out to the limits of the modern territorial sea, generally 12 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline. Given that the Government is involved in all claims over offshore waters, this approach should help bring about more negotiated settlements.""9


The limitation of procedural rights under subsection 26(3) that denies traditional owners a right to negotiate over future acts in offshore areas is clearly inconsistent with this recognition that native title can exist up to 12 nautical miles out to sea, and so item 2 of the Bill remedies this by repealing subsection 26(3) to remove this unnecessary contradiction and allow traditional owners the right to negotiate over acts that impact on their sea country.




Strengthening good faith negotiations



The future acts regime plays a crucial role in the manner in which traditional owners are able to exercise their native title rights, by governing the requirements placed on parties negotiating agreements concerning proposed activities. There has been sustained criticism of the manner in which the future acts regime has led to protracted and uncertain outcomes, and calls for the act to be amended to create stronger incentives for beneficial agreements and to achieve greater procedural fairness by striking a better balance between native title and non-native title interests.


To this end the amendments proposed in items 3 to 12 of this Bill expand on the current requirements for parties to negotiate 'in good faith' in relation to future acts.


Currently the burden of proof for proving the absence of good faith in negotiations is on the native title party, rather than the proponent of a proposed future act. This appears procedurally unfair as it is in effect the proponent who is effectively asserting that they have negotiated in good faith for the required period when they apply for a matter to be taken to arbitration.


Item 3 of this Bill seeks to strengthen the requirement to negotiate in good faith, in line with the recommendations of the Native Title Report 2009.10


The NTA as it stands prevents parties from resorting to an arbitral body, such as the National Native Title Tribunal, for a period of six months from the issue of a notice that the government intends to grant a mining tenement. This fixed negotiating period does not take into account the relative scope or difficulty of the proposed negotiations—it is the same irrespective of whether the parties have established previous agreements or are meeting for the first time, and irrespective of whether they are negotiating a single act or attempting to conclude an overarching agreement on a 'whole of claim' basis.


So on the one hand, parties who are undertaking complex negotiations in a genuine attempt to make efficient use of their time and resources to secure wide-scale agreements over large areas of land and multiple future acts need to do so within the six month limit (irrespective of the number of negotiations and the lack of resources of the native title representative body). On the other hand, proponents who are not inclined to enter into serious negotiations with native title holders can effectively stonewall and sit on their hands for six months, knowing they can then force the matter to arbitration without any requirement to demonstrate they have made all reasonable efforts to come to agreements.


To this end item 3 of this Bill substitutes a new paragraph 31(1)(b) which requires parties to negotiate in good faith for at least six months and to use all reasonable efforts to come to an agreement about the conditions under which each of the native title parties might agree to the proposed future act. As made clear in the evidence to the Inquiry, this provision does not limit the ability of parties to reach agreement within 6 months but it does require negotiation for at least 6 months before either party can apply to the Tribunal.


Item 4 inserts new subsections 31(1A)-(1C), providing clarification of what the requirement to negotiate in good faith really means.


The good faith negotiating requirements are one of the few legal safeguards that native title parties have to protect their native title interests under the NTA. While section 31 of the NTA seeks to oblige the parties to negotiate in good faith during the negotiating period, in practice it is virtually impossible for claimants to establish that a proponent is not acting in good faith. This is borne out by the decision of the Full Federal Court in the matter of FMG Pilbara v Cox11—a decision which substantially watered down the right to negotiate, to the extent that any negotiation in which the native title party cannot demonstrably prove bad faith is effectively considered to be a good faith negotiation.


Item 4 strengthens the requirement to negotiate in good faith by including explicit criteria for the type of negotiation activities that are indicative of good faith and clarifies that deceptive or unsatisfactory conduct is not a perquisite to demonstrate a failure to negotiate in good faith. Furthermore, it places a requirement on the arbitral body to consider the financial resources, and in the case of the native title party, the demands of cultural and religious practices, when considering whether a party has negotiated in good faith.


Item 7 reverses the onus of proof so that the party that is asserting good faith is the one that is required to prove it, by inserting a new subsection 31(2A).


Item 10 provides that a party may not apply to an arbitral body (under subsection 35(1)) until the party has first demonstrated good faith negotiations have taken place in accordance with section 31.




Strengthening coexistence by disallowing extinguishment



Another area where the NTA has failed to deliver is the manner in which the bar on extinguishment has been set too low. This has meant that in practice the principle of 'coexistence' of native title rights, which is clearly envisaged within the NTA, is too often brushed aside or ignored.


Item 13 of the proposed amendments seek to address this issue. Item 13 inserts new sections 47C and 47D. The new section 47C provides that in the case of National, State or Territory Parks, extinguishment is to be disregarded. Given the nature of national parks, it is appropriate for the non-extinguishment principle to apply and to allow for the co-existence of native title rights and interests. Chief Justice French has used the example of the vesting of a nature reserve on Crown land as one act which could be determined to have extinguished native title, where it would make sense to be able to disregard extinguishment and provide for an agreement between the traditional owners and the state to recognise native title rights in the interests of managing that reserve.12


New section 47D provides that at any time prior to a determination, the applicant and a government party can make an agreement that the extinguishment (or possible extinguishment) of native title rights and interests can be disregarded.


The current breadth and permanence of the extinguishment of native title through the provisions of the NTA is arguably unjustifiable, unnecessary and in breach of Australia's human rights obligations.13


Section 47 of the NTA provides a model for coexistence of native title and other rights on pastoral leases. The new sections in item 13 are consistent with the current application of the NTA, and allow the existing coexistence provisions to be extended to nature reserves and allow extinguishment to be disregarded by agreement in a wider range of circumstances.




Presumption of continuity



In practice, the bar for the recognition of native title rights has been set too high—with the onus of proof of cultural continuity being placed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and with evidence standards effectively mandating a reliance on the written accounts of European colonists that deny the predominantly oral nature of Indigenous cultures.


As the Australian Human Rights Commission argued in its submission to the 2009 Senate Inquiry:


""It cannot be disputed that Indigenous peoples lived in Australia prior to colonisation and that the Crown was responsible for the dispossession of Indigenous peoples throughout Australia.


It has also been acknowledged by governments over time through various policies, laws and statements of recognition, including the creation of land rights regimes and other mechanisms, that Indigenous peoples are the Traditional Owners of the land.


It is in this context that the Commission argues that it is unjust and inequitable to continue to place the demanding burden of proving all the elements required under the Native Title Act on the claimants.""


The issue of prior occupation and hence the pre-existence of native title rights is not being questioned (as the preamble to the NTA readily acknowledges) and so under these circumstances it seems to be 'fundamentally discriminatory'14 and a gross injustice to place the burden of proof upon the dispossessed. This is particularly true when we consider that it is State and Commonwealth Governments that have granted the rights that have led to the possible extinguishment of native title, and that it is those governments who hold many of the historic records needed to establish connection.


The intent of providing for a rebuttable presumption of continuity is to shift the burden of proof in a way that encourages government parties (who must now take on the role of adducing evidence in their archives to rebut presumptions) to be more inclined to settle claims with a strong prospect of success—rather than dragging them out in the Federal Court as they are currently entitled to do.


Item 14 of our proposed amendments to the NTA seeks to address this issue, by putting into legislation amendments suggested by Chief Justice French15 that reverse the burden of proof to create a rebuttable presumption of continuity.


Moving to resolve more native title cases by consent determination could result in timelines being 'streamlined beyond recognition' and costs being 'reduced out of sight'.16 However, as the Native Title Report 2009 points out,17 a respondent would still be able to defeat a native title claim due to the operation of section 223, by providing appropriate evidence.


We have adopted a suggestion from the Law Council of Australia to insert new section 61AB clarifying that a court may determine that section 223 has been met notwithstanding substantial interruption of or significant change to traditional laws and customs if the interruption or change resulted from the action of a State or a Territory or a person or a party who is not an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander.




Definition of ' traditional '



As described in the second reading speech to my original Bill, in practice, the manner in which 'traditional' culture is defined by section 223 of the Act fails to recognise the dynamic and living nature of Indigenous Australian cultures. Instead it seeks to freeze culture in some pre-colonial past, which defines traditional culture based on a snap-shot of cultural practices at the time of European settlement and an expectation that they should continue unchanged. This ignores the fact that by their very nature the cultures of Australia's first nations were geared towards adapting to and surviving in an often harsh environment, not to mention the substantial efforts and resources expended by successive governments aimed at forcing or encouraging changes in behaviour.


This limited and unrealistic definition of 'traditional' means that in practice it is far too easy for a respondent to rebut the presumption of continuity by establishing a law or a custom is no longer practiced in exactly the same way it was at the point of colonisation. A more sensible and realistic definition of traditional culture would be one that ""encompasses laws, customs and practices that remain identifiable through time""18 and allows at law for an appropriate level of adaptation to the changing circumstances brought about by colonisation.


The narrow application of section 223 has created insurmountable barriers to cultural resurgence as clearly seen by the Noongar, Larrakia, Wongatha and Yorta Yorta cases. In practice, the policy decision to narrowly interpret continuity and traditional practice under section 223 in the Yorta Yorta19 case has created a situation which directly contradicts the original objects of the NTA—in that it means that there is no opportunity to raise the role of past injustices in the interruption of cultural continuity in an Act whose every intent is to provide remedy to those injustices.


Where a group has revitalised its culture, laws and customs by actively seeking out and recovering those elements of cultural continuity driven underground by dispossession, forced relocation, or the removal of children, a comparatively minimal interruption to the sharing of that culture across the claimant group should not be sufficient to prevent the recognition of native title rights.


This state of affairs is clearly at odds both with the stated intentions of the NTA and Australia's international human rights commitments. On this basis it would be sensible to empower the Court to disregard any interruption in the observance of traditional laws and customs where it is in the interests of justice to do so.


Item 18 of our proposed amendments inserts new subsections 223(1A), (1B), (1C) and (1D) which provide clarification of the definition of 'traditional' to ensure that the interpretation of what counts as ongoing Indigenous culture and law is based on a more realistic understanding of the maintenance and continuity of traditional practices and cultural values over time. This should help ensure that communities who have maintained a strong connection to their lands, laws, cultural practices and values will not have their recognition discounted based on changes which do not fundamentally alter the core of their cultural identity as traditional custodians of their land and sea country.




Commercial rights and interests



As mentioned in the second reading speech to my original Bill, in practice, the rights native title have delivered have also not been strong or complete enough to effectively provide 'for the advancement' of traditional owners or to provide a basis for economic and cultural development as they have not provided an unambiguous and exploitable right to land and resources.


Currently there is no mechanism to provide for the recognition of commercial rights to enable agreement making that delivers on the stated intent of the NTA ""for securing the adequate advancement … of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders"" by providing a vehicle for social and economic development. Furthermore, courts have appeared to take a view of customary Indigenous laws that does not properly recognise existing cultural economies and effectively distinguishes between customary or cultural rights and commercial ones.


This is at odds with a wealth of existing evidence of customary trade rights and practices which were based in customary rights to resources—including aquaculture, trade in clay and ochres and turtle shells, as well as crafts such as baskets and spears. It also includes strong evidence of a long-term trade relationship with Macassan fishermen from Indonesia.


Many have argued that Aboriginal communities should be able to use their native title rights to leverage economic development. To achieve that the NTA needs to strengthen the rights of native title holders, but amendments to date have largely confined themselves to those that reduce the rights of native title holders.


The Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, has spoken of his ""determination to ensure that the Aboriginal people of Australia finally get a fair go where their land is concerned"" and went on to say that ""the land which Aboriginal people have secured is obviously a cultural and spiritual asset but it should also be an economic asset."" On the face of it, it would seem in principle that there should be broad support for these measures.


To this end, item 19 the Bill provides that native title rights and interests can be of a commercial nature, removing what is an unnecessary impediment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples’ economic development.




Conclusion



As with our previous Bill, the reforms contained in this legislation put forward clear and specific measures to address a number of key areas of interest to native title claimants.


They address the barriers claimants face in making the case to demonstrate their pre-existing native title rights and interests and they tackle some of the procedural issues within the future acts regime that restrict the ability of native title holders to assert and exercise their native title rights.


As we stated before, native title has the potential to play an important role as a basis for the economic and community development of those of Australia's first peoples who have been able to maintain their connection to their traditional lands and culture in the face of dispossession.


It is clear that the original intention of the Parliament was that the Native Title Act would 'rectify the consequences of past injustices' and secure their 'adequate advancement and protection'; however, it is equally clear that in its application this complex area of law has failed to deliver on those hopes.


The strong relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their land and sea country should provide a firm basis on which to strengthen their culture and build their future. To make this happen, native title reform is needed.


The Native Title Amendment (Reform) Bill 2014 is an important first step on that path—I commend it to the Senate.

 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (15:47):  Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  The motion authorises publication of the annexures provided to the former Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee by Fair Work Australia in its report on the investigation into the national office of the Health Services Union. The documents comprise thousands of pages unearthed during the investigation into former Labor MP and convicted union thief, Craig Thomson.


It should be noted that these annexures were suppressed until now by the Labor Party, then in government, and the Greens, first in the committee and then in a vote in the Senate which took place on 12 September 2012. It has been reported that these documents include a memo in which Mr Thomson, probably in his own handwriting, misrepresented $770 worth of sexual services obtained from Internat Immobilaire, the business name for Boardroom Escorts, as a dinner function for which he claimed reimbursement from the HSU.


I understand the Leader of the Opposition initially intended to again oppose the release of these documents. The amendment moved by Senator Faulkner is nothing more than a fig leaf to cover the opposition's embarrassment at having suppressed these documents for so long. (Time expired)

  The statement made by Senator Fierravanti-Wells about the Leader of the Opposition is not accurate. I can say to the Senate that the amendment I have moved is about good Senate and good parliamentary process. It is not about partisan, or cheap, politics. It takes account of the Senate's sub judice convention, the volume of material and the time that material has been held by the Senate. Of course it takes account of the public interest. For the record, I have absolutely no interest in protecting Craig Thomson; I never, never have. I think the approach with the amendment moved by the opposition enables good process and full transparency.

  Senator Fierravanti-Wells just blatantly misled the Senate in terms of the suppression of documents. The documents were not suppressed. In fact, the Senate should be informed that Senator Fierravanti-Wells had complete and total access to every one of those documents. She spent a week or so in a room going through those documents, making copies, taking notes and taking recordings. There is no way that she can get up in this place and suggest to the Senate that these documents were suppressed. They were not suppressed. They were available to every senator. For her to suggest that a decision of the entire committee was a suppression by the Labor Party is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. She should be ashamed of herself. She should have more respect for Senate committee processes than she has just demonstrated in her ridiculous outburst. It is blatantly untrue.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2014-03-04,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:09):  I rise to speak in favour of the motion as put forward by Senator Siewert. This is a really important issue for us to discuss in this place today. I know, when we have in the past had debates around the issue of how Australia deals with and manages the flow of asylum seekers and what we do to help offer protection to refugees, often the level of debate in this place is very low. Often it becomes all about the politics of the issue rather than about understanding the fate of the people whom we are incarcerating in detention. There will be discussion, of course, as to how people arrived. We know that, under this government, even the terminology that is used in relation to how those asking for our help arrive here is negative: all government officials have been directed to refer to them as 'illegal'. In fact, they are not illegal at all. They are asylum seekers. They are people who are asking for refuge. They are not illegal. There is nothing in Australian law that says they are illegal—nothing but a directive from the immigration minister.


I do not want to spend the next hour in this place in an ugly debate, in what is often a very toxic discussion, around asylum seekers and refugees. What I want to do here today is talk about a very serious incident that occurred at the Manus Island detention centre only two weeks ago. A young man died. That young man's name is Reza Barati, a 23-year-old from Iran. He came to Australia as an asylum seeker, asking Australia to assess his claim. For all asylum seekers, there is a process they need to go through in order to be given permanent protection or, if they are not owed protection, to find them a safe way to be sent home. Now, Mr Barati had not even had his asylum seeker claim assessed because not one of the people who are detained at Manus Island have had their asylum seeker claims assessed, processed or judged in any way.


The incident that occurred on Manus Island two weeks ago resulted in the death of this young man. It also resulted in the serious injury of dozens of others. Seventy-seven people suffered injuries as a result of the incident. We do not know all the facts of what happened on that night or on the night before, when the first reports of an incident inside the detention centre started coming out to the Australian public and through the media. We do not know all the facts—



Senator Seselja interjecting—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  because the government is not releasing all the facts.



Senator Seselja interjecting—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Mr Deputy President, if you could ask the senator on the other side to desist so I can at least hear myself think.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will ask all senators involved in interjection to desist.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. What we do know is that a young man has died. We know that dozens of others have been injured. Many staff involved in the incident wish to tell their stories of what happened—many of them traumatised themselves by the incident—but they are not allowed to speak because as contractors to the immigration department they have all signed confidentiality agreements. We will not know all the facts as to what occurred that night. There is of course a review being run by the immigration department and there is an investigation underway in PNG. Neither of those investigations will, I believe, shed light on what really happened that night at the Manus Island detention centre. It is one of the reasons why we need a parliamentary inquiry, and I hope that we can establish that when the Senate votes on that motion, which will be put forward by the Greens tomorrow.


We know that this whole policy of deterrence is designed to break people. It is designed to be as harsh as possible, to force people to choose between two hells: either live in the hell that is the Manus Island detention centre, where people are stripped of their rights, where they live in fear, or face the hell of being sent home, back to danger. That is the precise objective of this government's deterrence policy—to break people, to break people's spirits. And, unfortunately, it has done that. This young man was broken. Many others have been broken. And this is a country that has signed the refugee convention, a country that has said, 'We will look after those who come to our shore and assess their claims and, if they are genuine, we will take them in and look after them.' These people were under the care of the Australian government. The detention centre on Manus Island is funded by the Australian taxpayer. The contracts are signed by officials of the immigration department here in Australia. It is run in every sense by the Australian government. This man died in the care of the Australian government.


We know that the minister, in his first statements in relation to what happened on that day, misled the Australian people when he stood there and tried to blame the refugees and asylum seekers for causing the harm to themselves. He said that if people had not protested, if they had stayed inside the centre, this would not have happened to them. I think blaming the victim is one of the most sickening things I have seen the minister do. And I must say, this is a government that has been harsh all the way. They have not pretended about it; I will give them that. The Prime Minister says he does not want a wimp as an immigration minister. Well, he does not have a wimp; he has a bully. And we know that at the end of the day it is bullies who are usually the biggest wimps of all, because they are the ones who pick on the most vulnerable, who push them down, who push them away, who strip away their ability to speak up and have a voice. And that is exactly what this immigration minister is doing with this policy and exactly what this immigration minister did when he stood on day one after the death of a young man and blamed Mr Berati for his own death. What an appalling thing. What an appalling position for a leader within this parliament, a minister who is responsible for this person's care, to take.


We need more facts to come out in relation to this issue and here in this place we will not give up trying to get to the truth to what happened, holding the government to account for the responsibility they must take. We also need to make sure the staff in these places are looked after. Story after story of traumatised workers continues to come out. The brutality that was inflicted on the refugees that night shook Manus Island. Those staff need the right to speak out and to be protected too. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-03-04,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:17):  I rise to reject out of hand the assertion that there has been a failure of the Abbott government to respond adequately to the tragic incident on Manus Island as has been described by the first speaker. And I will place on record, if I may—as others in the coalition have done—that any event that causes the loss and death of any person and injury to others is entirely regrettable. There is no question about that. But, as is usual in the case of the particular senator who preceded me, she has rushed to conclusions long before she ever should have done in this circumstance.


Acting responsibly, the Abbott government has of course deferred to the Papua New Guinean authorities—the Papua New Guinea police and coroner. But, in addition to that, the PNG and Australian governments have both commissioned reviews into the events surrounding 16 and 17 February at the Manus offshore processing centre. The Australian government, of course, has directed that its review will be led by Mr Robert Cornall AO, a former secretary of the Attorney-General's Department and a very highly regarded bureaucrat in this country. He has been tasked to determine exactly what the facts are, to ensure that the facts are available to any authorities who will be called upon to take any action that might be required as a result, and to ensure that the department is provided with a clear recommendation on any improvements that are to be made—three very sound procedures that should take place.


I want to draw the attention of the chamber to the coalition's long-held policy in this whole area of which we speak. One need only go back to the previous coalition Prime Minister, Mr Howard, when he made the comment—which resounded around this country and still holds today—that:


We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.


One thing I will agree on with Senator Hanson-Young is that the coalition has been harsh. But the harshness has been and will continue to be on the people smugglers. We will continue to close down this evil trade in the movement of human beings. But we will also act—as has been the case for some years, when the coalition was previously in government and now that it is in government again—on the basis that the best way to protect these people is to make sure that they do not get on boats in the first place.


Regrettably, as we all know, since 2007-08 some 1,100 people have lost their lives in their attempts to come by boat to our shores. They are the ones we know about; it is probable that there are more. It is about one every second day. And, as has been said in this place, I think it has now been 71 or 72 days since we last had an asylum seeker vessel land on Australia's shores. If you average out those 1,100 people over that period of time, you could safely say that anything up to 35 people have avoided losing their lives under these circumstances.


What is of enormous concern to me in this whole debate is the fact that we conveniently ignore and overlook those genuine refugees who we know have been rotting for years in refugee camps approved by UNHCR to come to this country. I have had advice from an interested person in Western Australia about the corruption that goes on at the management level of those refugee camps. People who have been there for a long time in fact never get to the top of the queue, because payments are made to ensure that others jump that queue. That of course is where our concern needs to be, in my view. But, if we have a look at the evil trade these people smugglers have engaged in, we can see that in the life of the last government some 50,000 people arrived in over 800 boats.


In the last period of the Howard coalition government we had, I believe, four people in detention in 2007—and yet, at the time the coalition came back into government, we were dealing with some 30,000 people. We were looking at arrivals of two people per month in the last five years of the coalition government. Contrast that with some 3,000 people per month at the time we came back into government.


I will conclude with the observations of a young person, well known to me, who was on Christmas Island just prior to Christmas on the occasion of the arrival of yet another of these asylum seeker vessels. The point he made to me very strongly, as he watched these people come off the boats, was the obvious wealth of these people—from the clothing they were wearing, the sunglasses et cetera. He said of a group of Afghani men, whom he said certainly appeared to him to be of military bearing and military standing, that these were not your poor asylum seekers; they were quite clearly people who were coming to this place illegally— (Time expired)

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:23):  I do appreciate Senator Back's extraordinary insight into the military capabilities of refugees coming to Australia!


The Prime Minister has spoken about not having a 'wimp' in control of border security. What we do have now are real questions about who is actually in control. I, for one, am quick to acknowledge that I do not think there is anyone in this chamber who would take any other position than deep regret at the death of Reza Berati. I also suggest that everyone in this chamber appreciates the grief that his family would be feeling over the manner in which he was killed—while effectively in Australian custody. I am very concerned—and I am sure many other senators here are equally concerned—about the fear that his family would feel in terms of the response from authorities in Iran.


We also know that were dozens—we do not know how many, but we are quite clear from reports that there were many dozens—of people seeking safety in this country injured in the events that occurred on Manus Island on 16 and 17 February. These are the facts that I think are now beyond dispute. What we know is that the reports that have emerged all too clearly demonstrate that there are serious questions to be asked about the competence of the minister who is responsible for the operation of Manus Island and that there are serious questions about the management of the facilities at the core of Australia's immigration and border control policies. The questions keep piling up as I read the newspapers and listen to the reports. On the ABC this morning, for instance, we heard of an Australian employee of the contractor G4S, the security firm, who is making extraordinarily serious allegations about the conduct of the Papua New Guinea police on the night Mr Berati died.


For the sake of all involved, it is now important that we get to the bottom of what actually happened there as quickly as possible. The circus of secrecy that surrounds the government's policy and its administration, frankly, has to stop. When the tragic events of Manus Island were first reported by the minister himself, it has been demonstrated that the facts were totally wrong. To quote from his media conference of 18 February, he said:


This is a tragedy but this was a very dangerous situation where people decide to protest in a very violent way and to take themselves outside the centre and place themselves at great risk …


So what we were told, in a very blunt and unequivocal way, was that the asylum seekers themselves were responsible for what occurred. Then we wait until 8.44 on the following Saturday night, when a media statement is issued, at that very late hour, entitled 'Manus Island update'. And what was the substance of that update? That the minister had got it fundamentally wrong. 


A full five days after his initial report he sought to correct the record and to make it clear that the breach that led to the death of this particular asylum seeker, Mr Berati, actually occurred inside the compound—and that the perimeter itself had not been breached. He told us originally, if I may quote the proposition he advanced, that 'people would be safe inside the compound'. That was the assertion made: that we were dealing with transferees who breached the external perimeter. We now know that to be totally untrue. 


On 22 February the minister said:


Earlier this week I noted that when people co–operate and conduct themselves appropriately within the centre then we are able to provide for their safety. This is the most effective way to ensure the security of these facilities and safety of all those who are accommodated and work within the centre.


That is the statement made on the night on which the record was being corrected! It seems to me, on the basis of a normal reading of that statement, that we could be assured that violence and death took place beyond the scope of that guarantee. It does seem, on what we have heard since that time, that the guarantee itself was quite hollow—because the majority of what the minister called 'riotous behaviour' took place within the perimeter of the facilities themselves. o, as far as I am concerned, the implications are quite profound. Only someone like George Orwell could look at this statement and describe it as an update. What we now know is that the safety and wellbeing of everyone in the facility on Manus Island is an open question. I say that both in terms of the asylum seekers themselves and the staff. We now know that the situation was entirely chaotic—and that reflects the way this centre has been administered.


It is quite clear that Manus Island is absolutely at the centre of the arrangements in place to deter people from taking that risky voyage by sea. But, in terms of the effect of the establishment of Manus Island, we know that between 19 July and the time of the federal election there had been a 90 per cent reduction in the number of people seeking to travel by sea. But that in no way justifies any government breaching the guarantee of safety that people have a right to expect. It strikes me that we have a situation here where the minister has made this guarantee and it needs to be enforced. We need to ensure there is genuine substance behind such an assertion. That is why Labor has welcomed the government's announcement of the independent inquiry and we look forward with interest to its interim report in March. The public needs to see the full report. We owe this not just to the people who are now in our custody, and who have been exposed to this violence, but to every Australian in whose name we are acting.


I woke this morning to the reports on the ABC and I was horrified. The ABC told us this morning that local G4S staff were the first in, followed by local contract staff. A G4S employee was quoted as saying:


We saw them going in with machetes. They had anything they could pick up—rocks, sticks, the poles from the exercise weights. Once they knocked people to the ground, they were stomping on their heads with their boots. A day later you could still see guards and staff and cleaners walking around with blood on their boots.


   …   …   …


I just remember blood everywhere I looked. Blood everywhere.


I think anyone listening to that report this morning would be deeply concerned that these people were acting in our name. I cannot for the life of me understand why the government feels it is necessary to act in secrecy about these matters. It is not enough simply to wash your hands of responsibilities on these sorts of questions. But it entirely goes beyond what I think anyone would regard as reasonable— (Time expired)

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:33):  I support the contention in this matter of public importance that the Abbott government failed to adequately respond to the tragic incident on Manus Island that led to the death of Reza Barati and the serious injury of many other asylum seekers. It is about time that the hypocrisy we have heard in this place is brought to the fore. What we need is a royal commission into what has occurred. We need an inquiry that has judicial powers and can bring in the documents and the evidence and give witnesses the protection they need. But there is not the will in this place to have the truth told in its entirety. That is because the Labor Party in government re-opened Manus Island and made all kinds of claims in this place. Go back to the debate, which I was reading through. I wonder how Senator Lundy feels now when you look at the claims she made defending the Gillard government at the time, saying that all of the conditions would be met and it would meet our human rights obligations. She listed all the things that would occur and she gave endless undertakings—all wrong.


Then we had the next Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, engaged in a memorandum of understanding, and now we have disgraceful behaviour from the current minister and the government, and the cruelty goes on to the point where Reza Barati is dead. I have used the word 'murder' in his case, because what else do you call a situation when a person is in the direct care of the government of Australia and they are dead inside the compound and there are reports of people stomping on people's heads. That is not an accident. What do you call it if there is intent?


Now I get to the reports that Senator Carr mentioned this morning on the question of whether G4S staff are to blame for the Manus Island violence—the reports that the G4S guards allegedly opened the doors of the camp to a local dog squad and PNG police and so on and so forth. They are the reports, but I want to go to a more fundamental question, because I am sick of hearing this in this place. We are supposedly breaking people and destroying their mental health. We end up with Reza Barati dead, 70 people in hospital, bashings and cruelty. Why? Because we are stopping people from drowning. That is why. That is rubbish. This is not about stopping people drowning, and it is about time that truth was told to power. That is outrageous.


I want to go to that point right now. What has this government or the last government done to help people not get on boats? Number one: have they put more money into the UNHCR in Indonesia to assist? No, they have cut the funding. What about the humanitarian intake? Under the last government there was a promise to increase it, and what has this government done? They have decreased the humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 13,750. They have decreased the humanitarian intake and decreased the money in Indonesia. There is all the talk about people worrying about people drowning. That is not the case. You have never supported upholding the Safety of Life at Sea convention. When we questioned—



Senator Seselja interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Seselja, I have noted your name is on the list. You will have an opportunity later. Senator Milne, you have the call.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you. I appreciate that, Mr Deputy President. When the SIEVX sank, 353 people died. Why? Because the Howard government had stopped a program of allowing family reunion. Women and children were on that boat because they had no other way of joining the rest of their family in Australia. That was a policy decision designed to stop families being together and people had no hope except to be on that boat. To this day, we do not know whether they were allowed to drown. That is a question I have asked for very many years. I am making this very clear.




Senator Bernardi:
  That is shameful.




Senator MILNE:
  It is not shameful; it is truthful.




Senator Bernardi:
  You are a disgrace.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Bernardi, you are also on the list, I have noticed, so you will have an opportunity to comment.




Senator MILNE:
  To this day, the survivors of the SIEVX say that a ship came and put lights on the water. They started shouting and swimming towards the lights. The lights went off and the ship went away. That is what the survivors say. What did Australia know about where they were? Why were the ships not dispatched to rescue them? To this day every inquiry we have tried to get up into the SIEVX has been blocked, and so it goes on. We are involved in a cover-up over what has gone on on Manus Island. I say that because you have Prime Minister O'Neill in PNG saying:


Under agreement, all media queries relating to this deceased transferee are being handled by the Australian government. You have to direct your queries to Canberra …


Then we have an Australian government statement saying:


This is actually a police matter in PNG, so our role has been to support the PNG police in the investigation of a crime, and any matters that follow in relation to an autopsy or a coronial inquest are matters for the PNG government, and we have provided all the support that has been required for that. It is not a matter that is within our control.


So the Australian government puts in a detention centre, does its memorandum of understanding, says it is going to be in control, says it can guarantee safety, and then disaster occurs and it immediately says, 'It's actually up to the PNG government.' The PNG government brings out a statement saying, 'It wasn't our police. No—everything on our end was fine.' This is a cover-up and that is why we need a royal commission to get to the bottom of it, but we need to close that centre right now. If you had any sense of decency and humanity, that is what you would do.


I want to congratulate the 500 academics who signed an open letter to Prime Minister Tony Abbott. It says:


We believe that the current approach to dealing with asylum seekers arriving by boat, especially offshore detention and claims determination, is seriously flawed and unsustainable.


It breaches Australia's international legal obligations, including its obligations as a party to the Refugee Convention. It demonstrably harms the physical and psychological health of detainees.


Furthermore, it seriously undermines the status and good name of Australia as an international citizen.


We call on the Australian government to close the detention centres on Manus Island and in Nauru immediately.


Yours sincerely—


and it is signed by 500 academics in all kinds of academic pursuit around the country. I congratulate them and urge every Australian to stand up to this. It is a cover-up. We need it to be opened right up, but we need Manus Island and Nauru to be closed immediately. This is a disgrace to the nation. In future, people are going to look back and say, 'How did this parliament allow this to continue?' Frankly, Liberal and Labor are complicit in keeping Manus open and in keeping this an internal inquiry when it needs to be a royal commission.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2014-03-04,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:41):  I commence my contribution to this debate by saying how I wholeheartedly support Minister Scott Morrison in his dogged pursuit and determination to stop the people smugglers. He is ably assisted by our Senator Cash, the assistant minister in that capacity. I find it rather extraordinary that when even the Labor Party acknowledges that the government is focused on getting to the bottom of exactly what happened in the incident on Manus Island that led to the death of asylum seeker Reza Barati, the Greens somehow want to make political mileage out of it. The Labor Party have acknowledged that the government is taking appropriate steps to establish exactly what has happened. I do not particularly like the slant that Senator Carr put on it in his selective quotation of what the minister said in successive press conferences. Most of the comments that he made were about the advice that he received. He was constantly and continually updating members of the public and the press gallery as new advice came to hand. So it is a little disingenuous.


But I cannot stand here and let go some of the most grotesque slurs to have been cast upon a previous government, the comments by Senator Milne. To merely suggest that any government of this country would stand by or have their navy float by and watch people drown, as Senator Milne alleged in her grossly defamatory and I think hypocritical address, is an appalling assessment of the judgement of the Greens party. It is an unbelievable slur upon any government to suggest, as Senator Milne has done, that we would stand by and watch people drown for some sort of political expediency. That might be the standards by which you judge your own contribution, Senator Milne, but it is not the standard of contributions from those on this side of the chamber. The appalling hypocrisy of those in the Greens party is begat from their absolute jealousy and their outrage that policies are actually working, demonstrating that their ideas are simply as kooky as they have always been.


Senator Milne asked: 'What has this government done to stop the boats coming?' I could point to the track record that the boats are no longer arriving on Australian shores or in Australian waters, that we have not had an illegal boat arrival on Australian shores for countless days. I cannot believe that Senator Milne thinks that somehow that is a bad outcome.


There is further evidence which I read recently about how the price of a ticket for passage on a people-smuggling vessel has plummeted from $10,000 to $1,000 because the demand is drying up. But that would smell like success. They are unfamiliar with success in the Greens and they are jealous of it. They do not like our success because it exposes just how hollow their whole agenda is.


We have had no arrivals. We have had no drownings at sea. We have not seen 1,100 people drown, as happened under the policies of the previous government and their alliance with the Greens. We have not heard the dismissive, 'Accidents happen,' and 'Tragedies happen,' from the spokesperson for the Greens. We have not seen anything except for the fact that the policies implemented by this government are working.


Do you know how the Greens characterise it? They characterise it as some sort of reality TV show. It is like it is a soap opera to the Greens' spokesman. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young thought it was like an episode of Border Security or Sea Patrol. That is extraordinary. This is the national parliament. We are debating the sovereignty of Australia's borders and the right of people to come to this—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would like Senator Bernardi to correct the record seeing as the Hansard for Senate estimates does not prove that at all.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. That is a debating point.




Senator BERNARDI:
  YouTube will testify—I should send it to you, actually, Mr Deputy President—how Senator Hanson-Young thought that our border protection officers were part of Sea Patrol, that fictitious drama series.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Bernardi is misleading the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. That is a debating point.




Senator Seselja:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Not only is that not a point of order; the senator should actually withdraw. She cannot make that claim. There are formal procedures for making such claims.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have ruled on the point of order. There was no point of order.




Senator BERNARDI:
  What we have is the Greens' spokesman on this matter cavalierly dismissing—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: I am not a man.




Senator BERNARDI:
  I think she is withdrawing, Mr Deputy President. I think she is going to withdraw her spurious allegations.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! I indicate to Senator Hanson-Young and other senators that spurious points of order will not be tolerated. Points of order are to be utilised for important purposes.




Senator BERNARDI:
  What we have all of a sudden is the arrogance and outrage of Senator Hanson-Young because not only has her policy position been exposed as the folly that it is; there is also the not-so-small matter that our policy is working. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young is upset because everything that she has built her political career around—faux crocodile tears, the Sea Patrol issues, the dismissal of people drowning at sea and the grotesque accusation from Senator Milne, which was that we stood by and were prepared to watch people drown—has been false. It has been built on a house of cards, on the lie that somehow if we had a more compassionate policy it would stop the boats. That is not true. Our policy is compassionate. It is compassionate because it stops the boats. It takes away the people smugglers' product. It puts back into the Australian government's hands the determination of who should participate in our generous humanitarian refugee program. It puts the people smugglers out of business. If the Australian people are serious about a humanitarian immigration program then they will salute the fact that we have regained control of it. They can see firsthand the dangers of extremists who have really no ideas grounded in reality and the implications of the kooky policies of the Greens, who have made some truly vile suggestions today.


In conclusion, we as a collective in this Senate should be appalled at the death of any individual who is seeking asylum in this country. We should be appalled, and there is no question about it. It is hard. It is very tough on the minister. I know he takes it to heart, as do we all. The simple fact is that it is better to have an orderly immigration program than one in which hundreds, maybe thousands, of people could perish at sea. This is the great tragedy of it. We are doing our best. The Australian people have asked us to go in and fix up the mess that was created by the policy agenda of the previous government, together with the Greens. It is time that we took stock of that. That is why I appreciate the Labor Party saying that the government have taken appropriate steps to inquire into this. I would ask the Greens to reflect on their politicising of a tragic event. (Time expired)

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:49):  I support the contention in this matter of public importance that the Abbott government failed to adequately respond to the tragic incident on Manus Island that led to the death of Reza Barati and the serious injury of many other asylum seekers in the detention facility on that island. I reiterate my Labor colleague Senator Carr's remarks on the question of who is in control of immigration policy in this government and in this country, because there is a serious question over the minister's competence. There is a serious question about the grip that he has on his portfolio and the way he has handled the Manus Island detention facility incident. Those questions loom large. There are still no answers from the minister. All we had were emphatic statements when the tragic event first happened—and then later they turned out, as we know, to be totally wrong. The minister tried to hide by correcting the record in the dead of night. This is not the behaviour of somebody who should be managing an incredibly important facility that I am sure the government would call the cornerstone of their border protection policy. There remain questions looming large as to the minister's competence in the way he is handling this facility and his entire portfolio.


The minister initially said that these matters happened outside the perimeter of the facility and that if asylum seekers were going to breach the perimeter then that was going to be a matter for them. But at the same time as he said that, he gave a guarantee of safety that, if they stayed inside the boundaries of that facility, he could guarantee their safety. Clearly he could not. We are still waiting, though, for that truth to be told.


This circus of secrecy around this government's border protection policy must stop. It has been going on since this government came to power—secrecy not only in this policy but across the board in a number of portfolio areas. When it comes to this circus of secrecy, though, it is probably in this area that it has been the most profound. People in this country have a right to know what is going on and the minister should be out there telling them exactly that. Instead, the grip that he has on his portfolio is very weak and, while this secrecy continues, becoming weaker by the day. The public want to know what is happening and how people are being treated in Australia's name. They have every right to know that. He is a minister of the Crown, he is the minister for immigration, and it is under his watch that this has occurred. It is under his watch that someone's life has been taken and that a number of asylum seekers have been injured.


The government cannot keep hiding from the public because, as we already know, information is coming out, regardless of the minister ducking and weaving and not letting the public know anything. We heard this morning, through the ABC's AM program, about a G4S staff member who has spoken out about the situation. Chris Uhlmann reported on that program that not only are asylum seekers incredibly traumatised by what has occurred but G4S staff themselves are also incredibly traumatised. He said:


Some have left the island suffering from serious post-traumatic stress and one … has spoken to the ABC … and says the situation is now so tense that the asylum seekers are refusing to have anything to do with local staff.


In fact, the G4S guard said that asylum seekers now feel so unsafe that, when they tried to bring local cleaners in the day after the incidents, it just about started another riot. The asylum seekers now want nothing to do with any of the locals. That is how tense the current environment is and remains on Manus Island. We have had three very serious incidents since Minister Morrison became minister, since the Abbott government came to power. The most recent, though, is this one which resulted in a young man tragically losing his life. What we have is a minister who simply has no idea what is going on, or at least is not willing to tell the public about it.


The question remains: where does the minister's guarantee of safety now stand? How can he enforce the statement that he made about a guarantee of safety? I may stand here and wish that Manus Island and the detention facility did not exist, that the death of Reza Berati did not happen and that the injuries and the trauma caused to asylum seekers and staff did not occur. But it does exist and these events did happen. The detention facility on Manus Island exists today—and I am sure it will tomorrow as well—but we need to ensure that people who are within our jurisdiction are provided with the highest level of safety. Yes, they may be on Manus Island, but they are still within our jurisdiction. That is something that must happen under this government's watch—under this parliament's watch. That is what is definitely owed after the tragic events that have occurred in the last week.


Yes, Labor does welcome the announcement of an independent inquiry. That will go some way towards getting to the bottom of what has occurred and we do look forward to an interim report as soon as possible—I think this month. The Australian public also needs to see that inquiry so that everyone can understand where the government is going wrong in its management of this facility and what steps are being taken to fix this mismanagement. Why? Because this is about human dignity. This is about taking ownership of what has occurred. 


This is happening under Minister Morrison's watch. He is the minister. He needs to take ownership of what has occurred. He needs to ensure that such a riot—such an event—does not occur again. He needs to quell the fear, the trauma and the disquiet that now remains in the Manus Island detention centre. He needs to provide the public with some reassurance that this simply is not going to happen again. He also needs to deal with the atmosphere, which we have heard from the ABC's AM program is now so tense that it will not take anything much to potentially kick off another round of unrest. Surely the minister does not want that on his watch. Surely he is doing all that he can to ensure that such an event does not occur again.


The other concern I have is whether there were unaccompanied minors on Manus Island during this riot. I did ask a question during Senate estimates regarding unaccompanied minors. As the minister has said himself, it is not an appropriate place for children. I was given an answer by the secretary of the department, Mr Bowles, that there were no unaccompanied minors on Manus Island. But we know, from the Amnesty International report that came out in December, that there had been reports of at least two or three unaccompanied minors on Manus Island. It is certainly my hope that there were not any there during this riot. Having said that, for anyone there it was certainly a terrible tragedy that they should never have had to endure. I hope it never happens again.

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2014-03-04,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:00):  Today, we discuss the government's policy to process asylum seekers on Manus Island. The bad idea of processing asylum seekers on Manus Island was the brainchild of one of the previous ALP governments. The new, coalition government, however, has taken to this policy like a duck to water and has done very little in attempting to advance the wellbeing of those who are held in detention.


The precise circumstances which led to the sad death of Mr Reza Barati may not be known at this time by the government, but what is known is that Mr Barati's death took place in an atmosphere of anguish and perpetual suffering for over a thousand asylum seekers in offshore detention and, to a lesser extent, in onshore detention.


The issues surrounding Manus Island are too numerous to mention in this debate. However, recent reports state that there has been limited drinking water for asylum seekers, with some figures suggesting that people have had to get by on as little as two cups of water per day. Taking into consideration the environmental conditions, this is completely unacceptable, if it is true.


Amnesty International reported last year that men would often have to wait in queues for up to five hours in order to access food or toilets. However, what many find most astounding is that these people—people who have done nothing wrong other than seek asylum, people who just want peace and stability for them and their families—are being detained without even being given a sentence. They do not even know how long they will be there—weeks, months or years.


Earlier today, I put forward a motion calling on the government to work more closely with Indonesia to stop people attempting the treacherous journey to Australia by boat. I am not against people seeking asylum; I simply want them to act safely and proportionately to the circumstances in which they find themselves. There are currently thousands of asylum seekers in Indonesia, and many of them are there due to previous Australian and Indonesian government policies. We need to step up to the plate now and be fair. We need to take on board more of those people already in our region who are seeking asylum and help them get their lives on track within Australia. 


And that leads me to my last point. The last point that I called on the government to adhere to in my motion this afternoon, which was supported by the Greens, was that we should be processing people here. The Abbott government is telling us all to live within our means. Well, it was made very clear at Senate estimates last week, that it would be much cheaper for asylum seekers to be processed onshore and in community detention than the way we are currently doing things.


We need to start being sensible about the issue of asylum seekers. We must act in a balanced, dignified, safe and compassionate manner. We must ensure that we take some responsibility for the wrongs committed by the global community of which we are part. I acknowledge Senator Back's comments that there are people offshore in camps, who have been there for decades—maybe like the Karen people on the Thai-Burma border. What are we doing to bring them here?

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-03-04,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:03):  I start by offering my condolences to the family of Reza Barati. I echo the condolences that the government has expressed for this tragedy. I also congratulate Minister Morrison. I join with other coalition members in rejecting the premise and the intent of this MPI that we are debating today.


Minister Morrison, in very difficult circumstances, is doing the job that the Australian people asked him to do and which the Prime Minister has asked him to do—that is, to regain control of our borders and to stop the flow of illegal boats. Minister Morrison is doing that job in very difficult circumstances, despite the protestations of some of those opposite. I think we should take the time to reflect on the fact that the job of stopping the boats and stopping the drownings is now underway. Minister Morrison deserves praise for that rather than many of the false criticisms that have been tossed around, particularly by the Greens but also by members of the Labor Party.


Let's go to the substance of this issue. The facility on Manus Island was established by Labor. It was established with bipartisan support from the coalition. There was a disturbance with a tragic death at the end of that. The minister gave information as it arose, and where he was advised that information was incorrect he corrected the record, giving constant updates in relation to the information that was coming.


The government, as has been stated already, has commissioned a review by Robert Cornall, which will look into all the circumstances of this tragedy. Unlike some of those opposite, particularly the Greens, we will not be prejudging that investigation. That investigation should be allowed to take its course. 


What I will not do is allow the Greens to lecture the coalition on compassion and effective policy in this area. I will not accept that. I will go to what Senator Hanson-Young said at the start of her address. She said that she wanted to raise the tone. I agree: we should raise the tone. We should raise the tone above statements like Senator Milne's, which was that he was murdered. We should raise the tone above the statement of Adam Bandt, which was that we killed him. We should raise the tone. We should raise the tone above what we hear constantly from those opposite. We should raise the tone above Senator Hanson-Young's statement in response to deaths at sea. When asked whether she took any responsibility she said, 'Of course not; tragedies happen. Accidents happen.' How simple it was when the Labor Party and the Greens were running things and 1,100 people drowned.


Senator Hanson-Young's response, in those circumstances was that tragedies happen, accidents happen and that she does not take any responsibility. I think we should raise the tone and we should—



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  It is interesting, isn't it: no responsibility for the policies that you supported—no responsibility whatsoever. I agreed with the former minister Tony Burke when the Labor Party belatedly acknowledged that the policies were not working. He said, and I agree with this statement:


There is nothing compassionate in a policy where you see people drowned at sea.


…   …   …


In the first place, if it does have an impact on the number of people risking their lives on the high sea, that is a massive difference and compassion can't be limited to who is in your line of sight. The people who drown on the way here don't end up giving interviews.


No, they do not. Tony Burke was right: there is nothing compassionate about the kinds of policies that were pursued for most of the time that the Labor Party was in government and are still advocated by the Greens and were advocated right the way through this motion.


We are faced with choices. We can go down the path that the former government went down and we can see what results they got. What were those results? Fifty thousand people arrived illegally on 800 boats; more than 1,100 people tragically perished at sea—one every two days; more than 6,000 children had their lives put at risk by making the dangerous journey to Australia; and more than 14½ thousand desperate people have been denied a precious resettlement place under our offshore humanitarian program because, under the former government and the Labor-Greens policy, those places were taken by people who arrived illegally by boat. This is about choices. We have a choice as to whether we want to revisit what happened over the last six years, with all of the tragic consequences, or whether we implement policies which stop the boats—because when we stop the boats, we stop the drownings.


Some of those opposite might want to pretend that those 1,100 people who drowned do not matter. I do not accept that. Just as this one death was a tragedy and we need to get to the bottom of it and develop policy responses to make sure it does not happen again, those 1,100 deaths were a tragedy. We are putting in place policy responses to make sure it does not happen again.


You have to ask the question: do the Greens want the policy to fail? It would appear from everything we have heard that they do, because, at no point in any of their contributions either in this place or elsewhere, have they said, 'Isn't it good that people are not risking themselves on that journey in the numbers that they were? Isn't it good that we haven't seen any drownings for the last few months because the boats are stopping?' Isn't that a good thing? Shouldn't we be celebrating that? If you genuinely cared, you would have it within yourself to say, 'Yes, it's a good thing.' We will get to the bottom of this tragedy, but let's stop the thousands of tragedies that we saw under six years of Labor-Greens government in the past.

 (Western Australia) (17:12):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the third report of the 44th Parliament of the committee on the examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SMITH:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This third report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in the 44th Parliament sets out the committee's consideration of 17 bills introduced during the period 11 to 27 February 2014, 87 legislative instruments received between 1 and 21 February 2014, and seven responses relating to 20 bills and legislative instruments on which the committee had commented in its first report of the 44th Parliament.


The committee considers that seven of the bills and 81 of the legislative instruments it has considered do not give rise to human rights concerns. The committee has identified nine bills, two legislative instruments and a number of responses for which it will seek further information before forming a view on compatibility with human rights.


In considering the legislation that comes before it, the committee strives to provide advice to the parliament in as timely a matter as possible so as to inform the consideration of legislation. At a recent symposium on the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011, I had the opportunity to reflect on the role of the committee and its work to date. In the course of my address, I noted expectations that the committee, together with the requirement for statements of compatibility, would play a significant role in ensuring that human rights are explicitly and systematically taken into account in the legislative process.


A key element of the committee's work is the dialogue it maintains with executive agencies regarding the consideration of human rights in the development of policies and legislation. The committee's concern is to ensure that statements of compatibility provide adequate analysis and explanation of any proposed limitations on rights. At the same time, the committee's work is squarely focused on the consideration of legislation by the parliament. The committee not only aims to complete its work while legislation is still under active consideration by the parliament but seeks to draw its work to the attention of other parliamentary committees charged with examining particular bills and instruments at the earliest opportunity.


The committee's comments on legislation are intended to draw the parliament's attention to any potential conflicts with Australia's human rights obligations and to contribute to the effective identification and consideration of human rights implications throughout the legislative process.


I noted the committee's efforts to ensure that its reports are clearly expressed, not overly legalistic and reasonably accessible. I also observed that there is some considerable scope for enhancing parliament's consideration of human rights and stated that, in the 44th Parliament, the committee intends to focus greater attention on enhancing the parliament's awareness and understanding of human rights issues. With this in mind, I would like to take this opportunity to advise the Senate that, of the bills considered in this report, those which are scheduled for debate during this current sitting week include:


the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Bill 2014;


the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment Bill 2014;


the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013; and


the Higher Education Support Amendment (Savings and Other Measures) Bill 2013.


I can also advise that the committee has decided to defer its consideration of the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014, which was introduced on 27 February 2014, to enable closer consideration of the human rights implications of the bill.


The committee is mindful that not all parliamentarians are familiar with human rights and that most of us are not legally trained. The committee has therefore given some thought to how it can assist parliamentarians to develop their understanding of human rights issues and make effective use of the committee's reports in their work within the parliament.


The committee has developed a plain-English guide to human rights which it intends to publish on its website. This guide focuses on 25 of the key rights found in the seven treaties against which the committee considers questions of human rights compatibility.


The guide is not intended to be comprehensive or legalistic. It is intended to complement other human rights sources, in particular guidance and resource material available on the Attorney-General's Department's website and on the Australian Human Rights Commission's website. It is intended to provide a short and accessible overview of the key rights that the committee considers when examining legislation, includes examples to illustrate how each right can be applied in practice and points to other information and sources that may assist those seeking a more comprehensive analysis of the rights discussed.


A further way in which the committee is able to contribute to the consideration of human rights within the parliament is through its ability to undertake thematic inquiries into legislation that raises significant or complex human rights questions. The committee's ability to look at acts has provided it with the flexibility to give careful consideration to key human rights concepts, even after legislation has been passed by the parliament, while at the same time retaining a strong practical focus for its work.


In the 43rd Parliament, our predecessor committee applied this approach to its examination of the Stronger Futures package of legislation and used its 11th report of 2013 to set out its understanding of the concept of special measures and the circumstances in which special measures may be permitted, or required, under human rights law.


In considering those measures described as special measures in the Stronger Futures legislation, the committee noted the importance of continuing close evaluation of such measures and concluded that the committee could usefully perform an ongoing oversight role in this regard. The committee recommended that in the 44th Parliament the committee should undertake a 12-month review to evaluate the latest evidence in order to evaluate the continuing necessity for the Stronger Futures measures.


I am pleased to advise the Senate that the committee has given careful consideration to our predecessor committee's recommendation and has decided to undertake a review of the Stronger Futures package of legislation commencing in June 2014. In preparation for this review, the committee proposes to write to the minister advising him of its intention to undertake this review, invite him to respond to the conclusions drawn by our predecessor committee in its 11th report of 2013 and alert him to the range of information the committee will seek from him and his department as part of the review. The committee proposes to report the conclusions of this review in 2015.


Finally, I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of all members of the committee, to acknowledge the work of the current committee secretary, Ms Jeanette Radcliffe, who is leaving the secretariat. Ms Radcliffe has been the secretary of the committee since its inception and has done an outstanding job supporting both the current and the previous committees.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (17:12):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the third report of the 44th Parliament of the committee on the examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator SMITH:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This third report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in the 44th Parliament sets out the committee's consideration of 17 bills introduced during the period 11 to 27 February 2014, 87 legislative instruments received between 1 and 21 February 2014, and seven responses relating to 20 bills and legislative instruments on which the committee had commented in its first report of the 44th Parliament.


The committee considers that seven of the bills and 81 of the legislative instruments it has considered do not give rise to human rights concerns. The committee has identified nine bills, two legislative instruments and a number of responses for which it will seek further information before forming a view on compatibility with human rights.


In considering the legislation that comes before it, the committee strives to provide advice to the parliament in as timely a matter as possible so as to inform the consideration of legislation.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2014-03-04,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:20):  I seek leave to make a statement in relation to the government's tabling of the modelling outlining the economic costs and benefits of the Korean free trade deal.


Leave granted. 




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I start by thanking Senator Cormann, the Minister for Finance, for providing the information that we sought relating to the modelling of the Korean free trade deal. Free trade deals are one of the biggest items on this government's agenda. The Greens have been very vocal about our desire to see a more mature and balanced debate relating to free trade in Australia. I am pleased to have received the information on the modelling. In discussions with DFAT at estimates last week, they acknowledged that the modelling that has been completed was not put out to tender because it was below the $80,000 threshold and that the modelling itself was limited. The modelling factors in trade in goods between the two countries but not trade in services. Essentially, it looks at changes to tariff structures and impacts on different industries. The modelling itself is not capable of looking at the inherent complexities involved in trade deals, especially in relation to areas such as ISDS, investor-state dispute settlements, and what impacts they have on, for example, future trade flows and investment flows between nations. It is, as I expected, a fairly limited modelling arrangement. Why I am talking about it is not because I am grandstanding here. It is an economic model. I have taught quantitative methods and I understand the limitations.


The issue I have is that the government is out spruiking this free trade deal. Just on Q&A last night, a Liberal MP was talking about a $5 billion-a-year boost to the Australian economy and multiple jobs. I think this is the risk that we run with this free trade agreement. That is why I wanted to see the modelling. Because if we are out there talking about free trade, we should also be acknowledging that trade—let us put aside the word 'free' for a second—has risks. This was clearly reflected by the Productivity Commission in what was probably the most comprehensive report that has been done, certainly in recent decades, in relation to trade in this country. For example, they highlighted that these investor-state dispute clauses do not add anything to trade. What they could lead to is inflexibility for us as parliamentarians in relation to our sovereignty and our ability to legislate in the public interest.


The Productivity Commission also very clearly stated that the potential benefits—and I underline the word 'potential'—of the free trade agreements currently under negotiation have been oversold and their negatives largely ignored. What I am asking and what the Greens are asking for—and I am sure Senator Madigan and others in this chamber also—is a more mature debate about trade. We need to recognise the risks.


One of the specific things that I was interested in getting access to in this modelling was what scenario analysis, if any, or what simulations had been done in relation to the car industry. We know from the collapse of various automotive manufacturers in this country that they have all fingered free trade deals as being a culprit for their decisions to close down. That was especially the case with Toyota. They very clearly made a statement where they cited the impacts of current and future free trade deals for their decision to close here.


We have got on record last year, even in October and November, automotive industry experts saying that if the Korean free trade deal goes ahead it will finish the car industry in this country. Taken in isolation, a change to their tariff structure may not be enough to close their industry. But it makes sense that an industry that is under pressure, especially because of a high Australian dollar and its cost base, does not need extra pressures. They very clearly outlined that this free trade deal, if it were to proceed, would shut down the industry. It was certainly highlighted on that day as playing a major part in their decision to close.


I was interested to see whether this type of risk and this type of cost had been factored into our free trade deal, because I think it is only fair that if you are going to talk about the benefits of free trade—and I have no doubt there are benefits to trade between nations; we have been trading for over 10,000 years as people and it is a natural thing for us to do—you also have to talk about the costs. What concerns me about this document in front of me is that, clearly, it was ex-post the collapse of Toyota. So it has only been written in the last week or two. Certainly, the date on the report is 28 February, which is the date after we asked comprehensive questions at estimates on these types of risks.


I will try to seek Labor's support and other support to find out what other modelling was done prior to this new report that I have in my hand, because the government were talking about these benefits in the second half of last year when they came into government. The Korean free trade deal itself was one of the first things they went on the front foot about in terms of their trade agenda, saying what great outcomes this would have for the economy. I would be very interested to see what types of modelling they did to make those claims and to know why I now have in my hands what certainly seems to be—and I am happy to stand corrected—an economic modelling exercise that was done the day after estimates or was certainly changed after estimates, because it incorporated the collapse of one particular industry.


I believe—and I said it last week in estimates—that these types of risks to the automotive industry should have been factored into free trade deals, as should any industry that is negatively impacted. If you have a look at this document, you will see there is a table of industries that are negatively impacted. That is good. Although we are only dealing with trading goods here; we are not dealing with the trade in services and we are not dealing with a whole complex arrangement that is now in place for trade deals. Trade deals now are not what they used to be. Currently, they are mostly about investment and protecting investment. By that, I mean direct foreign investment; long-term investment; 20- or 30-year investments; protecting companies; and IP. There are a whole range of things now that there never used to be.


In dealing with investment flows between countries, suddenly we have a whole new array of factors that we need to consider in trade deals. That is what the Productivity Commission warned of. Certainly, I do not see any recognition of costs here. It is very clear that the modelling is talking about nett benefits.


Another reason I am so keen to shed more light on these trade deals is that we are now talking about sending a massive delegation to China and Japan. We are also negotiating what I suspect is possibly the biggest trade deal ever: the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. It is between 12 nations. It is a multilateral trade deal and it contains a whole new set of complexities. We absolutely have to get a mature debate going in the Senate if we want to see it in the country and if we want to see in the media.


We should not be going out, spruiking the benefits of free trade deals without acknowledging their costs, certainly in the case of giving corporations the same sovereign powers as nations. The ISDS is quite simple. It gives the corporation the ability to sue a government if they change a policy that impacts on their future profits. That is it. They set up an international arbitration, parallel with governments, that allows corporations to sue governments for changing legislation.


They are talking about carve-outs, some sort of legal jargon in clauses that will certainly lower the risk of that happening. But it is happening all around the world, because trade deals are evolving into areas where they are now. For example, look at not only IP but also internet access. There are all sorts of things that we all use in daily life. It is time that we took a much closer look at the powers that we want to give corporations.


This is not about stifling investment; in the US free trade deal John Howard decided that we did not need these clauses in our free trade deals, yet now we are incorporating them. There is a very clear assumption that we had good legal systems back then and they were not necessary. So why are we taking these risks now? Someone has made this decision on our behalf. I have no idea whether it was Minister Robb or someone at DFAT, but we need to get to the bottom of this. That is why I am going to the effort of standing here today talking about trade for 10 minutes. It is not the most exciting of subjects, but it is absolutely essential to do this because it is very important for this country's economy, community and environment.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:31):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


When the Fair Trade (Workers' Rights) Bill was introduced to the committee last year, I did not anticipate the strong level of support it would receive from relevant industry leaders both domestically and internationally. I am very grateful to all those who made submissions and I am pleased that 83 per cent of these submissions were in favour of the bill. However, I am a little disappointed by the report produced by the committee and would like to express my response to those views now. The committee report states:


The proposed legislation may constrain FTA negotiations.


I do not believe this bill will constrain the negotiation of trade agreements. On the contrary, it will set a basis from which to begin negotiating a fair and reasonable outcome for workers both at home and abroad. These reasonable outcomes include: freedom of association; the right to organise and collective bargaining; freedom from discrimination; the elimination of the worst forms of child labour; a 40-hour week; occupational health and safety standards; the idea of an appropriate minimum wage; and weekly rest. I ask the committee: which of these outcomes are not fair and reasonable? Which of these internationally recognised standards does the committee think international workers do not deserve?


The committee report also mentions that 'there is no evidence of a policy failure with regard to Australia's current approach to FTAs and workers' rights'. Australia's policy may not be a failure; however, it is far from perfect. Home Loan Experts elaborated on the reasons why. They said:


One of the most apparent examples would be Bangladesh, where recently a factory building collapsed due to shoddy construction and unsafe working conditions and an estimated 1,129 people died. Less than six months before this, another factory building caught fire and more than 100 people died. In this case too, unsafe working conditions, as well as poor maintenance and planning, were the cause behind the large number of deaths.


While Australia is only one market for these 'shoddy' companies, we have a strong record in the area of workers' rights. This bill provides a strong opportunity for Australia to lead by example on the global stage.


The Australian Council of Trade Unions supported these ideas. They said:


We strongly believe the primary objective of all trade negotiations should be to raise living standards and make a positive difference in the lives of working people in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. Reducing barriers to trade and investment and increasing economic cooperation and integration are possible means of achieving this.


The peak body of Australian vegetable and potato growers, AUSVEG, believes that 'it is a reasonable expectation that trading nations should observe and implement these [the bill's] standards'. The Australian Lawyers for Human Rights provided further reasons. They said:


ALHR considers that passing the bill will assist Australia to meet its obligations as a member of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and to promote human rights on a global level, to follow specific recommendations that have been made by human rights organizations, and to add its voice to the growing international consensus that promoting labour standards in other countries is justified in both a social and economic sense.


The International Trade Union Confederation's sentiments also align with those of ALHRs and most contributors to the inquiry. They said:


This bill creates a legal framework for such conditionality and it aims at achieving a more inclusive trade where all those involved in the production and distribution of goods and services capture a fair share of trade's gains. Australia will not be the first country to make the inclusion of conditionality obligatory for trade agreements. The two parties of the US Congress concluded an agreement in May 2007 that enforceable conditions on labour and environment are to be part of all trade agreements negotiated by the US.


In summary, the Fair Trade (Workers' Rights) Bill 2013 has three strong pillars which make it a reputable piece of legislation. These are outlined in Slavery Link's submission:


1. The bill would assist Australia to meet its obligations to implement international agreements to which Australia is a signatory.


2. The bill would encourage Australia's trading partners to provide their workers with access to minimum standards regarding workers' rights.


3. The bill would support standards in Australia, to the benefit of Australian workers and business.


It is for these reasons that I believe that, when given the opportunity, the Senate should vote in favour of this piece of legislation.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2014-03-04,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (17:38):  Earlier today, I was about two minutes into my speech when it was interrupted for question time. As I was saying, the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill has been blocked, there has been filibustering, the debate has been going on for three weeks, and every man and woman in the Labor Party has dutifully come forward and presented a speech. I do not think some of them even knew what they were saying. As I said earlier, it might as well have been in Swahili, because I do not believe the people in the Labor Party actually know what they are talking about. I do accept that the Greens know what they are talking about. It is their thing; this is what they specialise in. I do not agree with them. In fact, I am violently opposed to them—




Senator Wright:
  Not violently, I hope!




Senator BOSWELL:
  Well, not violently, where I am not going to walk over there and hit Senator Peter Whish-Wilson! Of course I am not. But I am violently opposed to what a carbon tax does. With the Greens, I could almost quote the Bible: 'Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do.' Because what they are doing is not putting jobs at risk but burning jobs. They are burning jobs. Job after job after job is going.


Because I ran a business for 20 years and I know the costs and I know how slim the margins are, when the carbon tax was first presented I thought, 'Hang on. This doesn't ring true to me; there's something wrong with this. This is going to cause problems.' So, on 26 August 2008, I asked the first question about the carbon tax and then I made the first speech on it. I belled the cat and I am very pleased that I did. The proposition was ridiculous—that we would reduce our carbon emissions to five per cent of 2000 levels by 2020. So, to quote my former Senate colleague Barnaby Joyce, from a room in this parliament we are going to control the temperature of the world. Now, we have 1.3 per cent or 1.4 per cent, depending on whose figures you use, of the world's carbon emissions. It does not matter what we do; we are going to make very little difference to it.


But look at what has happened—and I am not saying it is totally due to the carbon tax but it has certainly played a very, very significant role; and I know you, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, are very concerned about this because you have always represented the blue-collar worker. These are indisputable figures. The carbon tax and the RET have turned our manufacturing sector into a killing field. Under Labor's five years of government, over 140,000 manufacturing jobs were lost. So did we reduce our carbon emissions? No. We sent our manufacturing across to China, across to India, across to Indonesia, where they do not have the clean-air controls that our factories have. We have exported our carbon emissions. We have made other countries take on the role of our manufacturers.


When the leader of the Labor Party in the eighties said, 'We're going to get rid of tariffs,' I thought, 'This is big, brave stuff,' and because I worked in manufacturing—I was a manufacturer's agent—I knew a bit about it, and my thoughts went out to the blue-collar workers who do not have great experience, who grab a bucket from the way and put it in a hot dip and pull it out the other side. There were 300 of these people in one factory I represented for Queensland and probably 250 in the other. One was a paintbrush factory; the other was in metal. I thought to myself, 'How are these people going to get jobs?' I really had doubts. I must admit I was a doubting Thomas about it. And then the mining industry came along and everyone got a job. People got jobs in other areas. I have to admit that the Labor Party at that time were right. They removed tariffs. They created a better standard of living. Instead of going and buying a pair of shoes for $300, you could go and buy a pair of shoes for $80 and you had another $200-odd to spend down at the shops. It created employment and it created activity. That works. That works, as long as you can employ people. What we had was very low-cost energy, high-cost labour and good conditions.


In manufacturing, there are three things: the cost of labour, the cost of energy and the cost of raw materials. The cost of raw materials is set by a world price and you cannot shift it very much either way. The cost of energy and the cost of labour are set by the government. Paul Howes today—and I commend this to anyone in the Labor Party—is virtually saying the same thing as Maurice Newman, the Prime Minister's adviser; David Goodwin, from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and Brendan Pearson, from the Minerals Council: 'Have cheap energy, reasonable conditions and good wages, but don't trade away what you have got as cheap energy.' That is what has happened with this carbon tax. You do not have to be Robinson Crusoe. You do not have to be Einstein. It is happening before your eyes. But somehow the Labor Party do not seem to be able to see it. Paul Howes, David Goodwin, Brendan Pearson and the National Farmers' Federation are all singing off the one hymn sheet: 'Give us reliable, cheap energy and we can have decent conditions, pay a little bit more.' As Paul Howes rightly points out, we are a wealthy country and we are never going to be able to mix it with the cheaper, Bangladesh-type workers, and we do not want to. 


What is happening is that renewable energy and the carbon tax are just destroying our industries. I do not want to claim that the carbon tax is doing it solely. The high dollar does represent problems, and unfortunately it is coming back as a problem. But just look at what has happened in the last six months: McCain's processing plant in Penola, South Australia, 59 employees sacked; Simplot, 110 jobs going over to New Zealand. They do not have a carbon tax over there. Well, they do, but it is about the equivalent of a Mars bar, about $1, a tonne. It is all going over there. Simplot is downsizing its Bathurst plant operation, and 110 jobs have gone to New Zealand. Golden Circle have gone to New Zealand. I have got a special interest in Golden Circle because it was my father-in-law who, with a number of other farmers, established the cooperative of Golden Circle. My wife says that she can remember the days when she was eight or nine and her big day was going down to Golden Circle for dinner in the boardroom. At Downer EDI, 100 employees have gone. At Electrolux, 500 jobs have gone. Caterpillar announced that 200 jobs in Burnie have gone to Thailand. Kellogg's announced that 100 jobs have gone from the New South Wales Central Coast. 


Then we get to the big ones: Holden, 2,900 jobs; Toyota, 3,000 jobs; and Ford, probably the same. But why? On every Ford, every Toyota, every Holden, there is a $400 carbon tax. That is at the factory level. Then you put your margin onto the selling agents and it increases. Then on top of the $400 you have got a $200 renewable energy tax. That is a huge handicap for those people in the manufacturing industry to overcome. In fact, they cannot overcome it. So what have they done? They have gone. With our carbon tax and our renewable energy tax, household electricity prices have increased by 110 per cent in the past five years. Australian business, which accounts for 70 per cent of the total electricity use in Australia, has experienced almost an 80 per cent increase in prices since 2009. The causes are not hard to find. The carbon tax accounted for 16 per cent of the electricity bill for a typical large industrial user in New South Wales. The carbon tax added $6.4 billion to the nation's tax bill. We can say, 'Everyone else is doing it.' Well, I am sorry; no-one else is doing it. We have the dearest carbon tax in the world, and it is going to go up. We are out there showing the way. We are out there like Sister Anna carrying the banner, with someone else behind beating a drum. But no-one is following our stupidity.


You can argue that the science says this and the science says that. I will tell you, for every scientist that says the world is being overwhelmed by CO2 and temperatures are rising, you can find another 10 scientists that say that it is not.




Senator Stephens:
  You can't!




Senator BOSWELL:
  I am not going to get into that dispute.




Senator McLucas:
  That is not true!




Senator BOSWELL:
  I am not going to get into that dispute because I do not think it matters one iota. What matters is this: if you are going to have a carbon tax, then you had better make sure India, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh and all those other countries go along with you, because, if they do not, it is no more than a simple gesture. I do not want to get into the science. You do not have to get there but, if you want to convince me that a carbon tax will work, firstly, go and tell the people in Indonesia: 'I know you're only on a couple of rupiahs a day, but I know you'll carry the load, because it's good for the earth. We'll put a tax on your heating and we'll put a tax on your lighting.' They will say, 'But we don't have any lighting. Yes, we do have heating. We're very lucky; we have a kerosene heater.' 'Oh well, we'll tax that.' There would be a riot, and so there should be. 


If you go to China, what are they doing? We are told that they have got renewable energy. Yes, they have got a bit of renewable energy. Let us see what China have got in the way of renewable energy. Their renewable energy is about six per cent. Solar accounts for 0.2 per cent and wind is about six per cent. Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, I know you are interested in this, because I have always found you a person to be interested in the working class, the working person. Every two weeks, China is putting in a new one-gigawatt power station 


In Australia our total transmission through energy is 50 gigawatts. The energy that is driven out of Australia is 50 gigawatts. China are putting in one gigawatt every two weeks. China have a total capacity of 557,938 megawatts. India has a total capacity of 519,396 megawatts. Of course the brave Greens would say, 'I know it's rough in India, but you have to pull your weight and do a bit of sacrificing.' The people of India say: 'We live in a cardboard carton. What more can we sacrifice? Our kids cannot go to school. Do you want us to sacrifice more? What have we got to sacrifice?' The Greens, never short of an answer, would say: 'The wealthy countries like Australia and America can pay.' That is what the Copenhagen agreement started out to say.


I have never seen things so bad in Australia. On Sunday a friend of mine put a job ad on the website for an accounts clerk. By Sunday afternoon he had 100 people applying for the job and yesterday there were 200 people. He employed a solicitor to do a clerk's job and she was so grateful. It is a killing field out there. We do not realise that in here, because we are well paid and our kids are well looked after. But out there it is a battle. I am frightened for my grandchildren. We cannot afford to do this. We have got to pass this legislation.


While you are procrastinating, jobs are going and companies are closing. Holden is withdrawing. Then you have $100 million for the airline and $27 million for Virgin. Out of $250 million, $100 million is not going to rock the financial boat, but $100 million is a lot of jobs. You can employ a lot of people for $100 million.


The Labor Party are trying to defend 33 per cent of the votes. Thirty-three per cent is never going to get them into government. They have to sell their wares to the tradies, the people who work in factories and the people who have not got jobs. They are not doing it and they are going to be over there for the next 100 years if they do not break away from the Greens and defend their old position for the traditional blue-collar workers. If they do that, they will be some competition. If they do not, they are going to be over that side for the next 20 years.

Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (17:56):  I too rise to make a contribution to this debate on the carbon tax bills. I listened with interest to Senator Boswell, but I fear that the facts might have gotten in the way of a good story. We need to acknowledge that the climate change challenge, particularly the need to lower CO2intensity and thus improve energy efficiency across the economy, is actually closely related to the need to increase productivity-improving investment. That is why Labor see climate change as an opportunity rather than a barrier to a stronger economy. That is why we pursued the clean energy policy that would spur investment in research and development and promote innovation and the use of new technologies and do that at a negligible cost to the economy.


We have always believed, despite the government's denials, that climate change is fundamentally an externality problem, where the costs of the activity are not fully represented in the institution or the market where the decisions are being made about the activity and that then leads to excessive social costs and what the economists would call a suboptimal welfare outcome. We also believe, despite the government's denials, that climate change is fundamentally a global problem and, as with any international problem, coordination issues are the key. We further believe that climate change is a problem whose solution implies costs for certain powerful vested interests in the economy, and we know whose interests are being protected with the repeal of the carbon tax. Finally, Labor believe that climate change is a problem on timescales that are larger than the human life span. So climate change is a long-term, intergenerational problem with the complicating issues that such problems entail.


Professor Ross Garnaut called it a diabolical public policy problem. Others in the field of public policy describe these problems as wicked. That is not to suggest, as many on the other side would, that climate change is a problem that is not solvable. In fact, the most challenging aspects of the problem are practical not conceptual, in particular the need to create a coordinated international approach. Conceptually we certainly understand the externality problems well. We understand the specific nature of climate change externality and we understand the mechanisms needed to overcome the intergenerational aspects of the problem. From a domestic point of view, if the will to address the problem were shared by both sides of politics, it would actually cease to be a policy problem for government at all and would instead become a practical engineering and scientific problem for industry and academia. The challenge would become purely one of invention and investment, and its solution would benefit the economy and our long-term competitiveness and prosperity.


Climate change is not the result of true disagreement about the best solutions that governments and countries might argue as the best policy approach. It is actually the effort to delay or avoid the implementation of real solutions that causes this dilemma. These efforts are born either of a denial of the problem in the first place, which we hear constantly from the government, or of a misrepresentation of the scientific uncertainty in order to delay the implementation of solutions and to delay harm to vested interests. We have heard that argument consistently from the government as well. Both of those explanations apply to the government's position and its action on repealing these bills.


Labor accepts the science of climate change and we believe that we need to do something about it. Mr Abbott and the coalition do not. This bill removes the legal cap on pollution and allows the big polluters carte blanche to pollute, courtesy of the pollution fund being set up by the government. The bill is nonsensical in every way, just as the Direct Action Plan is nonsensical. Experts agree that this will cost households more, while failing to cut pollution.


Several economists, in submissions to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's inquiry into the government's Direct Action Plan, have highlighted that any real solution needs to include several features. A broad based carbon price is the first. It will: incentivise investment in deployment of and research in low-carbon technologies; incentivise abatement across the whole economy, which will allow private actors to make low-cost abatement decisions; raise revenue in an economically inefficient manner—taxing a good which produces a negative societal externality is one of the few methods available of raising revenue that does not produce the usual economic dead-weight cost on the economy—and ensure that an equitable approach to climate change is taken. Revenue raised will need to be used to support low-carbon investment, trade exposed industries and low-income earners. It needs to be able to be linked to global carbon markets and thus become part of a global solution to climate change. It needs to be permanent in order to provide policy and investment certainty with long-term carbon allocations decided on the basis of fair Australian effort and scientific advice. Labor's clean energy future legislation satisfied all of these features, and the fact is that the Abbott government does not have an alternative that meets the same standards.


Mr David Rossiter, who appeared before the environment committee's inquiry, reminded the committee that there is very little new thinking in the government's alternative. He said in his submission:


The DAP is very similar to the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Plan (GGAP) introduced by the Howard Government in 1999 as that plan also called for a reverse auction process for abatement action funding. It failed to deliver over a ten year period and was originally intended to be a four year programme. Ultimately despite the increase in implementation period only 36% of the funds were expended and the amount of abatement achieved was considerably less than was expected at tender and at a greater cost per tonne of abatement. It effectively delivered under 15% of its target in its original programme term.


He went on to say:


It would therefore be expected that DAP will suffer from similar problems, that is, it will have a considerably extended implementation period, an inability to disburse funds quickly and have increased abatement costs over those tendered for any abatement it does encourage. The current national target for abatement is a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020. It is unlikely that DAP will be able to achieve the quantum of abatement required by this target within the requisite timeframe. History shows us GGAP was regarded by the Howard Government as a failed experiment as they then adopted an emission trading scheme as their preferred mechanism to address climate change.


So here we have another revisionist policy and the government playing back to the future with everybody's future.


Last year, the OECD released a report confirming that countries could achieve higher levels of emissions reduction at much lower cost if they relied on emissions trading schemes. Emissions trading schemes are already being adopted in many countries around the world, including in the UK, France, Germany, South Korea, Canada and parts of the US and China. The GLOBE Climate Legislation Study, which covers 66 countries across the globe, found that Australia is the only country to be taking negative legislative action in climate policy. The study covers major nations including the US, China, India, Brazil and more.


The government senators' contributions to this debate have been superficial and unconvincing, simply because Mr Abbott and the coalition have not been able to come up with one credible scientist or economist willing to stand up and back their climate change policy. As we heard on Friday at the inquiry hearing, the Direct Action Plan requires setting baselines for a diverse set of projects over a wide variety of sectors. This is a very difficult and highly specialised task that should not be underestimated. It is highly site and geographic location specific. It is extremely resource intensive and it often exposes a lack of firm data from which baselines can be set.


The government claims that the Direct Action Plan will be simple, straightforward and streamlined to make it 'easy for businesses to participate'. But the reality is that the baseline system proposed is extremely complicated, detailed and data intensive if it is to be credible and accountable, as it will have to be, because the grants system proposed for allocating public money will require that. History also tells us that the system will inherently take a lot of time to reach decisions because of the baseline process. Consequently, the time frame for abatement will be reduced from the maximum of five years and costs per tonne will inevitably rise further. We are not that far away from 2020. About 60 actions are identified. This means that perhaps 600 or more baselines might be called for in the bidding process, with each being proposed and having to be independently verified. That alone is an extraordinarily enormous task. But, in addition, by the voluntary nature of participation in the measure, not all of the actions shown will be able to be bid for under Direct Action Plan. There may be too short a period for a return to be made or the risks associated with reliability of any innovation being proposed and other more costly actions will have to be invoked to achieve the abatement required to meet the full quantum of the target.


This issue was also revealed in the Howard government program and consequently any abatement cost curve produced in this form will represent a lower bound on cost and an upper bound on abatement quantity. In other words, the abatement costs will be higher and the total abatement quantity will be less than expected. Under emissions trading schemes, such cost abatement curves represent an upper bound on cost and lower bound on abatement quantity. In other words, there are more abatement options identified, costs are less and total abatement quantity can be higher. That reversal is because the incentive to reduce costs under emissions trading lies with the polluter and more options for abatement will be revealed as development and further innovation occurs. History shows us more abatement options have been revealed in many similar existing market-based mechanisms, such as the US sulfur dioxide reduction scheme. 


Examples of the operation of the Direct Action Plan quoted by the government are very misleading. Several government senators have referred to the transport sector and have diligently quoted the Emissions Reduction Fund green paper, for example: 


… fleet operators could be rewarded for reducing emissions per tonne of freight per kilometre. 


That is an example that has been widely and publicly referenced back to a major transport company by the government purporting to show how the Direct Action Plan will work. While the emissions intensity of that company may have dropped, National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme data published by the government for the company show that its total emissions have risen by 11 per cent, not fallen at all. The world's atmosphere is not concerned about emissions intensity—and Australia's international target commitments are not framed in such terms. Total emissions are the only issue at stake. The Direct Action Plan is structured counter-intuitively—the taxpayer pays the polluter and the polluter may or may not reduce their emissions. We have no idea how the government intends to encourage compliance with abatement proposals.


Climate change, as we all know, is set to have a major impact on Australia's economy and the environment and these impacts increase significantly with larger increases in temperature. Many senators have made that point in their contributions. We say we know climate change is well understood. Climate change is already occurring, and the independent modelling that has been undertaken has proven that the government's alternative climate change policies will cost billions of dollars more than Mr Abbott claims and will have no chance of meeting Australia's emissions reduction target. The government policy will simply be nothing more than an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing meaningful or systemic to address climate change. 


We need to be very clear about the government's alternative plan. Achieving the emissions reduction required to deliver its commitment to the five per cent target would require an additional expenditure of more than $4 billion to 2020. What do we have? We have the coalition's approach to carbon pollution, which is to create this $2.9 billion fund to pay Australian companies to reduce pollution. Where Labor's focus is to cap the amount of pollution that can enter the atmosphere and to have a system for business to find the cheapest way to reduce their pollution, the government will use taxpayers' money to pay big polluters. What will the outcome be? Independent research and modelling, undertaken by SKM-MMA and Monash University's Centre of Policy Studies, shows that the Emissions Reduction Fund will see pollution increase by 8 to 10 per cent above 2000 levels by 2020; reduce pollution by nearly one-third less than Labor's policy; require significant additional investment of between $4 billion and $15 billion to achieve the 2020 target; see costs and pollution both increase over time and even with spending increasing to around $88 billion from 2014 to 2050 pollution would still be increased by about 45 per cent over this period; and subsidise the pollution of businesses who do not make the changes, with these public subsidies calculated at about $50 billion to 2020. 


The government is actually relentlessly pursuing an ideological agenda—part of its three-word campaign slogan from the last election. This is despite the fact that they are now in government and have access to all the data that informed the Labor government policies. Labor provided unprecedented support for renewable energy through the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The government is intent on abolishing these. Labor provided support for business to become more efficient and productive, including the Clean Technology Program and the Jobs and Competitiveness Program. The government is intent on abolishing these. Labor also provided support to reduce land sector emissions through the Carbon Farming Initiative. It is interesting that the government is set to replace this with the Green Army of underpaid, undertrained young workers and a tree planting target that is simply unachievable.


Labor has contributed an extraordinary legacy: our wind capacity has trebled; more than a million households have solar panels installed; employment in the renewable energy industry has more than doubled to over 24,000 people; and during the first year of the carbon price around 150,000 jobs have been created while the economy continued to grow at 2.5 per cent and inflation remained low, pollution in the national electricity market decreased by seven per cent and, again, renewable power energy generated as a share of the national electricity market increased by 25 per cent. 


In the area of agriculture, since 2011 farmers and landholders have been able to create offset credits under the Carbon Farming Initiative. Under that CFI, farmers are able to earn credits by reducing carbon pollution and then sell those credits to the 370 large business that are covered under the emissions trading scheme. That CFI means that farmers are able to do their bit in helping Australia to meet its international target while at the same time earning income by reducing carbon pollution. The government intends to decimate clean energy investment in Australia and their legislation to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has shown their complete antagonism to the sector. As the committee heard in the hearing last week, agriculture barely gets a mention in the government's green paper—something we certainly have not heard from any Nationals senators.


We want to tackle climate change in the most effective way possible. We put in place a very effective scheme. It was delivering on the long-term outcomes that Australia needed to deliver; it was providing best-practice guidelines for industry and innovation; and all the experts tell us that an ETS puts a legal cap on carbon pollution and lets business work out the best, cheapest and most effective way to operate within that. That is what this government is seeking to unravel, and it will be to the nation's peril.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:15):  I rise also to speak on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013. I would first like to commend opposition senators on their fine contributions to this bill—well thought out arguments against these pieces of legislation. It is simply not good enough to stick our heads in the sand and leave the next generation to tackle the issue of climate change. Climate change is real, and the Labor Party supports real, meaningful, effective action on climate change. As I have said in previous contributions on climate change, something must be done; we cannot sit back and do nothing. Our parliament, as leaders of our country, must send a clear message on this issue, which is so important to our children and future generations. 


The most cost-effective way to deal with carbon pollution is an emissions trading scheme. An emissions trading scheme—a market based mechanism with a legal cap on carbon pollution—is the cheapest and the most effective way to reduce emissions, while encouraging business. Labor accepts both the science of climate change and the fact that Australia cannot afford to leave the challenge of climate change to future generations. Mr Abbott and his environment minister, Mr Hunt, and the coalition do not. No credible expert argues that the coalition's direct action policies will work. The government do not even want to put a cap on how much pollution is allowed in Australia. It shows that they do not have the political will or the nous to actually effect meaningful change to reduce emissions. Big polluters, who put out high levels of carbon emissions, should not be subsidised by the taxpayer. Treasury has estimated the cost of Direct Action at $10 billion a year; that is, money paid as taxes by ordinary Australians then siphoned off into the pockets of big polluters.


I ask you: how can that sit well with anyone? It is certainly not sitting well with the Australian people. A Fairfax-Nielsen poll at the end of last year showed just 12 per cent of Australians supported Direct Action. Don't hold your breath, Mr Acting Deputy President, if you expect Mr Abbott to take any notice! This is a government that did not even bother sending any ministerial representation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Warsaw, a government that was not represented by a minister at this significant worldwide conference. It is a government that barely pays lip-service to one of the greatest challenges our planet faces this century.


Emissions trading schemes are already in place in the UK, throughout Europe, Korea and parts of Canada and the United States. Almost every credible economist or expert says Direct Action will not work. Direct Action is not sustainable due to the cost. Most direct action plans cannot be scaled up, and those that can prove too expensive. So why do the Prime Minister and the Treasurer set about slashing services to schools, hospitals, roads, community grants and whatever else they can get their hands on? Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott are bracing themselves for huge bills into the future so that they can pay the biggest polluters. 


It is as laughable as it is tragic. The local school goes without much-needed money, but the government pays highly profitable multinationals that money instead. Carbon pollution, which causes climate change, is a problem, both environmental and economic, a problem that we must tackle. But, as we have heard in public reports and in the media, Mr Maurice Newman—one of the Prime Minister's most trusted advisers and known climate change sceptic—thinks money spent on science and cutting carbon pollution is wasted. When Mr Newman speaks, it appears that Mr Abbott not only listens, but he acts. It is deeply alarming to have someone so influential holding views on climate change that are so at odds with the Australian people, let alone with the mounting scientific evidence. It is really little surprise that with advice like this, the coalition offers such an ineffective and ill-conceived policy.


We know that climate change is real and something must be done—meaningful action must be taken. It is simple, basic logic. It is logic that we must listen to in the interests of our children, their children and for all future generations of Australians and all countries around the world. The UK, Europe, Korea and parts of North America are already using emissions trading schemes. In our region, China has also started pilot ETS schemes and, as reported in TheAge on 2 December last year, Guandong, China's largest province with a population of more than 100 million has capped greenhouse gas emissions. It began to issue carbon permits to big polluters from last December. This was after China introduced emission trading schemes in Beijing and Shanghai in late November 2013. In terms of size, Guandong's carbon markets will be second only to Europe's trading scheme. 


Australia must live in the real world and stay the course towards an ETS. Labor will continue to listen to the best available science and it does beggar belief that any political party would not. Yet we have those opposite shouting down the experts and sticking their fingers in their ears and, in fact, trying to put legislation into the parliament to repeal some of that expert advice.


Those who do not have their fingers in their ears should be crossing them. History will not be kind to this government. It will be a government that will look foolish for ignoring the science. It will be the government that ignored the biggest problem of this century because it lacked the courage to tackle the real issue. The climate change deniers will look as foolish as those who once argued that cigarettes do not cause lung cancer. But Mr Abbott is a denier and wants to tear down the progress made by the previous government. If Mr Abbott wants to scrap the so-called carbon tax, it must be replaced with something that works. It is accepted that an emissions trading scheme will work by putting a cap on carbon, but there is uncertainty about what the Liberal Party's policy will do. When pushed, the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, could not explain it in parliament and Mr Hunt has been unable to explain how it will actually work.


Carbon pollution changes our weather and harms our environment. That is the best available science. The experts all agree. All reputable scientists say that it is a fact: the climate is changing and humans are accelerating that change. That is why governments around the world are taking action, including the previous Labor government. But this government, under Prime Minister Tony Abbott, has effectively put taking meaningful steps into the too-hard basket. Instead, we have a toxic policy from a government out of step with society both in this country and on a global scale.


Labor argues that we should tackle the problem and that Australia should back itself to compete with the rest of the world by still acting responsibly for future generations. Those future generations should be proud to look back at this period of history and see that Australia made a difference. Instead, they will read about an isolationist Australian government that shrugged its shoulders, paid a bit of lip-service, tore up policy that was making meaningful change and established a slush fund of billions of taxpayers' dollars to hand to polluters. What sort of legacy is that? Rather than feeling pride, they will be ashamed that a coalition government tore down the progress that was already made, put in laws that nobody wanted, caused economic and environmental upheaval and gave up on tackling such a huge issue.


The coalition wants to replace the laws with this poorly-thought-out replacement, Direct Action, that nobody with any economic or environmental credibility thinks will work. As I have indicated, they want to replace that with a scheme that will cost taxpayers an estimated $10 billion a year. No less an authority than Alan Kohler sums it up:


Tony Abbott will have to either drop the promise to cut emissions by five per cent or the promise to repeal the carbon tax - both together will be impossible without massive Government spending under the proposed ""direct action"" policy of paying companies to reduce emissions.


I ask the Senate: which of those two options—repealing the carbon tax or reducing emissions by five per cent—should we expect Mr Abbott to choose? With advisers such as Mr Maurice Newman in Mr Abbott's ear, it is safe to say that he would prefer to ditch the price on carbon and damn the consequences if we do not need the absolute minimum emissions target reduction.


Mr Kohler also says:


The liquefied natural gas (LNG) export boom will make it virtually impossible for Australia to meet the Government's carbon emissions reduction target.


So according to one of our most respected economic voices in Australia, under Direct Action there is no chance of meeting the minimum target. Mr Kohler says that not trying to reduce carbon emissions at all would put Australia at odds with the rest of the world, including China and the US, and endanger trade agreements. But as Mr Kohler writes:


… the Prime Minister and Treasurer Joe Hockey will be, or at least should be, desperately hoping that the Senate never allows the repeal of the emission trading scheme legislation, so it's not exactly a broken promise—at least they tried.


At least they tried! Already, the coalition—Mr Hockey, Mr Abbott and senators in this place—might just wash their hands of the issue altogether.


The coalition has given up—it is too hard! They have put in place Direct Action as an alleged alternative policy, but it will not achieve anything meaningful. This is a government without a map to navigate the country into the future. It is a government refusing to live in the real world. It is a government refusing to listen to the experts. It is a government claiming that it knows best but with no actual idea of what it will do when the hard questions are asked of Direct Action.


Businesses with foresight are already leading the charge, using clean, green technologies of the future to secure the long-term future of their businesses. Governments that claim to have foresight would be wise to follow their lead. We cannot afford to be left behind. Treasury said in its Blue Book, prepared prior to the 2010 election:


A market based mechanism can achieve the necessary abatement at a cost per tonne of emissions far lower than any other alternative direct-action policies.


That advice on Direct Action from Treasury hardly sits on its own.


The poorly-thought-out Direct Action policy is also at odds with industry. In a submission to the government the Australian Industry Group said:


… there is a risk that the Emissions Reduction Fund does not deliver the abatement outcomes sought. As currently understood there is no equivalent to an emissions cap or other legal guarantee that the targets will be met.


The AiG, which speaks on behalf of about 60,000 businesses, wants the government to adopt a market mechanism—an ETS. he AiG says it is the cheapest and most effective way to drive down carbon pollution. This is a 60,000-strong industry group urging the government to put in place a market mechanism, not its Direct Action Plan. This respected industry group says that 'bureaucratic or political decision making are usually poor substitutes for the judgements of market actors responding to price in light of their own circumstances'. And, along with Mr Kohler, the AiG also raised fears over the consequences of not matching the emissions reduction targets of other major economies around the world.


The AiG says that consistent global action is fundamental to preserving Australian competitiveness. Economists and climate scientists across the world all agree that an emissions trading scheme—a market-based mechanism with a legal cap on carbon pollution—is the cheapest and most effective way to reduce pollution and provide certainty for business, again, as we have seen with the AiG, representing over 60,000 Australian businesses, telling the government not to push forward with Direct Action. So I ask: is this the government they voted for—one that would not listen and jeopardise economic growth? In 2011, accounting and audit expert Ernst & Young said that Direct Action has key problems that could 'hinder Australia's participation in a deeper and globally consistent response to climate change'—yet more evidence that Direct Action will leave Australia at odds with other economic powers.


In June 2012 the global chief executive of Shell, Mr Peter Voser, told 7.30 that the company already includes carbon pricing in investments and that his company took a longer term view than the next two or three quarters.


This longer term certainty is not provided by Direct Action. To quote Mr Voser:


… Shell as a company is actually very much advocating that we need a price for carbon on a worldwide basis and we want that to be on a market mechanism.


This is the head of a massive multinational company calling for a price on carbon through a market mechanism—an ETS. The list goes on. The former Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, called on the coalition to scrap its Direct Action Plan. He said:


The easiest cut you'll make is the stuff you never go into.


And then in August of last year a leading researcher on emissions markets released detailed modelling on Direct Action and found that Direct Action would leave emissions 16 per cent above 2000 levels, would require an extra $35 billion to meet the target, cannot meet higher targets and needs to pay polluters $58 per tonne by 2020.


But, as we have heard, Mr Abbott and Mr Hunt are not listening to these respected voices. Mr Abbott is not listening to the Australian people. The recent Nielsen-Fairfax poll released on November 25 showed that only 12 per cent of people polled supported Mr Abbott's direct action policy. That says loud and clear that the voters of Australia—the hardworking taxpayers of Australia—do not want their tax dollars being shelled out by this coalition towards those who need it least: big polluters. Just 12 per cent of Australians, according to the poll, are backing Mr Abbott. This is not the government they told Australian businesses and families they would be. Australia should be setting a standard on the global scale and working with the major economies of the globe.


Mr Abbott should show leadership. This 44th Parliament will be judged by the history books on this issue as much as on any other. Labor is comfortable with our position: climate change is real, and we must not stall on acting on it. Labor supports an emissions trading scheme. We do not support Direct Action. Australians agree that there is something happening to our climate. They want action. They want meaningful action. That is what the ETS delivers. It is better for the economy. It is better for the environment. Our summers are getting hotter. Our weather is changing. That changing weather affects our economy. It affects our river systems, our reefs, our farms, our cities. It affects the entire country. We must take a stand. We cannot leave it for the next generation, the next parliament. We have to act and act now. The experts have spoken, and we must listen to them. To do nothing is unforgivable.


Labor introduced an emissions trading scheme that is working. It was cutting dirty power generation and increasing clean energy generation. Are Mr Abbott, Mr Hunt, Mr Hockey and their colleagues comfortable about facing up to future generations with their feeble excuses for having done so little at best, and having caused harm at worst, to limit emissions and protect our environment? Instead, Mr Abbott wants to plough ahead with Direct Action.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-03-04,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:35):  I indicate my support for the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 and related bills and I want to outline the reasons. As I previously said, I believe we need to take meaningful and appropriate action to address the issue from both an environmental and an economic point of view. In respect of climate change, the cost of not doing so in the next few years, effectively, will be much greater for generations to come. The debates around how to deal with the need to both reduce emissions and support our economy have been long and vexed. I am concerned that even now we do not have a detailed policy in place to achieve the goals we must meet. Back in 2009, then opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull and I jointly commissioned Frontier Economics to model and formulate an alternative, intensity based emissions trading scheme. The Frontier scheme could have delivered deeper cuts to emissions at a lower cost than the CPRS and the carbon tax, because it avoided the enormous economic cost associated with the revenue churn of the former government's scheme.


Frontier's modelling estimated that for every dollar invested in abatement there is a churn of $5 to $6 through the economy. An intensity based scheme, by contrast, sets emissions targets for industries, particularly the stationary energy sector, and avoids that level of churn and with it distortions and loss of economic activity. It also avoids unnecessary distortions in energy pricing in the way the merit order works with respect to that—and that is also important for economic growth and getting the balance right to find the most efficient way to reduce emissions.


Frontier Economics also calculated that it would be relatively simple to amend the CPRS legislation at the time to make it one-third cheaper and twice as effective by introducing intensity based elements. I moved a number of amendments to that effect, rejected by both the then government and the then opposition.


The warnings given at the time by Frontier of the potential for a budget black hole in the former government's approach were dismissed by the then government—Senator Wong, I think, called it 'a mongrel of a scheme'. Well, for a mongrel, it had a lot of bite! Frontier warned the Rudd government back in 2009 of the budgetary black hole created by the decline in revenues from permit sales. The government ignored this and the black hole turned out to be about $5 billion a year. They also warned that one group that would see the upside of the abolition of the price floor announced in September 2012 would be the private brown coal generators in Victoria and South Australia.


Danny Price, the Managing Director of Frontier Economics, made the point back then that the former government handed the generators billions of dollars of cash compensation and permits in the high-fixed-price period, based on the Treasury modelling of carbon prices across many years, not just the fixed-price period. These figures were unrealistically high. Ironically, as Danny Price pointed out in an opinion piece in The Australian in September 2012:


Of course, one group that will see only upside from the abolition of the price floor is the private brown coal generators in Victoria and South Australia. The government handed them billions of dollars of cash compensation and permits in the high fixed-price period, based on the Treasury modelling of carbon prices across many years, not just the fixed price period, that now look unrealistically high. Ironically, this makes the dirty brown coal generators more valuable than if the government had never priced carbon and compensated for it.


Danny Price went on to say:


It also makes the dirty brown coal generators relatively more valuable than the cleaner, government-owned black coal power generators in NSW and Queensland that have not been compensated.


Something Treasury has also ignored over the past few years in the context of carbon policy, which must be tackled now, is a tax interaction effect associated with different mechanisms for reducing emissions. This tax interaction effect should not be ignored from a public policy point of view—or from a sheer economics point of view. It actually matters. 


Frontier's proposed amendments to the CPRS would have substantially reduced the economic distortions that the proposed CPRS, or the current carbon tax, would create, as a direct result of savings due to a reduction in inefficiencies of the tax interaction effect of current policies. As Frontier put it:


… pre-existing taxes already create economic distortions that discourage investment, consumption and labour. When a carbon price/tax is imposed in addition to these existing taxes, the resulting economic costs are multiplicative, not additive.


That means that the revenue churn of the CPRS and the carbon tax has a disproportionate drag on the economy, as well as leading to much higher abatement costs.


I am also acutely aware that the Gillard government had, in effect, a reverse mandate when it came to the carbon tax, in the sense that the former Prime Minister promised not to introduce a price on carbon on the eve of the 2010 election. That, combined with the flawed design of that scheme and the associated budget black hole, made it impossible for me to support the former government's carbon tax and emissions trading scheme. But, in the context of this vote to repeal the carbon tax, there ought to be, at the very least, a very firm personal commitment from the Prime Minister to establish an alternative scheme which at minimum will achieve the bipartisan goal of a five per cent reduction in emissions on 2000 levels by 2020.


That leads to the next question of how to best replace the carbon tax with a credible alternative scheme for emissions reductions. I have said before that I was shocked to hear during the Senate inquiry into these bills on 26 November last year that Treasury has not undertaken—or had not, at that stage—any modelling to determine whether it is more effective to spend money to reduce high-emissions activity or to spend money to increase cleaner generation activity. This is a significant gap in policymaking and I strongly believe the government should commission such modelling as a matter of priority. In fact, a question I would like to give on notice to the government, Mr Acting Deputy President, is: have they actually undertaken this? I think it is something the government ought to address when they are summing up this debate—because they know, Treasury knows, that whether you spend money on reducing high-emissions activity or on increasing cleaner generation activity does make a difference to what is more cost-effective and the price effects of that. 


A carbon reduction policy can only achieve its objectives through investment because, in order to transform the economy to a lower-polluting one, you need to change how energy is produced and used. Therefore, we need to know where to direct investment for the best outcomes. The business environment needs to be conducive for that investment to flourish; otherwise, the taxpayer has to pay for it through subsidies or the consumer through higher power prices—and, inevitably, they are effectively one and the same.


The former government fatally damaged its carbon policy by its ill-considered, and I suggest cavalier, changing of the rules. Removing the carbon price floor and then bringing forward the ETS by a year may have seemed like reasonable and popular policy shifts, but it caused great uncertainty for investors and highlighted the lack of robustness in the scheme. I have no doubt that the changes in government policy have led to major investors either walking away from the Australian energy market or deferring additional investment.


I think the second Rudd Government's proposal just before the election, to link the carbon price to the European scheme by next year, was the final nail in the carbon tax coffin. A European price of about $6 a tonne would be a nuisance tax that would do nothing to drive investment in cleaner energy in Australia. This is especially true where the European price may have been artificially inflated and, in any case, may have little stability—hardly attractive for investors. But the energy sector here well knows that the European scheme has been subject to significant political volatility, leading to price uncertainty. Here in Australia, that would create investment uncertainty and risk. That is why I have to date supported retaining the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


The elegant simplicity of the Frontier scheme would have been that instead of charging for all emissions it would reward cleaner forms of energy and technology, reducing their cost rather than increasing them, largely avoiding a revenue churn and the associated economic distortions. Also, rather than government acting as both a conflicted tax collector and benefactor, trade would occur between market participants. Despite its flaws, at least Direct Action could be modified to be more efficient and it does not involve the churn of the former government's approach. I believe Direction Action can be modified to take elements of the Frontier approach, to deliver a more cost-effective environmental outcome than the current carbon-pricing arrangements. As I understand it, the Direct Action approach involves a tender process—I say 'as I understand it' because a discussion paper released relatively recently on Direct Action seems to lack sufficient detail, although it appears the government is prepared to show some flexibility in its approach.


Australian state governments conduct tenders for billions of dollars of services in the economy each year. Some of these tenders are flawed and sometimes the services delivered are poor. However, a robustly designed tender process can still be a credible approach to obtain services at a competitive price. Under Direct Action there is only one buyer of the services—the government.


There is a direct cost to the taxpayers and the government has given itself a lot of wriggle room in setting out what the likely costs over the next four years will be. Environment Minister Greg Hunt told Lateline's Emma Alberici that the emissions reduction target is $2.5 billion over the next four years, in terms of money to be spent, but the coalition's policy documents three years ago said that Direct Action obligations would cost $10.5 billion over 10 years. The big advantage of Direct Action that I see, subject to modifications, is that the government spends only a dollar for every dollar that needs to be invested in reducing emissions—not a $5 tax for every dollar, as occurs under current arrangement. This means Direct Action will largely avoid the tax interaction effect, and in this sense is cheaper than what we currently have in terms of reducing emissions.


The other significant benefit of Direct Action is that it will appeal to investors and that they will have a contract with the government to supply abatement. Investors understand contracts and so does the government. It is a very secure and well understood instrument in business and this level of security will attract the investment needed to achieve our abatement targets.


I note Minister Hunt has said that Direct Action could be implemented by regulation, rather than through legislation, to avoid a hostile Senate. I think that is very problematic because of the potential for any regulations to be disallowed by the Senate, throwing the scheme into disarray and with it any investor certainty with respect to abatement.


I still regard the Frontier scheme as much more targeted in terms of emissions abatement, but I think there is scope for what appears to be a malleable Direct Action approach to incorporate its key elements. It is worth noting that the Frontier scheme unveiled by Malcolm Turnbull and myself, in mid-2009, actually had a 10 per cent emissions reduction target, not five per cent. That is because some of the cost efficiencies from the Frontier scheme were spent on achieving a tougher target. Given that Direct Action has a similar quality, I will be urging the government to allocate some of the efficiency savings from Direct Action to achieving a more ambitious but affordable emissions reduction targets.


I believe the government needs to reconsider its approach to excluding overseas permits from Direct Action. This needs to be put on the agenda. There are arguments to consider the competitive neutrality of buying permits overseas, as long as they are robustly assessed and the local economic benefits of abatement are taken into account.


That brings me to the next related question of how the Direct Action scheme and the renewable energy target may interact. I think it is important that, while all the carbon policy balls are up in the air, the government needs to look at the interaction between the RET and Direct Action. There is an opportunity here to have a coherent environmental policy as well as having a more ambitious reduction target.


I note the May 2011 report from the Productivity Commission, Carbon emission policies in key economies, said that the RET was an expensive form of abatement. Whilst I query whether the commission took too narrow an approach in its analysis, I think it would be worthwhile to review the RET in at least one regard, as it has been reviewed in other jurisdictions—that is, the existing framework fails to weight renewable energy certificates on the basis of whether the renewable energy is more reliable as a baseload source. Baseload geothermal, solar thermal and tidal power are at a distinct disadvantage in the current scheme, compared with wind energy, because of this lack of weighting. If you want to replace coal-fired power stations you need to have a reliable form of baseload energy. It is reasonable to say that wind energy investment has choked out investment in baseload renewables, which is something that is of particular concern in my home state of South Australia as it has enormous potential with its geothermal reserves in the north of the state.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2014-03-04,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (17:38):  Earlier today, I was about two minutes into my speech when it was interrupted for question time. As I was saying, the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill has been blocked, there has been filibustering, the debate has been going on for three weeks, and every man and woman in the Labor Party has dutifully come forward and presented a speech. I do not think some of them even knew what they were saying. As I said earlier, it might as well have been in Swahili, because I do not believe the people in the Labor Party actually know what they are talking about. I do accept that the Greens know what they are talking about. It is their thing; this is what they specialise in. I do not agree with them. In fact, I am violently opposed to them—




Senator Wright:
  Not violently, I hope!




Senator BOSWELL:
  Well, not violently, where I am not going to walk over there and hit Senator Peter Whish-Wilson! Of course I am not. But I am violently opposed to what a carbon tax does. With the Greens, I could almost quote the Bible: 'Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do.' Because what they are doing is not putting jobs at risk but burning jobs. They are burning jobs. Job after job after job is going.


Because I ran a business for 20 years and I know the costs and I know how slim the margins are, when the carbon tax was first presented I thought, 'Hang on. This doesn't ring true to me; there's something wrong with this. This is going to cause problems.' So, on 26 August 2008, I asked the first question about the carbon tax and then I made the first speech on it. I belled the cat and I am very pleased that I did. The proposition was ridiculous—that we would reduce our carbon emissions to five per cent of 2000 levels by 2020. So, to quote my former Senate colleague Barnaby Joyce, from a room in this parliament we are going to control the temperature of the world. Now, we have 1.3 per cent or 1.4 per cent, depending on whose figures you use, of the world's carbon emissions. It does not matter what we do; we are going to make very little difference to it.


But look at what has happened—and I am not saying it is totally due to the carbon tax but it has certainly played a very, very significant role; and I know you, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, are very concerned about this because you have always represented the blue-collar worker. These are indisputable figures. The carbon tax and the RET have turned our manufacturing sector into a killing field. Under Labor's five years of government, over 140,000 manufacturing jobs were lost. So did we reduce our carbon emissions? No. We sent our manufacturing across to China, across to India, across to Indonesia, where they do not have the clean-air controls that our factories have. We have exported our carbon emissions. We have made other countries take on the role of our manufacturers.


When the leader of the Labor Party in the eighties said, 'We're going to get rid of tariffs,' I thought, 'This is big, brave stuff,' and because I worked in manufacturing—I was a manufacturer's agent—I knew a bit about it, and my thoughts went out to the blue-collar workers who do not have great experience, who grab a bucket from the way and put it in a hot dip and pull it out the other side. There were 300 of these people in one factory I represented for Queensland and probably 250 in the other. One was a paintbrush factory; the other was in metal. I thought to myself, 'How are these people going to get jobs?' I really had doubts. I must admit I was a doubting Thomas about it. And then the mining industry came along and everyone got a job. People got jobs in other areas. I have to admit that the Labor Party at that time were right. They removed tariffs. They created a better standard of living. Instead of going and buying a pair of shoes for $300, you could go and buy a pair of shoes for $80 and you had another $200-odd to spend down at the shops. It created employment and it created activity. That works. That works, as long as you can employ people. What we had was very low-cost energy, high-cost labour and good conditions.


In manufacturing, there are three things: the cost of labour, the cost of energy and the cost of raw materials. The cost of raw materials is set by a world price and you cannot shift it very much either way. The cost of energy and the cost of labour are set by the government. Paul Howes today—and I commend this to anyone in the Labor Party—is virtually saying the same thing as Maurice Newman, the Prime Minister's adviser; David Goodwin, from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and Brendan Pearson, from the Minerals Council: 'Have cheap energy, reasonable conditions and good wages, but don't trade away what you have got as cheap energy.' That is what has happened with this carbon tax. You do not have to be Robinson Crusoe. You do not have to be Einstein. It is happening before your eyes. But somehow the Labor Party do not seem to be able to see it. Paul Howes, David Goodwin, Brendan Pearson and the National Farmers' Federation are all singing off the one hymn sheet: 'Give us reliable, cheap energy and we can have decent conditions, pay a little bit more.' As Paul Howes rightly points out, we are a wealthy country and we are never going to be able to mix it with the cheaper, Bangladesh-type workers, and we do not want to. 


What is happening is that renewable energy and the carbon tax are just destroying our industries. I do not want to claim that the carbon tax is doing it solely. The high dollar does represent problems, and unfortunately it is coming back as a problem. But just look at what has happened in the last six months: McCain's processing plant in Penola, South Australia, 59 employees sacked; Simplot, 110 jobs going over to New Zealand. They do not have a carbon tax over there. Well, they do, but it is about the equivalent of a Mars bar, about $1, a tonne. It is all going over there. Simplot is downsizing its Bathurst plant operation, and 110 jobs have gone to New Zealand. Golden Circle have gone to New Zealand. I have got a special interest in Golden Circle because it was my father-in-law who, with a number of other farmers, established the cooperative of Golden Circle. My wife says that she can remember the days when she was eight or nine and her big day was going down to Golden Circle for dinner in the boardroom. At Downer EDI, 100 employees have gone. At Electrolux, 500 jobs have gone. Caterpillar announced that 200 jobs in Burnie have gone to Thailand. Kellogg's announced that 100 jobs have gone from the New South Wales Central Coast. 


Then we get to the big ones: Holden, 2,900 jobs; Toyota, 3,000 jobs; and Ford, probably the same. But why? On every Ford, every Toyota, every Holden, there is a $400 carbon tax. That is at the factory level. Then you put your margin onto the selling agents and it increases. Then on top of the $400 you have got a $200 renewable energy tax. That is a huge handicap for those people in the manufacturing industry to overcome. In fact, they cannot overcome it. So what have they done? They have gone. With our carbon tax and our renewable energy tax, household electricity prices have increased by 110 per cent in the past five years. Australian business, which accounts for 70 per cent of the total electricity use in Australia, has experienced almost an 80 per cent increase in prices since 2009. The causes are not hard to find. The carbon tax accounted for 16 per cent of the electricity bill for a typical large industrial user in New South Wales. The carbon tax added $6.4 billion to the nation's tax bill. We can say, 'Everyone else is doing it.' Well, I am sorry; no-one else is doing it. We have the dearest carbon tax in the world, and it is going to go up. We are out there showing the way. We are out there like Sister Anna carrying the banner, with someone else behind beating a drum. But no-one is following our stupidity.


You can argue that the science says this and the science says that. I will tell you, for every scientist that says the world is being overwhelmed by CO2 and temperatures are rising, you can find another 10 scientists that say that it is not.




Senator Stephens:
  You can't!




Senator BOSWELL:
  I am not going to get into that dispute.




Senator McLucas:
  That is not true!




Senator BOSWELL:
  I am not going to get into that dispute because I do not think it matters one iota. What matters is this: if you are going to have a carbon tax, then you had better make sure India, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh and all those other countries go along with you, because, if they do not, it is no more than a simple gesture. I do not want to get into the science. You do not have to get there but, if you want to convince me that a carbon tax will work, firstly, go and tell the people in Indonesia: 'I know you're only on a couple of rupiahs a day, but I know you'll carry the load, because it's good for the earth. We'll put a tax on your heating and we'll put a tax on your lighting.' They will say, 'But we don't have any lighting. Yes, we do have heating. We're very lucky; we have a kerosene heater.' 'Oh well, we'll tax that.' There would be a riot, and so there should be. 


If you go to China, what are they doing? We are told that they have got renewable energy. Yes, they have got a bit of renewable energy. Let us see what China have got in the way of renewable energy. Their renewable energy is about six per cent. Solar accounts for 0.2 per cent and wind is about six per cent. Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, I know you are interested in this, because I have always found you a person to be interested in the working class, the working person. Every two weeks, China is putting in a new one-gigawatt power station 


In Australia our total transmission through energy is 50 gigawatts. The energy that is driven out of Australia is 50 gigawatts. China are putting in one gigawatt every two weeks. China have a total capacity of 557,938 megawatts. India has a total capacity of 519,396 megawatts. Of course the brave Greens would say, 'I know it's rough in India, but you have to pull your weight and do a bit of sacrificing.' The people of India say: 'We live in a cardboard carton. What more can we sacrifice? Our kids cannot go to school. Do you want us to sacrifice more? What have we got to sacrifice?' The Greens, never short of an answer, would say: 'The wealthy countries like Australia and America can pay.' That is what the Copenhagen agreement started out to say.


I have never seen things so bad in Australia. On Sunday a friend of mine put a job ad on the website for an accounts clerk. By Sunday afternoon he had 100 people applying for the job and yesterday there were 200 people. He employed a solicitor to do a clerk's job and she was so grateful. It is a killing field out there. We do not realise that in here, because we are well paid and our kids are well looked after. But out there it is a battle. I am frightened for my grandchildren. We cannot afford to do this. We have got to pass this legislation.


While you are procrastinating, jobs are going and companies are closing. Holden is withdrawing. Then you have $100 million for the airline and $27 million for Virgin. Out of $250 million, $100 million is not going to rock the financial boat, but $100 million is a lot of jobs. You can employ a lot of people for $100 million.


The Labor Party are trying to defend 33 per cent of the votes. Thirty-three per cent is never going to get them into government. They have to sell their wares to the tradies, the people who work in factories and the people who have not got jobs. They are not doing it and they are going to be over there for the next 100 years if they do not break away from the Greens and defend their old position for the traditional blue-collar workers. If they do that, they will be some competition. If they do not, they are going to be over that side for the next 20 years.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (17:56):  I too rise to make a contribution to this debate on the carbon tax bills. I listened with interest to Senator Boswell, but I fear that the facts might have gotten in the way of a good story. We need to acknowledge that the climate change challenge, particularly the need to lower CO2intensity and thus improve energy efficiency across the economy, is actually closely related to the need to increase productivity-improving investment. That is why Labor see climate change as an opportunity rather than a barrier to a stronger economy. That is why we pursued the clean energy policy that would spur investment in research and development and promote innovation and the use of new technologies and do that at a negligible cost to the economy.


We have always believed, despite the government's denials, that climate change is fundamentally an externality problem, where the costs of the activity are not fully represented in the institution or the market where the decisions are being made about the activity and that then leads to excessive social costs and what the economists would call a suboptimal welfare outcome. We also believe, despite the government's denials, that climate change is fundamentally a global problem and, as with any international problem, coordination issues are the key. We further believe that climate change is a problem whose solution implies costs for certain powerful vested interests in the economy, and we know whose interests are being protected with the repeal of the carbon tax. Finally, Labor believe that climate change is a problem on timescales that are larger than the human life span. So climate change is a long-term, intergenerational problem with the complicating issues that such problems entail.


Professor Ross Garnaut called it a diabolical public policy problem. Others in the field of public policy describe these problems as wicked. That is not to suggest, as many on the other side would, that climate change is a problem that is not solvable. In fact, the most challenging aspects of the problem are practical not conceptual, in particular the need to create a coordinated international approach. Conceptually we certainly understand the externality problems well. We understand the specific nature of climate change externality and we understand the mechanisms needed to overcome the intergenerational aspects of the problem. From a domestic point of view, if the will to address the problem were shared by both sides of politics, it would actually cease to be a policy problem for government at all and would instead become a practical engineering and scientific problem for industry and academia. The challenge would become purely one of invention and investment, and its solution would benefit the economy and our long-term competitiveness and prosperity.


Climate change is not the result of true disagreement about the best solutions that governments and countries might argue as the best policy approach. It is actually the effort to delay or avoid the implementation of real solutions that causes this dilemma. These efforts are born either of a denial of the problem in the first place, which we hear constantly from the government, or of a misrepresentation of the scientific uncertainty in order to delay the implementation of solutions and to delay harm to vested interests. We have heard that argument consistently from the government as well. Both of those explanations apply to the government's position and its action on repealing these bills.


Labor accepts the science of climate change and we believe that we need to do something about it. Mr Abbott and the coalition do not. This bill removes the legal cap on pollution and allows the big polluters carte blanche to pollute, courtesy of the pollution fund being set up by the government. The bill is nonsensical in every way, just as the Direct Action Plan is nonsensical. Experts agree that this will cost households more, while failing to cut pollution.


Several economists, in submissions to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's inquiry into the government's Direct Action Plan, have highlighted that any real solution needs to include several features. A broad based carbon price is the first. It will: incentivise investment in deployment of and research in low-carbon technologies; incentivise abatement across the whole economy, which will allow private actors to make low-cost abatement decisions; raise revenue in an economically inefficient manner—taxing a good which produces a negative societal externality is one of the few methods available of raising revenue that does not produce the usual economic dead-weight cost on the economy—and ensure that an equitable approach to climate change is taken. Revenue raised will need to be used to support low-carbon investment, trade exposed industries and low-income earners. It needs to be able to be linked to global carbon markets and thus become part of a global solution to climate change. It needs to be permanent in order to provide policy and investment certainty with long-term carbon allocations decided on the basis of fair Australian effort and scientific advice. Labor's clean energy future legislation satisfied all of these features, and the fact is that the Abbott government does not have an alternative that meets the same standards.


Mr David Rossiter, who appeared before the environment committee's inquiry, reminded the committee that there is very little new thinking in the government's alternative. He said in his submission:


The DAP is very similar to the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Plan (GGAP) introduced by the Howard Government in 1999 as that plan also called for a reverse auction process for abatement action funding. It failed to deliver over a ten year period and was originally intended to be a four year programme. Ultimately despite the increase in implementation period only 36% of the funds were expended and the amount of abatement achieved was considerably less than was expected at tender and at a greater cost per tonne of abatement. It effectively delivered under 15% of its target in its original programme term.


He went on to say:


It would therefore be expected that DAP will suffer from similar problems, that is, it will have a considerably extended implementation period, an inability to disburse funds quickly and have increased abatement costs over those tendered for any abatement it does encourage. The current national target for abatement is a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020. It is unlikely that DAP will be able to achieve the quantum of abatement required by this target within the requisite timeframe. History shows us GGAP was regarded by the Howard Government as a failed experiment as they then adopted an emission trading scheme as their preferred mechanism to address climate change.


So here we have another revisionist policy and the government playing back to the future with everybody's future.


Last year, the OECD released a report confirming that countries could achieve higher levels of emissions reduction at much lower cost if they relied on emissions trading schemes. Emissions trading schemes are already being adopted in many countries around the world, including in the UK, France, Germany, South Korea, Canada and parts of the US and China. The GLOBE Climate Legislation Study, which covers 66 countries across the globe, found that Australia is the only country to be taking negative legislative action in climate policy. The study covers major nations including the US, China, India, Brazil and more.


The government senators' contributions to this debate have been superficial and unconvincing, simply because Mr Abbott and the coalition have not been able to come up with one credible scientist or economist willing to stand up and back their climate change policy. As we heard on Friday at the inquiry hearing, the Direct Action Plan requires setting baselines for a diverse set of projects over a wide variety of sectors. This is a very difficult and highly specialised task that should not be underestimated. It is highly site and geographic location specific. It is extremely resource intensive and it often exposes a lack of firm data from which baselines can be set.


The government claims that the Direct Action Plan will be simple, straightforward and streamlined to make it 'easy for businesses to participate'. But the reality is that the baseline system proposed is extremely complicated, detailed and data intensive if it is to be credible and accountable, as it will have to be, because the grants system proposed for allocating public money will require that. History also tells us that the system will inherently take a lot of time to reach decisions because of the baseline process. Consequently, the time frame for abatement will be reduced from the maximum of five years and costs per tonne will inevitably rise further. We are not that far away from 2020. About 60 actions are identified. This means that perhaps 600 or more baselines might be called for in the bidding process, with each being proposed and having to be independently verified. That alone is an extraordinarily enormous task. But, in addition, by the voluntary nature of participation in the measure, not all of the actions shown will be able to be bid for under Direct Action Plan. There may be too short a period for a return to be made or the risks associated with reliability of any innovation being proposed and other more costly actions will have to be invoked to achieve the abatement required to meet the full quantum of the target.


This issue was also revealed in the Howard government program and consequently any abatement cost curve produced in this form will represent a lower bound on cost and an upper bound on abatement quantity. In other words, the abatement costs will be higher and the total abatement quantity will be less than expected. Under emissions trading schemes, such cost abatement curves represent an upper bound on cost and lower bound on abatement quantity. In other words, there are more abatement options identified, costs are less and total abatement quantity can be higher. That reversal is because the incentive to reduce costs under emissions trading lies with the polluter and more options for abatement will be revealed as development and further innovation occurs. History shows us more abatement options have been revealed in many similar existing market-based mechanisms, such as the US sulfur dioxide reduction scheme. 


Examples of the operation of the Direct Action Plan quoted by the government are very misleading. Several government senators have referred to the transport sector and have diligently quoted the Emissions Reduction Fund green paper, for example: 


… fleet operators could be rewarded for reducing emissions per tonne of freight per kilometre. 


That is an example that has been widely and publicly referenced back to a major transport company by the government purporting to show how the Direct Action Plan will work. While the emissions intensity of that company may have dropped, National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme data published by the government for the company show that its total emissions have risen by 11 per cent, not fallen at all. The world's atmosphere is not concerned about emissions intensity—and Australia's international target commitments are not framed in such terms. Total emissions are the only issue at stake. The Direct Action Plan is structured counter-intuitively—the taxpayer pays the polluter and the polluter may or may not reduce their emissions. We have no idea how the government intends to encourage compliance with abatement proposals.


Climate change, as we all know, is set to have a major impact on Australia's economy and the environment and these impacts increase significantly with larger increases in temperature. Many senators have made that point in their contributions. We say we know climate change is well understood. Climate change is already occurring, and the independent modelling that has been undertaken has proven that the government's alternative climate change policies will cost billions of dollars more than Mr Abbott claims and will have no chance of meeting Australia's emissions reduction target. The government policy will simply be nothing more than an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing meaningful or systemic to address climate change. 


We need to be very clear about the government's alternative plan. Achieving the emissions reduction required to deliver its commitment to the five per cent target would require an additional expenditure of more than $4 billion to 2020. What do we have? We have the coalition's approach to carbon pollution, which is to create this $2.9 billion fund to pay Australian companies to reduce pollution. Where Labor's focus is to cap the amount of pollution that can enter the atmosphere and to have a system for business to find the cheapest way to reduce their pollution, the government will use taxpayers' money to pay big polluters. What will the outcome be? Independent research and modelling, undertaken by SKM-MMA and Monash University's Centre of Policy Studies, shows that the Emissions Reduction Fund will see pollution increase by 8 to 10 per cent above 2000 levels by 2020; reduce pollution by nearly one-third less than Labor's policy; require significant additional investment of between $4 billion and $15 billion to achieve the 2020 target; see costs and pollution both increase over time and even with spending increasing to around $88 billion from 2014 to 2050 pollution would still be increased by about 45 per cent over this period; and subsidise the pollution of businesses who do not make the changes, with these public subsidies calculated at about $50 billion to 2020. 


The government is actually relentlessly pursuing an ideological agenda—part of its three-word campaign slogan from the last election. This is despite the fact that they are now in government and have access to all the data that informed the Labor government policies. Labor provided unprecedented support for renewable energy through the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The government is intent on abolishing these. Labor provided support for business to become more efficient and productive, including the Clean Technology Program and the Jobs and Competitiveness Program. The government is intent on abolishing these. Labor also provided support to reduce land sector emissions through the Carbon Farming Initiative. It is interesting that the government is set to replace this with the Green Army of underpaid, undertrained young workers and a tree planting target that is simply unachievable.


Labor has contributed an extraordinary legacy: our wind capacity has trebled; more than a million households have solar panels installed; employment in the renewable energy industry has more than doubled to over 24,000 people; and during the first year of the carbon price around 150,000 jobs have been created while the economy continued to grow at 2.5 per cent and inflation remained low, pollution in the national electricity market decreased by seven per cent and, again, renewable power energy generated as a share of the national electricity market increased by 25 per cent. 


In the area of agriculture, since 2011 farmers and landholders have been able to create offset credits under the Carbon Farming Initiative. Under that CFI, farmers are able to earn credits by reducing carbon pollution and then sell those credits to the 370 large business that are covered under the emissions trading scheme. That CFI means that farmers are able to do their bit in helping Australia to meet its international target while at the same time earning income by reducing carbon pollution. The government intends to decimate clean energy investment in Australia and their legislation to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has shown their complete antagonism to the sector. As the committee heard in the hearing last week, agriculture barely gets a mention in the government's green paper—something we certainly have not heard from any Nationals senators.


We want to tackle climate change in the most effective way possible. We put in place a very effective scheme. It was delivering on the long-term outcomes that Australia needed to deliver; it was providing best-practice guidelines for industry and innovation; and all the experts tell us that an ETS puts a legal cap on carbon pollution and lets business work out the best, cheapest and most effective way to operate within that. That is what this government is seeking to unravel, and it will be to the nation's peril.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2014-03-04,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (18:15):  I rise also to speak on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013. I would first like to commend opposition senators on their fine contributions to this bill—well thought out arguments against these pieces of legislation. It is simply not good enough to stick our heads in the sand and leave the next generation to tackle the issue of climate change. Climate change is real, and the Labor Party supports real, meaningful, effective action on climate change. As I have said in previous contributions on climate change, something must be done; we cannot sit back and do nothing. Our parliament, as leaders of our country, must send a clear message on this issue, which is so important to our children and future generations. 


The most cost-effective way to deal with carbon pollution is an emissions trading scheme. An emissions trading scheme—a market based mechanism with a legal cap on carbon pollution—is the cheapest and the most effective way to reduce emissions, while encouraging business. Labor accepts both the science of climate change and the fact that Australia cannot afford to leave the challenge of climate change to future generations. Mr Abbott and his environment minister, Mr Hunt, and the coalition do not. No credible expert argues that the coalition's direct action policies will work. The government do not even want to put a cap on how much pollution is allowed in Australia. It shows that they do not have the political will or the nous to actually effect meaningful change to reduce emissions. Big polluters, who put out high levels of carbon emissions, should not be subsidised by the taxpayer. Treasury has estimated the cost of Direct Action at $10 billion a year; that is, money paid as taxes by ordinary Australians then siphoned off into the pockets of big polluters.


I ask you: how can that sit well with anyone? It is certainly not sitting well with the Australian people. A Fairfax-Nielsen poll at the end of last year showed just 12 per cent of Australians supported Direct Action. Don't hold your breath, Mr Acting Deputy President, if you expect Mr Abbott to take any notice! This is a government that did not even bother sending any ministerial representation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Warsaw, a government that was not represented by a minister at this significant worldwide conference. It is a government that barely pays lip-service to one of the greatest challenges our planet faces this century.


Emissions trading schemes are already in place in the UK, throughout Europe, Korea and parts of Canada and the United States. Almost every credible economist or expert says Direct Action will not work. Direct Action is not sustainable due to the cost. Most direct action plans cannot be scaled up, and those that can prove too expensive. So why do the Prime Minister and the Treasurer set about slashing services to schools, hospitals, roads, community grants and whatever else they can get their hands on? Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott are bracing themselves for huge bills into the future so that they can pay the biggest polluters. 


It is as laughable as it is tragic. The local school goes without much-needed money, but the government pays highly profitable multinationals that money instead. Carbon pollution, which causes climate change, is a problem, both environmental and economic, a problem that we must tackle. But, as we have heard in public reports and in the media, Mr Maurice Newman—one of the Prime Minister's most trusted advisers and known climate change sceptic—thinks money spent on science and cutting carbon pollution is wasted. When Mr Newman speaks, it appears that Mr Abbott not only listens, but he acts. It is deeply alarming to have someone so influential holding views on climate change that are so at odds with the Australian people, let alone with the mounting scientific evidence. It is really little surprise that with advice like this, the coalition offers such an ineffective and ill-conceived policy.


We know that climate change is real and something must be done—meaningful action must be taken. It is simple, basic logic. It is logic that we must listen to in the interests of our children, their children and for all future generations of Australians and all countries around the world. The UK, Europe, Korea and parts of North America are already using emissions trading schemes. In our region, China has also started pilot ETS schemes and, as reported in TheAge on 2 December last year, Guandong, China's largest province with a population of more than 100 million has capped greenhouse gas emissions. It began to issue carbon permits to big polluters from last December. This was after China introduced emission trading schemes in Beijing and Shanghai in late November 2013. In terms of size, Guandong's carbon markets will be second only to Europe's trading scheme. 


Australia must live in the real world and stay the course towards an ETS. Labor will continue to listen to the best available science and it does beggar belief that any political party would not. Yet we have those opposite shouting down the experts and sticking their fingers in their ears and, in fact, trying to put legislation into the parliament to repeal some of that expert advice.


Those who do not have their fingers in their ears should be crossing them. History will not be kind to this government. It will be a government that will look foolish for ignoring the science. It will be the government that ignored the biggest problem of this century because it lacked the courage to tackle the real issue. The climate change deniers will look as foolish as those who once argued that cigarettes do not cause lung cancer. But Mr Abbott is a denier and wants to tear down the progress made by the previous government. If Mr Abbott wants to scrap the so-called carbon tax, it must be replaced with something that works. It is accepted that an emissions trading scheme will work by putting a cap on carbon, but there is uncertainty about what the Liberal Party's policy will do. When pushed, the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, could not explain it in parliament and Mr Hunt has been unable to explain how it will actually work.


Carbon pollution changes our weather and harms our environment. That is the best available science. The experts all agree. All reputable scientists say that it is a fact: the climate is changing and humans are accelerating that change. That is why governments around the world are taking action, including the previous Labor government. But this government, under Prime Minister Tony Abbott, has effectively put taking meaningful steps into the too-hard basket. Instead, we have a toxic policy from a government out of step with society both in this country and on a global scale.


Labor argues that we should tackle the problem and that Australia should back itself to compete with the rest of the world by still acting responsibly for future generations. Those future generations should be proud to look back at this period of history and see that Australia made a difference. Instead, they will read about an isolationist Australian government that shrugged its shoulders, paid a bit of lip-service, tore up policy that was making meaningful change and established a slush fund of billions of taxpayers' dollars to hand to polluters. What sort of legacy is that? Rather than feeling pride, they will be ashamed that a coalition government tore down the progress that was already made, put in laws that nobody wanted, caused economic and environmental upheaval and gave up on tackling such a huge issue.


The coalition wants to replace the laws with this poorly-thought-out replacement, Direct Action, that nobody with any economic or environmental credibility thinks will work. As I have indicated, they want to replace that with a scheme that will cost taxpayers an estimated $10 billion a year. No less an authority than Alan Kohler sums it up:


Tony Abbott will have to either drop the promise to cut emissions by five per cent or the promise to repeal the carbon tax - both together will be impossible without massive Government spending under the proposed ""direct action"" policy of paying companies to reduce emissions.


I ask the Senate: which of those two options—repealing the carbon tax or reducing emissions by five per cent—should we expect Mr Abbott to choose? With advisers such as Mr Maurice Newman in Mr Abbott's ear, it is safe to say that he would prefer to ditch the price on carbon and damn the consequences if we do not need the absolute minimum emissions target reduction.


Mr Kohler also says:


The liquefied natural gas (LNG) export boom will make it virtually impossible for Australia to meet the Government's carbon emissions reduction target.


So according to one of our most respected economic voices in Australia, under Direct Action there is no chance of meeting the minimum target. Mr Kohler says that not trying to reduce carbon emissions at all would put Australia at odds with the rest of the world, including China and the US, and endanger trade agreements. But as Mr Kohler writes:


… the Prime Minister and Treasurer Joe Hockey will be, or at least should be, desperately hoping that the Senate never allows the repeal of the emission trading scheme legislation, so it's not exactly a broken promise—at least they tried.


At least they tried! Already, the coalition—Mr Hockey, Mr Abbott and senators in this place—might just wash their hands of the issue altogether.


The coalition has given up—it is too hard! They have put in place Direct Action as an alleged alternative policy, but it will not achieve anything meaningful. This is a government without a map to navigate the country into the future. It is a government refusing to live in the real world. It is a government refusing to listen to the experts. It is a government claiming that it knows best but with no actual idea of what it will do when the hard questions are asked of Direct Action.


Businesses with foresight are already leading the charge, using clean, green technologies of the future to secure the long-term future of their businesses. Governments that claim to have foresight would be wise to follow their lead. We cannot afford to be left behind. Treasury said in its Blue Book, prepared prior to the 2010 election:


A market based mechanism can achieve the necessary abatement at a cost per tonne of emissions far lower than any other alternative direct-action policies.


That advice on Direct Action from Treasury hardly sits on its own.


The poorly-thought-out Direct Action policy is also at odds with industry. In a submission to the government the Australian Industry Group said:


… there is a risk that the Emissions Reduction Fund does not deliver the abatement outcomes sought. As currently understood there is no equivalent to an emissions cap or other legal guarantee that the targets will be met.


The AiG, which speaks on behalf of about 60,000 businesses, wants the government to adopt a market mechanism—an ETS. he AiG says it is the cheapest and most effective way to drive down carbon pollution. This is a 60,000-strong industry group urging the government to put in place a market mechanism, not its Direct Action Plan. This respected industry group says that 'bureaucratic or political decision making are usually poor substitutes for the judgements of market actors responding to price in light of their own circumstances'. And, along with Mr Kohler, the AiG also raised fears over the consequences of not matching the emissions reduction targets of other major economies around the world.


The AiG says that consistent global action is fundamental to preserving Australian competitiveness. Economists and climate scientists across the world all agree that an emissions trading scheme—a market-based mechanism with a legal cap on carbon pollution—is the cheapest and most effective way to reduce pollution and provide certainty for business, again, as we have seen with the AiG, representing over 60,000 Australian businesses, telling the government not to push forward with Direct Action. So I ask: is this the government they voted for—one that would not listen and jeopardise economic growth? In 2011, accounting and audit expert Ernst & Young said that Direct Action has key problems that could 'hinder Australia's participation in a deeper and globally consistent response to climate change'—yet more evidence that Direct Action will leave Australia at odds with other economic powers.


In June 2012 the global chief executive of Shell, Mr Peter Voser, told 7.30 that the company already includes carbon pricing in investments and that his company took a longer term view than the next two or three quarters.


This longer term certainty is not provided by Direct Action. To quote Mr Voser:


… Shell as a company is actually very much advocating that we need a price for carbon on a worldwide basis and we want that to be on a market mechanism.


This is the head of a massive multinational company calling for a price on carbon through a market mechanism—an ETS. The list goes on. The former Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, called on the coalition to scrap its Direct Action Plan. He said:


The easiest cut you'll make is the stuff you never go into.


And then in August of last year a leading researcher on emissions markets released detailed modelling on Direct Action and found that Direct Action would leave emissions 16 per cent above 2000 levels, would require an extra $35 billion to meet the target, cannot meet higher targets and needs to pay polluters $58 per tonne by 2020.


But, as we have heard, Mr Abbott and Mr Hunt are not listening to these respected voices. Mr Abbott is not listening to the Australian people. The recent Nielsen-Fairfax poll released on November 25 showed that only 12 per cent of people polled supported Mr Abbott's direct action policy. That says loud and clear that the voters of Australia—the hardworking taxpayers of Australia—do not want their tax dollars being shelled out by this coalition towards those who need it least: big polluters. Just 12 per cent of Australians, according to the poll, are backing Mr Abbott. This is not the government they told Australian businesses and families they would be. Australia should be setting a standard on the global scale and working with the major economies of the globe.


Mr Abbott should show leadership. This 44th Parliament will be judged by the history books on this issue as much as on any other. Labor is comfortable with our position: climate change is real, and we must not stall on acting on it. Labor supports an emissions trading scheme. We do not support Direct Action. Australians agree that there is something happening to our climate. They want action. They want meaningful action. That is what the ETS delivers. It is better for the economy. It is better for the environment. Our summers are getting hotter. Our weather is changing. That changing weather affects our economy. It affects our river systems, our reefs, our farms, our cities. It affects the entire country. We must take a stand. We cannot leave it for the next generation, the next parliament. We have to act and act now. The experts have spoken, and we must listen to them. To do nothing is unforgivable.


Labor introduced an emissions trading scheme that is working. It was cutting dirty power generation and increasing clean energy generation. Are Mr Abbott, Mr Hunt, Mr Hockey and their colleagues comfortable about facing up to future generations with their feeble excuses for having done so little at best, and having caused harm at worst, to limit emissions and protect our environment? Instead, Mr Abbott wants to plough ahead with Direct Action.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,2,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-03-04,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:35):  I indicate my support for the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 and related bills and I want to outline the reasons. As I previously said, I believe we need to take meaningful and appropriate action to address the issue from both an environmental and an economic point of view. In respect of climate change, the cost of not doing so in the next few years, effectively, will be much greater for generations to come. The debates around how to deal with the need to both reduce emissions and support our economy have been long and vexed. I am concerned that even now we do not have a detailed policy in place to achieve the goals we must meet. Back in 2009, then opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull and I jointly commissioned Frontier Economics to model and formulate an alternative, intensity based emissions trading scheme. The Frontier scheme could have delivered deeper cuts to emissions at a lower cost than the CPRS and the carbon tax, because it avoided the enormous economic cost associated with the revenue churn of the former government's scheme.


Frontier's modelling estimated that for every dollar invested in abatement there is a churn of $5 to $6 through the economy. An intensity based scheme, by contrast, sets emissions targets for industries, particularly the stationary energy sector, and avoids that level of churn and with it distortions and loss of economic activity. It also avoids unnecessary distortions in energy pricing in the way the merit order works with respect to that—and that is also important for economic growth and getting the balance right to find the most efficient way to reduce emissions.


Frontier Economics also calculated that it would be relatively simple to amend the CPRS legislation at the time to make it one-third cheaper and twice as effective by introducing intensity based elements. I moved a number of amendments to that effect, rejected by both the then government and the then opposition.


The warnings given at the time by Frontier of the potential for a budget black hole in the former government's approach were dismissed by the then government—Senator Wong, I think, called it 'a mongrel of a scheme'. Well, for a mongrel, it had a lot of bite! Frontier warned the Rudd government back in 2009 of the budgetary black hole created by the decline in revenues from permit sales. The government ignored this and the black hole turned out to be about $5 billion a year. They also warned that one group that would see the upside of the abolition of the price floor announced in September 2012 would be the private brown coal generators in Victoria and South Australia.


Danny Price, the Managing Director of Frontier Economics, made the point back then that the former government handed the generators billions of dollars of cash compensation and permits in the high-fixed-price period, based on the Treasury modelling of carbon prices across many years, not just the fixed-price period. These figures were unrealistically high. Ironically, as Danny Price pointed out in an opinion piece in The Australian in September 2012:


Of course, one group that will see only upside from the abolition of the price floor is the private brown coal generators in Victoria and South Australia. The government handed them billions of dollars of cash compensation and permits in the high fixed-price period, based on the Treasury modelling of carbon prices across many years, not just the fixed price period, that now look unrealistically high. Ironically, this makes the dirty brown coal generators more valuable than if the government had never priced carbon and compensated for it.


Danny Price went on to say:


It also makes the dirty brown coal generators relatively more valuable than the cleaner, government-owned black coal power generators in NSW and Queensland that have not been compensated.


Something Treasury has also ignored over the past few years in the context of carbon policy, which must be tackled now, is a tax interaction effect associated with different mechanisms for reducing emissions. This tax interaction effect should not be ignored from a public policy point of view—or from a sheer economics point of view. It actually matters. 


Frontier's proposed amendments to the CPRS would have substantially reduced the economic distortions that the proposed CPRS, or the current carbon tax, would create, as a direct result of savings due to a reduction in inefficiencies of the tax interaction effect of current policies. As Frontier put it:


… pre-existing taxes already create economic distortions that discourage investment, consumption and labour. When a carbon price/tax is imposed in addition to these existing taxes, the resulting economic costs are multiplicative, not additive.


That means that the revenue churn of the CPRS and the carbon tax has a disproportionate drag on the economy, as well as leading to much higher abatement costs.


I am also acutely aware that the Gillard government had, in effect, a reverse mandate when it came to the carbon tax, in the sense that the former Prime Minister promised not to introduce a price on carbon on the eve of the 2010 election. That, combined with the flawed design of that scheme and the associated budget black hole, made it impossible for me to support the former government's carbon tax and emissions trading scheme. But, in the context of this vote to repeal the carbon tax, there ought to be, at the very least, a very firm personal commitment from the Prime Minister to establish an alternative scheme which at minimum will achieve the bipartisan goal of a five per cent reduction in emissions on 2000 levels by 2020.


That leads to the next question of how to best replace the carbon tax with a credible alternative scheme for emissions reductions. I have said before that I was shocked to hear during the Senate inquiry into these bills on 26 November last year that Treasury has not undertaken—or had not, at that stage—any modelling to determine whether it is more effective to spend money to reduce high-emissions activity or to spend money to increase cleaner generation activity. This is a significant gap in policymaking and I strongly believe the government should commission such modelling as a matter of priority. In fact, a question I would like to give on notice to the government, Mr Acting Deputy President, is: have they actually undertaken this? I think it is something the government ought to address when they are summing up this debate—because they know, Treasury knows, that whether you spend money on reducing high-emissions activity or on increasing cleaner generation activity does make a difference to what is more cost-effective and the price effects of that. 


A carbon reduction policy can only achieve its objectives through investment because, in order to transform the economy to a lower-polluting one, you need to change how energy is produced and used. Therefore, we need to know where to direct investment for the best outcomes. The business environment needs to be conducive for that investment to flourish; otherwise, the taxpayer has to pay for it through subsidies or the consumer through higher power prices—and, inevitably, they are effectively one and the same.


The former government fatally damaged its carbon policy by its ill-considered, and I suggest cavalier, changing of the rules. Removing the carbon price floor and then bringing forward the ETS by a year may have seemed like reasonable and popular policy shifts, but it caused great uncertainty for investors and highlighted the lack of robustness in the scheme. I have no doubt that the changes in government policy have led to major investors either walking away from the Australian energy market or deferring additional investment.


I think the second Rudd Government's proposal just before the election, to link the carbon price to the European scheme by next year, was the final nail in the carbon tax coffin. A European price of about $6 a tonne would be a nuisance tax that would do nothing to drive investment in cleaner energy in Australia. This is especially true where the European price may have been artificially inflated and, in any case, may have little stability—hardly attractive for investors. But the energy sector here well knows that the European scheme has been subject to significant political volatility, leading to price uncertainty. Here in Australia, that would create investment uncertainty and risk. That is why I have to date supported retaining the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


The elegant simplicity of the Frontier scheme would have been that instead of charging for all emissions it would reward cleaner forms of energy and technology, reducing their cost rather than increasing them, largely avoiding a revenue churn and the associated economic distortions. Also, rather than government acting as both a conflicted tax collector and benefactor, trade would occur between market participants. Despite its flaws, at least Direct Action could be modified to be more efficient and it does not involve the churn of the former government's approach. I believe Direction Action can be modified to take elements of the Frontier approach, to deliver a more cost-effective environmental outcome than the current carbon-pricing arrangements. As I understand it, the Direct Action approach involves a tender process—I say 'as I understand it' because a discussion paper released relatively recently on Direct Action seems to lack sufficient detail, although it appears the government is prepared to show some flexibility in its approach.


Australian state governments conduct tenders for billions of dollars of services in the economy each year. Some of these tenders are flawed and sometimes the services delivered are poor. However, a robustly designed tender process can still be a credible approach to obtain services at a competitive price. Under Direct Action there is only one buyer of the services—the government.


There is a direct cost to the taxpayers and the government has given itself a lot of wriggle room in setting out what the likely costs over the next four years will be. Environment Minister Greg Hunt told Lateline's Emma Alberici that the emissions reduction target is $2.5 billion over the next four years, in terms of money to be spent, but the coalition's policy documents three years ago said that Direct Action obligations would cost $10.5 billion over 10 years. The big advantage of Direct Action that I see, subject to modifications, is that the government spends only a dollar for every dollar that needs to be invested in reducing emissions—not a $5 tax for every dollar, as occurs under current arrangement. This means Direct Action will largely avoid the tax interaction effect, and in this sense is cheaper than what we currently have in terms of reducing emissions.


The other significant benefit of Direct Action is that it will appeal to investors and that they will have a contract with the government to supply abatement. Investors understand contracts and so does the government. It is a very secure and well understood instrument in business and this level of security will attract the investment needed to achieve our abatement targets.


I note Minister Hunt has said that Direct Action could be implemented by regulation, rather than through legislation, to avoid a hostile Senate. I think that is very problematic because of the potential for any regulations to be disallowed by the Senate, throwing the scheme into disarray and with it any investor certainty with respect to abatement.


I still regard the Frontier scheme as much more targeted in terms of emissions abatement, but I think there is scope for what appears to be a malleable Direct Action approach to incorporate its key elements. It is worth noting that the Frontier scheme unveiled by Malcolm Turnbull and myself, in mid-2009, actually had a 10 per cent emissions reduction target, not five per cent. That is because some of the cost efficiencies from the Frontier scheme were spent on achieving a tougher target. Given that Direct Action has a similar quality, I will be urging the government to allocate some of the efficiency savings from Direct Action to achieving a more ambitious but affordable emissions reduction targets.


I believe the government needs to reconsider its approach to excluding overseas permits from Direct Action. This needs to be put on the agenda. There are arguments to consider the competitive neutrality of buying permits overseas, as long as they are robustly assessed and the local economic benefits of abatement are taken into account.


That brings me to the next related question of how the Direct Action scheme and the renewable energy target may interact. I think it is important that, while all the carbon policy balls are up in the air, the government needs to look at the interaction between the RET and Direct Action. There is an opportunity here to have a coherent environmental policy as well as having a more ambitious reduction target.


I note the May 2011 report from the Productivity Commission, Carbon emission policies in key economies, said that the RET was an expensive form of abatement. Whilst I query whether the commission took too narrow an approach in its analysis, I think it would be worthwhile to review the RET in at least one regard, as it has been reviewed in other jurisdictions—that is, the existing framework fails to weight renewable energy certificates on the basis of whether the renewable energy is more reliable as a baseload source. Baseload geothermal, solar thermal and tidal power are at a distinct disadvantage in the current scheme, compared with wind energy, because of this lack of weighting. If you want to replace coal-fired power stations you need to have a reliable form of baseload energy. It is reasonable to say that wind energy investment has choked out investment in baseload renewables, which is something that is of particular concern in my home state of South Australia as it has enormous potential with its geothermal reserves in the north of the state.

 (Queensland) (18:50):  by leave—I present to the Senate the following e-petition, from over 8,000 people, which is not in conformity with the standing orders as it is not in the correct form:


Federal Parliament of Australia


This petition was created on behalf of the Call Upon the Australian Government to Protect the Dingo organisation and has collected over 8,000 signatures world-wide. The initial target was 5,000.


The action we require from the government is for the dingo, an animal native to Australia, to be protected under Federal law because at this stage the level of protection varies from state to state and in some states, it is not protected at all.  A particular case in point is that of the Fraser Island dingo, the last of the pure bred strains of dingo left in Australia.


Please consider this petition carefully and with the respect due to any native animal of


Australia. They are all relevant to the environmental health and wellbeing of our country and this includes the dingo.


Thank you.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:51):  I am delighted to rise to comment on the report to the parliament titled Livestock mortalities for exports by sea: 1 January - 30 June 2013. I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


In so doing I comment once again on the excellence of the figures that have been presented to us in the report. Of some 440,000 cattle—just under half a million—mortalities were 500, or 0.12 per cent. n other words, more than 440,000 of the 441,000 survived the journeys in condition as good as or better than when they left Australia's shores.


In numbers of sheep, out of 805,000 the mortality rate was 1.12 per cent, which is higher than you would normally expect—some 9,800—but there was one particular incident in September in the Gulf where the vessel, as I understand it, ran into a most unusual high-humidity period for a couple of hours. At different times I have read—although I never experienced this when I was a veterinarian on live sheep ships—about that type of circumstance, but prior to that and after that the mortality levels have been very low. If you remove those, we are back down to 0.7 per cent, which I think is a remarkable statistic and speaks to Australia's excellence over the last 40 years in leading the world in the transport of livestock to the points of export, transport on vessels, transport to feedlots, behaviour, nutrition and husbandry at ports. I will come back to that.


This evening I want to report to the Senate a remarkable statistic. In Jordan at this time there are some 700,000, moving towards one million, refugees coming across the borders from Syria. I am very proud to report that Australia almost uniquely is supplying the sheep, and therefore the sheepmeat, for that enormous number of refugees displaced by the atrocities going on in Syria at the moment. It is my understanding that meat forms about 18 per cent of the accumulated foodstuffs for those people. This country can be very proud that, as a result of the long-term contracts we have had, as a result of the excellence of the stock that leave this country and are transported and arrive in those destinations—in this case Jordan and its associated Gulf states—we are playing our role in providing foodstuffs. Should anyone say, 'Surely we could send this meat frozen or chilled,' I would dare say that, with the standard of infrastructure in the refugee camps supporting some 700,000 to a million people, refrigeration would not be high on the priority list.


We are always going to have disasters and we are always going to have events with animal deaths. Unfortunately, during the bushfire season here in Australia during January, on one day alone we lost 7,000 sheep in a bushfire in one of our southern states. Australia has always and, regrettably, will always face those sorts of events. It is the resilience of our producers, the excellence of our exporters and, I dare say, the excellence of our regulators who oversee this process that drive the improvements that always go on. I say, and will go on saying, that, of the 109 countries that export live animals around the world, there is only one country that has ever invested, and continues to invest, time, money and people in improving animal husbandry, animal welfare, nutrition, housing, transport and other standards in those markets—and that country is Australia.


I believe it is high time that Greens senators, animal activists and others in this country give some acknowledgement to the producers, the exporters and those who have over so many years worked to improve and upgrade standards. Are those standards at 100 per cent? No, they are not. But let me say this to you very clearly: should Australia ever be exited from live export trade in those markets, two things will happen: we will lose the meat trade, as indeed we have done every time we have lost live export trade, and—I say this particularly to those who genuinely have an interest in animal welfare standards around the world—the inevitable outcome will be a decline in animal welfare standards in those countries. I for one will never stand in this chamber and fail to defend animal welfare standards around the world. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (18:59):  I am pleased to rise tonight to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Canberra's oldest social club, the Canberra Burns Club. The Burns Club began in 1924, when only 3,000 people called Canberra home. A significant number of construction workers who were building the new capital city were of Scottish origin and they decided to form a society where they could support each other, socialise and maintain their Scottish cultural interests. The club was named after Scottish poet Robert Burns and quickly established itself in Canberra's life. Within its first year, the Burns Club was already an important and active influence in the Canberra community. The first highland gathering of 1925 raised money for Telopea Park School, a soccer team was formed and a series of concerts were organised to help raise funds for the Queanbeyan Hospital.


Since that first year, the Burns Club has continued to contribute to Canberra's life. Last year was Canberra's Centenary and for 90 of those 100 years the Burns Club has been a staple of Canberra's culture and community. The club's famous pipe band and highland dancing group have enriched the artistic character of Canberra, and the variety of sports groups have promoted healthy and active living while fostering community engagement.


In 1927, the Burns Club undertook a project to build a Robert Burns statue in Canberra. After raising funds across Australia, the statue was built in Forrest in 1935 and was unveiled by the then Prime Minister Joseph Lyons. It was not the first or the last encounter with politics the Burns Club would have. In 1931, the then Prime Minister James Scullin was guest of honour at the Burns Club night. In 1939, Robert Menzies became the club patron.


The club funded and built its own club facility in Forrest and it was opened in 1957. The club then moved to its current location in Kambah in 1991, where it has grown to over 14,000 members. I was privileged to be a part of the club's 90th anniversary celebration dinner last month and I was able to hear some of the great stories that are part of the club's heritage—as well as enjoy some haggis! It is an extraordinary achievement for a small, independent club like the Burns Club to have survived these nine decades—decades that saw the Great Depression, war, recession and social change.


But the Burns Club have not only survived; they have flourished and continue to live out their original charter to preserve and promote Scottish culture and to contribute positively to the community. There are many challenges that face small clubs in Canberra, but their success is an important part of maintaining and promoting the diversity of cultures and creeds here in the ACT. I encourage Canberrans and visitors to the ACT to use and support these clubs.


I would like to commend and congratulate the current president, Mr Athol Chalmers, who is also the leader of the pipe band, as well as the CEO, John Weir, for the great work that they have done. I acknowledge all the current and former members of the Canberra Burns Club who have made it such a success. I hope that this anniversary will be just one of many celebrations in the years to come.
