"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-10,"—Madam President, I seek leave to do something I should have done at the placing of business.
—You may proceed, Senator.
—I move:
That General Business notice of motion No. 72 standing in my name for today proposing an order for the production of documents by the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Region 
 al Services (Senator Ian Macdonald), be postponed till the next day of sitting.
—I put the question that motion No. 72 be deferred till the next day of sitting. I think the ayes have it.
—Madam President, I take a point of order. Did you ask the Senate if leave would be granted? I was concerned that leave might not be granted.
—A postponement can be moved at any time and leave is not required, so I didn't do so.
—She does not need leave to go back to the placing of business?
—No, not at this stage. Once the business of the Senate has commenced she would need leave. At this stage she doesn't. Senator Mackay obviously knows what she is doing.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-12-10,"—Madam President, I seek leave to present a petition from 574 petitioners which was not presented at the appropriate time.
Leave granted.
The petition read as follows—
To the honourable the President and members of the Senate assembled in parliament:
The petition of certain citizens draws the attention of the Senate to the detention of Mr Abdullan Ocalan, leader of the PKK, by the Italian authorities and his call for a negotiated settlement on the Kurdish issue.
Your petitioners therefore ask the Senate to formally ask the Italian government to grant political asylum to Mr Abdullan Ocalan and encourage the Turkish government to acknowledge his call for a unilateral cease-fire and a negotiated peace settlement.",SENATE,<title>ADDITIONAL PETITION</title>,"<title>Ocalan, Mr Abdullan</title>",Miscellaneous,16,1,speech

Leave granted.
—The coalition government will support this motion. In fact, we would have moved it ourselves except Senator Murray is quicker off the mark than the government in this respect. I do understand that at the Selection of Bills Committee the opposition did move for the same matter to be referred, so I presume that the only trouble is that the Selection of Bills Committee does not refer bills to those committees. This bill was in fact before this committee prior to the prorogation of the parliament. We would like to see it referred.

I think the sensible thing for us to do—as soon as the responsible shadow ministers and others who have an 
 interest in this matter in the chamber can confirm the facts of the matter and where the process is up to—would be to revisit it and quickly ensure that the matter is referred if that is consistent, as I understand it to be, with the spirit and the intent of the Senate on previous occasions.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-10,"—by leave—I was going to speak to the motion, but I thought it would be more simple to briefly indicate that there may be a need at a later stage, given that this may be the last day of sitting or the sitting on this day may be suspended, to make one or two other alterations to committee memberships that may also affect the government. But it is certainly a possibility that there will need to be a change of membership for certain committees because a number of matters have not quite been finalised in relation to committees' programs and references. There are also one or two issues that are still being dealt with by the House of Representatives. I would hope that, if that is the case, by leave of the Senate we can return to that and deal with those as a matter formally without delaying the Senate unduly.

That the provisions of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry 
 and report by 22 March 1999, with particular reference to:
(a)	 whether the bill, by treating companies differently depending on whether they are in a region covered by a regional forest agreement (RFA), provides for a discriminatory regime between one state and another which is inconsistent with section 99 of the Constitution;
(b)	 whether the bill is invalid to the extent that it refers to instruments not yet in force (RFAs that have yet to be concluded) or to instruments that can be varied without reference to Parliament or without a specific power in the bill enabling the variation;
(c)	 whether the compensation provisions in the RFAs are valid to the extent that they attempt to bind Parliament or fetter the exercise of executive power;
(d)	 whether the bill will limit Australia's capacity to meet its obligations under international treaties, in particular the World Heritage Convention, the Climate Change Convention, and the Ramsar Convention;
(e)	 whether the requirements of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 , the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974  and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992  have in fact been met, notwithstanding declarations to that effect in the RFAs; and

That the provisions of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 be referred to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 22 March 1999, with particular reference to:
(a)	 the relationship between the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998, in particular, the activities regulated by each and the extent of the geographical areas covered by each;
(b)	 whether the bill will fetter the capacity of the Commonwealth to meet its obligations under the World Heritage Convention and the Climate Change Convention, or any other international convention, and in particular whether native forests that are either listed, nominated or identified as being of World Heritage value could be logged;
(c)	 the amount of compensation for which the Commonwealth would be liable if its ac 
 tions directly or indirectly curtailed forestry or mining operations in areas covered by the regional forest agreement (RFA) as a result of Australia's obligation under the Climate Change Convention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
(d)	 the amount of compensation for which the Commonwealth would be liable if an action by it resulted in curtailment of forestry or mining operations in areas covered by the RFA for any of the following purposes:
	 (i)	 nomination or listing of an area for world heritage, for either cultural or natural values,
	 (ii)	 protection of species or communities that are found to be threatened during the next 20 years,
	 (iii)	 protection of the quantity or quality of water in a water catchment, and
	 (iv)	 flood mitigation;
(e)	 whether any remedy is available to the Commonwealth where a state is found to have breached the RFA, such as by logging illegally (as in East Gippsland) or by downgrading the status of reserves to permit mining (as in Tasmania);
(f)	 whether the requirements of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 , the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974  and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992  have in fact been met (notwithstanding declarations to that effect in the RFAs) and the environmental impact of RFAs overriding those Acts; and

—These motions are an effort to have the provisions of the regional forest agreements around the country referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and Arts Legislation Committee. As a result of votes in the Senate yesterday, there is going to be no real scrutiny of the content of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  and the ramifications there are for this nation. I will not go over that ground except to say that this is the opportunity for the Labor Party to at least see that there is some scrutiny of the impact of a bill which is aimed to essentially take away the power of the federal or, for that matter, state governments to intervene on what the 
 woodchip corporations have been doing in our forests for 20 years.
We heard yesterday from Senator Murphy that there is gross mismanagement in the forests of Tasmania. To summarise, the woodchip corporations are using Forestry Tasmania as an instrument to rapidly as possible cut down the grand forests of Tasmania and export them for profit, which does not stay in Tasmania but is exported to shareholders of corporations like North Pty Ltd outside the state.
The small operators in Tasmania lose out. Senator Murphy sited the Cue River sawmill, which has been operating for 100 years, which is now closing at a time when the forests of Tasmania are being cut at the greatest rate in history. When the Green-ALP accord came to an end, because Labor broke its accord commitment, particularly section 9, by lifting the ceiling on woodchip exports in 1991, the rate was 2.7 million tonnes per annum. That is the limit to which woodchip exports had been capped for 10 years. The current rate is 4.6 million tonnes per annum. It is devastating the forests of Tasmania.
There is an added component, which is very important for the Senate to know, if it does not know already—that is, there is job shedding as the carnage of the forest increases. So in the period between 1991 and now, where the forests have been cut at something like double the rate, there has been job shedding because of automation and glomeration. Big corporations are sending 90 per cent of Tasmania's forests to the woodchip mills and, ultimately, the rubbish dumps of the northern hemisphere, while the small mills continue to close. This is gross mismanagement.
There is a case to be put for there being corruption in the forest industries of Tasmania. There is a prima facie need for an independent inquiry in Tasmania, if not in the other states. We have seen the uproar in Western Australia in recent days. There is a need, I believe, for a royal commission into the way in which this great resource in Tasmania is being exploited at a loss for Tasmanians. As you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, the people of Tasmania are getting something like $12 a tonne for the 
 forests; freight on board for the woodchip company, $120 a tonne; when it comes out of the paper mills of Japan, $1,200 a tonne. This is an extraordinary set of figures showing just what an extraordinary loss of value occurs, as far as these forests are concerned, under the mismanagement of serial Labor and Liberal governments in Tasmania and Forestry Tasmania, which is nothing other than an instrument, a handmaiden, of the big woodchip corporations.
If we look at the job side of it—and the woodchip corporations always weep crocodile tears and say that they are there to defend jobs—we will see that, while some 2,500 jobs were shed in the logging of native forests in Tasmania, 3,500 jobs were created in the service, hospitality and tourism industries thanks to the native forests left standing. Whereas logging is shedding jobs as they cut faster, tourism is putting on extra jobs, even though the forests are dwindling. It is absurd.
It is irresponsible that this process should be cemented in place—a process which allows the forest to be destroyed by job-shedding, out-of-state industries for 20 years under this legislation and which we, in the Senate, will not send to be scrutinised by the proper committees before we vote on it. I want the Labor Party, if it is going to oppose this, particularly the Tasmanian Labor senators, to get to their feet and explain why they don't want this scrutiny, because they have become part of the problem if that is the way they are going to vote.
Senator Faulkner has just said to one of his colleagues that they are part of the problem if they do not support this bill going to these committees.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is incumbent on a senator not to eavesdrop on other senators' conversations. Senator Brown is quite wrong to have insinuated that I indicated to one of my colleagues that they were part of any problem. He misheard what I was saying and, as a result, has grievously misled the Senate. I would not like that to stand in Hansard  in that form. It is unusual for me to do this, but on this occasion I ask that Senator Brown withdraw that slur and 
 insinuation that I would have suggested such a thing of one of my colleagues. It is absolutely untrue. Although I do not take personal affront, one of my personal colleagues might take personal affront. On that basis, I think it might be better to withdraw.
—There is nothing to withdraw. There was no misuse of parliamentary language. I can hear right across the chamber very accurately.
—You should not be eavesdropping.
—Well, one should not be speaking in such an audible tone that it is interrupting the delivery of a very cogent argument to this chamber.
—Unfortunately, I was not able to pick up the full import of what you said. Therefore, I am not in a position to rule, Senator Brown.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. That is a good ruling. I was saying that the Labor Party owes it to the people of Tasmania, if not to every other state, if they are going to vote against these motions to say why. Why on earth, of all things, should there not be Senate committee scrutiny of this matter? I think one of the most important pieces of legislation this government will deal with next year is the regional forest agreements. They have created an uproar in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania, and they will create an uproar in Queensland when they are announced there.
—You have created an uproar in Tasmania; they have not created an uproar in Tasmania.
—I am getting further interventions from, in this case, Senator Sherry from Tasmania, who is out of his seat, if I am not wrong, who says that there is no uproar in Tasmania. That blinkered, ostrich like attitude to the majority of Tasmanians that the tearing down of our grand and magnificent wild forests is wrong should have been brought to an end.
But even if it is not, I ask this question: why should this legislation not go before 
 these committees? Why should there not be scrutiny? Why should the public not have an opportunity to have input before the Senate deliberates on this legislation? I will tell you what I think. I think it is because of the sway of the woodchip corporations. I am very aware of the fact that, for example, North Broken Hill in the last couple of years has put $80,000 into the election baskets of both of the major parties. That is having an untoward effect on the way in which this whole debate is proceeding. You cannot look at matters like this important move to refer the RFA legislation to committees being blocked by the major parties without standing back and asking why. I believe there is enormous pressure from the logging corporations around this country to prevent such an outcome.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I think that is a clear reflection on the motives of senators. Senator Brown has made that a very clear reflection. The fact is this Senate voted yesterday to refer these very bills to a committee for a period of at least two months. To say that there is some conspiracy and that senators are being manipulated or bribed to stop reference of these matters not only is patently absurd and contrary to the facts but also reflects on the motives of senators and how they vote in this chamber. And I think that any inference in relation to that should be withdrawn immediately and unreservedly.
—On the point of order, I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Ian Campbell. To suggest that people cast their vote on a particular matter on the basis of the allegations that Senator Brown made is certainly alleging an improper motive. It is exactly the same as the sort of scurrilous remark made yesterday when Senator Kemp accused senators of having improper motives when they voted on the superannuation surcharge.
—I have made no inference about any particular senator in this matter. If the parties feel fragile about the assertion I have made, then it is for them to get up and debate the matter. I might add that we need to be mindful in debating this matter, as I am sure all senators were yesterday, of 
 the standing orders requiring anybody who has an interest in the matter to have declared it yesterday and to declare it today. That is a rule of this place.
—Senator Brown, the imputation does not have to be against individual senators, and I ask you to withdraw your allegation of improper motives.
—Sir, I ask you to look at what I said. I said that the corporations—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I do not think the honourable senator can debate your ruling; he can either accept your ruling, and do the proper thing, or he should move a motion of dissent on your ruling. He does not have any other alternatives, as far as I am concerned.
—Senator Brown, you have either got to withdraw or make it quite clear to everybody in the Senate that you are not imputing improper motives, either individually or collectively.
—If you look at the record, you will find that I was imputing the motives to the corporate sector, which wants to levy influence on this place, and not to the senators in this place.
—We have senators from either side of the chamber who both feel that you have imputed improper motives.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order, you gave Senator Brown a choice to either withdraw or explain the statement that he made. From the opposition's perspective, from the explanation that he has given, I can only come to the conclusion that that does not impugn individual senators and—
—That is not the issue.
—With respect, I think, given your ruling, it has become the issue, because you in fact asked Senator Brown to either withdraw or explain himself. From the explanation that I did hear Senator Brown make, I do not think that we can draw any 
 further the inference that individual senators are being impugned.
—Collectively or individually.
—Yes. So, with respect, it seems to me that Senator Brown has complied in his own way with the request you properly made from the chair. I suspect, given that circumstance, the matter is dealt with. But, of course, it remains open for any individual senator to take the issue on in debate if they wish, because there may well be very little support from senators for the case that Senator Brown makes. But in relation to the ruling you have made, I think that has adequately been dealt with, and we ought to just get on with it.
—Senator Brown, continue your remarks.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I must say that the short debate that has just occurred is a very important one, and it is one that I will be coming back to in the future in this place. I was saying that I believe it is very important for the Labor Party—and the same applies to the government—to explain why, if they are going to vote against these motions, we ought not be seeing reference of this extraordinarily important regional forest agreement legislation to these committees so that the public can have the input that I know it wants to have. I think that the Senate is failing that public if it does not allow those committees to go to the places where there is turmoil over the destruction of forests in this country—and that does not just apply to conservationists; that applies to many businesses around this country of ours and many people employed in businesses which depend on forests being kept standing—so that they can have a say.
It is right out of kilter that this legislation will not be subject to far greater scrutiny than what yesterday's motion would on the face of it allow it to have. If these motions go down, I will be one of those who will be trying to bring up constitutional and environmental issues before the committee under yesterday's reference. But it will depend on that committee. As things stand, there could be a total block on such matters being discussed. I do 
 not think it is good enough to leave it to a committee to be good-hearted enough to decide it will accept evidence about the environmental downsides or the potential constitutional problems associated with the regional forest agreement legislation.
There is something untoward if the Senate does not send this legislation to these committees. I cannot say much more than that. Let those who vote against these references explain why they are going to do that, not only in this place but to the Australian public at large, remembering that opinion polls over the last decade have consistently shown that the great majority of Australians do not want the wild forests of this country further destroyed and they do want the plantation base which we have in this country, which is totally adequate for the country's wood needs, to be the total basis upon which woodchipping as well as other logging pursuits take place in the years ahead.
There can be a win-win situation. We can keep our wild forests and at the same time have a healthy industry based on plantations. Many people in here will not know that already 80 per cent of the wood products used in Australia come from plantations. There is the wherewithal to make that 100 per cent. The Tumut mill, announced with federal government support in the last week, is an example of that. I do not know why on earth Premier Carr in New South Wales was not, as part of the announcement there, saying, `We are putting an end to the cutting of wild forests in New South Wales.' It was a historic opportunity to say to the public, `Here we have got the end of wild forest cutting, the end of controversy and a mill based totally on plantations,' which is the way of the future. It was a political failure on a grand scale by the Carr government, which is the sort of political failure happening at the state level right around the country as far as forests are concerned.
That is another good reason why the whole thing should have been opened to much greater public scrutiny. The Senate, ultimately, is not doing itself a good turn if it does not allow that public scrutiny, because I can assure you that this legislation for the regional 
 forest agreements—which is a prescription for wild forest destruction around the country—is going to be a major item for debate when it comes before this chamber some time in the new year.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-12-10,"—I will briefly put the government's point of view on the reference of the provisions of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  to two committees. As I said in a point of order, the coalition rejects the claim that this bill will not get proper scrutiny. We supported a motion yesterday to have this very bill referred to the appropriate legislation committee—the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee—which I understand is chaired very well by Senator Crane, who I think is respected by all sides of the chamber.
I am quite confident that any of the constitutional and environmental matters that Senator Brown has referred to and any submissions made on those matters will be given due consideration; that people making submissions on these matters will be heard by that committee; and that members of the public who want to make submissions or be heard by the committee from now until 15 February, a period in excess of two months, will be heard by this committee—the appropriate committee, an effective committee, a well-chaired committee and a committee on which a number of honourable senators who have given good service to this place sit.
I think it reflects on the committee, the committee secretariat and the members of that committee to suggest that that committee will not be able do its job. It has certainly done its job on a number of contentious, complex pieces of legislation during the term of the last parliament. I have absolute confidence that the members from various parties on that committee will fulfil their duties to the parliament and the people of Australia in giving proper consideration to, as Senator Brown calls it and the government concurs, this very important piece of legislation, which does seek to create a win-win situation for Australia's forests from a conservation point 
 of view, a biodiversity point of view and a resource security point of view.
The committee will receive submissions. It will have public hearings. It will have, in effect, over two months to receive those submissions and deliberate on these matters and make a report to this parliament. It will, hopefully, then be a matter for this Senate to deal with when we return in the second half of February. So the coalition will be rejecting these motions. We believe they were debated at great length yesterday. The government believes that the debate has been had and the votes have been had. We would like to see the matter resolved this morning as quickly as possible.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The opposition does not support the motions of Senator Brown to refer the provisions of the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  to two committees. In fact, we also reject quite strongly the assertions that he has made regarding our position on this issue. We, first of all, support the bill being considered by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. That is the appropriate committee that should consider the legislation, and that is indeed what will happen.
We do, however, want to make the point, as we did yesterday when the matter was debated, that the ultimate reporting date that was determined by the Senate, by the brutal use of numbers by the government, of 15 February does cause us some concern. There may well be two months between now and then, but everyone knows that it is not that easy to organise public hearings and conduct inspections, if necessary, over the December-January period.
We also know that work is being done by many other senators in other committees early next year, particularly those related to the GST. We raised that point yesterday. As I understand it, that was why we put forward the suggestion in the Selection of Bills Committee deliberations that the reporting date would more appropriately be a date in late March—22 March was the date we proposed. I understand that, at the time, the government was prepared to accept 8 March as a suitable 
 reporting date but, as there was no agreement within the committee, it was understood that the issue would be ultimately resolved in this chamber.
We were rather surprised and believe it was pretty dirty pool on the part of the government yesterday to have pushed through, by the use of numbers, the date of 15 February as the  reporting date. But that is an issue with regard to the ultimate reporting date of a reference which is already before the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The committee will do everything it can to meet that timetable but, as we know does happen from time to time, if timetables become impossible to meet then it is open for the Senate to revisit that issue on a subsequent occasion. We will be pushing that view strongly in the committee in the hope that we can get more time for consideration of this legislation.
Putting that aside, on the central issue of Senator Brown's propositions, we reject them. We reject the allegation that we will not be serious about giving this legislation the scrutiny that it deserves and taking into account all the submissions that the committee receives. The bill is already before the appropriate Senate committee and, on that basis, we will be opposing the motions.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Referral to Committees</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—I rise in support of Senator Brown's notices of motion Nos 2 and 3 and I will speak briefly, aware that there is business of the Senate people wish to go on with. Yesterday, one of the reasons I was called out of the chamber during the ARPANSA bill, which I was deeply involved with, was that I was asked to do a brief interview on radio in Western Australia, which ended up being less than brief. It ended up, unbeknownst to me, that I was debating head to head with the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Wilson Tuckey.
The minister said that we were concentrating too much on the environmental aspects of regional forest agreements and that we should be more interested in the economic aspects. I thought that was very interesting from a minister who comes from Western Australia, because the whole process of the regional 
 forest agreements has been given largely to the states. Of course, the mechanisms available within the states are the ones that are part of this intrinsic agreement which is coming together to be dealt with in this bill.
The irony in Western Australia is that Mr Tuckey said that economic consequences should be dealt with as well as environmental consequences. I actually happen to agree. I have always believed that the definition of `environment' should include the impact on the local economy. Having sat in on one unit of environmental law, it seems it was the intention—even if it was not written into the law—that the impacts on the environment, especially the local environment, and the impacts on the local economy should be assessed in the environmental impact assessment.
But what does that mean? It means that you look at the economy as a whole and not just on one narrow sector. Once you start looking at the economy as a whole—how it works, what fits in and what does not—often you find there are quite different circumstances from what you assumed in the first place. Honourable senators will remember that the Resource Assessment Commission was set up to do just that. It was set up, I suppose, to beat environmentalists around the head on the basis of doing assessments to see what the outcomes would be for communities and for the wider public interest.
Ironically they did their job too well. They did their job so well that they produced reports which looked at the balance between the environment and the economy and came out with different results from what was assumed. They asked people what they valued in certain areas like Kakadu. If you were to have a Resource Assessment Commission assessment of the Jabiluka proposal, most of us are quite sure of what people would say when asked what their values would be—what they would be prepared to pay not to have Jabiluka mined for uranium. There would probably be a few people throwing in cash from other parts of the world as well, if you were to do that. But that is not what the Resource Assessment Commission did.
Minister Tuckey says that we have it wrong, but he has not looked at the history of his own state. Unfortunately, we have a situation where there is an agreement between both of the major parties in this chamber that we will deal with this as a rural and regional issue—not deal with it as an environmental issue and not look at the legal issues in context. I will be very pleased if the rural and regional committee is able to look at the legal issues, if they can do it properly. But there is very limited time available, and we cannot be sure that the resources will be made available to that one committee even to be able to hold the hearings that may be necessary for the level of interest there is in this issue right around the country.
I am disappointed to hear what I have heard today. The numbers are quite clear in what is going to happen. But we have evidence that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, is sitting on his hands in relation to action on regional forest agreements already, even before some of them are signed. We can see that even the mechanisms that are available to the Commonwealth now are not being used. We also know that, after this bill is passed, there is no specific action that can or will take place that will guarantee that any agreements must be abided by. So it looks as though we will have a much worse situation than we have experienced up to now, and that is a great disappointment. These issues deserve to be given greater scrutiny.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-12-10,"—These private health insurance bills are of central importance to the way that we run Australian society. Much has been said already about these bills and about the wisdom or otherwise of devoting over $1 million to private health insurance. In talking about these bills and about health services overall, there are certain questions that should be asked, certain prospects that should be discussed and certain perspectives that should be looked at. Those things have been done in debates so far.
This debate is essentially about who should bear the cost of illness and injury in Australia. Once somebody becomes ill or injured, there is a cost. The issue is who will bear the cost. It might be the person who is injured or the person who becomes sick. That person might bear the cost simply by having to suffer for a longer time than otherwise. He or she may 
 have an illness which, if not treated, might be terminal or, at the very least, put people through considerable distress. Society could choose to say that the person who is going to bear the cost of this illness and trauma is the person who suffers it. He or she either bears it by simply going through the pain, distress and torture that illness and trauma can bring or by paying for treatment out of his or her own pocket. That is one alternative that we might take.
The doctors might bear the cost. In other words, you might have a health system where the doctors get less than they really ought. Indeed, that happens now, particularly with junior doctors in hospitals, who are paid at times less than they should be paid and who have to work overtime that is sometimes not paid. That is the other alternative; the doctors might bear the cost that comes about through illness or injury. Nurses might do it by working for longer hours than they should. Physiotherapists or dietitians or what have you also might. That is another choice that we could make. We could let the health providers bear the cost.
The hospitals might do it. The private hospitals in particular and the public hospitals are saying that they cannot afford to give the treatment that is needed to people who are injured or who suffer illnesses. The community might bear the cost through insurance schemes. In other words, you spread the cost across the community by having insurance schemes. The function of the insurance schemes is to gather money from the community generally and spread the loss that comes about through illness and injury. Everybody puts in, irrespective of whether they are ill or injured themselves, so that the community, as it were, bears the cost. The community could also bear the cost through taxation, either generally across the board or through specific imposts such as, for example, the Medicare levy.
They are the choices we face. This legislation must be looked at in that context. It should be looked at not only in the context of who should bear the cost of illness and trauma but also in terms of where the money might come from. That means not only in 
 terms of insurance and taxation but also from other bodies. One thing that seems not to have been looked at in this context is how specialist insurance, if I can call it that, operates in all this. How much, for example, does the Transport Accident Commission in my home state of Victoria contribute to the cost? How much does the Victorian Workcover Authority contribute?
In looking at this legislation and in listening to the debate about it, that sort of question seems not to have been answered. I wonder why not. What contribution do bodies such as the Victorian Workcover Authority and the Transport Accident Commission make to the costs imposed upon people through injury and illness? There are bodies like them in all the states around Australia. What sort of contribution do they make? That question could be asked in the committee stage of this debate.
What does occur to people as they go through this debate is that the whole system seems not to be in control. There are institutions that cover people injured at work. There are institutions that cover people injured on the roads. There is private health insurance and private insurance, in any event. There are public and private hospitals. There are people who are underpaid. There are people who suffer and who cannot get proper treatment.
Those concepts do not seem to be addressed in the bill. What seems to be happening is that we are going to say, `Righto! We will contribute over $1 billion towards helping the private insurance industry.' And no doubt it is argued that, through helping the private insurance industry, a flow-down effect will occur and people will be better looked after. But it seems to me that in this debate that particular approach has been taken without having a wider vision of what it is all about. The explanatory memorandum seems to have ignored the concept of how we can best help health services across the board. It says on page 1, in the `General Outline and Financial Impact' statement:
The Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998 will provide for a financial incentive for people who take out or maintain private health insurance.
It then tells how the incentive works. On page 56 of the explanatory memorandum, the 
 section headed `Assessment of impact (cost and benefits) of the measures' talks about the particular people who will be affected and the particular funds which will be protected.
But there is no concept put forward in the explanatory memorandum of what we should be doing in the whole area of health, which is really about trying to get people better after they have become ill or have suffered trauma. It is a bad approach in a policy sense to confine the issue of how we get people better to one particular area. Say that somebody is injured on the road or at work, or gets sick in any particular circumstance. Where does he or she go to get money? To some sort of accident compensation scheme, if they are injured at work? To a fund that is supposed to look after people who are injured on the road? To a private insurance scheme, if they are injured in the home? Do they go straight to a public hospital? Or do they go to the local doctor? Unless we get a concept of what this is all about, we are in trouble.
There is one other matter I want to raise while we are talking about this, and I hope I have made the point clear. Legislation dealing with issues of health services should have the care of the sick and the maimed as its prime objective. It is not quite clear what weight the legislation before us gives to the sick and the maimed, as distinct from trying to prop up a system of private health insurance. I have read from the explanatory memorandum as an illustration of what I mean by that.
It does seem that the propping up of private health insurance is the prime objective here, rather than the care of the sick and the maimed. The legislation is an answer to a wrong question; namely, how private insurance can be subsidised. The right question should be who should bear the burden of sickness and injury. You can look at society as either a collection of individuals or a community where every member can benefit to the utmost. The legislation here sees society as a collection of individuals who have each got to get what they can out of the system. Unless we start thinking in a communal way, we will not get a solution to the issues that are raised by those who are sick and injured in our community.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The issue before us today is a choice between playing politics or good health policy. Good health policy demands that the government devote adequate resources to the public health system. It also requires that we endeavour to strike the appropriate balance between the public hospital system, Medicare and the private health insurance industry. The government seems hell-bent on diverting substantial sums of taxpayer funds from the public health system, from public hospitals, from the states—who have the responsibility for managing those hospitals—ultimately into subsidising private health insurance funds.
It has been a disturbing trend of coalition conservative governments over many years that, in their ideological objection to Medicare, they have followed this path. It must be remembered that it was a Labor government back in the 1970s that introduced Medicare—then known as Medibank. It was Malcolm Fraser, when he was Prime Minister and John Howard was his Treasurer, who abolished Medibank. Whilst the government stands up and talks about the levels of private health insurance membership today and how they may have fallen, what they do not say is that, when they were in office between 1975 and 1983, they left 30 per cent of the Australian population totally uninsured. There was no universal health coverage system. There was no Medibank, because they abolished it. So many hundreds of thousands and, indeed, millions of Australians had no health cover at all.
It was only when the Hawke government came into power in 1983 and Medicare was introduced that once again we had a universal health coverage system, a system whereby all Australians could have access to decent, quality health care, particularly when they most desperately needed it, when illness or accident suddenly struck. It is in those circumstances that you need a decent, high quality, affordable, accessible public health system. Australia today stands, and has done for many years since the introduction of Medicare, as a world leader in providing the best of public health coverage.
This government, however, in its short 2½ years stripped some $2.6 billion out of funds available for the health system in this country. It took around $800 million out of public hospital funding in its first budget by slashing funds to the states—and the states were forced to find the money to make up that shortfall. It abolished the dental scheme, a scheme worth around $400 million which provided urgent dental care for persons who were unable to afford it. It took an incredible $1.4 billion out of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, making many necessary drugs and treatments far more expensive.
On top of that, they introduced the health incentive scheme, a scheme, they said, designed to encourage people back into private health insurance. They claimed that it would increase the rate that was declining. In reality, private health insurance membership did not increase at all—despite the $1.6 billion or approximately $650 million a year that was earmarked to be provided for that incentive scheme—but fell even further to its now lowest level ever of just over 30 per cent. That scheme was a failure, which was acknowledged by everybody, whether a Labor supporter or a conservative Premier. Indeed, many experts in the health industry recognise that it was a failure.
When the last round of Medicare agreements were being negotiated, what were the states unanimously calling for? Whether they were conservative or Labor governments, they were calling for greater funds to be directed into the public health system because needs were not being met through increasing waiting lists as a result of this federal government's failure to provide adequate funds.
This current proposal would provide a 30 per cent rebate with no means test to persons with private health insurance. So those people who have had to drop out of private health insurance because they were unable to afford the ever increasing premiums or were unable to afford the huge gaps that exist between the level charged by doctors and the amount refunded through private health insurance will suffer even further. This is a scheme which will reward all of those people who can afford 
 to have private health insurance. The high income earners, and many of us in this parliament who are in private health insurance and who have stayed in it, will be rewarded whilst those who cannot afford it will not be in any greater position in terms of being able to access private health insurance. There is no means test and, furthermore, there is no discrimination at all between the types of coverage for which the rebate will be paid.
Coalition ministers such as Senator Herron have talked about how they believe the previous scheme reached a position where health insurance membership had plateaued and was on the increase. That is what we were constantly being told by Senator Herron, representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care in this chamber. Yet, at the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's hearing on 4 December, the evidence of Mr Schneider, representing the Australian Health Insurance Association, was that it was declining and was continuing to decline irrespective of the government's measures.
So one has to ask the logical question: why should throwing more money at this system work? Of course the answer is that it will not. Until we are able to address the fundamental problem of private health insurance in this country—that is, the issue of the gap—these sorts of schemes will simply not work. Whilst it might be very attractive and it might be seen as good politics to pay substantial amounts of money by way of a rebate to the 30-odd per cent of people who have private health insurance, it is certainly not good health policy.
Everyone knows that the major problem with private health insurance is that you pay your $2,000-odd a year for your family cover and you get your doctor of choice but, after you have had elective surgery in a private hospital, you often find that, whilst your hospital costs may have been met, your medical costs have not been met because the surgeon has charged well in excess of the schedule fee. The private health companies pay a refund of only 25 per cent of the schedule fee. Further, they do not cover the gap between the doctors' fees and the schedule fee. It should be remembered that private 
 hospitals have the benefit of the fact that, for all the medical procedures that are undertaken in private hospitals, 75 per cent of the schedule fee—that is, the costs of the surgeon, the anaesthetist or whomever—are met out of Medicare, they are met out of public funds. So we are already providing substantial support to private hospitals.
I just want to finish on two other points. Everyone knows that, whilst we do need, and we on this side support, a strong private hospital system that complements the public hospital system, first and foremost the objective of government is to support the public health system. I hear time and time again of situations where after people have gone into a private hospital for an operation, something serious has developed following that procedure and they have been very quickly transferred, in some cases just across the road, to the public hospital.
It is a fact that many private hospitals do not provide all of the facilities that can be obtained in a public hospital, whether they be crash carts or the sorts of intensive care units that patients in a critical condition may need. Essentially, we are providing huge amounts of money to support private hospitals, profit making enterprises, dealing largely in providing elective surgery at the expense of much needed funds that should be in the public hospital system.
The final point I wish to make is this: I obtained some information about where in New South Wales private hospitals are located. It is very interesting to note that, of the 85 private hospital licensed establishments in New South Wales, 23 are in the northern Sydney area, eight are in the central Sydney area and 15 are in the south-eastern Sydney area. That is, over 50 per cent of private hospitals in New South Wales are located in areas which are in northern, eastern or central Sydney.
It is no wonder that people in rural and regional areas, in western Sydney where they only have five private hospitals, in south-western Sydney, or in the far west where there are none, according to this table, are screaming out, saying that they want decent hospital systems in their regions rather than 
 huge amounts of funds being diverted into private hospitals which ultimately will be accessed more by the higher income earners of this country than by the general public.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I thought I might begin my contribution on the second reading debate on this legislation by quoting from the 1998 platform of the Australian Labor Party, which says this:
Labor remains resolutely committed to universal access to publicly funded health services through Medicare. Labor will work to ensure that health resources are allocated on the basis of need and people are not excluded from necessary services because of their economic circumstances.
Labor is committed to maintaining the effective integrity of Medicare as a system of universal health insurance that will finance the delivery of high quality, medical and public hospital services to all Australians.
These are the principles that the Labor Party will honour and will uphold, as we deal with this legislation; they will guide the approach of the Labor Party on this matter that is currently being dealt with by the Senate. Our Labor Party platform, in regard to the private sector, also says this:
Labor recognises the role of the private health sector and remains committed to a balanced health system making best use of both public and private sectors.
The private sector must operate under appropriate government regulation. In particular, Labor remains committed to a private health insurance system which does not discriminate on the basis of age, sex or health.
The critical point of this is balance: we want a balanced health system that makes the best use of both the private and the public health sectors. This legislation before the parliament now is unfair: it does not provide balance, and it certainly, I have to say, is not good policy.
We think that the best way to boost hospital funding and reduce hospital waiting times for surgery is to directly fund public hospitals. The public hospital system is our priority because that is where the greatest need exists. We believe that spending money directly on treating patients is the most effective way of 
 reducing waiting lists. We encourage people, of course, who wish to take out private health insurance. But we know that for many people in Australia, people on low incomes particularly, the public health system is the only option they have.
The hundreds of millions of dollars that are being thrown at this rebate in this legislation would go a very long way to improving the public hospital system—and that would be of benefit to all Australians. The rebate being proposed by the government is inherently unfair. It does not provide balance, nor will it achieve its desired objective of increasing the take-up of private health insurance, and therefore reduce pressure on the public health system—and that is very strongly backed up by the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, which I thought put forward some strong and persuasive arguments against the legislation at the Senate committee hearing last Friday. Just look at what it actually said to the Senate committee. It summarised its position as follows:
First, that it will not fix the problem it seeks to fix, it will probably make the problem worse and it is highly unlikely to do anything to improve the quality of health care available to the Australian people;
second, that the huge proposed transfer payment would be more efficiently and equitably used in other ways;
third, that the problem that has led the government to this point should now be the stimulus for real reform of private health insurance, making it supplementary to, not a competitor with, the publicly funded health care system.
There is no evidence that the private health insurance rebate will take the pressure off public hospitals. If you take the example of the government's existing means tested rebate—which, of course, the proposal before us is supposed to replace—you find that it has not increased the number of people taking up private health insurance. The new rebate will benefit primarily people who have existing private health insurance.
The government's estimate for increasing the number of people with private health insurance is a mere 2.7 per cent. That is the government's figure—a mere 2.7 per cent increase; up from 30.3 per cent to 33 per cent. 
 That is a 2.7 per cent increase at the cost of $1½ billion. That is what the government is proposing, and we say that it is simply not good enough. Minister Wooldridge, I noticed, boasted an increase to 40 per cent in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives. A private hospital survey has claimed that the rebate would result in a boost to coverage to 45 per cent. Again, you have to ask this question: where is the evidence to back up those sorts of claims?
I mentioned the evidence of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health given to the Senate committee. I think they presented a very worthwhile and impressive submission to the Senate inquiry. On the question before us, they said:
. . . this is a clumsy and predictably ineffective way to achieve what the government wants to achieve. This approach would lock the government into an inflexible $7 billion spending program which would not produce the desired offsets in the public sector . . . this subsidy is likely to exacerbate the problem for the private funds of adverse selection and differential risk dropouts, without addressing the underlying problem.
We say that the government is throwing good money after bad. It is sticking a whopping $1.5 billion into the private health system—money, of course, that is desperately needed in the public health system in public hospitals; money that could really make a difference in the public health system. It is directing this enormous amount of money exclusively to private health insurance owners, and we say that is patently and transparently unfair. It will benefit most those who need it least. It will benefit most high income households, most of whom already have private health insurance. How obviously unfair.
In May of this year the Australian Bureau of Statistics produced a private health insurance survey which demonstrated a direct correlation between income and private health insurance. It showed that of those earning less than $20,000, 22 per cent have private health insurance; of those earning between $50,000 and $60,000, 60 per cent have private health insurance; and, of those earning over $70,000, 72 per cent have private health insurance. Most low income families in Australia cannot 
 afford private health insurance. They simply cannot afford it, and that is the case with—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Exactly, Senator West and Senator Denman. They cannot afford it with or without a rebate. That is the truth of this issue. That is why we say the priority here must rest with the public health system—and that is Labor's priority—because it is the system that most Australians rely on. That is the fundamental principle that guides the Labor Party in its approach on this legislation.
But I do not want to suggest for one minute that the unfairness stops there. Pressure on public hospitals will not be relieved by extending the rebate to all ancillary services. There is no justification at all for doing that. Take the example of what I think is the great injustice on dental health. While abolishing the Commonwealth dental health scheme, which was, as I recall, worth $100 million—a scheme that provided dental health care and treatment to pensioners and low income people—those with private insurance are going to get a 30 per cent rebate on their dental premiums. That is the government's approach. Nearly $200 million of the rebate will go to subsidising private dental treatment. On the other hand, the low income people in our community wait at least a couple of years for treatment.
We now have, as I say, this open-and-shut case of the unfairness of the legislation that is now before the parliament, but we also have the spectacle of the government trying to turn debate on this legislation into just another typically tawdry Liberal Party political stunt. As far as the government is concerned: forget about the health system and the health issues—the debate really is not about that. There is an election on the horizon in the state of New South Wales. That is an election, of course, that the coalition obviously desperately wants to win. So the debate no longer is about the policy issues, and I am sure that in particular my colleague from New South Wales, Senator West, has noted this. The debate is not about the policy but it is about the politics—the politics of the New South Wales election in March of next year.
I just want to mention this as I conclude my remarks on this bill. John Howard is now less focused on the January 1999 start-up date for this rebate than he is focused upon realising political advantage in forcing the Senate to reject an unaltered or unamended and unnegotiated piece of legislation which the vast majority of commentators and experts agree is bad policy. Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, is perfectly happy to risk his January 1999 start-up—risk it all—for a bit of politics to play in the New South Wales election in March of next year. Of course, he has his pollsters like the discredited Mark Textor. They have, apparently, predicted significant political advantage to the New South Wales Liberal Party in forcing the Senate into some game of brinkmanship on this legislation. We are told that it would suit the New South Wales Liberal Party if the Senate does not pass the legislation in time for a January 1999 start-up so they can reintroduce this legislation in three months time.
—Anything to take the focus away from their leadership problems.
—That's true, Senator West. But also, of course, three months time is right on the eve of the New South Wales election. I am glad you raised the issue, Senator West, of the Liberal Party leadership in New South Wales because you have a situation, which has been demonstrated so clearly during the debate on this legislation, where the Prime Minister is far more interested in matters relating to the internal dynamics of the New South Wales Liberal Party than he is in what ought to be his responsibility—the health of Australian families. What he is on about is the health of his stumbling protege in New South Wales, Ms Kerry Chikarovski, and Mr Howard's and Ms Chikarovski's cronies in the New South Wales Liberal Party.
I draw the Senate's attention to last week's article in the Bulletin by Mr Laurie Oakes, who reported that before John Howard committed his government to the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance premiums he had the concept market tested. The results, as reported in the Bulletin, were unequivocal 
 in regard to its popularity. According to—and I use this term advisedly—the `researcher', the only proposal he had ever found to be more popular was the reintroduction of the death penalty.
This policy, this legislation, that we are debating has been poll driven from its conception. I put all my money on who did the research. You can bet your life it was Mark Textor, that grubby, unprincipled push pollster for the Liberal Party. No doubt as has been reported, his most recent polling is inextricably linked to both Ms Chikarovski's leadership coup and the politics of the 30 per cent tax bribe for upper income earners. I assume polling was uppermost in Dr Wooldridge's mind when he threatened on the weekend to bring the legislation back to the Senate for a vote a week before the New South Wales election if it did not pass unamended this week.
I will be very interested in the Liberals' approach during the committee stage of this debate. I will be very interested to see whether Dr Wooldridge will be delivering on that threat that he made on the weekend or whether it was just a bit of breastbeating and empty rhetoric, as we have come to expect from people like Dr Wooldridge, or whether the Liberals will contemplate no amendment at all to this legislation—whether they happen to consider that that's in their political interest. Don't think for one minute that threats and brinkmanship are going to work with us. They are not. They are not going to work with the Labor Party; they never have. We are going to stand by our principles.
—Our policy.
—What we are going to do is stand by our policy and stand by the public health system in this country. We are not ashamed of that. We are opposing this legislation in the name of fairness and balance. That is what drives the Labor Party's approach on this. We are opposing it because we want to ensure the health of our public hospital system, we want to ensure the health of all Australians and we want to ensure that low income people in our community are not disadvantaged. I commend the approach of the opposition. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I would like to state very clearly at the outset that I do have a small amount of private health insurance—about the lowest you can buy. I have some insurance that enables me to receive doctor of choice treatment in a public hospital, but I am beginning to wonder about the value and benefit of private health insurance, like so many other people in this country. Let me give an example of why I feel this way. I had my gall bladder removed during the break recently. The doctor's bill was pretty much on par with what I got back from Medicare and Medibank Private, but the anaesthetist's bill took the cake. For two hours of being trundled into the theatre on a trolley and being trundled out of the complex to the ward on a trolley, I scored a bill from the anaesthetist for $500. I had to write a cheque for $223.75, which was the gap.
The gap is not a problem for people on my income, which is around $100,000 a year. The Prime Minister, in answering questions on why this proposal is so wonderful, talked 
 about how people are scrimping and saving to be able to purchase health insurance. They need to do a hell of a lot more scrimping and saving if they are going to cover this gap. This proposal is bad policy. It does nothing to address many of the fundamental problems and issues that need to be addressed in the provision of health care. There is nothing in this proposal that will rein in the activity of some doctors. I say `some doctors' because I can give you an example of my surgeon's bill which was quite close to the mark. Probably the only reason it is not closer to the mark is that I am having a disagreement with the HIC over a small amount of money, in the region of $9 to $10.
A former neighbour of mine several years ago who had maximum private health insurance and maximum ancillaries—the whole box and dice—had cataracts removed. She wrote cheques for $3,000. She had to have both eyes done, so all in all she ended up writing cheques for $6,000. We are not talking figures that are within the ballpark of being able to be afforded by the average, ordinary person. We are talking figures that can be afforded only by the 70-odd per cent of people earning more than $70,000-odd a year who have private health insurance.
This is legislation aimed at greed and not need. This is not good policy. Senator Faulkner has pointed out a number of things that have driven this. I want to look at how this will impact upon rural areas. We know from the submissions to the inquiry last week that the Western Australian government raised a concern that there are only two private hospitals outside the metropolitan area in Western Australia. What incentives are there? Why do people in Western Australia outside of Perth require private health insurance? Their only opportunity for health treatment is in the public system.
If you have an accident or you have a major illness, where are you going to end up? You are going to end up going through casualty or emergency into the public health system. For anybody who disagrees with that, let me remind them, as I have done on many occasions, that my background is nursing. I am a member of the two colleges of nursing 
 in this country. I do not speak in this case on their behalf, but I do speak as somebody who has a background in nursing. I am older than most of the advisers in the box. I can tell them that this has been the case for the last 30-odd years that I know of.
I can remember working in a public hospital, in a teaching hospital in Sydney, 25 years ago and having somebody who was earning a six-figure sum a year admitted to our ward because he had thrown off a pulmonary embolus from a deep venus thrombosis. He was admitted to a teaching hospital in the middle of the public ward. It was the Royal Prince Alfred that he was admitted to. He eventually moved to the private section in Gloucester House. But for time immemorial that sort of level of acuity has always ended up, and should continue to end up, in our public hospital system because for the most part that is where the best treatment is available.
I find this piece of legislation obscene. It find it obscene that somebody like me on an income of $100,000 a year is offered a 30 per cent rebate to encourage me to take out private health insurance which I already have. I find it obscene that included in that 30 per cent rebate are ancillaries such as dental. If this legislation is passed, I think it is an obscenity that $200 to $300 million will be spent to give people who have some form of income, and who are on the whole wealthier, access to dental care through ancillaries and to not give that money to lower income people through the state system. It is an injustice.
We will very shortly, if this legislation is passed, not need to ask a person anything about their income, their occupation or their status. We will be able to line them up behind those boards you see at fairgrounds with a hole for the face and ask them to smile. Because it will be quite apparent who has and who has not got money. If you do not have money, you will have holes in your teeth. If you do have money and you have private health insurance, you will have a perfect smile. That to me is an obscenity.
I also want to talk about some of the other issues that this legislation does not address. 
 The issues of waiting lists are not addressed. Occupancy in the private health system is very high, as well as in the public health system. This does not address the shortages of doctors in various places and the shortages of specialists. This does not address the fact that a number of colleges that allow access for specialist training have, I would allege, almost monopolistic and cartel-type activities in keeping their numbers restricted. This government is all for competition, but it is not looking at the behaviour of some of those colleges and their restriction of competition. Maybe Professor Fels should look at them and not some of the other areas. It does nothing to address those issues.
This legislation does nothing to address the shortages of occupational therapists, speech therapists, dietitians, physiotherapists and social workers in rural areas of Australia. It does nothing to address the problems and the shortages of mental health services in rural Australia. This will not help bring one more of these professional people to the bush and maybe even to the outer areas of some of the capital cities, particularly Sydney. This legislation does nothing to address these fundamental problems that we have to address in health.
This is legislation which, as I said, is an obscene and unjust piece of legislation which gives those of us on my income a bit more money and does not give a service that I consider to be an absolute basic service essential to life and human dignity. It does not give that. This is the most unchristian piece of legislation I think I have seen come into this place in some considerable time. This is about giving to the haves and not sharing with the have-nots, and I find it an obscenity. I find it an obscenity that people can get a rebate to buy a pair of Reeboks or running shoes. That sort of business will not help the public health levels in this country and will not do anything to reduce people's usage of the public health system.
The money could far better spent in many, many other ways. This, as I said before, is bad policy. It is bad legislation. It has been put forward by a government which is being poll driven and thinking only of political 
 advantage and not the advantage, the benefit and the wellbeing of this country. For that, the government should be roundly condemned.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I rise to speak in this debate briefly today, firstly, to indicate that my family has private health insurance. I suspect that, as a result of that, I am not paying the additional one per cent Medicare levy as one who falls in the higher income levels that attract the levy. I will be opposing this inequitable legislation which proposes to grant me a significant tax concession whilst I am exempt from paying this additional Medicare levy. This legislation will give a person on the income level of a senator, member of parliament or the many higher income earners in the community a significant advantage over the bulk of the constituents of my state of Tasmania, more than 80 per cent of whom have a family income of less than $50,000. I believe that the recent census information distributed by the Parliamentary Library this year points that out very clearly from my examination of the figures.
This legislation will give someone like me a significant financial advantage. I do not propose to canvass figures because I think they have been most eloquently dealt with by my colleagues earlier in the debate. It will give a very small benefit, if any benefit at all, to the bulk of the constituents of my state, and certainly I am talking about those who hold private health insurance. The many thousands of families who do not hold family health insurance, who cannot afford family health insurance or who believe that family health insurance is not attractive because, even if you have the insurance, you still get significant bills—and we have just heard about that from Senator West—are all going to be significantly disadvantaged by this legislation.
I also oppose this bill because ultimately it threatens the future of the public hospital system in my state. It means that those hospitals will not be receiving the funding in the future that they need to provide the services that everyone—all Tasmanians, whether insured or not—may ultimately rely upon, 
 particularly in relation to critical care issues or complex medical procedure issues which are not provided by the private health system.
After talking to constituents during the last election campaign who are holders of private health insurance, particularly independent retirees who saw some benefit in this government policy, I was heartened that, when they were confronted by the approach of the Labor Party—that is, we support seeing the public health system funded so that the kind of care that particularly elderly Tasmanians may need in terms of deterioration of health issues and medical procedure issues is provided in preference to rewarding only those who have private health insurance—I received an indication that the representatives of the independent retirees found that to be quite a valid concern and one which they thought very worthy of consideration.
I am curious about a comment I received from a coalition senator about this legislation. It is an aspect that I had not considered until the point was made to me. The point was that, because members, senators and other higher income earners are paying a higher Medicare levy by virtue of the levy being a percentage of income, the private health insurance rebate was in fact a way of getting back part of that higher Medicare levy that the higher income earners are paying when compared, for example, with the combined effect of paying the Medicare levy and private health insurance between people on lower and higher incomes.
I found that comment curious at first. Ultimately, I guess it fits in with the Labor Party's view of where the coalition is coming from in relation to this legislation: this is yet another way of undermining the Medicare system. The Medicare system, whatever the government has been saying about it, exists to provide universal medical services for the community, whether insured or not. Labor has always supported a parallel system. If the ultimate effect of this legislation is to undermine the funding of the public health system to bolster the funding of the private health system, then I do not think constituents of my state will see that as anything other than an anathema to their interests.
At the end of the day, people in Tasmania, if they have major problems, rely on the public hospital system. I am sure that is not just the case in Tasmania but all over Australia. People rely upon the public health system, particularly for critical care, as I said earlier. If the funding of the public health system is sacrificed in the interest of funding private health insurance, which will ultimately, I suspect, bolster the private health system to the detriment of the public health system, then that is against the interests of all of my constituents.
To the extent that there have been newspaper advertisements and lobbying in my state, I say to the people who placed those advertisements that they should look not at the issue of self-interest but at the interests of the health system for the whole of the population of Tasmania when this matter is considered. I remind my constituents and the Senate that the Labor Party is doing just that in saying that we oppose this legislation as inequitable and a threat to the public health system Australia wide.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The Senate is discussing the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998  and associated bills. It is a sad moment for the Senate to be discussing such poorly targeted legislation—legislation which was conceived during an election campaign when the government was in some difficulty in making election promises, legislation which the government now seeks to gain some political advantage from in the forthcoming election in New South Wales. This bill is not about health care. This bill is blatant politicking on behalf of a government that does not care.
This bill will do nothing to resolve the problem that was headlined in the Perth Sunday Times on 29 November this year, just a couple of weeks ago: `97 die awaiting surgery'. Ninety-seven people died awaiting surgery. The $1.7 billion that the government will hand out to people who do not need it, like me on the salary that I have, would be better served going to alleviate the difficulties of Western Australians and their relatives who cannot get hospital treatment. But, no. Mr 
 Howard and Mr Wooldridge are seeking to put money in my pocket. I am on $100,000 a year. I have private health insurance. I do not need an incentive in the form of a tax rebate to remain in health insurance. I have the money to afford it.
Why are you doing this? Mr Howard, why are you spending $900 million in giving tax rebates to people earning more than $70,000 a year? This is absolutely stupid legislation, particularly so when you get headlines such as: `97 die awaiting surgery'. It is even worse when you get a headline such as the one that appeared on the front page of the Australian newspaper on Friday, 27 November 1998: `Health funds reap $300m fee bonanza'. We are going to put more publicly funded money in their direction. What has gone wrong?
There is obviously a major difficulty in the Prime Minister's office, the cabinet office and in the government party room if they continue to proceed with this bill and not either send it back for a rethink or accept some amendments on the floor at the committee stage. I understand that your party, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, is not going to negotiate on that. This is absolutely criminal activity on behalf of the government—propping up health funds which actually need a great deal of scrutiny as to how they operate.
Who said they need scrutiny? The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman's annual report, tabled very recently in this place, said they need scrutiny. Complaints against the private health insurers are up by 60 per cent on the previous year. One can understand that when you see the full-page advertisements that appear in the media. I quote from the West Australian newspaper of Saturday, 28 November:
An open letter to Members of Federal Parliament
This is from one Michael Gurry, Managing Director of HBF, Hospital Benefits Fund of Western Australia. Mr Gurry addresses me and my colleagues saying:
Members of Federal Parliament
I write on behalf of the 1,056,310 electors and their families in Western Australia who have private health insurance to ask why some of you refuse to allow them a 30% refund . . . 

Who gave Mr Gurry the authority to put that letter in on behalf of me and my family as members of a private health fund? Neither he, his organisation nor the individual fund which I am a member of consulted me about putting a letter like that in. Mr Gurry went further, though, he wrote direct letters to members of parliament. He sent a letter by way of fax to me—and, I guess, to my other parliamentary colleagues—on 26 November 1998. He said:
Dear Senator McKiernan
I am writing on behalf of the 830,000 members of the Hospital Benefit Fund of Western Australia to express their concern at the attacks the Labor Party is making on private health insurance.
I read the Hansard  from the other place, and I did not see any attacks on private health insurance. Perhaps the reason my comments are toned the way they are is because I am replying directly to Mr Gurry about what he did in putting forward that letter to me. I wrote back to him on the same day asking him to confirm the membership. I quote from my letter:
Your fax says 830,000 members, but the annual report of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council suggests you have a total membership (hospital and ancillary) of 392,489 at June 1998.
I asked him which was the true figure. A week later, Mr Gurry responded by saying:
I confirm HBF does have 830,000 individual members. HBF classifies all individuals covered by HBF as members.
The babies, the infirm—everybody is supposed to be a member according to him. The letter goes on:
The figures referred to in the PHIAC report for June 1998 are for Health Insurance policies not coverage.
For your information HBF has 788,000 Health members and 42,000 General Insurance members.
Mr Gurry is putting forward absolute lies, without the authority of his members, to me as a member of parliament. He asked for a copy of this speech, and I will ensure that he gets it. I hope that in the fullness of time the Department of Health and Aged Care or the Private Health Ombudsman will do something to bring some respectability into the way in which some of the health insurance funds operate. There are many that would appear to 
 be lining their own pockets at the expense of those insured.
Earlier this year, I, like many others in the community, following the last round of increases, gave very real consideration to whether or not I would remain as a member of my fund. As I said in my earlier comments, I can afford to be in it. On the salary that I earn, I can afford to retain coverage. The reason I considered dropping out was the ever increasing cost of the insurance. This particular bill that is before us now—giving away something like $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money—does nothing to address those ever increasing premiums that I and other members of health funds have to pay.
The bill does nothing—as previous speakers have said—to address the biggest problem associated with private health insurance, and that is the gap. It does absolutely nothing to address the gap difficulties. Senator West, giving the most recent of the excellent contributions from this side of the chamber, outlined some of the finer details on that and, rather than use the time of the chamber now, I refer people to Senator West's and Senator Faulkner's excellent recent contributions on this. There were other contributions as well.
Senator Forshaw interjecting—
—And Senator Forshaw also made some comments, as I recall. The gap is the major problem associated with the health insurance industry in Australia today, yet we have the government coming into this place presenting legislation which does nothing to address it.
The final thing I want to talk about in the limited time that I have imposed on myself—and that we, on this side of the chamber, have imposed in order to progress the legislation—is the letters that I have received from my constituents in Western Australia. I am quite pleased to receive letters such as those. I am very disappointed to receive letters from doctors, specialists and professors which are rote letters, probably drafted in a public relations office in the Hospital Benefit Fund. I expect a little bit better from professional people than that. The Hospital Benefit Fund have been the main leaders of the campaign 
 in Western Australia, and that is a bit disappointing. All of the individuals who have written to me have got a response. Some of them have asked for copies of my speech and, indeed, those who have asked will get a copy of it. I am very disappointed, as I said, that learned and highly educated people should just take form letters and send them on. The campaign just has not had an effect. They have wasted their time and their energy in sending these letters through.
It is a crying disgrace that the funds have used the elderly in our society. I have got great sympathy for those who are on pensions who do continue to hold health insurance, who do—as they said in their letters—go without meals in order to keep up their payments because it is something they have always done. The funds have got to be condemned for using people in the way they have used those in Western Australia.
I would hope, whether this bill passes or does not pass, or whether it passes in an amended form, that the funds themselves sit back and have a look at their own conduct in this whole thing. The way they have managed themselves in order to line their own pockets, in order to get an increase in membership for private hospital cover of a mere 2.7 per cent—from 30.3 per cent to 33 per cent coverage—is not to their credit. It is appalling what they have done. One would hope that they will learn something from this whole escapade. Perhaps next year, when the parliament has more time to look at them in detail, there might not be the damning reports from the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman that we have seen this year.
Debate (on motion by Senator Tambling) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—I would normally ask leave to move the Greens (WA) amendments Nos 1 and 2 together, but we have seen opposition amendment No. 1 incorporate part of the Greens (WA) amendments. So I will be basically asking for the chamber to consider agreeing to Greens (WA) amendment No. 1. This is different in that it actually asks that nothing in the act is to be taken to authorise the construction or operation of a nuclear fuel fabrication plant, a nuclear power plant, an enrichment plant, a reprocessing facility or a nuclear waste storage or disposal facility.
Considering the government has made statements on a number of these issues, especially in recent times on waste storage, disposal and so on, then I am sure it would have no problem at all in agreeing to this and indicating quite clearly without any doubt that this is not what this legislation is meant to, or can, be used for in the future. Therefore, I commend this amendment to the chamber. It makes it clear and unequivocal that this legislation cannot be used simply to allow a CEO to rubber-stamp an authority or a licence for any of those mentioned facilities.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we are prepared to support Greens (WA) amendment No. 1. These fac 
 ilities, such as nuclear power plants, do not exist in Australia at the moment. We understand that there is no either medium-term or long-term intention on the part of the government to proceed to construct such facilities. On many occasions the government has made it clear that, whilst it is determined to build a replacement research reactor located at Lucas Heights, it has stressed that it was not prepared or had no intention of building a waste reprocessing plant at the same site. On that basis alone, one would think that the government should be prepared to support this amendment. As I said earlier, we are happy to support it.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—The Greens propose the addition of clause 9A which explicitly states that nothing in the act authorises the construction or operation of any nuclear power plants, reprocessing plants and so on. The ALP amendment addresses the substantive concerns of the Greens by removing nuclear plants and reprocessing facilities from the definition of `nuclear installation'. Therefore, the further statements proposed by the Greens are unnecessary.
However, I indicate to Senator Margetts that, if she were prepared to remove proposed paragraph (e)—which reads, `a nuclear waste storage or disposal facility with an activity that is greater than the activity level prescribed by regulations for the purposes of section 12'—we could accept the balance of the amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—I do not know whether the rest of the chamber supports the whole thing. I could offer to move (1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) separately and then move (1)(e). It is an extraordinarily interesting statement. I was abused on the radio yesterday by Mr Wilson Tuckey about whether there ever would be a major nuclear waste international storage facility via this legislation. He made quite outrageous comments against me, actually. This could be cleared away altogether by saying that this legislation was not used for that. I am prepared to move an amendment regarding 9A(1)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (2) and 
 then move one regarding 9A(1)(e) and see what the chamber says. I therefore move:
(1)	 Page 4 (after line 21), after clause 9, insert:
9A  Prohibition on certain nuclear installations
	 (1)	 Nothing in this Act is to be taken to authorise the construction or operation of any of the following nuclear installations:
		 (a)	 a nuclear fuel fabrication plant;
		 (b)	 a nuclear power plant;
		 (c)	 an enrichment plant;
		 (d)	 a reprocessing facility;
		 (e)	 a nuclear waste storage or disposal facility with an activity that is greater than the activity level prescribed by regulations for the purposes of section 12.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-10,"—On the matter of the opposition amendment, I was wondering whether I could ask the same question that I asked yesterday towards the end of the debate before it was adjourned. I asked the government whether it understood the definition proposed by the opposition to include nuclear reprocessing and power generation. I thank the  parliamentary secretary for answering that question. I was wondering whether Senator Forshaw would give us his understanding of the definitions that are covered in the amendment.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The intention of what we put forward was to ensure that any such facility is one that is contemplated at the moment, such as the intermediate or low level waste 
 storage facility called for in the Senate select committee report. Indeed, we are certainly prepared to support Senator Margetts's amendment. We believe it ensures that the act will not authorise the construction of any larger facility, having in mind, for instance, one which could deal with imported waste and reprocessing to the enrichment stage. That is really what there has been some public discussion about in recent days.
The ultimate situation is that, whilst the definition of `nuclear installation' includes a nuclear waste storage or disposal facility, the regulations will limit the operation of any such facility. Clearly, if clause 9A(1)(e) is carried, the act would not authorise the construction of such a facility beyond what is set in the regulations. I hope that is clear. That is why we do not see any contradiction between carrying proposed clause 9A and the amendment that we have just carried.
—The question before the chair is that the Greens amendment which concerns clause 9A subclauses (1)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (2) be agreed to.
Amendment agreed to.
—The question now is that the Greens amendment which concerns clause 9A subclause (1)(e) be agreed to.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—The Greens (WA) oppose clause 7—`Act not to prejudice Australia's defence'—and clause 8—`Act not to prejudice national security'. As always with clauses such as these which appear in legislation from time to time, the problem from our perspective is the lack of definition and the consequent broad powers which are then given to the Chief of the Defence Force and the Director-General of Security.
The additional problem is one of perception, particularly international perception. As everyone knows, in foreign affairs, perception counts for a great deal. When those perceptions are intertwined with the often shadowy world of nuclear weapons, then there is cause for concern. As I stated in my speech in the second reading debate, many defence and security analysts acknowledge that the best method for developing nuclear weapons capability is through civilian nuclear technology. This is a great flaw. The great lie that underlies the international nuclear non-prolif 
 eration framework is the belief that you can prevent nuclear weapons proliferation if non-weapon states are provided with assistance to develop so-called peaceful nuclear technology.
This is especially so in the current world situation with proliferation, re-proliferation and disarmament, and Australia's standing in that debate. I believe we have got to be seen to be not just with the rest of the world but a good example to the rest of the world—and a leading example. I guess Australia could do that by taking a very positive role in the middle powers initiative. But, unfortunately, we are not.
In this particular instance we are using the powers that are available under the ASIO Act. I believe—perhaps the government can tell me if I am wrong—that it potentially enables ASIO operatives to be exposed to levels of radiation to which they normally would not be, perhaps for spying or whatever. Can the government clarify whether that is the case or whether we potentially have a situation where there is a great deal more power under this act to the Chief of the Defence Force and the Director-General of Security? Can the government tell us what assurances there are that that will not or cannot be misused beyond anything which the public would believe is normally given under this legislation?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—Clauses 7 and 8 of the bill relate to exemptions on the grounds of national security and defence. The Greens seek to remove these 
 provisions. However, the provisions must remain in the legislation. Removing them would jeopardise the national security and defence of the country. The provisions are standard clauses included in all such Commonwealth  legislation—for example, the occupational health and safety legislation. With respect to the issue raised by Senator Margetts, I refer her to clause 8(2) of the bill, which reads:
Without limiting subsection (1), the Director-General of Security may, after consulting with the Minister, declare by notice in writing that specified provisions of this Act or the regulations do not apply, or apply subject to such modifications as are set out in the declaration, in relation to:
	 (a) premises or a workplace under the control of the Director-General; or
	 (b) a person who is employed under section 84 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979 ; or
	 (c) the performance of work by such a person for the purpose of carrying out a function set out in section 17 of that Act.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-10,"—I draw the committee's attention, again, to the Director of Safeguards  report through Foreign Affairs and Trade. I asked the government yesterday if it could explain the activities of the company Silex Systems, which is developing laser enrichment technology at Lucas Heights. The committee may like to know that on page 23 of the report, under the heading `Laser enrichment research and development', it states:
An Australian company, Silex Systems Pty Ltd, is researching a novel method of separating uranium isotopes, using laser techniques. The company has entered into an agreement with the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) to explore the commercial potential of this technology. In the first phase USEC specialists are undertaking a technical assessment in Australia. If this is successful, the technology would be developed further in the US—this aspect is discussed further under Task C.1.
We look at that and then at page 31 of the report where, under the heading `Laser enrichment technology', it makes the comment:
Reference was made under Task A.1 above—
which I have just quoted—
to the laser enrichment R&D being undertaken by Silex Systems Pty Ltd. If this technology is classified as ""associated technology"", then any transfer to the US for further development will require an amendment to the existing Australia/US nuclear cooperation agreement, or a new agreement. ASO officers have been participating in discussions with US officials to develop appropriate arrangements.
This relates to what Senator Margetts refers to as the potential of civilian technology to be applied to the manufacture of weapons. I ask the government to explain what is going on at Lucas Heights.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I rise to speak briefly on the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Bill 1998 . As my colleague Senator Cook outlined in his speech in the second reading debate, this bill has unanimous support from all sides of the chamber. It is a real problem in the world which many people probably do not focus on enough. The problem was outlined in a speech by my colleague Mr Brereton last year, and Senator Cook referred to some of the statistics from the International Red Cross outlined by Mr Brereton in that speech, and it is worth traversing those again.
There are an estimated 119 million active landmines in 70 countries. It therefore becomes an issue of mammoth proportions indeed. The report also said that some 15 countries are, in effect, crippled as a result of 
 the placing of landmines. It is interesting to note some of the places that are listed as being crippled: Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia, Cambodia, Mozambique and Somalia. This is not because of external forces fighting each other but because of internal war, civil war, in many instances. One finds that, once the civil war has been resolved, the mines that were laid are invariably left lying around the place. The effect of that is that they injure, maim and kill innocent people long after the hostility, the internal insurrection, has ceased.
The International Red Cross report, as my colleague Senator Cook indicated, states that landmines kill or maim some 2,000 people every month. The figures broken down are 800 killed and 1,200 maimed every month. That, again, is something of mammoth proportions and is completely and totally unnecessary. The International Red Cross report went on to say—and this was as of last year—that, if mine clearing were to proceed and no more mines were to be laid, it would take 1,100 years to clear the entire world of mines laid during civil or other wars that have occurred. That really puts into perspective the problem that is confronting many people in many nations. It is not a small problem; it is a problem of great magnitude.
Antipersonnel landmines are an indiscriminate killer, as I said earlier. Long after peace has been brokered within many of the countries where civil war has occurred, the people who laid the mines have invariably gone onto other pursuits. Of course the minefields were laid without any markings and in peacetime they become an indiscriminate killer, particularly of the young and the old and of women and children. That, in itself, should be completely avoided at all costs. People who had no direct input into the violence, people who invariably had no part to play in the warring that took place, are being injured long after the settlement of the melee. In many instances, as the statistics have shown, death occurs quite wantonly for these people.
The fact that there are so many landmines out there causes real poverty in some of these nations—nations which really cannot afford to be subjected to additional poverty, because poverty is one of the factors those nations 
 inherit as a result of the protracted and prolonged wars having taken place in them. The existence of vast minefields stops appropriate resettlement within these nations, stops many of their people from being able to return to agriculture to till the land because mines are in the arable land. And all that does is impose further poverty. It also acts as an obstacle to the transportation of people and goods within some of these countries, and it has an effect on the provision of basic services. All in all, one sees in many cases not a very pretty picture being painted as a result of the laying and indiscriminate use of landmines in conflicts that have long been resolved—and, of course, they have wreaked havoc on very innocent populations in postwar periods.
I found it of interest to read a publication dated May 1997 called Living in a minefield—a report on the mine problem in Afghanistan, which was put out by—pardon my French—Medecins Sans Frontieres.
—Good; eight out of 10.
—It was quite good? I got an eight out of 10 for French there, and I thank the honourable senator for that mark. But that was not the point. The point was not to prove my French but to look at just a couple of excerpts from this publication. I believe that we really have no experience nor real understanding of the problems caused by landmines and, therefore, it becomes a bit of an academic exercise for us. But I find it interesting that outlined on page 12 of the publication are the problems caused by landmines. It states:
There are three common patterns of anti-personnel mine injury: one is amputation of the foot or leg from standing on the blast mine; the second is multiple fragment injuries from triggering a fragmentation mine where the legs are injured and often so too are the head, neck, chest and abdomen; and, three, hand, arm, face and eye injuries from handling a mine.
What we see are injuries that are not at all pretty, injuries that take a lot of treatment and injuries that, in many cases, absolutely ruin the dignity of the individual living in these communities. This brings with it problems in terms of treatment, problems in terms of rehabilitation and problems in terms of ongoing support. It places a strain on the economy, 
 on the family and on the community. Without being emotional about the issue, one sees landmines really as being a blight on our society and an issue being appropriately addressed by this legislation and measures that are being taken by the government through our expenditure going towards the elimination of mines in different parts of the world.
Part of the real problem in this is the finding of the mines; that costs time and money as well. Of course, in many instances, the minefields have not been marked and have not been mapped. So it is not simply a matter of once the war is over the nation returning to normalcy; what one finds is that there is still much work to be done in finding the mines, marking the areas, mapping them and then, of course, clearing the areas. This further disrupts the lives, the lifestyles and the chance of a livelihood of those people within those nations.
Part of the problem is educating the locals and making them aware of the problem. This in itself can have its own problems in that many of these people are unable to read or write and, therefore, are not necessarily able to understand signage. Even if signage is placed there, with many of these people being so poor, there is evidence that it is removed to assist them to make basic shelter and homes. As I have said, the Australian government is to spend $100 million by the year 2005, and this is very commendable.
As I realise this is non-controversial legislation, the last thing I will do is read from a World Vision document, which highlights the problem in Cambodia. I quote:
Between six and 10 million landmines that were laid in Cambodia during or after the 25-year war are yet to be removed. One of every 236 Cambodians has lost an arm or a leg to a mine.
I repeat: one in every 236 people. It is something of enormous proportions and it shows the lack of dignity that these people must experience in the injury being inflicted and in the harm that has been caused to them by the landmines that were placed in Cambodia over a long period of time.
We are a nation free from this. In this nation we do not have this problem, we do 
 not experience it and, therefore, probably do not understand the disaster it causes at the family and social levels within these communities. The article goes on:
Landmines are currently the single greatest causes of poverty in these districts—
this is in Cambodia—
not only because of the deaths and the injuries but also because of the large areas of precious farming land that cannot be used due to the mines that lie hidden there. Mines are preventing needy families and communities from re-establishing decent livelihoods and futures.
The fact remains that, whatever one's view of war might be, landmines should be banned. They should be kept out of the realms of war. We as a nation should seek to assist others in clearing lands that are peppered with these indiscriminate killers. The fundamental thing that we can achieve by helping these people out is to return to them the most precious commodity that we can give them, and that is their dignity as human beings—their dignity as persons. I commend the legislation and I hope it gets the speedy passage it deserves.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1998-12-10,"—On behalf of Senator Bourne, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  a speech on the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Bill 1998 .
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Anti Personnel Mines Convention Bill is one of the most important we have dealt with in this Senate.
The Democrats have a proud record in calling for a total ban on the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of landmines. We join with NGOs here and around the world in believing that the only solution to this terrible problem is a complete and total ban.
First, and most importantly, this Bill represents Australia's commitment to the eventual destruction of landmines throughout the world, and their elimination as a legitimate weapon.
Former UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Gali said
The landmine, that scourge of the battlefield of World War I, has re-emerged on a scale unimagined, and with hideous unanticipated effects. There is today a global landmine crisis. . . it began as a military problem; it is now an ongoing humanitarian disaster.
The United Nations estimates it would take more than a thousand years to clear the 110 million active landmines already in the ground in 64 countries around the world. Two million more mines are laid every year.
Poor farming communities bear the greatest load from the deployment of landmines. The burden of injury and loss of income affects poorer women to the greatest extent.
The mindless carnage caused by landmines is an affront to the conscience of humankind. Growing public awareness of landmines and the devastation they cause are the best weapons against their continued use.
In recent years, landmines have attracted international coverage—they are now recognised as a global catastrophe. In 1994 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the eventual elimination of landmines. This led to the Ottawa process and the Bill we have before us today.
This Bill is also important for a second reason. It sends a loud message about Australia's commitment to a total ban on landmines. For that, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be congratulated. I know it cannot have been easy for the Minister to convince the rest of the Cabinet that this was the right thing to do, and it is very much to his credit that he was able to do so.
In ratifying the convention and introducing this legislation the Australian Government will encourage other governments in our region to take similar action.
The past 20 years have seen new types of warfare, often involving non-conventional combatants such as insurgents, partisans, terrorists and guerrillas. Regular armies fight against these groups and each other. All use landmines. Those mines will kill civilians. In far too many circumstances, mines are beyond military control. They have ongoing political, social and economic effects.
Those countries most affected by landmines tell the story—Afghanistan, Angola, Burma, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Kenya, Pakistan, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Vietnam and former Yugoslavia. The list goes on.
The effects are devastating and the practice is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law.
Anti-personnel mines are cheap and very easy to manufacture. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, prices range from $3 to $15 per mine. They might be cheap, but the cost of dealing with their effects is appallingly expensive.
Hospital stays, physical and psychological rehabilitation services, are all expensive. Many of the most affected nations don't have the money or resources to provide these services. Artificial limbs are just too expensive for many. Children typically require 
 a new artificial limb every year. Then there are the costs of re-integrating victims into society, making them feel useful and able to feed their families.
De-mining is very expensive. Clearing mines, which in most cases must be done by hand, can cost as much as $1,000 per mine.
The Australian Defence Force has an excellent record in mine clearance and training. The Government recognised this with a pledge at the Ottawa signing to provide an extra $100 million to aid clearance work. We welcome this. However, we fear the money for mine clearance will be drawn from the aid budget rather than the defence budgets where it belongs.
The Democrats and the NGO community have always maintained that funds for mine clearance operations should come from the defence budget. The humanitarian aid budget is already dreadfully depleted.
We also believe the Minister could better use forums such as the ASEAN Regional Forum to achieve a total ban on anti-personnel mines in our own region, as recommended by the Treaties Committee in our landmine report.
The Minister should be actively encouraging our South-East Asian neighbours to sign the Ottawa convention. Australia has demonstrated leadership in this matter and we should not lose that momentum.
The Democrats are keen to know when and how Australia will destroy our own stockpile of these weapons.
We welcome the Minister's clarification of clause 7(iii), which we now understand will be applied in instances where an Australian Defence officer carries out one of the prohibited acts under clause 7(i) in the course of combined operations.
We are also pleased that Defence doctrinal and operational manuals will be amended to comply with the prohibitions contained in the Bill. We are sure these amendments will be made as soon as possible after this Bill becomes law.
In conclusion, I would like to say how pleased the Democrats are to see this Bill before the Senate. It is remarkable to think that we are moving towards an effective total ban on landmines.
Lastly, I would like to thank Sister Patricia Pak Poy, Australia's co-ordinator for the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, whose tireless campaigning and encyclopaedic knowledge on the subject of landmines have been absolutely central to Australia becoming a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and their Destruction.  

—Also while I am on my feet, I seek leave, on behalf of Senator Margetts, to incorporate in Hansard  a speech on the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Bill 1998 .
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Today is a particularly satisfying day in my Parliamentary career, seeing the Bill come before the Senate and being met with the support of all Senators.
It is an issue which has been close to my heart and one I have tried to pursue from the very early days of time in this place. My first question in the Senate on the issue was about the Australian Defence Force use of mines and Australian compliance with the inhumane weapons convention back in February 1994. The part of the question to do with modification of weapons for use as booby traps wasn't answered at that time and the issue of grenades and other weapons being modified to work as defacto land mines is still a problem.
What was different then was the political climate on the issue. In June 1994, when I raised the landmines issue in the context of its effect on the world refugee problem it seemed to me I was very much on my own in this place. There was sympathy but no commitment to getting anything done about it.
Australia was being accused of providing Papua New Guinea with grenades which could be easily converted to mines for use in Bougainville—but the government continued to turn a blind eye.
Australia's role in this arms trade was a recurring theme of my speeches on the issue and several times I sought to draw the attention of the Senate to the hypocrisy and inconsistency of the Government over its failure to support a total ban campaign. They held to a position that mines were OK if they were mapped and if they went off by themselves or defused themselves after a certain time. I pointed out then that they couldn't be mapped if they were dropped from planes or fired from guns and didn't necessarily do what was expected of them anyway.
Then in 1995 there was the infamous Gareth Evens speech which I hope will continue to haunt him till his dying day in which he referred to my call for a total ban on landmines as ""hopelessly utopian"". He went on in that speech to use the chilling phrase ""landmines perform a unique military function"".
That is an expression that deserves to be rated alongside collateral damage and smart bombs!
Well Gareth, maybe now that you have time for reflection from your position in semi-retirement on the backbench, you'll realise that a utopian position 
 is not necessarily hopeless. If a few more people in high office were to take a utopian position we might actually get a few more achievements such as this Bill to ratify the Ottawa Treaty.
Over the years that I engaged in a war of attrition with then-Senator Evens, Senator Hill and others, the real battle to put an end to landmines was being fought by the non-government sector which was building up a world-wide constituency pressing governments to go further, to take on the total ban as an achievable aim.
In 1995 Australian Catholic Relief, Community Aid abroad, The Christian Centre for Social Action and many others affiliated with the Australian Council For Overseas Aid raised almost a quarter of a million signatures requesting the Government to push for a total ban on Landmines.
The turning point was the 1996 Ottawa Conference at which Australia pledged to work towards a having a ban treaty in place as soon as possible. It wasn't long before the Government were backtracking on that position, moving in to line behind the US which preferred the slower approach through the UN Conference on Disarmament. The CD approach was always going to be flawed as landmines got caught up in the complex trade-offs over nuclear weapons—and the commitment of the US was always in doubt anyway.
Fortunately the momentum for change was overwhelming. The groundswell of popular feeling could not be ignored. Disgust grew as people became aware of the indiscriminate nature of weapons which lay around for years, sometimes killing children, farmers, anyone in the wrong place at the wrong time. And the wrong place at the wrong time could be any place at any time—in fields, on paths, in forests.
Then gradually there was the realisation that—all the more horrible—that this killing of civilians was not  always so indiscriminate. That sometimes it was the intentional outcome of the planting of mines. This was the case in many conflicts around the world.
This realisation, and the appearance of television coverage of the plight of victims, intensified the movement for a total, global, unconditional ban on landmines. It would never have come about if it hadn't been for the untiring efforts of people such as Sister Patricia Pak Poy and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. I am please to see Sister Patricia was recognised for her efforts with an ANZAC peace prize earlier this year.
It is she and the others in the Non-Government sector who are to be thanked for making so much progress on an issue that seemed so intractable only a short while ago. 

That brings us to the current situation—where what was once ""hopelessly utopian"" is now Government policy and soon will be Australian law.
The Bill to ratify The Convention On The Prohibition Of The Use, Stockpiling, Production, And Transfer Of Anti-Personnel Mines And Their Destruction is very welcome indeed.
While there have been some concerns raised about particular aspects of the Bill, particularly in respect of Section 7 (3), on the issue of Australian troops involved in operations with non-signatory states, I understand those concerns have been pretty much addressed in the Second Reading speech by the Minister. I certainly hope that loop-hole is well and truly closed.
The issue I wish to focus on is: Where to from here? What happens from now on in terms of action to get the mines out of the ground, to provide assistance to victims and to universalise the Treaty. It is important to know how all of this will be managed and monitored. In this regard I commend the current efforts in Ottawa to establish a Landmines Monitor, but we will also have to be vigilant in our monitoring of Australia's role.
The amount allocated by the Government for work on landmines—$100 million—is on the face of it a generous amount. But do we have guarantees that this is `new money'?  i.e. not coming out of existing aid budgets. Even with this allocation, there is room for Australia to make further allocations for clearance of mines from priority land, and for assistance to victims and survivors.
Universalisation
Ratification by Australia now puts us in a better position to seek to convince others in the region, and elsewhere (including the US), to come on board. Vietnam, Laos, Burma, Singapore and PNG are still not signatories. Neither are China, Korea, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Let's make this a high priority in our regional relations.
The focus needs to be on total ban. Let's not see our efforts fall back into reliance on the CD process. While the CD is obviously one forum, Government efforts here should not detract from the ban principle. We must continue efforts in UN forums especially the next Review of Protocol II in 2000-2001.
Mine Action
Key issues around mine action are the priorities—deciding where and how the remainder of the $100m gets spent.  The choices here need to be made in a strategic and transparent way, targeting getting the mines out of the ground, maximising local capacity in the countries affected and maximising Australian expertise in the area. In this context, countries in our region should receive priority attention. 

Mine Action programs should develop local capacity in mines awareness, management and clearance—not rely on expensive expatriate expertise. In this regard we should capitalise on the potential for the ADF to play a positive role—as part of its training and awareness role—and its moral responsibility.
But there are other advantages to the Defence Forces in participation in de-mining and their efforts should be funded out of their budget, not from humanitarian/relief allocations whether on a cost recovery basis or any other.
The choice of where to de-mine should be based on proper data, and on practical and humanitarian principles which will maximise the capacity of local affected communities to return to productive and safe livelihoods.
Victim Assistance
Obviously there needs to be an ongoing commitment to assisting people who have been injured by mines. In an immediate sense, we need to continue with medical assistance etc. But also we need to focus on providing assistance to victims, and their families in developing safe and alternative livelihoods (where people can't farm their land because it is mined, or because they have lost limbs etc). Landmines are currently the single greatest cause of poverty in some parts of the world: not only because of the deaths and injuries, but also because large areas of precious farming land cannot be used due to the mines that lie hidden there.
It is most appropriate that this assistance be provided through the non-government sector as much as possible. It is the NGO's who have the experience on the ground and the confidence of local people and organisations and it is they who are best able to provide assistance.
Organisations such as Austcare, World Vision, Red Cross and others have well established programs which are deserving of greater government support.
Monitoring
We would not want to see the legislation as being the end of this process. Although it has been a good achievement, we should not let the feast of self-congratulation cloud the fact that what matters will be what Australia actually does to further the cause of the elimination of landmines. There are many aspects here: how Defence implements its side (including the destruction of the stockpile—and the importance of openness about progress towards destruction of the stockpile within 4 years), how DFAT approaches the task of universalising both the principle and the fact of the Treaty, how AusAID disburses funds (and against what criteria) and what other efforts the Government and civil society will need to make in scrutinising adherence in the manufacturing/transfers area. There is a role 
 for multipartisan scrutiny here—involving parliamentarians, bureaucrats and NGO's.
Research
There is also need for research and development of mine detection and clearance technology, but it needs to be stressed that this must not come from the aid budget or humanitarian funds.
Finally let us turn to the longer term priorities.
In July this year in Rome the international community created a statute for an International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC will come into being once 60 States have ratified the treaty. Unfortunately anti-personnel landmines were not included in the list of prohibited weapons found in Article 8 dealing with war crimes. However there is an opportunity to amend the Statute pursuant to Article 121 and 123 in the future. If the use of landmines was deemed a war crime it would be an extremely powerful tool in the fight to stop these heinous weapons destroying more lives.
The first priority there is for Australia to ratify and then start the long term process of getting the use of landmines considered a war crime for which prosecution can be mounted in the International Court.
But maybe that is just me being `hopelessly utopian' again.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I want to associate myself with the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Bill 1998 . This is a very important issue to a lot of people, particularly those who live in developing countries or countries that have seen strife, unrest, fighting and war in the last few years. I think particularly of Cambodia. However, more recently we have had brought home to us the troubles experienced around Honduras and some other Latin American countries as a result of Hurricane Mitch—the worst hurricane ever—dislodging and moving a significant number of landmines to areas that had previously been clear.
That is the thing about landmines: they are silent killers and silent maimers. Everyone in some of the rural villages and communities of developing countries—people on low incomes—needs to participate in the labouring work that has to be done in the fields. These instruments of war silently sit buried for any number of years—with some of the later devices and batteries that are operating in them, it could be a century—and, when least expected, they explode, usually maiming 
 rather than killing. This places a large burden on small rural villages because an active worker is removed from that community. If the victim happens to be a child, the effect would be to remove that child from whatever future he or she had. If the child was maimed, their only future would be to beg or be at home, dependent upon other members of the family and other members of the village. When the village is living not much above subsistence, these impacts are very great.
The impact of this was brought home to me when, on Anzac Day and the day after, I visited the French and Belgian battlefields of World War I. Tonnes and tonnes of unexploded ordnance are still being dug up 80-odd years after the cessation of those hostilities. When you think that, 80 years later, potentially lethal ordnance is still being found and dug up, you wonder how long it is going to take countries and the world at large to clear so many of the mined areas of Cambodia, Angola and parts of Latin America. The monumental size of that task really impacted upon me when I saw those battlefields of France. While they did not use landmines in those days that are as sophisticated as the ones that are used now, we certainly saw the impact and the devastation. We saw unexploded ordnance that had been dug up from the site of the memorial at Le Hamel. So it is a very important issue. The use these days of smaller and lighter weight components in the mines has made them even harder to detect and has made them more able, of course, to be moved around by floods.
I have a friend who is working in Cambodia for an offshoot of the World Council of Churches on community development work related to landmine victims. She has told me stories about travelling in the Cambodian countryside on roads and paths that have been cleared of mines. As Senator Hogg said, people do not read the signs, cannot read the signs or use the material on which the signs are displayed for other purposes. My friend said that she had seen families out ploughing fields that are marked with the signs that warn of landmines. She told me a story about one gentleman who had been partly maimed by a mine being helped by his child to plough a 
 field. The dangers for that family were very great but, obviously, the dangers of starvation, hunger or no income were also very great. So it very much affects those countries that are less fortunate than us.
I think it is appropriate that we pass this piece of legislation today, which is the day we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Human Rights. This legislation will help people who have been fighting to maintain their access to human rights. It is important that we pass this legislation so that we do not contribute to the proliferation or the continued use of landmines. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before us. It deserves to be classed as non-contentious legislation and it deserves to get the support it is getting from everybody within the government and this parliament.
It is legislation that puts to rest the lie that all we ever do in this place is argue, fight and disagree. This is a classic example of a good piece of bipartisan legislation being passed, one which will benefit many people, I hope. It certainly signifies Australia's commitment to the rights of those people and to not having landmines in a position where they can callously maim, injure and wound people in the future.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-12-10,"—Earlier this year I was in Africa. I met some people of outstanding ability and fame, Mr Acting Deputy President—in fact, I met you there amongst those people. You were not on this part of the journey, Mr Acting Deputy President, but we went to two places: Angola and Mozambique. I must confess that I felt very proud in both places because of the work being done at Australia's instigation. It made me feel very proud to be part of the Australian community. In Angola, Australia was responsible for the making of artificial limbs and feet for people who had been injured by mines. It was tragic to see the people who needed these feet but very `proud making', if I can use that expression, to see Australia trying to remedy a dreadful situation.
In Mozambique, the Australian Army had been central in educating local people in how 
 to dispose of landmines. The Australian military force had started disposing of landmines themselves and then had taught others how to get rid of them. At the time, Major McIntosh was there; I single him out because of that. I would like, through him, to pay tribute to all the Australian Army personnel who have gone over there to help de-mine Mozambique. I should also pay tribute to our Kiwi colleagues who were there at the time.
—Don't forget the AFP guys who were risking their lives in those areas, too.
—I accept that statement and endorse it, Minister; it is now on the record. Australia does great things around the world and the Australian Army does great things around the world. Mines, as everybody has said—the speakers before me, in particular—are the most cruel of weapons and are devastating to many people. It is good that we are known around the world not for laying mines but for trying to help those who are injured by them.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-12-10,"—I would like to thank all honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Bill 1998 . This bill will put in place the necessary domestic legislation for Australia's ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Land Mines and on their Destruction, known as the Ottawa Convention.
The Foreign Minister, Mr Downer, took particular pride in signing the Ottawa Convention on 3 December 1997, the day it was open for signature. I know that for a fact because I saw him very soon after he signed it when he visited Ottawa and then came on to New York to meet with Penny Wensley, the Australian Ambassador to the UN in New York.
I was equally pleased to deliver a statement on the floor of the General Assembly of the United Nations shortly thereafter. Just after Minister Downer signed the convention I was able to give a statement in which I outlined 
 Australia's commitment to a lasting, effective and comprehensive solution to the global landmines problem, including through enhanced international efforts in the fields of de-mining and victim assistance. I was able to highlight some of the things that have been said around the chamber here today about Australia's role in that, about some of the technology that has been developed in Australia for de-mining, about the role the armed forces and the Federal Police have played and also about the pride we have in what Australia has been able to achieve in de-mining. I also mentioned around the traps some of the partnerships that were going on between community organisations in supporting people adopting fields and de-mining them.
So we have a good record. We have a commitment. I also take great pride in having taught some students in prosthetics and orthotics who have contributed to some of the developments in the technology, simplifying the development of prostheses for people who have been affected by landmines. So across the board we have set an example in signing the convention. With this bill we are ahead of the pack compared with some countries. We have a record in contributing to de-mining through technology, through personnel and through assisting people who have been injured. We all have the right to be proud of that but we should never sit back and rest on our laurels. It ought to be noted that this bill has been passed with very strong support on all sides of the chamber. That is not always the case with bills. I have much pleasure in acknowledging that. The passage of today's bill helps bring closer the goal of a solution to the global landmine problem.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The opposition supports the Acts Interpretation Amendment Bill 1998 , though we do indicate that we will be moving an amendment during the committee stage of the legislation. The bill seeks to overcome the problems created for the government by the decision of Justice Spender in the Federal Court in Foster v. Attorney-General on 12 October this year. In that decision, His Honour held that the process adopted by the government in purporting to allow portfolio ministers to authorise junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries to act on their behalf was unlawful. In essence, the Federal Court found that there were flaws in the delegation process. A further flaw in the process was that the authorisation was made directly by the portfolio minister and not through the Administrative Arrangements Order or by the cabinet or the Prime Minister.
Justice Spender's decision has a potentially wide impact. It affects the validity of all government decisions made pursuant to authorisations which were made in accordance with the Prime Minister's code of conduct since April 1996 and it affects delegations and decisions made by either junior ministers or parliamentary secretaries on behalf of a portfolio minister by or under, for instance, the following areas: the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 pertaining to foreign investments; some 21 acts pertaining to the Department of Health and Aged Care, including the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989; the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and 17 matters taken by Australia on behalf of foreign countries; and the Crimes Act 1914 and a whole range of matters pertaining to parole, early release and revocation of parole.
It is important to note that Justice Spender's decision affects only those decisions made under a provision that vests statutory responsibility in a specifically named minister. In other words, if a minister, the Treasurer or the A-G is mentioned specifically in legislation, then under the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct and delegations of April 1996, quite a range of decisions taken over the last 2½ years under the four acts that I 
 mentioned, in particular, are probably now unsustainable at law.
The problem identified in the Foster decision would have been avoided if the government had acted pursuant to section 19BA(1) of the act and sought to regularise the arrangements reached between the relevant portfolio ministers and their junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries through the issuing of amended admin arrangements. Basically, what we have here is the Prime Minister going outside the law and endorsing somewhat sloppy administrative arrangements for his government. As a consequence, in a critical case just a few weeks ago in the Federal Court of Australia, Justice Spender found that such delegations were ultra vires.
Since that date, the Attorney-General has had the job of cleaning up the Prime Minister's mess. He has acted, I must say, with appropriate alacrity. This legislation is a sign of that. It must be put on the record as well that the Commonwealth is appealing the decision, and I gather the appeal was heard last Thursday. This legislation is necessary and it is urgent. It is for that reason that the opposition is assisting in the passage of it.
The bill, however, does go further than is required. What we have here is a bill which is retrospective in nature. Retrospectivity is always a concern but more so in respect of oral delegations. This government allowed, under the Prime Minister's arrangements, for oral referral of responsibility from a minister to a parliamentary secretary or a junior minister. Oral delegations have a number of problems in terms of ministerial responsibility and in terms of people being able to access their rights against government. Oral delegations are enormously difficult to ensure auditing of and administrative review thereof. The government has removed the ability to make an oral authorisation in future, but this legislation seeks to authorise past oral authorisations. We have some concerns about that, and they were expressed in the House of Representatives by the shadow Attorney-General, Rob McClelland.
Our second concern is the ability of a minister to job share even where parliament has prescribed that a particular minister needs 
 to act. The A-G, for instance, has special skills and experience. We would not want him delegating some of his responsibilities to the primary industries minister, for instance.
In terms of our second concern, this bill goes much further than the previous custom and practice. What we are seeking to do by way of our amendment is to allow authorisation by a minister to a junior minister or a parliamentary secretary within a particular portfolio, but not jump over the portfolio fences and delegate outside one's portfolio responsibility. That should not be a concept which would appeal to the Senate, though I anticipate that the Democrats are still thinking seriously about whether to support such an amendment.
This legislation seeks to redress the administrative problems arising from Justice Spender's decision, but we should also keep in mind that the process we are going through here may very well be a futile one, because Justice Spender in his judgment questioned whether anything short of a formal Administrative Arrangements Order signed by the Attorney-General in this case would be valid. His analysis was based on the concept of the separation of powers, and it is worth putting on the public record the comments he made on this point. In his judgment, Justice Spender said that the intention of the relevant section of the Acts Interpretation Act was to:
. . . provide a mechanism by which illness or absence from Australia or leave or other emergency could be met so as to permit the continued orderly administration of the enactments of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.
So we say that it is appropriate for delegation to occur in that situation. Justice Spender went on to say:
Consistent with the notion of responsible government is the requirement that Ministers of State, appointed by the Governor-General, administer Departments of State, and the cases reflect a ""longstanding practice "" that the Prime Minister might appoint a Minister to act, for the time being, for or on behalf of another Minister.
Again, we are content to support legislation which will confirm, entrench or specifically authorise that acknowledged practice. Justice Spender then proceeded with his analysis of 
 the separation of powers under the Westminster system. He said:
There is much to be said . . . that it is for the Governor-General on advice to appoint officers to administer such departments of State as are established, and . . . it is not even for the Prime Minister to determine who should be appointed to administer such departments.
So he went specifically to a discussion on the separation of powers and the role of the Governor-General under our Westminster system. He indicated that, basically, the approach that we are taking here may ultimately be found to be ill founded. This bill may turn out to be futile because it may breach the separation of powers concept. In the meantime, it is appropriate that the government should proceed to try to clean up this particular problem, and this legislation does that to the extent that we, at this stage, are assured of the constitutional parameters within which we are working.
I indicate that the opposition have one amendment, and it is an amendment I flagged earlier. It basically will ensure that delegations would occur within a portfolio rather than stretching over portfolios, and we will move that at the appropriate time. I also repeat that this legislation is substantially supported by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-10,"—The Acts Interpretation Amendment Bill 1998  sets out amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act and deals with the implications, as Senator Bolkus has pointed out, of the recent Federal Court decision in Foster v. Attorney-General. The government says that this decision has serious consequences for government administration. The Australian Democrats agree with that and we are happy to discuss this important issue which we believe goes to the very heart of how government in Australia functions.
The Foster case itself has been the vehicle for this change and, in particular, the decision of Justice Spender, as Senator Bolkus has pointed out, makes this debate now necessary. I would like to briefly discuss the details of the Foster case and then move to the contents of the bill. The United Kingdom have request 
 ed that Peter Foster be extradited on a number of fraud related charges. He was arrested last year in Australia and granted bail. He challenged the Attorney-General's decision unsuccessfully and, after a number of appearances in court, failed to attend a listed hearing on 1 December 1997. He was subsequently captured in February 1998 and brought before a magistrate to determine his eligibility for extradition. He was found to be eligible to be extradited on 4 March this year.
Foster challenged this decision in the Supreme Court of Queensland, which dismissed his application on 7 April 1998. He then made a number of submissions to the Minister for Justice and Customs seeking to avoid extradition. The minister for justice, Senator Amanda Vanstone, decided on 24 July 1998 that Foster should be extradited. Foster sought review of that decision in the Federal Court. On 12 October 1998, the Federal Court granted Foster's application on the basis that the minister for justice did not have the authority to make the decision on behalf of the Attorney-General. The Commonwealth appealed this decision to the full Federal Court on 15 October 1998, which was heard on 26 November, and the decision was reversed.
I received submissions from both Foster and his mother setting out a number of grounds addressing the merits of the case. There is no doubt that Foster is a colourful character and has undertaken activities which have attracted considerable media attention and other attention. I have accepted those submissions from the Fosters in good faith, and I have put their allegations to the Attorney-General.
This is an issue that goes to the merits of the case which has been the subject of comment by Justice Spender. The submission to the minister was described by Justice Spender as:
. . . a careful and fair summary of the submissions advanced on Mr Foster's behalf in relation to the nature of the offences, the likely penalty that might be imposed, submissions concerning the bona fides of the United Kingdom charge, delay in the prosecution of the United Kingdom charges, and the safety considerations advanced by Mr Foster.
Justice Spender found that:
. . . it was open to the decision maker to reach a different conclusion than that urged by Mr Foster as to the existence or extent of any threat to his safety on extradition. . . the claims and assertions by Mr Foster were investigated and, in the end, the Minister was not persuaded that any mandatory ground for denying surrender was made out, nor did any other discretionary factor so indicate.
This is a merits matter, and I am in no position in this instance to adjudicate the decision of the court, which is still the subject of an appeal. I have been assured of the bona fides of both the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom governments, and I accept that—although I would seek an assurance from the government that they do not have an agenda here, and suggest clear cases of procedural unfairness can have a political component which might in some circumstances warrant the scrutiny of the parliament.
Turning to the substance of this amending bill, the bill proposes amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act by inserting a new section 18C. This will provide for a portfolio minister to authorise a non-portfolio minister or a member of the Executive Council who is not a minister to act in the performance of statutory functions or the exercise of statutory powers. This bill makes amendments to section 19A so that all ministers within a portfolio can exercise the statutory powers of the portfolio minister. Amendments to section 19BA ensure the Governor-General may make orders under the section to meet the changes of an administration.
These amendments will also validate past authorisations to the extent that they may be invalid. The government, of course, has argued these amendments are urgently needed to overcome the implications of the Foster case. They say this decision would mean authorisations to another minister, to the so-called junior ministers and to parliamentary secretaries are invalid when that person was exercising statutory powers based on that authorisation. We believe that this is a serious matter, as the functioning of government depends on the designated decision maker having the power to exercise the functions available through statute, subordinate regulation rules and cabinet decisions.
From the Democrat perspective, the way the executive implements its own structures in order to exercise these powers is often shrouded in mystery. These are complex rules and practices about the appointment, powers and responsibilities of ministers and other members of the federal executive and the other office bearers. The Democrats are keen to see some formalisation of these processes under our general policy of accountability and transparency in appointment and decision making by governments. This is particularly important because the institutions in Australia, such as the cabinet, do not have any legal foundation.
However, there are some formalities. Central to this process are the administrative arrangement orders, the AAOs, made out by the Governor-General acting on advice. The AAOs set out the details of the department's and the minister's responsibility. It is under this scheme the Acts Interpretation Act enables the AAOs to take effect in conjunction with the existing statutory and other relevant rules assigned to particular ministers and departments, and the terminology in this debate is important.
Delegations are a complete transfer of the decision making power, whereas an authorisation is the decision making taking place on behalf of the decision maker. This debate is about authorisations—the exercise of a decision making power for, and on behalf of, the holder of the statutory power. We are concerned whether these amendments are necessary, and I am assured by the Attorney-General's office a resolution of this issue is essential for administrative certainty. However, I would note that this bill fixes up an erroneous interpretation of the Acts Interpretation Act and that the continued use of section 19 is possible because the Prime Minister might rely on the existing powers to deal with indisposed or unavailable colleagues and the re-making of AAOs.
We are also concerned that this bill goes beyond the issue in the Foster case. We are concerned that this bill sets out to retrospectively validate past decisions, which may effectively deny certain rights. I have raised this matter with the Attorney-General's office, 
 and I have been assured that civil liberties and other rights will not be denied by this particular amendment. The government says this amendment puts into effect existing practice. This matter was identified by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. In response to these concerns, the Attorney-General has said that these amendments would in no way prejudice practice that has in the past ensured due process. We are happy to accept this assurance from the Attorney-General, although we would seek a further assurance that where this retrospective amendment does affect due process the government will use their discretionary powers to remedy that or any injustice.
I am also aware that the debate in the House of Representatives focused on the place of oral authorisations—again, Senator Bolkus has referred to this. The government now has introduced its own amendment to make all these authorisations in writing. The Democrats support that amendment, recognising the difficulty and often the considerable expense faced by anyone challenging a decision to determine the decision maker and the decision making power. We are of the view that every authorisation and delegation should be in writing and easily identifiable to ensure open and accountable decision making in government.
The Acts Interpretation Act has been subject to review by the department and a discussion paper has been prepared. We welcome that review. The issue identified by the discussion paper for section 19 of the act is that what is printed in an act may not have the meaning that the text indicates. The problem then arises in identifying the decision maker and tracing the thread of power through the various orders. This is clearly not satisfactory.
The Democrats are also conscious of the changed administration under the previous government that created the mega departments and the new range of junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries. These structures have been inherited; they have been maintained. However, the Acts Interpretation Act was never designed to deal with this structure, and we are effectively imposing a new struc 
 ture on an old framework. The solution is to review the Acts Interpretation Act comprehensively to reflect these new structures. This is under way in part, and we would like to see this involve the parliament to make sure the important issues of transparency, accountability and responsibility are maintained. I am happy to discuss that further in a committee stage whenever that may be.
Basically the Democrats are very keen to see reform of the Acts Interpretation Act. We see an act that was made out in 1901, which has been amended to try to reflect modern times but still in many ways is holding onto the past. Government is very different now from what it was back in 1901. We have had a huge increase in the amount of legislation administrated by the executive, and we have had a huge increase in the size of the executive and we have a society that is no doubt becoming more and more complex.
The Democrats believe that the Acts Interpretation Act is essential as an interpretative document and a pivotal act in the devolution of powers. It is for this reason alone we need to make sure that the act reflects our needs now as well as into the future. We will be supporting this bill with an understanding that the Acts Interpretation Act is under review. We would expect to see the outcome of this review in legislation before the parliament and, in particular, the entire issue of the distributions of powers between the Executive Council and others. The Labor Party has flagged its support for this proposition, and I look forward to the government making the same commitment.
I want to make very clear why the Democrats will support the government's amendments and this bill. We accept the need to remedy the presently invalid authorisations from ministers to junior ministers, parliamentary secretaries and others. But we also see the need to make the Acts Interpretation Act reflect modern times. We are very pleased to see that this process of review is under way in the Commonwealth's review of the act. We support this review and the proposed rewrite.
I will say clearly that the need for change to include institutions such as the cabinet in 
 the formal legislative structures is something else that motivates our support for these changes. Another important reason for the rewrite of this legislation is to recognise the evolution of administrative law. The legislation of administrative law has been a great move forward in government accountability, transparency and efficiency. This has required decision makers to be accountable for their decisions and, in opening up the review of these decisions, the powers of decision makers are under scrutiny. From the Democrats' perspective, the powers to make decisions should be easily identified and their scope strictly within the powers that are given according to our laws. Further, for anyone challenging a decision, the scope of power should be an easily resolved issue and should not be a major legal challenge in itself.
Finally, we look forward to the review and the rewrite of the Acts Interpretation Act, and we expect to see that legislation before the parliament—hopefully soon.",SENATE,<title>ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-12-10,"—People looking at this situation might well say, `Of course, this act should be passed. Isn't it nitpicking to say that the proper process wasn't gone through? The Attorney-General didn't have power to delegate to another minister. So what? Everybody knows what was intended, and everybody knows that the proper result has been obtained.'
The judge in this matter, Mr Justice Spender of the Federal Court, saw that argument and answered it—and, I thought, answered it very effectively—when he said:
It might be thought nit-picking and offensive to the efficient and orderly arrangement of the business of the Attorney-General's Department that I have concluded that the Minister for Justice is not a person who satisfies the description in s 19 of the Acts Interpretation Act. However, the liberty of an Australian citizen and our international obligations in respect of extradition highlight the need for a punctilious compliance with the law in this area. Deane J noted in Re Bolton; Ex parte Beane . . .
""Any officer of the Commonwealth Executive who, without judicial warrant, purports to authorise or enforce the detention in custody of another person is acting lawfully only to the extent that his conduct is justified by clear statutory mandate. That being so, it is the plain duty of any such officer to satisfy himself that he is acting with the authority 
 of the law in any case where, in the name of the Commonwealth, he directs that a person be taken and held in custody.""
It would be a terrible thing if we as legislators and the government of the Commonwealth became desensitised, that is, we thought that locking people up was not a terribly big issue. To take somebody from the community and to lock them up in a cell—which, judging from my visits there and from illustrations that are made of it, is certainly not comfortable or big—is a dreadful and fearful thing. We must never forget it is a dreadful thing to arrest somebody and to lock them up in gaol. It is easier to do that to someone who we think is guilty. If you look at the history of what is alleged against Peter Clarence Foster, you can see that people might well say that this person has been in gaol and, on the surface, has been associated with fraud and what-have-you and so it is really not as bad to lock him up as it would be to lock up someone who was innocent.
The law in this area and the whole concept of civil rights are tested by our ability to apply them to the unattractive people in the community—the people who have a criminal record; the people who are twisted in mind and body. It is very easy at times to provide civil rights and the rule of law to the attractive, but it is often times less so where the ugly of the community are concerned. I think it would be a bad mistake on our part to say, `Foster'—that is what we would call him; we would not give him his full title—`is guilty anyhow. Therefore, we won't give him the rule of law.' The judge was a bit overenthusiastic in nitpicking about whether the law should apply or not.
It would be a bad thing to do that, especially on the day when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The issues of 50 years ago are still the same as the issues of today. Taking away a person's liberty or going into a person's house without a warrant is a fearful thing. It is a fearful thing, even with a warrant. It is a fearful thing to be put in gaol, if you are put in gaol according to process. 
It is for that very reason that we need the process. If we are going to do these sorts of things as a community—that is, to take away a person's liberty or to invade his or her house—we should do it only within the strict conformity of the law. It would be wrong of us to think—not that we do think it, but if we were inclined to think it—that Mr Justice Spender was somehow being pernickety, that he was somehow being precious in these circumstances. He was doing what he should have done as a judge, that is, to protect the liberty of the individual.
It is proper for us as legislators to think of these things. Indeed, as legislators, we do things about civil liberties and what-have-you. Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, I think the committee you are chair of—the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee—has done great work in this area. It has given parliament a real part in the protection of liberties. It has had many a fine secretary. I see Mr Paul Griffiths here in this chamber, and it is very true that having him in the system will ensure that the sorts of things I am talking about are properly listened to. Senator Coonan, an eminent barrister from the Sydney bar, is here too. It is good to have her in the loop.
—Will a common senator do, too?
—An eminent minister has gone beyond the legal toing and froing. But may I say the minister went to a great law school and was there with many other eminent people.
Returning to the issue, there is some very good thought going on about how we as a parliament can protect liberties. I refer to two people who have done a lot of work in respect of committees in this parliament. The first is Professor Janet Hiebert, who is a professor at the Queen's University in Canada. She has written several articles, but the one I particularly address my attention to is entitled `A hybrid approach to protect rights? An argument in favour of supplementing Canadian judicial review with Australia's model of parliamentary scrutiny'. This article shows that proper parliamentary scrutiny can 
 overcome problems that might arise in legislation.
 The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which I am honoured to be the chair of, has played its part in that scrutiny. Over the numerous parliaments since I have been here, ministers have cooperated very effectively with that committee in trying to get legislation free of any infringements on human rights. The legislation that does infringe human rights usually does so by accident. When you draft legislation, these things can creep in. I must confess that over the years the executive has usually been keen to see that the legislation does not breach human rights.
 The other person I want to refer to is Frank Brennan, who is probably known to everyone listening to me speak now. He has written a book called Legislating Liberty: a Bill of Rights for Australia? that has recently been published by the University of Queensland Press. Again, he goes into this issue of how parliament can have its input into seeing that civil liberties are properly attended to through the legislature. He argues that the Bill of Rights is certainly not to be put aside, because it can be a very effective means of looking after the liberties of the citizen, but that parliament itself can and should do more. I think we as a parliament should take up the words of Janet Hiebert and Frank Brennan and take their issues forward.
I make the point that the judge on this occasion was fulfilling the grand traditions of the judiciary, that is, he was ensuring that a person—no matter what his background, no matter whether he was good, bad or ugly—was nevertheless given the full protection of the law and that, if his liberty was going to be taken away, then it had to be taken away according to due process and that due process is a very high test—and so it should be.
The next point is that the courts over the years have been protective of the freedom of Australians, as has parliament. We should not overlook that. But this is the occasion and the time for the parliament to look more and more at its part—it would have to be a bipartisan approach—in establishing that legislation in any event does not contain problems in so far as human rights go. This is a good occa 
 sion to raise these issues, today being the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 The work of both Janet Hiebert and Frank Brennan provides us as a parliament with a way of going forward to ensure that we do walk proud as citizens and that nobody is going to be able to interfere with us, as we do walk proud as citizens, unless the full operation of the law has been called into play. It does mean the full operation. We cannot cut the corners. Once we start cutting corners, then we get instances of injustice, which we want to avoid. I do not want to go through the number of people who have been wrongly convicted and wrongly treated over the years—that will keep going because to err is human. But I think we as an institution can do a lot to ensure that that does not happen as much as it otherwise would.",SENATE,<title>ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-12-10,"—On behalf of Senator Margetts, I seek leave to incorporate her speech on the second reading of the Acts Interpretation Amendment Bill 1998 .
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
1.	 General Themes
The broad issues in this bill relate to achieving a balance between administrative ease or speed and proper oversight of executive decision making. Administrative law in general, is concerned to ensure that the existence of values of fairness, openness, honesty and efficiency in Commonwealth executive dealings with the general public.
Now—I would like to make clear that the Greens (WA) are supportive of the concept of administrative efficiency. Administrative efficiency is beneficial for members of the executive so that they can deal with their business in an optimal fashion without unwieldy red tape. Administrative efficiency is also beneficial for members of the public dealing with the executive. It is not in anyone's interests that government decision-making process should falter on what are no more than mere technicalities. Third parties dealing in good faith with the Commonwealth have a legitimate expectation that arrangements will not be frustrated by administrative oversights beyond their control. In addition, otherwise reasonable and lawful action taken against wrongdoers should not be defeated by technical objections. 

However, administrative efficiency should in no way be confused with administrative ease and speed. The speediest methods of administration are not always the ones that produce the most desirable outcomes. The Greens are concerned that best practice administrative procedures and protocols are in place in our executive arm of government—so that the executive can do their job with certainty, transparency and effectiveness and that the public can go about their business with certainty without having their rights unnecessarily or harshly or unjustly impinged upon.
The Acts Interpretation Act 1901  is one of the central pieces of legislation in this kind of framework. In some instances the Acts Interpretation Act 1901  will operate to confer legal responsibility for particular statutory provisions on persons other than those specifically named in the legislation. Consequently the Acts Interpretation Act in prescribed circumstances works to bring the legal position into line with changes agreed at the administrative and political level. As such, the Greens take very seriously the potentially immense implications of even small changes to this Act.
In effect, the Bill asks the Parliament whether (and to what degree) it is prepared to permit the Executive to exercise a wider discretion than is currently available when altering lines of administrative authority and responsibility delineated by legislation.

Verbal Authorisations
One provision in this amending Bill, which would have had immense implications, is the ability to verbally authorise another Minister. We are pleased to see that the Government has taken on board concerns raised regarding their proposal that a grant of authority may be oral in cases where authority is conferred on a Minister. Oral authorisations are obviously problematic for a number of reasons.
The ability to authorise without a written instrument decreases the transparency in administrative decision making—it makes it hard to engage in proper auditing of these decisions; it creates problems in the enforcement of individual rights—as anyone who is aggrieved by administrative actions would run into evidentiary difficulties, and this would make it more difficult to gain redress through administrative appeal. Oral authorisations could also increase the incidence of court and tribunal proceedings being commenced with the wrong respondent/decision-maker being nominated by the complainant.
The lack of publicity and the lack of a clear paper trail could result in not only in severe injustices for anyone seeking to review or challenge an administrative decision, but in bad practice in Government decision making. Best practice most consistent with the principles of administrative law would be 
 written authorisations for reasons of transparency and accountability. If oral authorisations are legitimate, there would a temptation to pursue this easier and less specific path—which would undercut best practice.
Not only that, but oral authorisations would potentially undermine parliamentary intention in specific pieces of legislation. But I will come back to this point later. For all these reasons—oral authorisations are a good example of where administrative ease or speed would not produce administrative efficiency—and may have produced very poor outcomes all round.
For all these reasons, I am glad that the Government has been persuaded by these arguments and has removed the ability to orally authorise.
2.	 What the Bill Does
This bill is ostensibly a clarification of when it is allowable for a Minister to authorise another Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary to exercise statutory powers on their behalf.
The Bill amends the Acts Interpretation Act 1901  in direct response to the decision of Justice Spender in Foster v Attorney-General  (1998) that has put a question mark over the breadth of s19 in the Acts Interpretation Act. 
Justice Spender's decision in the Foster case means that s19 is not sufficient legislative authority for a portfolio Minister to authorise a junior portfolio Minister to exercise statutory powers vested in the holder of a specific ministerial office (ie vested in the ""Attorney General""). So in the Foster case, the Attorney General's authorisation of the Minister of Justice was held to be invalid. Consequently, a decision to issue a warrant purportedly made by the Minister for Justice, Senator Vanstone, under section 23 of the Extradition Act 1988  was held to be invalid.
This decision, by implication, also means that a portfolio Minister cannot authorise non-portfolio Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries when powers are vested in a specific Minister.
Essentially this Bill will do a number of things.
(a)	 It will retrospectively validate past authorisations that may have been made in reliance on section 19 to the extent that they may be invalid.
(b)	 It will provide for a Minister to authorise a non-portfolio Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to act on his or her behalf.
(c)	 And it will ensure that an order can be made by the Governor General under section 19 whenever there is any change to the administration of government business and validates past orders under s19BA to the extent that they may be invalid. 

3.	 Concerns
The Greens appreciate the concerns expressed by the Attorney General in relation to Foster . The decision does have potentially serious ramifications for the administrative process of the executive and the Greens will not be preventing this Bill from attempting to address these concerns. The Greens see the merits in remedying the defects of the past. However, we do have concerns that a whole raft delegations or authorisations were done in an informal or non-recorded manner. And we would not like to see our acceptance of past validations as condoning informal delegations/ authorisations in the future.
Of course the issue of retrospectivity is ever present when we are dealing with past delegations. The issue is of injustices in the past that may no longer afford a remedy to an individual. This is always a difficult issue to weigh up. But on balance, as I mentioned previously, I do appreciate the concerns of the Attorney General and the potential for immense difficulties if these past authorisations are not validated.

Parliamentary Oversight
Another concern the Greens have is with the removal of the variance between specific and non-specific references to Ministers. This Bill essentially operates to remove the distinction between more general terms like ""the Minister"" and highly specific terms like ""the Attorney General"".
The situation as it currently stands is that when a piece of legislation uses the term ""the Minister"" this refers to any Minister with responsibility for that portfolio.
However, when a piece of legislation uses the term ""the Attorney General"" or ""the Minister for Finance"" or ""the Treasurer"", this refers specifically to the person currently occupying that position. By naming a particular Minister, there is an assumption that it was Parliament's view that that Minister should be accountable for things done under the Act and should be required to personally perform the statutory functions that the law assigns to her or him.
The amendments in this Bill, by homogenising the distinction between these terms, threaten to usurp parliamentary intention when the legislation was written and agreed to. Although the Prime Minister's ministerial code of conduct prefers the generic term to avoid potential complications, the legislation handbook recognises that there are appropriate circumstances where parliament should legislate to name a specific minister because of the special skills needed in undertaking a particular duty or function.
Of course, the entire basis of administrative law is that everything requires a specific statutory mandate. Ministers (or anyone else in the executive arm 
 of Government) cannot go off on ""a frolic of their own"" without reference to a specific statutory authority. So when a piece of legislation says ""Attorney General""—it is indicating that there are special skills needed in this area. This should not be overlooked too easily.
The Greens (WA) note that the Attorney General's department is currently undertaking a review of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 . We shall be watching these developments carefully to ensure a good balance is struck. We shall be watching that changes do not ask the Parliament too go too far in permitting the Executive to exercise a wider discretion than is currently available and when altering lines of administrative authority and responsibility delineated by legislation.
While supporting this Bill at Second Reading, the Greens (WA) will carefully consider the amendments in the Committee Stage of this Bill.",SENATE,<title>ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-12-10,"—I thank senators for their contributions to this debate. The bill provides that all ministerial authorisations that may have been affected by the decision of the Federal Court in the Foster case are validated. Because of the implications of the decision, it is appropriate that urgent legislative action be taken to clarify the position of ministerial authorisations.
The amendments in the bill will ensure that there is no uncertainty about the legal status of decisions made under such authorisations. The bill also clarifies the legal basis for senior portfolio ministers to authorise junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries to exercise statutory powers on their behalf. As senators are aware, the speedy passage of this bill will restore certainty to government administration and facilitate the continued orderly and efficient conduct of government business.
In relation to two matters raised by Senator Stott Despoja, I would say as follows. The government can give the assurance sought by Senator Stott Despoja that there is no political agenda involved with these amendments. Extradition matters or other matters which are sensitive and require review will be capable of review—judicial, administrative and political—in the same manner as occurs at present.
In addition, Senator Stott Despoja wanted an undertaking in the same vein as this sentence: `The amendments will in no way prejudice practice that in the past has ensured due process.' On the contrary, the amendments validate past practice. It will not retrospectively disadvantage anyone.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-12-10,"—Senator Ray asked me questions yesterday relating to the superannuation surcharge. I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard  additional responses to those questions.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR RAY ON THE SUPERANNUATION SURCHARGE
Can the Minister confirm that the Australian Taxation Office is imposing the 15 per cent super tax on deceased Australians?
No.
Assessments are issued to the holders of for member's contributions, generally superannuation providers. They are based on information given to the Commissioner about members' contributions. Basically, if an assessment is raised in relation to a member's, contributions and that member died before the assessment is received by the provider, then the assessment is taken not to have been made in relation to that member's contributions.
How many assessment notices have been sent to deceased taxpayers for the 15 per cent super tax?
The Commissioner of Taxation would not send out a surcharge assessment if he is aware the member has died.
In most cases, assessments are sent to superannuation providers as the holders of members' contributions. However, if a provider ceases to be the holder of a member's contribution (for example, when a member is in receipt of a pension or annuity), any assessment will be issued to the member. If a member dies before an assessment is received, the assessment is taken not to have been made, that is, there is no requirement to pay any assessed surcharge liability in these cases.
Why does the Government believe that it is appropriate to levy the surcharge or super tax on Australians who have not and cannot receive their superannuation because they have died?
Surcharge is calculated on the surchargeable contributions of high income earners and is assessed to the holder of the contributions. As I indicated earlier, if a member dies before the 
 surcharge assessment is received by the holder of the contributions, then the assessment is taken not to have been made and there is no requirement to pay the amount assessed.
How much does the Government anticipate collecting in this matter?
The Government does not anticipate collecting any amount in relation of the surchargeable contributions of high income earners who die before an assessment is received by the holder of the contributions. The law does not allow it.
Would the Minister like to comment on the principle of sending out notices of assessment, which are quite appropriate with income tax and other matters, to people who have died and are not able to access their benefit to superannuation but who still have to pay the tax on it? Can you see that that is quite a different principle to any other tax imposition for a deceased person? Can you imagine the distress it causes to those managers and beneficiaries of the estate? Can you tell us what the situation is, how many people are affected, what the value of it is and how you rationalise the principle of the matter?
The Commissioner of Taxation would not send out a surcharge assessment if he is aware the member has died. If the Commissioner is not aware of the death and an assessment subsequently issues, there is no requirement to pay the assessed surcharge liability.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Surcharge</title>,Miscellaneous,28,1,speech

LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Senate Standing)
Off the record—shield laws for journalists' confidential sources
The `Off the Record' report is the only report that has been tabled as part of the committee's wide ranging inquiry into the rights and obligations of the media generally. The report was tabled in October 1994. The report considers only one aspect of the terms of reference given to the Committee (ie whether the media should be able to protect the identity of sources of information). These recommendations were conditional upon the media adopting a new code of ethics and an effective disciplinary mechanism for enforcing the code. The Government has been closely monitoring developments since 1995 towards the adoption of a new code of ethics by the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance.
The report also raises issues that are related to other aspects of the Committee's inquiry.
Given the desirability of a comprehensive Government response to all aspects of the 
 committee's terms of reference, the Government does not propose to respond to the report.
LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION
Copyright Amendment (No. 2) Bill 1997
On 1 April 1998 the Committee released its report on the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997.  By majority, the Committee supported the passage of the bill but raised four matters for consideration by the Government.
The bill was subsequently debated and passed in the Senate on 12 July 1998 effectively providing the Government's response to the Committee's first recommendation that the bill be passed. During debate the Government introduced a number of amendments that responded to the Committee's fifth and final recommendation—to examine the effect that the bill might have on music composers where a CD containing their work is imported.
The Government also took further advice from the Attorney-General's Department, as recommended in the Committee's second recommendation, confirming that the form of the legislation as passed was consistent with the World Trade Organisation's TRIPS agreement.
The two remaining recommendations of the Committee concern matters of more general policy and the Government will provide a response on those matters, as part of the formal response to the report as a whole, by the end of the year.
The preparation of the bill for debate and passage, and the subsequent calling of the Federal election in August 1998, has contributed to the delay in not responding to the report within the agreed timeframe.
Special benefit provisions—Newly arrived resident's waiting period
As the report concluded that there was no need to vary the provisions regarding access to Special Benefit, and contained no recommendations for future action, it is not intended to provide a Government response to this report.
LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENCES
Inquiry into the Commonwealth's actions in relation to Ryker (Faulkner) v The Commonwealth and Flint
The Government response to the Committee's report is still under consideration.
Payment of a Minister's Legal Costs Part 2
The Government response was presented out of session to the President of the Senate on 27 August 1998.

The Government is now finalising its response for tabling.
Working holiday makers: More than tourists
The Government is now finalising its response for tabling.
Deportation of non-citizen criminals
The report's recommendations are currently being considered by the Government.
NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY (Joint Statutory)
Third evaluation of the National Crime Authority
The Committee's report, which was tabled on 6 April 1998, contained a number of recommendations to the Government concerning the powers and operations of the National Crime Authority (NCA). The complex nature of the recommendations required extensive consultation to be undertaken with a number of agencies, including members of the Inter-Governmental Committee (IGC) on the NCA.
Subject to further consultation with the IGC, the Government is expecting to table its response in the 1999 autumn sittings.
NATIVE TITLE AND THE ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LAND FUND (Joint)
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (11th report)
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998 was redrafted taking into account the recommendations of the 11th and 12th reports of the Committee and was reintroduced into Parliament on 12 November 1998. The Government will not be making any further response to the report.
Examination of 1996-7 Annual Reports in fulfilment of the Committee's duties pursuant to s.206(c) of the Native Title Act 1993 (13th report)
As this report contained no recommendations, the Government does not intend to provide a formal response.
PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT (Joint Statutory)
JCPAA Reports
As a matter of general practice this explanatory schedule does not include reports from the Joint 
 Committee of Public Accounts and Audit unless such reports contain policy recommendations. Reports that address administrative or operational matters are usually responded to in the form of Finance Minutes. These are normally provided to the Committee within six months of the tabling of the report and are then tabled by the Committee.
Aboriginal Councils and Torres Strait Island Councils: Review of financial accountability requirements (Report No. 355)
The Finance Minute for this report has been transmitted to the Secretary of the Committee. Tabling of the Finance Minute will be organised by the Committee.
Tax Law Improvement Bill (No. 2) 1997 (Report No. 356)
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit made 17 recommendations, most of which related to the technical content of the bill (recommendations 3, 6, 9 and 11 to 17). The Government has already approved and given effect to all of these `technical content' recommendations by sponsoring amendments of the bill in the House of Representatives. The remaining recommendations relate to the Tax Law Improvement Project (TLIP) more generally.
In its tax reform package A New Tax System  under the heading Subsume the Tax Law Improvement Project  (page 149), the Government indicated that it would be giving further consideration as to how to best make use of the considerable experience developed by the TLIP, in developing the proposed integrated tax code. Accordingly, the resources of the Project will be made available to assist in the implementation of the Government's tax reform package. The Government has, therefore, delayed its response until the precise details of the future of the TLIP (and its relationship with the integrated tax code) are settled.
The Jindalee Operational Radar Network Project (Report No. 357)
The Finance Minute for this report will be transmitted to the Secretary of the Committee shortly. Tabling of the Finance Minute will be organised by the Committee.

The Finance Minute for this report will be transmitted to the Secretary of the Committee shortly. Tabling of the Finance Minute will be organised by the Committee.

 shortly. Tabling of the Finance Minute will be organised by the Committee.
Internet commerceTo buy or not to buy (Report No. 360)
The report's recommendations, some of which will be addressed by way of Finance Minute, are currently being considered. The Government's response is expected to be tabled before the end of the year.
Review of Auditor-General's report 1996-97—First quarter (Report No. 361)
The Finance Minute for this report is not due with the Committee until 25 December 1998.
General and specific purpose payments to the States (Report No. 362)
The Committee has confirmed that no Finance Minute is required for this report as the Committee made no recommendations.

—In accordance with the usual practice, on behalf of the President, I table a list of parliamentary committee reports to which the government has not responded within the prescribed 
 period. The list has been circulated to honourable senators. With the concurrence of the Senate, the list will be incorporated in Hansard .
The list read as follows—
PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO THE SENATE ON GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OUTSTANDING TO PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE REPORTS AS AT 10 DECEMBER 1998

PREFACE
This document continues the practice of presenting to the Senate twice each year a list of Government responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.
The practice of presenting this list to the Senate follows the resolution of the Senate of 14 March 1973 and the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 the former Government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The current Government in June 1996 affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation.
The list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the following Senate Standing Committees: Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Privileges, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills. However, such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by way of Finance Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.

Legislation committees report on bills and on the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations which cannot readily be implemented through the bill, and therefore require a response, are listed. The list also does not include reports by legislation committees on estimates.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I move opposition amendment No. 1:
(1)	 Schedule 1, items 1 and 2, page 3 (line 5) to page 4 (line 23), omit the items, substitute:
1 After section 18B
	 Insert:
18C The Prime Minister or Cabinet may authorise a non-portfolio Minister or a member of the Executive Council who is not a Minister to act on his or her behalf in the performance of statutory functions or the exercise of statutory powers
	 (1)	 The Prime Minister or Cabinet may during the temporary absence or incapacity of a Minister (the  portfolio Minister ) who administers (whether alone or jointly with one or more other Ministers) an Act or a provision of an Act authorise:
		 (a)	 a Minister who does not administer the Act or provision; or
		 (b)	 a member of the Executive Council who is not a Minister;
		 to act on behalf of the portfolio Minister in the performance of functions, or the exercise of powers, that the portfolio Minister may perform or exercise under the Act or provision.
	 (2)	 A portfolio Minister with overall responsibility for the portfolio (the  senior portfolio Minister ) may authorise: 

		 (a)	 a Minister who is responsible for certain matters within that portfolio (the  junior portfolio Minister ); or
		 (b)	 a member of the Executive Council who is not a Minister and who is responsible for certain matters within that portfolio;
		 to act on behalf of the senior portfolio Minister in the performance of functions, or the exercise of powers, that the senior portfolio Minister may perform or exercise under an Act or a provision of an Act.
	 (3)	 An authorisation under subsection (1) or (2) in relation to an Act or a provision of an Act extends to the performance of functions, or the exercise of powers, that the portfolio Minister or senior portfolio Minister may perform or exercise under an instrument (including a regulation, rule or Proclamation) having effect under or for the purposes of the Act or provision.
	 (4)	 Subject to subsections (5) and (6), an authorisation under subsection (1) or (2) may be expressed:
		 (a)	 to have effect only during a period or periods, or during the existence of a circumstance or circumstances, referred to in the authorisation; or
		 (b)	 to take effect immediately, or at a time referred to in the authorisation, and afterwards to continue to have effect until another person is appointed to the office held by the authorising Minister.
	 (5)	 Despite subsection (4), an authorisation under subsection (1) may be revoked at any time by the Prime Minister or Cabinet.
	 (6)	 Despite subsection (4), an authorisation under subsection (2) may be revoked at any time by the senior portfolio Minister.
	 (7)	 An authorisation under subsection (1) or (2) given to a Minister or member of the Executive Council, and the revocation of such an authorisation, must be in writing.
	 (8)	 This section does not affect the giving, under a power existing apart from this section, of an authorisation to a Minister or other member of the Executive Council to act on behalf of another Minister.
	 (9)	 Either the portfolio Minister or the senior portfolio Minister, or the Minister or member of the Executive Council who acted on behalf of the portfolio Minister or the senior portfolio Minister, as the case may be, may be named as respondent in any proceeding to review the decision. 

	 (10)	 In this section:
 Cabinet  refers to the group of Ministers who are designated as Cabinet Ministers in details of the Ministry issued by the Prime Minister.
 function  includes duty.
Validation of past authorisations
(1)	 Any authorisation that a Minister (the  authorising Minister ) purported to give before the commencement of item 1 to another Minister or member of the Executive Council to act on behalf of the authorising Minister in the performance of functions, or the exercise of powers, that the authorising Minister was empowered to perform or exercise under an Act or a provision of an Act is taken to have been, at all times before that commencement when the authorisation purported to be in force, as valid as it would have been if that authorisation had been made by the Prime Minister or Cabinet in accordance with item 1 and the section inserted by that item had been in force when the purported authorisation was given.
(2)	 If an authorisation that a Minister (the  authorising Minister ) purported to give before the commencement of item 1 to another Minister or member of the Executive Council to act on behalf of the authorising Minister in the performance of functions, or the exercise of powers, that the authorising Minister was empowered to perform or exercise under an Act or a provision of an Act purported to be in force immediately before that commencement, the purported authorisation has the effect after that commencement that it would have if that authorisation had been made by the Prime Minister or Cabinet in accordance with item 1 and the section inserted by that item had been in force when the purported authorisation was given.
As I indicated in the second reading debate, the opposition's concern is that the government goes too far in what it is attempting to do here. We understand that there is a problem. We understand that the government wants flexibility, but we think the government goes too far and, in doing so, in some ways may give authority for ministers to in fact override laws passed by this parliament.
Our concern is that ministers should not be able to delegate or authorise outside of their portfolio areas. That should be a responsibility of the Prime Minister or cabinet. We think 
 that should be so for good policy and administrative reasons. There needs to be certainty. Individuals need to know who is taking decisions as to their existence, their businesses and so on. The current government proposal does not do that.
We are also concerned to keep in mind the words of His Honour when he tackled the case of Foster v. Attorney-General. In the judgment, as I cited earlier, Justice Spender made mention of the separation of powers under the Westminster system. Our amendment would offer protection against impingement on such separation of powers. I indicated before lunch that we would move this amendment. The Democrats indicated they would not support it. As a consequence, I will not be putting it to a vote.",SENATE,<title>ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-10,"—I rise to speak on the amendment moved by the opposition. As Senator Bolkus has indicated, the Democrats will not be supporting the amendment in its current form. Clause 18C makes provision for the Prime Minister or cabinet to authorise a non-portfolio minister or a member of the Executive Council who is not a minister to act for or on behalf of the portfolio holder. Although the Democrats have some reservations about the way this amendment operates in that it may not achieve its intended purpose, we are certainly quite glad that it is being proposed as a matter of discussion and debate.
The Acts Interpretation Act was assented to on 12 July 1901 as the second act in the new Australian Federation. Since then, the sections covered by the government's bill have been amended a number of times to deal with changes in the way government operates. The idea supporting interpretation legislation has been a significant reduction in the amount of legislation because commonly used words and phrases can be relied upon. This was evident from a number of submissions to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report entitled Clearer Commonwealth law in September 1993. That report recommended the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of 
 Parliamentary Counsel publicly review and rewrite the Acts Interpretation Act.
As I have set out before, the Democrats are keen to see this process advanced and encourage the government to rewrite this important act to reflect modern day times and needs and responsibilities. However, we also want to see that review and rewrite go further than just the interpretation measures. We want to see the Acts Interpretation Act deal with the institution of government and the way the executive organises itself and distributes the powers granted to government by our laws. We acknowledge the importance of the Acts Interpretation Act, and we want to ensure its continuing relevance and to promote legislative clarity so that those relying on legislation can know and understand what our parliament does and how laws are to take effect. More importantly, we want to make sure those challenging governments or who are subjected to the action of a government can ensure our laws are properly and appropriately administered.
The constitution makes provision for ministers and the federal Executive Council, but it does not distinguish between senior ministers, junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries. The Labor amendment, in many ways, is a welcome recognition of the central place of cabinet in the Australian government as well as these additional roles which reflect the changing way that government is administered. This recognition is now probably as important as ever before. This is because the changes to mega departments by the previous government, as I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, have been carried on by this government. It is also important to realise the increasing scope of government in Australia.
The constitution makes provision for only seven ministers. At the time the Acts Interpretation Act was assented there were 10 ministers. In 1998 there are some 30 ministers. Perhaps more interesting is the rise of parliamentary secretaries. They first appeared in the Lyons ministry in 1938, with parliamentary secretaries for defence and Treasury. Since then, they have existed in a number of government departments. In 1980 
 they became statutory office holders, and from 1990 they have become members of the Executive Council.
The Democrats are keen to see a reflection of these  changes in the Acts Interpretation Act. We welcome the Labor Party's recognition of these issues and their attempts to put them into effect. Unfortunately, we have some concerns about how these amendments have proposed to achieve their goal. We are of the view that they do not cover satisfactorily the complex issues. However, I understand we have a common interest in reviewing the Acts Interpretation Act to deal with this and related issues. I look forward to hearing the result of this reform process.
The Democrats will not be supporting the amendment in its present form with an understanding from the government that the Acts Interpretation Act is under review and that that review will be completed soon, we hope. We would expect to see the outcome of this review, as I stated in my speech in the second reading debate, in legislation before the parliament, addressing, in particular, the entire issue of the distribution of powers between the Executive Council and others. The Labor Party have flagged their support for this proposition, and I look forward to the government making the same commitment.",SENATE,<title>ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-12-10,"—I thank Senator Stott Despoja for indicating the support of the Democrats for the Acts Interpretation Amendment Bill 1998 . I freely acknowledge that there are wider issues to be canvassed under the review, and I expect the Democrats and others will want to make submissions to that review of the Acts Interpretation Act, but their approach is a sensible approach to a potential problem we face. It has been well canvassed in the speeches in the second reading debate that a Federal Court judge has drawn an unexpected interpretation of the Acts Interpretation Act which has put a number of decisions at risk across a number of portfolios. That matter is under appeal, but the judgment has not yet been handed down. In the meantime, there is an absolute need to protect those decisions that have been made, obviously for the longer 
 term, irrespective of the decision to deal with this matter.
I thank the Democrats for their support and confirm our commitment to the proper review of the Acts Interpretation Act that is already under way. I thank the opposition for their interest, in the sense of coming up with alternative amendments, but simply indicate, for reasons I think that are obvious, that they are not satisfactory.
Amendment not agreed to.
Bill agreed to.
Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I rise to speak on the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998 , the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 1998  and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance) Bill 1998 . I indicate on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, the opposition in the Senate, that we support Senator Lees's second reading amendment to the private health insurance bills. That amendment provides:
""the Senate:
(a)	 notes the evidence provided to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee that the rebate scheme will not take the pressure off public hospitals and is an inefficient and inequitable use of public funds; and
(b)	 resolves that the bill not be read a second time; and
(c)	 calls on the Government to:
	 (i)	 introduce a means test to restrict eligibility for the rebate to hospital insurance for people on low incomes;
	 (ii)	 implement a review process to evaluate the rebate scheme against defined outcome measures;
	 (iii)	 require health insurance funds to achieve improved performance outcomes; and
	 (iv)	 address the key areas of need in the public health sector, including coordinated care for older Australians; waiting lists in public hospitals; public dental health services; rural health services; and the health care needs of indigenous Australians.""
These measures highlight the concerns that have been expressed about the inadequacies of this bill. We think the amendment ought to be supported by the Senate. The problems with the proposed bills have been widely canvassed in the second reading debate. It is clear that this is bad public policy. It will not relieve the pressure on the public hospital system. Most of the funds will be directed to 
 those on high incomes who are already in private health insurance. A myth has been perpetrated by the government in this debate that somehow this measure is about assisting, via the rebate, low and middle income families who are battling to meet their insurance costs. The reality is that they will have a very small increase in the rebate that is available currently under the old scheme. Most of the money in this proposal goes to high income earners. Those earning over $70,000 a year are the ones that benefit most. The majority of the funds go to them.
We think that is inequitable. There are major problems in our public hospitals system and this sort of money would go a long way to addressing them. It would not only address those problems but mean that 100 per cent of the Australian population would have the benefit of those funds; that 100 per cent of the population could access good quality public hospital care, rather than just supporting the 30 per cent who are in private health insurance, as is proposed by the government.
It also does not solve the problems with the industry. The gap payments, the out-of-pocket expenses, are so high that a lot of people just cannot afford to use their insurance, even if they have it. That is a real problem in the industry. It is a problem that is not addressed in the bills. It means that this rebate will just get eaten up without solving the very real problems that exist in the health industry.
The other major problem it does not address is rising premiums. People in private health insurance know that their premiums have gone up 16 to 20 per cent in the last two years each year. That means that at this rate any benefit they get out of this measure proposed by the government would get eaten away in higher premiums within a couple of years. People will be no better off.
The measure is also highly inequitable, as I said. About $900 million of the additional $1.4 billion will go to families that already have insurance who are on high incomes. We are throwing money at the well-off in the community while denying funding for services, such as emergency dental care, for those who cannot afford to get treatment otherwise. It is just a wrong set of priorities 
 by the government. They are throwing money at a scheme with no real idea what it will do to the industry and with no real idea whether it will halt the slide. 
The government claimed the last scheme would halt the slide in private health insurance participation, and it did not. They have no statistical or economic modelling to suggest that this will be any more successful, but they will have wasted $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money by throwing it at the problem, not knowing whether it is going to work or not. They got it wrong last time and I suspect they will get it wrong this time.
The proposed amendment by the Democrats seeks to ensure that the pressure on the public hospital system is relieved, that the Dental Health Scheme is reintroduced and that the health needs of indigenous Australians and those in rural areas are addressed. It would ensure that the rebate would be means tested to ensure that it is targeted at middle and low income earners, at the people who need the help to pay the premium, not at John Howard, who does not need the help.
John Howard and people like him will benefit most from this measure. We will basically pay their private health insurance as a result of this measure. That is not what the health needs of this country are. That is not the priority. John Howard and other ministers in this government do not need help to pay their premiums, but people do need to get access to public hospitals and they do need to get off waiting lists to have operations performed when they are in pain. There is a whole range of health needs that are a far more urgent priority for this parliament than subsidising wealthy people to have health insurance.
We are not opposing support for those who need it, but we are opposing providing support for those who do not. As I say, there are some very good things in the Democrats' second reading amendment. It provides a much better direction for public policy in this area and the opposition will be supporting it.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-10,"—I understand that the government argues that this amendment is impossible to support because defence and national security will in some way be prejudiced. The Democrats have always been fairly sceptical about the defence and national security requirements every time we happen to deal with something that involves radioactivity.
 I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs met yesterday with a group to discuss nuclear weaponry. By all reports, he was disappointed that they failed to appreciate how much good he is doing to prevent the defence uses of nuclear weapons. Recent surveys highlight the very clear difference between public sentiment about nuclear weapons and the activities of governments all around the world, but particularly the nuclear weapons nations. We believe the Australian government is out of step with the community here. Despite the good intentions of the foreign minister, we do not believe that he is doing enough or that he is necessarily going far enough.
It was significant that the group who met with the foreign minister pointed out last 
 night on the radio the failings of the BJP government in India to focus on the nuclear detonations as a success of their office. This is significant, because we have been led to believe that there was great community support for those detonations and for the escalation of nuclear weaponry in India and in Pakistan. Clearly, the community does not necessarily share the same level of joy or have the same agenda as their government's. This was also obvious in the Rajasthan elections where the chief minister campaigned on the bomb, only to be ousted because the community was more interested in social problems such as whether or not there was enough food.
I suggest that the same thing is likely to happen in a nation like ours. It is probably time for our government to take a lead and do something to force the nuclear weapon states to get rid of their nuclear weapons.
—Hear, hear!
—Thank you, Senator Margetts. It is good to see the Greens support this notion. We certainly support your amendment, Senator Margetts.
This brings me back to the reliance on the defence and national security clauses in this bill. There is no place for these provisions in this bill, because the community does not want them there. Both subclauses 7(1) and 8 (1) are so broad that their application is uncertain. It is quite nebulous as a result. They effectively apply to anything that may affect Australia's defence or national security. What this means is pretty unclear.
 Add to this the obvious public disenchantment with the use of nuclear material in defence and national security, and we cannot support these incredibly broad provisions. If the government want to do this, then they should at least define what they mean and set this out in other legislation. We believe everyone in Australia should comply with the same standards, and exceptions need to be clearly identified and defined.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—The comments of both Senator Margetts and 
 Senator Stott Despoja have been noted and will be passed to the relevant ministers.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-10,"—You will remember that before lunch I raised the matter, because it is pertinent here, of the Director of Safeguards  report for this year through Foreign Affairs and Trade. The report points out that there is research and development being undertaken at Lucas Heights into the uranium enrichment process under the auspices of Silex Systems Pty Ltd, which has now combined with a United States company and a South African nuclear corporation. I asked the minister what he could tell the committee about this matter as I had raised it before in the chamber. I particularly drew his attention to the following comment on page 31 of the report to his government:
If this technology—
which is being developed in Lucas Heights—
is classified as ""associated technology"", then any transfer to the US for further development will require an amendment to the existing Australia/US nuclear cooperation agreement, or a new agreement.
I asked whether that was so. I also asked whether, in order to accommodate this research into uranium enrichment, the government is moving to throw out, dismantle or change the nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States and, if so, why.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—I will address the specific issue put by Senator Brown but, before doing so, can I have the indulgence of the committee for a moment to comment on some related matters that he raised in the debate yesterday about mining at both Kakadu and Pine Creek. I advise Senator Brown that his concerns on both these matters have been passed on to the relevant minister. With regard to Kakadu, oral advice has been received from the Office of the Supervising Scientist that the recent weather conditions in the Northern Territory have not caused any environmental problems at Ranger.
The senator would, of course, be familiar with the very satisfactory record of the Rang 
 er mine in that area over 18 years. I do not have particular information on the issue regarding Pine Creek. However, I assure the senator that it has been passed to a number of both Commonwealth and Northern Territory ministers for their early attention. As soon as I have any information on it, I will make it available to Senator Brown.
With regard to Silex and the laser issues, I am advised that the Silex project is a private sector project researching a possible method of enriching uranium for use in power reactors. This research is still at an early stage and it is not yet established that the Silex process will be effective in enriching uranium. The Silex company has a contract with the United States Enrichment Corporation for the commercial development of the process in the US if the research is successful.
It is too early to say whether the Silex process is of possible proliferation significance. However, security measures have been put in place to ensure that the technology is protected against unauthorised access. The Australian Safeguards and Non-proliferation Office is monitoring the process of the project to ensure that appropriate security is maintained.
Australian and US officials have been discussing a new agreement to ensure that if the technology is transferred to the US it will be used for exclusively peaceful purposes under international atomic energy safeguards. There is nothing inconsistent with Australia's non-proliferation commitments in undertaking this research. On the contrary, this enhances Australia's capacity to evaluate nuclear developments in other countries and to contribute to the development of effective non-proliferation controls. Examples are international safeguards and controls on the export of relevant technology. For these reasons, the research was authorised by the previous government.
The project does not represent any risk to the environment or public safety. It is extremely small scale. Silex is authorised to process no more than one kilogram of uranium. In practice, much less than this is being used in the process. Information on the project and safeguard arrangements applying 
 to it is given in the annual report of the Director of Safeguards, the head of ANSO.
I trust that that provides Senator Brown with information. I ask him to address any other questions that he may have specifically to this legislation, which we are keen to process in a reasonably ordered timetable today.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-10,"—I assure the parliamentary secretary that I will not take much longer. I recognise that he had a written response. I wonder whether I could have a copy of it.
—Yes.
—I thank the minister for agreeing to that. I recognise that the parliamentary secretary may not be able to answer these questions. If he cannot, I would again be happy to receive a later reply. Specifically, what in the Australia-US nuclear cooperation agreement would need to be changed to accommodate this research into uranium enrichment and, I am told, potential plutonium enrichment at Lucas Heights? Will there be a transfer to the US for the further use and development of this technology? Why is the research not being done in the US?
When the minister says that special safeguards are being put in place to make this research safe, what exactly are those safeguards? In what way are they being implemented? Finally, is there any other known case of research of this variety which has the potential to enhance the production of nuclear weapons occurring at Lucas Heights or anywhere else in Australia? Can the government be more specific in saying what it means by it not being known whether this has the potential for nuclear weapons development when prima facie it does?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech

This includes being appropriately accountable to parliament for the operations of ARPANSA, the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council and committees, providing that the minister and the CEO consult in relation to appointments to the statutory bodies, and ensuring that the CEO applies the principles of best practice in his or her decision making so that Australia remains a world leader in radiation protection and nuclear safety.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech

This is one of those areas where the outcome of the Senate committee inquiry and the tick-tacking backwards and forwards has led to an improvement in the way the legislation has been put together. So as not to delay this Committee of the Whole unnecessarily, I am happy to say that these amendments relate to the compliance monitoring by the Chief Executive Officer of ARPANSA, arrangements about council and committees, and matters about the accountability and the CEO reporting to Parliament. If I am correct, there is agreement that, in order to speed up the debate, and where there is agreement, I can incorporate the Greens explanation as to why 
 these amendments were necessary. I seek leave to do so.
Leave granted.
The explanation read as follows—
SPEECH NOTES FOR GWA AMENDMENT 3 ON SHEET 1183
CEO TO INITIATE PROSECUTION
Clause 14, p10 after line 21 insert (ea) . . . .
This is an amendment to clarify who has responsibility for initiating a prosecution in the event of the most serious breaches of the Act.
It is essentially technical, rather than a matter of principle.
The offences in Part 5 Division 1 relate toe construction and operation of nuclear facilities and prescribed radiation facilities without a license. We acknowledge that it is highly unlikely that a controlled person might construct a nuclear reactor without a license, however prosecution for failure to comply with the conditions of a facility license or a source license is not such a long shot.
While the prohibitions in Division 1 of Part 5 specify the offences, they make no reference to the process by which such prosecutions would be initiated.
Making it a `Function of the CEO' to monitor compliance and recommend prosecution is consistent with the rest of the Bill which creates the role of the CEO as the main regulatory authority. We think this is what would happen in practice anyway but we believe the CEO needs to be specifically authorised to initiate a prosecution.
It is similar in effect to the granting of powers to the CEO to apply to the Federal Court to obtain injunctions (See Section 42) under various circumstances. It does not make sense for the CEO to be able to seek injunction but not have the authority to refer matters for prosecution.
SPEECH NOTES FOR GWA AMENDMENTS 4, 8 & 15 ON SHEET 1183
REPORTING
Clause 19, p12, line 21 add(f); Clause 25, p14, line 27 add(d); Clause 58, p32 after line 12 insert 2a & 2b.
The purpose of these amendments is to strengthen the reporting requirements in the Bill.
The Bill sets up a Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council, A Radiation Health Committee and a Nuclear Safety Committee. Each of these has the role of advising the CEO on various matters. 

This amendment adds a reporting requirement so that the advice to the CEO is formally recorded and included in the CEO's reports to the Minister. We believe this is important because this may be the only way the Parliament gets to hear of minority or dissenting reports (particularly from the community representatives on the Council or Committees).
This will only happen if there is a requirement on them to report to the CEO and for the CEO to be required to include their reports in the CEO Annual reports referred to in Clause 58.
SPEECH NOTES FOR GWA AMENDMENT 6 ON SHEET 1183
ROLE OF COMMITTEE
Clause 22, p13, line 21, end subclause 2
The Radiation Health Committee is charged with `developing policy' and `drafting policy, codes and standards', but it is equally important for the Committee to review from time to time the existing standards to ensure they meet with world's best practice.
This process of review of policies, codes and standards is one, which we believe should be done in the public sphere. There should be a process for identifying priority areas for review, public notice requirements, consultation periods, draft proposals, publication of drafts and so on.
This will allow the Committee to draw on the widest possible range of sources of advice and give the public greater confidence in the outcomes.
The outcomes will, then, be better policies, codes and standards in the nuclear industry and improved protection from the hazards of radiation.

REPORTING
Clause 58, p32 after line 12; Clause 59, p32 after line 19; Clause 60, p33 after line 3.
These amendments each have the effect of specifying categories of matters about which the CEO is required to report, either annually, quarterly or to Parliament.
In summary they are: any breaches of license; reports received from the Council and committees: directions by the Minister to the CEO; and urgent reporting to Parliament of any accident or malfunction at a nuclear installation.
While we would like to see these matters in the Act, an assurance from the Minister that they would be included in the Regulations would probably suffice.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-10,"—I move Australian Democrats amendment No. 3:
(3)	 Clause 57, page 32 (lines 3 to 6), omit the clause, substitute:
57 Staff and consultants
	 (1)	 The staff necessary to assist the CEO are to be persons appointed or employed under the Public Service Act 1922 .
	 (2)	 The CEO has all the powers of or exercisable by, a Secretary under the Public Service Act 1922 , so far as those powers relate to the branch of the Australian Public Service comprising the staff referred to in subsection (1), as if that branch were a separate Department of the Australian Public Service.
	 (3)	 The CEO, on behalf of the Commonwealth, may engage consultants to assist in the performance of any of the CEO's functions.
This amendment relates to the staffing of ARPANSA. It was apparent during the Senate committee inquiry into this piece of legislation that stakeholders are particularly concerned that this agency should be independent. The question of the staffing of the agency was a specific issue for a majority of those people, whether they were community or environmental groups or independent experts present at the committee. We also believe that the staffing of ARPANSA is a vital issue.
If the CEO of the agency relies on the secretary of the department of health for staff, we do not believe it is really credible to claim that the agency is independent of the department. Clearly, the CEO must be able to control the staff of the agency who will ultimately be responsible for the day-to-day work which gives effect to the substance of 
 this legislation. The Democrats were pleased to see that the report of the Senate committee recommended that the CEO be given direct power over the staffing of ARPANSA. I was surprised that this amendment was not one of the government's amendments to this bill, but I am happy to move it on behalf of the Australian Democrats.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—The amendment provides the CEO of ARPANSA with the power over staffing. The government's position is that the bill provides flexibility in staffing and avoids the proliferation of differing industrial relations and other arrangements. It does not affect the independence of the CEO. However, the change to the staffing powers was a recommendation of the Senate committee. While the government does not support such a proposal, it will accept it.

27A  Public interest disclosures
	 Despite any other provisions of this or any other Act, it is not an offence for a member of the Council or a committee established under this Part to disclose any information about 
 radiation protection and nuclear safety if the person:
		 (a)	 has a genuine concern about an issue relating to radiation protection or nuclear safety; and
		 (b)	 has first discussed his or her concerns with the CEO; and
		 (c)	 believes the disclosure is in the public interest.

(18)	 Clause 79, page 47 (lines 4 to 25), omit ""Imprisonment for 2 years"" (wherever occurring), substitute ""30 penalty units"".
The government has indicated that it will not be supporting these amendments, but I will still endeavour to explain them briefly. Amendments Nos 5, 7 and 9 on sheet 1183 relate to prescribed procedures for public consultation. This is still an issue which has not been resolved. It is to give effect to the stated intent of the government following the committee hearing to have a transparent and consultative approach to the appointment of members of the advisory council and committees. By all means, leave the detail to be worked out in the regulations, about which there is still to be further consultation, but let us have this locked in at this stage rather than leave it to the goodwill of the government over the next few months.
Amendment No. 10 relates to public interest disclosures. It is essential that the council and committee structures work effectively. In going onto a council or committee, persons must be responsible to the people to whom they must provide advice (the CEO), to the people who appoint them (in this case the minister), to the rest of council, to the industry which relies on them and, most importantly, to the Australian community who rely on them to be their eyes and ears in the nuclear industry. From time to time—hopefully only rarely—it may be necessary for someone or 
 a number of people in one these councils to break ranks with the orthodoxy of their colleagues.
These committees, honourable senators will remember, are charged with monitoring radiation protection and nuclear safety. There is an obligation to err on the side of caution. We believe that it is necessary to make known concerns so people can make up their own minds and take appropriate action. If someone does have a concern and it is too urgent to wait for the annual or quarterly reports, what can they do? Clearly, they can raise it with the CEO, but more probably they have discussed it at council.
If the concern is genuine and is not shared by the majority or not shared by the CEO, it would be, we believe, in the public interest to disclose it, and this amendment will allow them to do so without fear of prosecution. This is particularly important for the community representatives on the council or committees because they represent a constituency of some kind as well as being council or committee members. The concern may be genuine. The issue has to be first discussed with the CEO and the person must believe the disclosure to be in the public interest. Then and only then can they publicly disclose any information about radiation protection and nuclear safety. If it were not for the culture of secrecy that surrounds and has surrounded this industry, this kind of specific amendment might not be necessary, but there still needs to be a way to move before the communities who have already been associated with industries, such as those associated with ANSTO, can gain that confidence.
Amendment No. 11 relates to public nomination and basically confirms in the bill a commitment given by the government to include in the regulations some process for public consultation before the minister chooses the representatives of the general public or of the community and environmental groups in the case of the committees. It takes that commitment one step further by requiring that the process include some form of nomination from the relevant community. In practice, this could be done by placing an ad in the papers or by contacting relevant local government 
 authorities. How it is done is still a matter for the regulations, but this amendment will ensure that the process of identifying community representatives includes an opportunity for the public to be involved in nominating suitable people. You would not think that would be too difficult.
Amendments Nos 14 and 18 relate to penalties and they highlight an inconsistency in the bill dealing with penalties. Section 40 deals with the power of the CEO to issue directions to a controlled person. There are two occasions on which this applies. The first occasion is where the person is not complying with the act or regulations. When someone is not complying with an act to protect the community from radiation, or when someone is in breach of a regulation about nuclear safety, you might assume that it is a pretty serious matter. Not so, if you go by the penalties of this bill. The second occasion is where the CEO believes a direction is necessary to protect the health and safety of people or to avoid damage to the environment.
The penalties come into play where the CEO's directions are not complied with. Let us consider the seriousness of that. The CEO believes there will be a harm to people if a direction is not carried out. If the person does not carry it out for whatever reason—it is too expensive, it is impractical, tomorrow is a holiday or whatever—what happens next? The penalty is 30 penalty units, which in today's money equates to $3,300. That is hardly a disincentive if the alternative is an expensive upgrade. So then what happens? Under this regime, nothing. There is a power for the CEO to undertake to do those things required if a controlled person will not, but imagine the complications that arise then, not the least being the arguments over cost and who will pay and the difficulty people will have getting information about this at the time.
When we consider that we have a situation where—and we will deal with this in more detail later—a person can be put into prison, according to the government, for two years if they get their warrant wrong, this is way out of proportion. This is an instance where, quite clearly, the community require and need the assurance that there will be some very firm 
 ability to make sure that those people under ARPANSA do feel the necessity to obey the legitimate instructions of the CEO—and this certainly is not good enough.
I do urge the support of the Senate for these amendments.

Other of the Greens amendments would cause significant problems in the operation of the legislation, such as the proposed Greens amendment to clause 27A which proposes that council and committee members may publicly disclose any information that comes before them, including confidential submissions from members of the public and others.
The Greens have also suggested that we change various of the penalty provision under the bill. These have been drafted in consultation with the Attorney-General's Department and are consistent with criminal law policy, where appropriate.

Accordingly, we are not prepared to support the amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—I would add just a little in 
 relation to part 7 of the bill, which deals with the powers of inspection; I mention it in relation to nuclear safety inspectors. This is where we have got way out of kilter with what we want the industry to do compared with the precautionary role we think we should be playing in relation to important nuclear health and safety issues. Part 7 of the bill deals with the powers of inspection—inspections crucial to the monitoring of any installation. Unless you can get in and have a look around, you cannot be sure that the information you are being given is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
But here, remember that we are hearing from the government and the opposition that it is all right if you hold back on the truth and do not allow the community to get it. Unless they can get in and have a look, basically clause 62 requires the inspector to have either the permission of the occupier of the premises or a warrant before going into a controlled facility. This is reasonable enough, I guess. One would expect that in the normal course of events a warrant would not be necessary but from time to time it might be.
Personally, there are other industries where inspectors, if you have a free and open case of health and safety, would not have to get permission or a warrant; that that would be part of their job. So I am not sure that it is reasonable—let us start off with that. I believe that perhaps there should be the powers of inspection and maybe there should be the powers of spot inspection. So we have already created a problem in relation to the powers of spot inspection.
There could be a part of an installation that an inspector wanted to get to or perhaps something in a facility—a computer simulation in a worst case scenario, for instance—which would require a warrant. There are procedures laid out by which an inspector gets such a warrant and they are, as you would expect, quite thorough. They require an inspector to provide information on oath that it is reasonably necessary to gain access to the premises to see whether the act is being complied with. Well, that is all well and good. 
The problem arises when we come to clause 79, which sets out the penalty for making, in an application or a warrant, a statement known to be false or misleading in a material particular. Yes, it would be naughty for an inspector to spin a yarn or beef up a case for a warrant when there was only suspicion to go on, or exaggerate the credibility of a source or information to get access to check it out.
But are we talking about the kind of offence of an overzealous inspector that could or should lead to a two-year imprisonment, or the kind of offence that might be committed by an inspector who is willing to serve the community in the way the community would be expecting him to which has been brought about by a threat or concern? There are, at worst, offences which led to a bit of inconvenience for the operator of a controlled facility; at best, they could lead to the uncovering of otherwise hidden dangers. Either way, they should not incur a two-year gaol term. Compare the seriousness of this offence with the seriousness of the failure to apply with a safety direction, as I mentioned before, of the chief executive officer—a small fine for a person under the law who does something dangerous compared with the maximum of a two-year gaol term for someone who has an exaggerated concern for safety.
Where are we getting at and why is the Labor Party sitting there, allowing this to happen? The priorities are all wrong here. The more severe penalty should be for unsafe practices, for failing to put dangerous situations right—and not for the safety inspector. We are trying to have the regime administered by ARPANSA to be one that encourages a culture of safety in the nuclear industry. These penalties send the wrong message entirely and have had the effect of putting a muzzle on the inspectors before they even get started.
During the committee, one of the issues raised was: what kind of notice was given in relation to things like the regulations involved that are attached to this legislation? The answer was that there has been substantial consultation in relation to the industry. So, in effect, one of the major industries that we are 
 attempting to regulate in Australia—and that is ANSTO—has been in there, helping to draft the legislation and the regulations. Is it any surprise to anybody that they have written in to have greater penalties for inspectors than for themselves? Of course not.
It is time that the parliament of this place realised that that is not an acceptable practice to be taken by those groups, and we would never accept it under any other circumstances. We realise that, in the Australian situation, we have become, or allowed ourselves to become, dependent on ANSTO for advice on nuclear issues.
This is what we are trying to move away from—to have an independent body. I wonder, with the acting CEO of ARPANSA being in the chamber giving advice to the minister, how independent that has become.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—If fraud is covered in the Crimes Act—and I am sure it is—then I am sure the Crimes Act is quite capable of handling fraud. We are dealing with intimidation and, in this case, intimidation should not be written in legislation in respect of people who have a precautionary principle role. They should not be intimidated when they have reasonable concerns. They should not be worried about putting those reasonable concerns on a warrant in case they may have got something wrong or in case a rumour turns out to be incorrect. If I were on an aircraft, would I want somebody to be threatened with imprisonment for following a precautionary principle if a small light indicated that something was not working? Quite frankly, if I were in 
 that aircraft, I would want them to check out the light. Even if they, in every intellectual way, knew nothing was wrong, I would want them to check out the light, and that is what the community would want as well.

These amendments, as I explained in my speech in the second reading debate, relate to accountability and transparency. They are not unlike amendments that the Democrats move on a number of occasions where boards such as this are involved. As I noted in my speech, Senator Andrew Murray, who is the Democrats accountability spokesperson, most recently moved similar amendments to the operation of the Wheat Marketing Board. It is part of our concern that we restore faith in governments, our boards and the parliamentary processes for the community, and that means appointments are not to be based on mateship or nepotism but directly and only on merit.
I cited in the second reading debate the experiences of the United Kingdom and its 
 Nolan committee, which has also sought to overhaul and redress ministerial and other appointments in the UK. It is something that the Democrats have sought to do a number of times here in Australia. We will continue to move amendments of this nature.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-10,"—On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that we will not be supporting the amendments. As Senator Stott Despoja correctly pointed out, this is a fairly standard set of amendments that have been moved on a number of occasions by the Democrats, particularly Senator Murray, in respect of other legislation. We have outlined on previous occasions our reasons for not supporting amendments, and on this occasion we will adopt the same approach.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—We have taken note of the comments made by Senator Stott Despoja. However, the government does not support the Democrats' proposed amendments to clauses 20, 23, 26 and at the end of part 4.
These amendments are twofold. Firstly, they provide that a member of the council or committees should not be appointed except in accordance with the code of practice under section 28A, which describes a very complex procedure. Secondly, the amendments require the minister or the CEO to ensure there is a balance of interests on the council and the committees, and that no single interest dominates these bodies. I understand that the Democrats are on a crusade to try to control government appointments from the Senate. The government will not be supporting the Democrats' proposal to establish this complex and unnecessary vetting system.
The government amendments moved earlier in this debate ensure there will be appropriate consultation before the appointment of any members to the council or committees. However, anything that moves beyond this mechanism usurps the legitimate right of the government of the day to make its own decisions regarding appointments and to be accountable for them.
With regard to clause 20—as I referred earlier in relation to this block of amendments proposed by the Democrats—the government believes that the proposed amendment to clause 20 undermines the legitimate right of the government of the day to appoint members to advisory bodies such as these. The government is, of course, committed to consulting appropriately and has demonstrated this by including relevant provision in the legislation. In respect of clause 23, the Democrats are proposing the same procedure for the appointment of committee members as they proposed for the council. The government opposes these changes on exactly the same grounds.
With regard to clause 26, the Democrats are proposing the same procedure for appointment of committee members as they proposed for the council. Again, the government opposes these changes on the same grounds. At the end of part 4, the Democrats are proposing the insertion of an additional section, which describes procedures for appointments of members as previously discussed. As the government does not support the proposal in relation to this appointment process, it does not support this further amendment either.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-10,"—I thank the opposition and the government for outlining their reasons for rejecting the Democrat amendments. I express my disappointment that they are not willing to support amendments which we see as providing clarity, transparency and accountability. If the parliamentary secretary believes that we are on some kind of crusade, well so be it. I suppose the Democrats are associated with keeping various groups and parties honest, if you like. We see it as still very much a part of our mandate, to use that oft bandied around word. The government talks about a legitimate right to make appointments and says that the government should be accountable for those appointments. That is exactly what we are suggesting—that there be increased mechanisms that ensure that governments are accountable for those appointments and that they explain those appointments.
The government's reference to the procedure for the appointment of members and its dismissal of that is quite discouraging. While it may be claimed that it is a complex process, the general principles that we outlined on which appointments can be made include merit, independent scrutiny of appointments, probity, and openness and transparency. I hardly think that those principles are incredibly challenging for any government. We simply seek to enshrine not only in this legislation but in other legislation these very general and appropriate principles which we believe would be to the benefit of any organisation. If you have a system of appointment on principles of merit, independent scrutiny probity, and openness and transparency, those principles are to the benefit of any organisation. I express again my disappointment that the amendments have been rejected by both parties.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—by leave—I move Greens (WA) amendments Nos 12 and 13:
(12)	 Clause 31, page 19 (line 4), omit ""The CEO"", substitute ""Subject to this section, the CEO"".
(13)	 Clause 31, page 19 (after line 11), at the end of the clause, add:
	 (4)	 The CEO must not issue a licence to a controlled person to construct or decommission a nuclear installation unless all of the following steps have occurred:
		 (a)	 the Minister has caused to be established in the prescribed form a public inquiry into the need for the construction or decommissioning of the nuclear installation;
		 (b)	 the public inquiry recommends that the construction of or decommissioning of the nuclear installation is necessary; 

		 (c)	 an environmental impact assessment of the proposed construction of decommissioning of the nuclear installation has been undertaken;
		 (d)	 the environmental impact assessment concludes that the construction or decommissioning of the nuclear installation is unlikely to have a significant, adverse environmental impact.
	 (5)	 The environmental impact assessment mentioned in subsection (4) is to be undertaken in accordance with the procedures set out in the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 .
These amendments go to the heart of accountability in relation to new installations. Clause 31 empowers the Chief Executive Officer of ARPANSA to license a nuclear installation. In order for this to be anything like acceptable to the Greens, there need to be some changes. For indications of community concern about nuclear issues you only have to look at what has come up recently in the public eye and the level of concern that was unleashed by the video last week outlining the plans of a private company, Pangea, to turn Australia into the world's waste dump for high level nuclear waste.
I saw an article today in the West Australian newspaper regarding Hendy Cowan, the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, who did speak to representatives from Pangea. When I read his words very carefully I realised that they did not actually rule out Australia accepting nuclear waste from other countries' nuclear power stations or imply that he was against that. We are talking about enriched uranium or reactor cores. What he said was that it would be difficult for Australia to accept nuclear waste from countries to which we had not supplied uranium. When you translate that, it means that the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, a National Party Deputy Premier, has said that it would be reasonable—and I am paraphrasing here—for Australia to take nuclear waste from reactors from other countries so long as we have supplied the uranium. That leaves us pretty open. He is saying that if we have exported uranium we should be prepared to accept the nuclear waste.
So whilst we have had various statements from the federal minister saying what we will not do, when you scratch a little deeper about what has or hasn't been said at the state level, we are not looking at a fantasy scenario; we are hearing in the public arena the Deputy Premier of Western Australia say that nuclear waste would not be acceptable if we have not exported the uranium. How much uranium has Australia supplied over time? What does that potentially mean in terms of sheer volume of high level and medium level nuclear waste, including plutonium, enriched reactor cores and so on? What does that mean in terms of what could happen in the future?
The community wants some say in regard to scrutiny in the nuclear industry—for example, the existing research reactor at Lucas Heights. We have noticed that the minister never answered that question from Senator Brown about the new technology being researched there. Even in the context of this current bill, how can they have that confidence when we know there is that wave of secrecy over here? There was no advertising in relation to the Senate committee on this bill because it was a short committee. We were able to get a number of people to express concerns.
The amendments recognise that the community is interested—and has a legitimate interest—when any new installation is being considered. If you do not think the community of Australia is interested, just try any community in Australia and say: `By the way, you are going to make lots and lots of money out of being an international waste dump' and see what happens.
As the bill stands at the moment, the CEO of ARPANSA can licence a new nuclear installation with a minimum of fuss. This is clearly not sufficient. It is especially not sufficient when you consider that the definition of a nuclear installation includes a number of issues like nuclear reactors, nuclear filled storage facilities and nuclear filled fabrication plants.
We would like to see the strictest possible licensing and monitoring regime to make sure that it is as safe as it can possibly be. This amendment seeks to put commonsense pre 
 conditions into the legislation so that licensing is not seen as some sort of short circuit, a quick and dirty way of getting nuclear installations authorised. This amendment seeks to ensure that the stages have been gone through before the licensing process starts. It is carefully constructed so that it does not involve the CEO in policy matters about whether there should be this or that installation. It does not involve the CEO at all in any of the matters which should be the subject of public debate. It simply says that the CEO must not issue a licence unless the minister has set up such an inquiry and the need has been demonstrated.
At that stage, the normal environmental impact assessment process cuts in, and if there is not likely to be a significant adverse environmental impact then the CEO can proceed with the licence process. The effect of this will be to stop the issue of a licence unless the minister has set up an inquiry into the need for the installation. If there is a need, there is an environmental impact assessment, and it is unlikely to have adverse impact. Some of this includes matters which may well be the province of other legislation, especially the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. However, the need for the inquiry is new.
It should probably go into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998. In the absence of current legislation, the only way to ensure such an inquiry is done is to have it referred as a prerequisite to licensing in the ARPANSA bill. I urge the Senate to support these amendments. I indicate in advance that we will seek to divide on this issue, because quite frankly we do not know where the Senate stands on this issue, and it is important to put it on the record.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The opposition will support amendments Nos 12 and 13 moved by Senator Margetts. We have an amendment on the running sheet which substantially seeks to do the same thing—that is, to ensure that there is a process in this legislation whereby any  decision to construct a major nuclear installation would be the subject of a public inquiry or an independent inquiry.
In our amendment we proposed that the Chief Executive Officer of ARPANSA would not be permitted to issue a licence pursuant to this section unless, firstly, the CEO had obtained from the minister a certificate in the minister's opinion having regard to the objects of the act that there was a need for the nuclear installation and, further, such certificate must not be issued unless there was either an independent inquiry or a public inquiry pursuant to section 11 of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Senator Margetts has put forward a proposition which certainly has the same intended result but which is in a different form. Whilst there are some subtle differences between the two, the end result is the same as that which we have been seeking to achieve.
The need for this is self-evident. Anybody who understands what is happening within the nuclear industry in this country today recognises that the government has made a decision to build a new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights to replace the current HIFAR reactor due to be decommissioned in about 2003. The government has made that decision without any proper consideration of the views of the scientific community, the medical community or the wider community, particularly the community of the surrounding areas of the Sutherland shire.
I appreciate that there is a major debate as to whether or not Australia needs another nuclear research reactor. The Labor Party has made it clear that that is a matter still to be properly resolved. There are arguments for and against the proposition. For instance, it is argued that we should have another reactor to replace HIFAR; that the best place and the cheapest place to put it is where the current reactor is; that it has a value with respect to the manufacture of medical radio isotopes; and that it is in Australia's national interest. That is a very brief potted summary of those who support the proposition.
There are some within ANSTO, I would suggest, who support the proposition simply because it means that ANSTO as an organisation will continue in perpetuity into the future. It guarantees they have another reactor to operate and, consequently, a large injection 
 well in excess of $400 million or $500 million of public funding over the next 40 years. The argument that we should have one because we already have one is one that some people support, notwithstanding what the merits of the case might be.
There are arguments from people within the local community who believe that, if we are going to have another nuclear reactor in this country, it should be located well away from any suburban residential area. The area around Lucas Heights is not the same as it was 40 years ago, when the establishment was built. It is no longer remote bushland some reasonable distance or long distance away from the city of Sydney. It is within about three to four kilometres of a thriving, growing part of the Sydney metropolitan region, with a population in excess of 150,000. If there was not a nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights today, no government in its right mind would contemplate putting one in that location. The fact that there is already one there is not of itself a reason why it is the best site for a reactor in the future.
I wanted to particularly address my remarks to the issue of why we need a public inquiry process. The 1993 Research Reactor Review, the McKinnon review, which I have referred to earlier in this debate, concluded that there were a range of issues that should be resolved before any positive decision for the new reactor was made. I quote from the conclusions of the report. It said:
If, at the end of a further period of about five years,
. a high level waste site has been firmly identified and work started on proving its suitability
. there is no evidence that spallation technology can economically offer as much as or more than a new reactor
. there has been no practical initiation of a cyclotron anywhere worldwide to produce technetium-99m
. there is good evidence of strong and diverse applications of neutron scattering capability in Australian science, including many young scientists, and a complex of industrial uses
. the national interest remains a high priority
it would be appropriate to make a positive decision on a new reactor. The most suitable site would need to be identified. 

If any one of these onerous requirements is not met, either a negative decision, or a decision to delay further, would be indicated.
That was the report of the Research Reactor Review issued in August 1993. What that report said was that, if any of those very onerous conditions were not met within five years—it is appropriately just on five years since that report was handed down—a decision should not be made to build a new reactor or, at the very least, it should be delayed. But this government ignored the recommendations and conclusions of the McKinnon review. It made a decision to build a new reactor at Lucas Heights. In one of the most cynical political exercises I have ever witnessed, it announced that decision on the very day that it announced to the community of the Sutherland Shire and southern Sydney that it was not going to build the proposed airport at Holsworthy. It was a bit of good news, bad news. As I said, it was a highly cynical approach.
Efforts to obtain information from this government as to what alternative sites were being considered by the government have been refused on the grounds of cabinet confidentiality. There has been no proper assessment made, as Professor McKinnon called for in his report, about the value of alternative technologies such as spallation technology. There has certainly been no decision made about the suitability of any site to take high level waste.
The report recognises, despite what ANSTO might say and despite what the government might say, that there is high level waste stored at Lucas Heights. Recent proposals by the government to ship that waste overseas have come to nought because of decisions made in Dounreay in Scotland that they are not prepared to take that waste. So there is clearly a major gap to be filled in terms of what is ultimately going to be the approach adopted in dealing with the waste currently stored at Lucas Heights.
Frankly, the position we have is that this government has proceeded to make decisions contrary to the recommendations of that very thorough inquiry and has done it in a most cynical way with minimal consultation with 
 local government bodies in the area and the community generally. It is a major decision to build another nuclear reactor in this country. Whatever one's view—whether one supports it or does not—it is appropriate that it be subject to the most vigorous scrutiny, and not just by an environmental impact statement.
Frankly, most people have absolutely no faith in environmental impact statements anymore. We all know that about 99 per cent of proposals subject to an EIS eventually get approved. People have very little faith in the process that has been undertaken for the EIS to this point in time. It has been subject to very severe criticism by the Sutherland Shire Council and internationally recognised consultants they have engaged. It has been subject to severe criticism by Environment Australia itself.
For instance, there is no design for the new reactor even on the table at the present time. So one wonders how an EIS could be properly conducted. But, in any event, there still needs to be a proper public inquiry before any such decision is made. We believe that such a major issue involving the expenditure of $500 million or more which commits this nation and particularly that area to the existence of another reactor for the next 40 years, on top of the decommissioning of the existing reactors, is such a serious issue that it should be considered by a public inquiry.
These things do not come along every day of the week. That is what the provisions of the Environment Protection Act are specifically there for—that is, section 11 for the conduct of public inquiries. I am advised that there have only been some four inquiries conducted under that act since it was enacted. At least two of those related to most serious issues. The very first one was the Ranger inquiry conducted by Justice Fox, known as the Fox inquiry. The second one was the inquiry into sandmining on Fraser Island. Both of those are major issues of environmental significance, public health and safety significance and so on. We believe this is a similar case.
The issue has been raised as to the potential for major waste reprocessing facilities. We are 
 very disappointed with the attitude the government adopted in respect of an earlier amendment. We support very strongly the proposals contained in the Greens (WA) amendments. As I said, they reflect the intention of our amendment; that is, before any major nuclear installation, such as a new reactor at Lucas Heights or any others that may be contemplated—we hope they will not be—it should be subject to the most thorough scrutiny, including provisions for a public inquiry. We support the amendments.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-10,"—On behalf of the Democrats, I support the amendments moved by the Greens (WA). For many of the reasons outlined by Senators Forshaw and Margetts, the Democrats support these amendments. We believe that the concept of needs assessment is a particularly positive one, as are the environmental impact assessments that are often undertaken.
Our concerns have been on record for a long time now about the concept of a new nuclear reactor, not a replacement reactor, at Lucas Heights. For that reason, my party is opposing that particular reactor for a number of reasons, apart from environmental and health hazards—lack of community consultation, not to mention lack of scientific consultation. This is also the single biggest amount of money ever allocated from the Australian science budget. I believe it was done so with minimal—negligible—consultation with the chief scientist.
Our views are very much on record. I look forward to hearing from other senators in this place—from opposition as well as government senators—as the debate rages further as to what their views are when it comes to the Lucas Heights reactor. We certainly support the amendments before the chair.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—The Greens (WA) amendments propose that a new and additional process of public inquiry be instigated which must demonstrate the need for a nuclear installation before the CEO makes any licensing decision for that installa 
 tion. The first point to make is that the purpose of the bill is to provide for the safety of nuclear facilities and use of radiation when the government and the community have decided that such facilities are needed.
This legislation is not the place to try to change the ways in which proposals are assessed and proceed. The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act still applies, and it can be expected that any substantial proposal would invoke the procedures under this act. Further, as was the case with the proposed replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights, substantial proposals for nuclear facilities will be assessed over a period of time in ways in which the government of the day considers appropriate. Second, it is clear that the real purpose of these amendments, and those proposed by the ALP, is to delay the replacement research reactor project.
Whilst I noted Senator Forshaw's comments—and I know his particular personal residential interest and genuine interest as a New South Wales senator—it is also important to note the comments of the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Gareth Evans, on 11 May 1998 when, in correspondence, he said, on the new reactor: 
I am afraid that the realities of politics in an election year, and in particular our need to win Hughes, have led us to a position of opposing a new reactor at the Lucas Heights site—as difficult that may be to justify in objective safety-focused terms.
I also note the degree of cynicism in many of Senator Forshaw's comments. This project has been assessed exhaustively, including through the Australian Science and Technology Engineering Council inquiry in 1992, the McKinnon report into the need for a replacement reactor in 1993, the current environmental impact statement and the current Senate Economic References Committee inquiry. The government absolutely refuses to implement a further resource intensive, wasteful process, which is nothing more than an underhand attempt by opposition parties to further delay key government initiatives.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—I do not wish to delay this 
 debate more than is necessary. The minister said when the `government and the community' deems it necessary. Quite clearly, from what Senator Forshaw said, that has not been proved. The McKinnon report said exactly that it was necessary to establish the need, and that has not been established. The government has not done it. None of the processes that have taken place have done it. It is not an accountable process. There is a lot of money involved in this, apart from anything else. We are dealing with community health and safety, which cannot and should not be rushed in terms of that.
If there has been no demonstrated need, why are we getting into it, except that some people involved with ANSTO think this is the way for Australia to be involved in the international fora on nuclear issues. That is not good enough, Minister. It is not good enough to make a decision on this basis. How dare we point at India and Pakistan and say, `Your argument that you want to be considered part of the international community is irrelevant.' We are doing the same thing here—even the concept that Australia should be contemplating continuing to have a nuclear reactor because we get to sit in on the international atomic debates!
We are pointing the finger at India and Pakistan saying, `Don't continue your nuclear testing. This is not going to make you an important nation.' But we are doing the same thing in Australia by continuing to have some form of nuclear reactor because that gives us a seat at the table with the big guys. It is ridiculous. It is puerile, and it is not the basis upon which we should get into it when there is no demonstrated need.
	 Question put:

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-12-10,"—by leave—On behalf of the Democrats, I move amendments Nos 1 and 2:
(1)	 Clause 31, page 19 (line 4), omit ""The CEO"", substitute ""Subject to this section, the CEO"".
(2)	 Clause 31, page 19 (after line 11), at the end of the clause, add:
	 (4)	 The CEO must not issue a licence to a controlled person that authorises persons to do some or all of the things referred to in subsection 29(1) in connection with a 
 nuclear waste storage or disposal facility operated for commercial purposes.
	 (5)	 It is the intention of the Parliament that subsection (4) has effect to the extent possible under the Constitution.
These amendments relate to the issuing of licences. I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate that we, like all members in this place—and I suspect a number of people in the community—were quite concerned to see that recent promotional video that was produced by Pangea Resources nominating Australia as the best country in the world to store high level nuclear waste.
We were also disturbed by the assertions by members of that organisation that they had had meetings with ministers. Again I acknowledge that federal ministers in this government have not been involved in those meetings. Certainly, we had an assurance from Senator Nick Minchin in question time when the Democrats asked questions about this issue. The statement given by the minister was unequivocal. He said:
. . . no high level radioactive waste facility is planned for Australia and the government has absolutely no intention of accepting the radioactive waste of other countries.
The Democrats welcomed that assertion by the government and the minister and, of course, his further claim that government policy was clear on this and that it would not be changed. I indicated that we would be seeking to enshrine this commitment in legislation. That is the purpose behind these amendments—essentially, to protect members of the community from the harms associated with any commercial nuclear waste disposal facility. I commend the amendments to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—I seek a little point of clarification—and perhaps the parliamentary secretary can make a clear and unequivocal comment. If Australia sells uranium to another country and that uranium is used in the nuclear cycle, say, in a nuclear reactor, is the radioactive waste from that reactor the waste of another country or could it technically be considered the waste created by Australia?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—With regard to the comment just raised by Senator Margetts, I am advised that it is the waste of another country. With regard to comments made by Senator Stott Despoja, the Democrats' amendments provide that the CEO must not issue a facility licence in connection with a nuclear waste storage or disposal facility operated for commercial purposes. The purpose of this bill is to regulate all Commonwealth radiation and nuclear activities. The issue whether an activity is commercial or not is completely irrelevant. Further, the meaning of the term `commercial' is not defined and could be expected to impinge on the government's capacity to appropriately recover the costs associated with, for example, any waste repository.
By opposing the amendments, the government is ensuring that, regardless of the commercial footing of any activity, it will be controlled and regulated—a significant improvement on the current situation. I also wish to reiterate Senator Minchin's comments in this chamber that it is not government policy and will not be government policy to accept radioactive waste from other countries.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech

I also thank him for outlining why he will not be supporting the amendments, although I understand that we have revised and changed these amendments in order to ensure that there are no constitutional difficulties with these amendments. I understand that subclause (5) of amendment No. 2 in relation to clause 31 has that intention in mind.
So there are no constitutional impediments to agreeing to such amendments.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—I reiterate the comments of both Senator Hill and Senator Minchin in the last week or so. Both have given unequivocal commitments of the government. Senator Hill said:
. . . the government is under no pressure; furthermore, it is not intending to build a facility for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste.
And Senator Minchin said in answer to a question:
. . . I think going back before we came into government—on the general issue of radioactive waste management, but those discussions have always been clearly on the premise that it is not government policy and will not be government policy to accept radioactive waste from other countries nor to accept high level radioactive waste.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—Most people obviously wanted to get those kinds of assurances. However, we did get similar assurances on the GST. When is `never', `never ever', `will not' or `won't ever'? We know there are times when policies change. The Australian Democrats are asking—and I am supporting this—if `ever', `never ever' or `won't be' ever changes to `will', `maybe' or `well circumstances have changed'—and that does happen, we know it does; we have seen it happen with the GST—then there will need to be a change in the legislation. That is not unreasonable.
Why the government would not accept that, if they were going to change that major policy area they would have to make a change to legislation, I do not know—except that they want to leave that door open. And that is exactly what they are doing.

I do not think Senator Forshaw feels that it was answered specifically—I do not know what the head nodding means. The government has reiterated a commitment not to make Australia a nuclear waste dump. I am wondering whether the parliamentary secretary could answer specifically: would this leave the door open? I am interested in the legal implications of this amendment being defeated. Does it not allow those commercial dumps, if you like, to come into this country? I am just wondering whether it leaves the door open legally—not whether or not the government has a particular policy at this stage because, as Senator Margetts has stated, that can be changed pretty much at the whim of government.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech

We do not think that is good enough and we will support the amendments.

(1)	 The CEO must not issue a licence under section 31 for a nuclear installation unless the CEO has obtained from the Minister a certificate that, in the Minister's opinion, having regard to the objects of this Act, there is a need for the nuclear installation.
(2)	 The Minister must not issue a certificate under subsection (1) without first causing to be held: 

	 (a)	 an independent inquiry into the need for the nuclear installation; or
	 (b)	 a public inquiry under section 11 of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 .
(3)	 In this section:
 independent public inquiry  means an inquiry undertaken by persons who:

I do not need to go through all the arguments. They were put in respect of the Greens amendment earlier.
While I am on my feet, I wish to respond to a rather cheap shot from Senator Tambling. It was something to do with declaring a residential interest. Everyone in this chamber knows that I happen to live within a reasonable proximity of the Lucas Heights reactor. If I need to declare that again, I will.

These are simple amendments. They include the category of decommissioning amongst those areas which should receive full assessment and consultation. Basically, they are an extension to the categories included in the ALP's amendment. I am pleased to see that the ALP seems to think that is acceptable. It originally had just the provision of a new reactor facility. We have agreed that the 
 decommissioning is a major event and must be done with great care and consultation, so an inquiry should be involved in it.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-10,"—It may have been thought from comments that I have made over recent weeks that I have some sort of opposition to the health funds in the private health system. I have some questions about them, as I have questions about the public health system, but I am not ideologically opposed to the dual system, provided it is fair and properly run. I am becoming less confident in the funds as a result of their inane campaign which was run recently. I am less confident in their capabilities. But, because it is usual to do so, I need to declare that I am a member of a health fund and have been for 40 years. I understand how people feel when they are struggling on a very insufficient income to try to keep up the payments—even then it was difficult.
Let me come to the package of legislation itself. The rebate proposal does not go far enough to meet sound public policy requirements. There is no evidence by any modelling that has been presented to us that that proposed rebate will work and achieve the objectives of the government; in other words, there are no guarantees that it will work. There are no guarantees that premiums will not rise—in fact, we have heard that premiums will rise next year. There are no guarantees that the rebate will not get gobbled up in the payment of extra costs created by specialist doctors, operating on private patients in private or, indeed, in public hospitals.
There are no guarantees about anything, except that 70 per cent of the taxpayers of Australia will contribute to delivering an amount of $5.4 billion to assist the other 30 per cent of the population who are privately insured—though I suppose 100 per cent, if you like, will do that, rather than the 70 per cent. There are no guarantees that the 30 per cent rebate will result in the eradication of extra medical fees beyond the insured costs—those medical out-of-pocket expenses which are very much the concern of fund members.
Honourable senators will know from their own experience that the two major complaints of fund members are the ever increasing premiums and the extra charges in costs they are hit with once, after having been in hospital, they get home. Once they get home, in 
 come the bills, one after the other; it also might be that even three or four months later a bill comes in. Multiple medical fees not only are aggravating but also leave many patients with onerous bills.
This legislation does nothing to address this problem. Many of the elderly who are treated in private hospitals could be cared for in other more suitable settings, such as convalescence and rehabilitation services. The coordination of better health care services should be associated with a measure like the one that is before us today, the rebate. Then health insurance could be more user friendly, particularly for the elderly and chronically ill.
There are no guarantees that health funds will not continue to raise their premiums after the introduction of this package of legislation containing this rebate. This begs the question of whether the rebate is in the interests of the members or administration of the funds. The government has not been able to encourage health funds and doctors to strike effective arrangements to eliminate out-of-pocket fees and set premiums. There are some examples of where this has been achieved, and honourable senators during debate have been informed of those by various government senators—and I acknowledge that.
The government maintains that the rebate will help reduce public hospital waiting lists; yet there is no guarantee that this will occur. In fact, there is no guarantee that privately insured patients will not enter public hospitals; they have that right. And I guess that, if nothing is done about the gap, there will be more and more privately insured people—that is, members of health funds—going into public hospitals so as to avoid those out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time low income elderly people who cannot afford insurance are resigned to waiting on public hospital lists for treatment. The government should seriously consider instigating a special program to meet these needs.
Madam Acting Deputy President, I must say that I stand before you in a somewhat difficult situation. The speech I have given thus far was going to come to certain conclusions which perhaps do not reflect discussions that have taken place today. I point out again that 
 the government—and I have indicated this previously—should seriously consider instigating a special program to meet the needs of low income elderly people who cannot afford insurance, including their need to have quicker access to hospital and other health services. It is conceivable that such a program, conducted along with a rebate scheme, could reduce public hospital demand and better meet the needs of the elderly in particular.
The government should consider some way to ensure that health funds move towards the elimination of gaps. I will move an amendment, which is currently being drafted, to go some way towards that particular objective—and I apologise to honourable senators that that is not as yet ready to be distributed. It is a simple amendment that will give an incentive to health insurance funds to come to agreements with hospitals and doctors for that purpose.
There should be an attempt to address the burden of unknown medical fees, so the proposal I am going to present to the Senate will include the not known aspect. For many patients, procedures are performed on them not knowing what the gap is, not knowing that it will cost far more than what Medicare provides or what their health insurance funds provide.
I must say that we are extremely fortunate that Australia is blessed with a highly qualified and dedicated medical profession. I appreciate that private health care has developed under a fee-for-service system. I also appreciate the value of the doctor-patient relationship and its intimate role in quality health care. However, it is incumbent upon the medical profession to understand that the lack of attractiveness of health insurance also rests with some of their number charging unreasonable fees.
I understand that there are no easy answers to these problems. However, the solution proposed by the government in this legislation does not go far enough—it needs to go further. A 30 per cent rebate for the purchase of health insurance has merit if it is associated with other tangible measures which will alleviate the demand on public hospitals, do something practicable for the health of the 
 elderly and lead to the elimination of out-of-pocket expenses, out-of-pocket fees.
I have concerns that the elderly, particularly the chronically ill, need a better coordination of their services, and their complex needs must have greater attention from our general practitioners. I am particularly concerned that low income, uninsured elderly people have little choice but to wait on the public sector lists for urgent care. We need to do more to ensure access for them to services in both hospitals and convalescent home care.
I am particularly perturbed by the lack of progress on out-of-pocket expenses and believe a more concerted effort by government and the private health sector is needed. The rebate proposals need to be advanced only if real reforms on these other measures are actively progressed. I do hope that, during the course of this debate, there will be an indication by the government of precisely that. At this stage, I am prepared to support the bill into the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—At the outset, let me declare a personal interest of 37 years of holding private health insurance. At the same time, let me also reflect on the last 10 months. As many of my colleagues in this place will know, I had heart surgery in August and that required extensive financial support and obligation from many people, and I appreciate their assistance. There were eight specialists, two GPs, many pathologists, X-Rays, echocardiograms, angiograms, et cetera. But in financial terms, at the end of the day, my 10 months has cost $30,378. It is very important to note that the health insurance contribution to that was $21,284; Medicare, $7,135; and the gap, to which Senator Harradine has just referred, $1,959. In all, some 134 services were rendered to me in the course of this year, and it is very important to note that principal of $21,284 met by my private health insurers that otherwise would have been met by the public purse, and without the degree of choice that I did enjoy under the circumstances I had.
The government is committed to maintaining a balance between public and private 
 sector health so that Australians have a choice when it comes to health care that is fair, affordable, customer-friendly and good value for money. The  Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998  and related bills allow for all members of private health funds to be eligible for a rebate of 30 per cent of the cost of their health insurance contributions. For example, a family with an annual health insurance contribution of $2,000 will be  entitled to a rebate of $600. This policy was taken to the recent election by the Howard government and roundly endorsed.
It is ironic that, after two decades of seeking to keep the bastards honest, the Australian Democrats are now seeking to prevent the government from honouring this commitment. They have lost their perspective of what honesty is all about and have become captives of political bastardry themselves. It is also ironic to see the Australian Labor Party carping on about gaps and billing for private health insurance, after spending 13 years doing nothing. Talk about political hypocrisy. The ALP have shown their hand as nothing but poker card players.
The Australian Private Hospital Association has said that without private hospitals the public system would have to treat an extra 1.8 million patients per year, perform twice as much surgery as now, provide 23,000 more beds and require $3.5 billion extra funding every year. If private health insurance participation declines further, the public system will have to provide more and more of the services and care that the private sector is providing. The ALP and the Democrats have conspired to wipe out that great Australian value of individual choice from the people they purport to represent.
The current trend shows that private health insurance will decline to around 20 per cent by the end of the current Australian health care agreement. This dreadful scenario would cost the government an additional $2.5 billion over the life of these agreements. Even more damaging to the bottom line is the fact that the base for the new agreements would be $5 billion more than the current agreements.
The alternative being offered by the coalition is to support choice, support quality care 
 and support private health care to continue the balanced health system that has served Australia so well. It is important that we note the issues that have been raised in this debate, particularly those that have been raised this evening by Senator Harradine. The government has undeniably done more to reduce the incidence of medical gap fees than any other government. I know that Minister Wooldridge is currently embarked on a major campaign with a number of issues to advance that important area.
Senator Crossin got it very wrong the other evening about the Northern Territory. She did not focus on the impact of this legislation on people who live in rural and remote parts of Australia. This is one of the most important tenets of this legislation. There is so much that needs to be offered for all of these people to get the balance right. People who come from rural and remote areas often need access to special services, not in their own area but in other areas. They need the reimbursement that private health insurance can offer to so many of them. And those people living in the bush are not rich.
The constitution of Australia prohibits any government's control of doctors' fees. However, through encouraging negotiation and partnerships between doctors and hospitals and health funds we have produced the first successes ever achieved in this area, for which Dr Wooldridge can take the credit. Legislation has been introduced to allow health funds, hospitals and doctors to negotiate over the entire medical fee, including any charges above the medical benefits schedule. The promotion of simplified billing has been a major lever in changing the culture of doctors, who are now recognising the importance of providing a better service to their patients. Labor did nothing during their 13 years to address the gaps. We certainly have, and some of the initiatives proposed by Senator Harradine tonight will go a long way in that regard.
I acknowledge that more needs to be done. We will continue to work hard to promote these issues, despite the moaning and the carping of those opposite. In summary, these bills provide for sensible incentives to com 
 plement recent and upcoming structural reform. The government's 30 per cent rebate makes sense economically, supports the choice that is one of the strengths of the great Australian health system and is expected by the Australian electorate.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1,speech

		 (c)	 if at any time during the financial year the person covered by the policy is a dependent child—$50,000.
4-7  Income test—policies covering more than one person
	 (1)	 If the policy covers more than one person, the income test is satisfied in respect of the financial year in question if the sum of the taxable incomes of all of the persons whose incomes are required by subsection (2) to be taken into account is less than the maximum amount under subsection (4)
		 Note:	 For taxable income, see section 4-8.
	 (2)	 The persons whose incomes are to be taken into account are:
		 (a)	 each person covered by the policy who is not a *dependent child during the financial year; and

			 (i)	 the parent, or his or her partner, made one or more payments of premiums in respect of the policy; or
			 (ii)	 a person (other than a parent of the dependent child or the partner (if any) of that parent) made one or more such payments, under an arrangement entered into with the parent or partner.

(2)	 Clause 10-5, page 18 (after line 6), before paragraph (a), insert: 

		 (aa)	 you satisfy the income test under section 4-6 or 4-7 (whichever is applicable) in respect of that year; and

		 (b)	 you satisfy the income test under section 4-6 or 4-7 (whichever is applicable) in respect of that year;
Most of these issues were covered fairly thoroughly as we went through the second reading stage. We must reach some reasonable compromise on this legislation. It would be the Democrats' preference that we did not support private health through this mechanism, but this is one the government has chosen so we will try to make the best we possibly can out of it. By means testing this in this way would mean that roughly half of this extraordinary amount of money, about $1½ billion a year on average, would be able to be directed into the public system. At least if we could not make the government put it into the public system, we would actually make a reasonable saving so that hopefully, when it came to budget time, their consciences would dictate that that money be directed into things such as the dental health program, rural health and public hospital waiting lists.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I want to make a contribution at the beginning of the committee stage of this debate about the way the committee stage is to be handled. I think a number of senators, certainly opposition senators, would have noticed that Senator Herron, who is the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, apparently is not going to handle the committee stage of this debate. Perhaps Senator Tambling can indicate whether he is going to handle it for the government. Senator Tambling, the parliamentary secretary, nods. So I assume that means he is going to 
 handle this. I think this is a very concerning development indeed.
—It is not concerning that Senator Tambling is handling it.
—No. Senator Ray, if you would allow me the courtesy—
—Senator Ray, if you would cease interjecting and, Senator Faulkner, if you would address the chair.
—Thank you for your protection, Madam Chairman. This is a serious issue. Who could forget over the last few weeks of sitting of the Senate the contributions that Senator Herron has made in question time in this chamber, attempting to answer serious questions about the issue of health insurance and a number of other issues relating to the health and aged care portfolio? We have heard Senator Herron time and time again attempt to outline what he believes is the government's position in relation to this important issue, and a range of others, to be proved comprehensively that he has a total incapacity to deal with issues of substance in the chamber.
Today we saw what could only be described as a completely incoherent performance from Senator Herron. It is not as if Senator Herron has an awful lot of work to do. It is not as if he has got an enormous ministerial load. This is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who has not had responsibility for the issue of stolen children, who has not had responsibility for the native title debate, who now does not have responsibility for the issue of reconciliation, because that is now, as a result of the new ministerial arrangements, in the hands of Mr Ruddock, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. This is the minister who cannot come in at the committee stage of this debate and deal with this issue on which he has been the spokesperson in this chamber.
Regardless of any other commitments that he might have, the truth of the matter is that this is a very important piece of legislation, the responsibility of the minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, and Senator Herron does not have the capacity to 
 deal with the detail of this legislation or the focus that is required of a minister during a committee stage debate. And, as far as the opposition is concerned, it is absolutely unacceptable, for a committee stage debate on legislation that the government believes is as important as this, that the minister representing the minister for health in this chamber cannot front up to the Senate and handle the committee stage debate on behalf of the government.
That says it all. It is not just that he cannot handle himself during question time on the range of issues on which he has had questions asked of him not only by opposition senators but also by minor party senators and Senator Harradine, it is not just that he cannot go the hard yards in question time, but that, here in this important and crucial committee stage debate, Senator Herron is missing in action. The point I want to make is that that is not good enough. We have had Senator Herron plead for the representational responsibilities that were previously handled by Senator Newman, whose approach always on these issues was to say, `I don't know anything about it. I will just refer it to the minister in the other chamber.' Senator Herron's approach is to say the first thing that comes into his head, and it is normally nonsense. It is normally incoherent psychobabble.
I think it is important that the record shows that in this committee stage debate, which the government claims is of such significance on such an important issue, the minister representing the minister for health cannot front up after lecturing senators, the parliament and the people of Australia day in and day out during the parliamentary sittings since the election. He cannot be bothered or is not interested enough to come in and handle this committee stage debate in the parliament.
Senator Tambling, as the parliamentary secretary, is doing this job and, obviously, he is struggling with the detail. I do not expect Senator Tambling to have the same level of familiarity with this particular issue. No reasonable person would expect Senator Tambling to be able to take over this responsibility in the chamber at short notice and handle the debate when, of course, you have 
 got the minister representing the minister for health squibbing it.
—Senator, please do not reflect upon ministers.
—I think we have had enough of lectures from Senator Herron, the sort of flaky performances that we have seen from him in question time today and over the last few weeks. I think that if Senator Herron wants to have the responsibility of a minister representing, then he ought to come in and do the job. This is a disgraceful performance in relation to the handling of this bill in the committee stage, and Senator Herron and the government stand condemned for it.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I will not delay the committee long, but I still want to add a couple of points, to which Senator Faulkner has alluded, before we get to the substance. The attitude of the opposition is that if  Senator Herron wants to get up day in and day out and lecture us on how important this bill is—and there is no doubt he has done that in the past—he really should be here to handle it. I am pleased Senator Faulkner put it in such a way as not to reflect on Senator Tambling. What is Senator Tambling's position? He is a parliamentary secretary, who does not get 1c more for all the work he does, and he does a lot of work. He gets one medium-level adviser and one receptionist and, if he is lucky, he might get a DLO.
Meanwhile, we have another minister working in his second job as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, getting $50,000, about seven staff and about 100,000 platitudes and cliches a year, yet he is not here to handle this bill—the only bill that he will probably have of any complexity or of any importance between now and when he gets appointed High Commissioner to London or to wherever he is heading off.
This is starting to become a bit of a pattern. I do not mind the fact that parliamentary secretaries are used as workhorses. But, really, they are not the front-line troops; they are the reserves, they fill in the gaps, and you should not expect them to take on the responsibility of shepherding through very complex 
 legislation, given the poor resource base and the lack of remuneration. What parliamentary secretaries are getting is all responsibility and nothing else.
It is true that some people may see the taking of a parliamentary secretaryship as a way up the greasy pole—that is, you do your apprenticeship as a parliamentary secretary and you might eventually be promoted into the role of minister and eventually to cabinet. I think that is true to a point. I am not going to point to anyone that disproves it because there are always hurtful examples on any side of the chamber at any particular point in time.
When it comes to crucial legislation—and I suppose the coalition would put this as one of its four or five centrepiece pieces of legislation in its three-year term; no doubt the GST would be their key one, but I would have thought this one would be in the top five of the remaining ones—we do not have Senator Herron here today. Why don't we? He may have a genuine excuse for not being here today, but, if he did not, I suspect he still would not be allocated the handling of these bills. You have got a minister who the Prime Minister picked, frankly, because he was a friend and he liked the look of him. That is basically why he was made a minister, the same as Mrs Moylan was in Western Australia. That mistake was rectified.
—How did you get one?
—It is hard to understand, Senator Ferguson, why you did not get a berth. I absolutely concede that. It is almost impossible to conceive—no, hold on; you don't meet some of the criteria: you are not vacuous and you probably have a grasp of detail. If you could give that up, we might see you on the front bench. You might be a regular feature there.
—You are ruining my preselection.
—Don't provoke me because I know we have got an important debate to get on with. But I really think, as a matter of principle, on the key piece of legislation in the health area for the next three years, the person who asks for the job of representing health in this chamber should be 
 here to put it through. It is no reflection on Senator Tambling. In fact, I think he will do a much better job of handling this. I am not trying to embarrass him in this way, but he will do a better job than Senator Herron. But, Senator Tambling, so would a telephone pole, so do not get too keen on that particular analogy.
—For the benefit of honourable senators, can I say that there is no running sheet for these bills. There is sheet 1215, which is the five Australian Democrats amendments, and there is sheet 1221, which is Senator Harradine's six amendments. I think it is fairly straightforward to work through the Democrats amendments and then Senator Harradine's amendments, which is the way I would plan to proceed.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—I wish to clarify one point with Senator Lees. When she started speaking to the amendments on sheet 1215, she drew attention to amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4. Am I right in assuming that her initial comments were in respect of amendment No. 1?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—I was mainly speaking about amendment No. 1, yes. But if you look down further at amendment No. 2, you look further at the actual income test and other details that are needed. If you go down further, amendment No. 4 is further entitlement relating to the means test.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—I appreciate that. However, the initial comments were with regard to the first amendment. The critical issue that the senator is raising in these amendments is that the government's private health insurance rebate should be means tested. I have no doubt that this rebate is the most equitable way to encourage people who can afford to take out private health insurance and to reward those who already have it. I completely reject the proposal by the Democrats that the rebate should be means tested. The government will not be 
 doing any deals to compromise the integrity of this policy.
Australia's private health insurance system complements our universal health care system and funds around 80 per cent of all private hospital care. It is entirely reasonable for those people who choose to fund part of their own private care to get back part of the funding from the public system they would otherwise draw on. The rebate is in essence a tax concession designed to reflect the extra cost burden borne by people across all income levels for private health insurance which is not carried by others who rely solely on the public system.
The government decided not to means test the rebate for several reasons. Firstly, the universal nature of the rebate reflects the universal nature of Medicare. Every taxpayer pays the Medicare levy whether or not the taxpayer uses it. It is only fair that every taxpayer who chooses to pay extra for private health insurance is entitled to the rebate.
Secondly, means testing the rebate would have an adverse impact on increasing private health insurance membership—the government's main objective in offering the rebate. The largest falls in health insurance participation rates have been in the middle to high income bracket and these people are generally lower risk members who are essential to balancing the cost of sicker members and helping control the escalating costs of premiums. The limited success of the current Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme illustrates the likely effect means testing would have on the success of the 30 per cent rebate.
Thirdly, the universality of the rebate recognises that, for some people, private health insurance is the only way they can be assured of a reasonable level of choice. For example, in rural communities, although publicly funded services are available, private health insurance provides a wider range of health care choices, especially if their condition requires transfer to a metropolitan facility. I certainly referred to that when I talked about my own personal health experience this year. I am not trying to transpose myself as someone special. I appreciate that there are 
 many other people in lower income levels than me who would similarly draw on that area.
The government supports people's right to choose between Medicare and private health care services. It is essential that people making the choice to choose private health care are treated equally, just as Medicare users are.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-10,"—It is a good opportunity with the parliamentary secretary referring to his own experience earlier this year—and I say thank goodness he is looking so healthy—to ask if he can tell us, in regard to the $30,000 or so expenditure that was required for that heart operation procedure, what the cost would have been in the public health system. If I remember correctly, the parliamentary secretary Senator Tambling said in his case some $21,000 was covered by insurance, $7,000 or so was covered by Medicare and the rest was out of pocket. That gives a very clear measure of the costs of this procedure with private insurance available. I would like to know what would have been the cost had the same procedure been undertaken in the public health arena and whether it would have been as readily and quickly available?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—I can only reflect on my personal experience in this area. As I said, that $21,000 that was contributed by my personal health insurance certainly reflected the extra costs of a number of specialists. It was largely the component of the health provisions at the private hospital of my choice and included all of the special facilities that were made available, such as intensive care and specialist treatment.
If I had not elected to have that surgery in Sydney, then I would have had to have been evacuated from the Northern Territory to Adelaide into the system where the cost would then have been borne by taxpayers. I assume it would have been at a similar cost factoring, but it certainly would have cost substantially more because of the extra requirements that would have had to have been imposed on the government for that provision, particularly with regard to the transport costs. 
 Again, I would not have had the choice of specialists—some eight of them—who were required to administer to me. I would have had no choice in that regard. I would have naturally been a public patient in Adelaide.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-10,"—This is a very important point. If I can remove it from the personal arena, I would like to get from the government what the actual costs would have been both for the medical procedures involved—all of them—and separately for the transport because that is another matter. When it comes to people who do not have the income level that we senators have, such things as availability of air transport become much more problematic. Access to the diagnostic services of specialists themselves also becomes much more problematic.
 There is great concern in the community that, if you join an insurance scheme, the price of the procedure goes up. At all levels there is a premium that is taken by the private system which makes it much less attractive for people to take out insurance. That is one of the major factors why we are seeing the tumbling participation rate in private health insurance.
 What I would like the government to do—if you cannot do it now, I would like an assurance that the work can be done on this—is to give a cost comparison for a very expensive medical procedure (one that has been very successful, very important and, I daresay, lifesaving) as against what it would have cost in the public health system. It is important that we get a measure on these things so that we see the premium, the mark-up, that occurs once you move across into the private system.
If the government has figures to show what the premium is for the delivery of a private health service—we are talking about legislation which is going to put billions of dollars over the years into supporting that health service and therefore that premium—I think the public needs to know the facts of the matter. Here is a very good example that, due to the grace of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, we have before the committee. It will serve the purpose of this exercise—seeing what the difference is between the costs in the public 
 arena and the costs once you take out insurance and move into the private health arena.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—The important issue to be addressed here is the particular matter in the legislation before us, and I would draw all senators' attention back to that. I would merely make the point with regard to the personal example that the fact that I chose private health insurance means that there were no costs on the public sector—costs which would have been borne if I were in that alternative health care service.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-12-10,"—That is a very curious claim because the public sector, Medicare, covers the large part of your health costs up to the medical benefits schedule fee. Indeed, I do believe that what was previously 75 per cent cover went to 100 per cent some time ago—maybe I am not right on that. No adviser is nodding; perhaps you can check whether that is right. A very significant part of your health care cost was borne by the public sector. That needs to be clearly put on the table.
 I rise to ask not about your health but about this matter in general. As a doctor myself, I have long since learnt that you never ask or never talk about other people's health in the public arena. If you wish to talk about your own, that is fine. I do not know what operation you had—and I do not want to know—or what procedures you had. I would like to talk about this in the general.
In the course of my second reading contribution, I said that I would like to know what is the state of play of casemix. Is the department still working in the area of casemix? Can the department say what happened to casemix, if you are not continuing with it? It was understood that an effort was being made to try to put a cost on a surgical procedure or a procedure, and therefore you would be able to say that this cost should be more or less the same in the public or the private sector.
It is curious to me that any surgical procedure, any operation—according to much of the evidence of people who have to pay the gap—costs more in the private sector when the private sector does not have anything like 
 the add-on costs that the public sector has. If there were to be a case for a more costly procedure, it ought to be in the public sector where our large public hospitals carry the burden—happily—of educating our doctors, educating our nurses, educating our pathologists and educating all sorts of health professionals. Very often they carry the burden of providing ancillary costs such as pathology in times past and morgues—whatever else was necessary for an adequate and thorough delivery of comprehensive health care.
What people were trying to do in casemix, as I understand it, was to factor out those extra costs from the cost of the procedure so that we could have a more accurate understanding of the comparison between procedures in one sector and another. I ask the parliamentary secretary for an answer on what is the state of play of that kind of study. Is it continuing and, if so, can you give us some comparative costs?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,—I believe that it would be much more appropriate for Senator Crowley to raise these issues in the next round of Senate estimates. Estimates is much more relevant to the issues that she raises.,SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—This is highly relevant. This is what we are actually dealing with. We are dealing with a huge amount of money that you want to throw at the private sector without checks and balances and even the knowledge of what procedures really cost there. We know that the government does not have these figures. That is why they cannot supply them. It just further adds to our argument that we should not be dealing with this partially blindfolded, which is what the government wants.
I return to some comments Senator Tambling made about how we have to have this because we have to acknowledge that all Australians, if they are earning, pay taxes and Medicare. I want to pick up on the point that Senator Crowley just made. A lot of the costs were covered by Medicare. A lot of the costs that someone who goes into the private 
 system has are covered by Medicare. People need Medicare to go to their GPs. They tap into the public system when they get a prescription or have radiology or pathology tests. The issue is that you do not get  anything back at the moment for the bed. That is the way in which I believe, if we want to support private hospitals—and we certainly should be—we can support them. It would cost a fraction of this measure.
If the right checks and balances are put in place, we might tackle some of the other difficulties we have in the private sector. At the moment, there are no cost controls there. This is the battle the Labor Party fought when it brought in the contracting system, which fell into a hole because doctors said, `How dare you interfere with the doctor-patient relationship.' They wanted to charge what they liked. We had no right to know what they were charging.
I stress here and acknowledge that we are only talking about a minority of doctors. But the problem for the pensioners is knowing which doctor will come out of the hat and how much they are eventually going to end up with. Certainly speaking for doctors in my home state, I congratulate particularly those working at places such as Ashford in the private system, who seem to be able to manage with the Medicare rebate and the schedule fee. People do not get gap payments with them. However, you only have to go through our mail and the calls we get to know that, unfortunately, there are a lot of different doctors out there. I had better not mention particular specialties here tonight.
It is highly relevant to this bill that we have no cost controls on the private system. This money could simply be going to further feed those doctors who want to charge more. They know now that their patients are getting money back for their private health insurance. So I argue that some of the constraints that may have been there may be lifted. Again, it is a minority of doctors, but they give the private system an incredibly bad name. They are ones that the private hospitals do not have any control over. The funds also do not have any control over them.
I understand what Senator Harradine is trying to do. However, this is where the second part of his amendments fall down. If we are going tonight to put in restrictions on gaps and make the funds pay them, all the doctors will do for some of them is charge the absolute earth. I imagine that it will drive premiums up—I will ask these questions later—between seven and 10 per cent to be able to guarantee that there are no gaps. Tonight we are giving a 30 per cent rebate. We will see these funds increase their charges by eight or so per cent next year. Add on 10 per cent for the gaps. Where are we then? We are almost back to square one, and we could put $1.5 billion into the public system.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I thank Senator Lees for her comments, which I think make my case very nicely. Senator Tambling's answer was, `Why don't you ask those questions in estimates.' I will tell him why. If he does not have the answer now, what is he going to do between now and estimates? If we are at least going to get some kind of answer, that is encouraging. But my question is exactly pertinent to the bill before us. Indeed, I signalled during my speech on the second reading debate, which happened to be some days ago, that I would be asking this question. Here now or later—I do not really care—I think it is pertinent for the department to provide to Senator Tambling and for him to provide to the Senate some evidence about the relativities of these costs. Does it cost more to have the same surgical procedure in the private sector? If so, why?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,—I will draw the senator's comments to the minister's attention and ensure that she receives the information she seeks.,SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—I would like to add a couple more questions to the list. I am looking at some of the information that came to us during the committee process. Another concern in the private system—this has some real basis in fact—is that certain procedures are available there far 
 more regularly than they are in the public system. One example is caesarean delivery. Women who go into the public system have a quite small chance of having a caesarean compared with women who end up in a private hospital. Rather than there being any overservicing in the private system, there may be underservicing in the public system. So, whichever is true, we need some answers. I put on notice this question for the minister: what have you done to actually look at the level of servicing in the private system? If we tonight put measures on gaps without some of these checks and balances, all that that small percentage of doctors will do is order more procedures.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—What we have heard in the last few minutes very well illustrates why what we should have done as a parliament, and what I believe we should still do, is have a full inquiry into health care funding and the whole kit and caboodle of what is going right or wrong. There is a lot of hairy-chested stuff being put by the government; I am not referring to anybody in this chamber. Basically, in the public arena, there is a lot of stuff going on which is based on a lack of proper knowledge. This relates to the lack of a proper inquiry into the issues involved in health funding.
We have had inquiries into health insurance but not a proper inquiry into health funding and the issues concerning gaps, for example. How are they created? Will anything we could do tonight within this legislation really and honestly deal with that situation? I do not think it is possible simply by concentrating on health insurance. That is why, from my point of view, as I mentioned in my speech on the second  reading debate, I have difficulty passing amendments at this stage which in effect give legitimacy to a policy direction based on private health insurance products. In fact, the overwhelming evidence in the committee was that this was not the way to proceed.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I have a question to ask—I am sure I know what the answer will be but let me ask it anyhow. Parliamentary secretary, is 
 there a cost differential between a surgical procedure done in a public hospital on a public patient and the same procedure done in a public hospital on a private patient? We are looking at the relativities between a private patient in a private hospital and a public patient in a public hospital. As we know, one of the reasons that there is considerable strain on our public hospital system is that so many private patients are having their procedures done as private patients in a public hospital. Indeed, very often it is as a public patient in a public hospital.
—As is their right.
—Indeed. It is also the right of the private patient. You will be pleased to know that very few public patients have the opportunity to be treated as public patients in private hospitals. That was tried by the previous Labor government and, with rare exceptions, the doctors did not want to operate on public patients in private hospitals because they were unable to charge above the medical benefit schedule. Senator Lees reports well of Ashford Hospital in our state but it was not the case when the doctors in South Australia refused to operate and use the spare beds in the private sector some years ago, when they could have run down the waiting lists in the public hospitals.
I congratulate the doctors in the Illawarra region who did contribute, through the private sector, to reducing the pension waiting lists for eye operations. Is the parliamentary secretary going to continue to tell us tonight that he does not have any detail, and come back some other day, when tonight we are supposed to be voting on the expenditure of $1.7 billion of precious taxpayer dollars—
—Year after year.
—Exactly. It may not be that figure because, if the government's proposal is that more people take up private insurance, and it is an open-ended cheque for 30 per cent for everybody's private health cover, that figure will be even more. I would like to know what the government puts as a guess on that. Before we get to that question, can the parliamentary secretary give us an answer to the first question: is the cost of an appendix operation or an open heart operation 
 in a public hospital different for patients who are public patients and patients who are private patients.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—I can only vouch for one open heart operation and that was in a private hospital. The issues that have been raised this evening I think are better placed in other committees and other considerations of this parliament. I can assure you that the Minister for Health and Aged Care is actively pursuing all of the areas and all of the issues that have been canvassed. What we are dealing with tonight is legislation that is to provide a private health insurance rebate and the effects of that. Whilst I appreciate that Senator Crowley and Senator Margetts, and to a certain extent Senator Lees, are coming at this matter from a philosophical point of view on which we probably do have major differences of opinion, I draw their attention back to the actual legislation and its effects. That is the purpose of our being here tonight.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—Just briefly, I am basing my opinion on the evidence—not on a philosophical or ideological position but on the basis of the evidence that has been presented to us and to the people who were sitting on that committee on Friday. Nobody could justify the direction that the government is taking. The figures were not there, the models were not there, and even the health department people there had a lot of difficulty explaining the report that supposedly they had written. The reality is that my opinion is not based on a philosophical point of view, it is that there is no evidence to back up your claims—you have presented no evidence to back up your claims. The parliamentary secretary presented his own situation but the questions relating to the comparisons have not been answered. That is because they cannot be answered to support these claims.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-12-10,"—The response from the parliamentary secretary is not disappointing: it is shameful. I think the points made by my colleagues are absolutely critical. The govern 
 ment is not providing any hard data for us, and that is really a disgrace.
—I ask Senator Crowley to be very careful.
—It was a disgrace, no person was a disgrace. I understand the finer distinctions here. I think it is appalling that we are being asked to vote on the expenditure of this amount of money and the government is unable to provide the critical data for us. The evidence, again and again, is from the people who write to us and say, `I have done the right thing. I have paid for my private health insurance for 10, 30, 40 years. I have finally had to use it and what do I have? No protection against health costs but a huge bill.'
I will not labour this any more. It is late and people want to get on. I am glad that the parliamentary secretary can speak of one operation in the private sector, but I would hate that to be taken that there is no good standing for such procedures to be done in the public sector. The majority of open heart operations are done in the public sector. The patients who have had them are walking, talking and recovering beautifully and they are not out of pocket one cent.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, you will be relieved to know that I do not intend discussing Senator Tambling's medical conditions except to say that the only point of interest that came out of Senator Tambling's example of his medical experiences is that from now on, if this bill is passed, the taxpayers of Australia will be helping to fund his private health insurance. They will be subsidising his taxation by about $800 a year because he will be paying less tax because he is in private health insurance. He will be $800 better off and we will be contributing $800 for a rebate for Senator Tambling's health insurance, or something of that order, because we will be paying 30 per cent off his private health insurance. For someone who is on a salary of $80,000 per year, I think that is a national disgrace.
I do not think people earning $20,000 or $30,000 a year ought to have to subsidise 
 Senator Tambling's private health insurance. He talks about choice and I agree with him that he has the choice to take it out but we have the choice not to pay for it for him. That is what this debate is about. It is about who pays for Senator Tambling's health insurance and who pays for John Howard's health insurance. I am happy for them to have health insurance but they should pay for it themselves. The taxpayers of Australia should not pay for their health insurance. They have the means and the wherewithal to make that decision and pay for it themselves.
The bill tonight says, `All of you out there in Australia who pay taxes, whether you are on $18,000, $25,000, $30,0000 or $40,000 a year, have kids and are struggling, your taxes will go into a pool so $1.5 billion can be paid to prop up the private health insurance of people who choose to take it out.' We are not talking about the money going in to prop up the private health insurance of the battlers; $900 million of this goes to people earning over $70,000 a year. The vast bulk of it goes to the top end of town. It goes to the Senator Tamblings and John Howards of Australia. This is a disgrace. The government will learn to regret this decision because it is inequitable. It is unfair.
Every time someone on a waiting list at a public hospital rings you up and says, `I can't get into hospital—why?' tell them it is because the money is paying Senator Tambling's private health insurance instead. That is why. That $1 billion plus that could end waiting lists in this country and that could mean that nobody waits in pain to go into hospital for an operation could be used so they would not have to wait, so they would get their operation in the public hospital and they would not be in pain. It could be used so pensioners who cannot eat because their teeth are broken could get their teeth fixed. But no, what are we saying tonight? We are saying the priority of the parliament of this country in health care is to subsidise Senator Tambling's and Mr Howard's private health insurance so they can pay less for their private health insurance. That is what this is about. It is a priority.
Whether we choose to spend $1.5 billion on this or on something else is the conscious choice of this parliament. We decide tonight whether this is a good use of $1.5 billion. I say it is not a good use and, when the 70 per cent of Australians who are not in private health insurance understand what this means—understand what it means for public health, understand what it means for waiting lists, understand what it means for nurses' wages, understand what it means for services in public hospitals—they will turn on this government.
Also, the 30 per cent who pay will begin to realise. The government has been very clever at trying to convince the 30 per cent who are in private health insurance that this is all about them, but they have to understand that for the vast majority of them this is a very marginal increase. The current scheme provides them with up to $450. Most of them will get, at best, around $600 to $700 out of this. It is a marginal increase. This money is going to the top end of town. That is what this is about. The government says we have to get the young rich people back into the scheme. That may be right, but do we have to pay to get them back in?
On John Howard's salary of $200,000 a year, he gets a tax discount of $2,000 because he does not pay the one per cent surcharge. So he pays $2,000 less tax than he otherwise would and we are also going to throw in $700 to $800 worth of rebate. So we are going to pay $2,800 to $2,900 of public subsidy so John Howard can take out $3,000 worth of health insurance. We are going to pay 95 per cent of John Howard's and Senator Tambling's health insurance. Why? Can't they afford it? I reckon they can afford it. We would be better off spending the money on helping the pensioners waiting to get their hips replaced so they can have an operation in a public hospital. I think that is a much better use of the money.
If the government want to defend this move, they have to say to Australians why this is a better use of Australian taxpayers' money than what the opposition is proposing. You cannot argue the case. This is not the best use of the money. This is an election 
 bribe that the government put up at the last election. It sounded like smart politics—I think it will turn out to be sour politics—but it is very bad economics. They did not get one public health economist to come and defend the scheme. They have not found one bit of methodology or calculation to support it. It is an absolute rort. It should not happen. It is a complete waste of taxpayers' money. I am extremely disappointed that we did not knock it off at the second reading stage, but I hope the Senate will reconsider. This is a gross misuse of taxpayers' money and it should not go ahead.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—I do not know whether Senator Evans has any children, but it was his side that, with both hands, grabbed the child-care payments that were made to every millionaire and every other family in Australia. That is what was voted in by the Labor Party, but that is not the issue we are discussing tonight.
Similarly, when Senator Evans wants to take a swipe at me because I pay $2,000 a year in health care premiums, he should do some homework about the surcharge issues. He should also look at the costs of people who do take their services in private health insurance. He might like to revisit the comment that I made in the summing up where I made the point that, without private hospitals, the public system would have to treat an extra 1,800,000 patients a year, perform twice as much surgery as now, provide 23,000 more beds and require $3.5 billion extra funding every year. There is a certain degree of hypocrisy in what Senator Evans is getting at.
However, I would like to return to the issue that is germane to tonight, that is, we are discussing legislation with regard to the private health insurance rebate. Specifically, we are discussing Senator Lees's amendments. People should not start making second reading speeches because the broadcasting button has been turned on but should deal with the issues before us which are the amendments—and on this occasion they are the amendments moved by Senator Lees.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—Senator Tambling, I do not think this has anything to do with the broadcasting button but a lot to do with this government's inability to argue their case. As for your previous comments, private hospitals are not about to close down. I suggest you go and check the Stock Exchange. You will find that private hospitals are making record profits. If you do consult with those who advise on how to invest money, that is one of the top investments in this country at the moment. Indeed, shares have had a steady increase over about the last five years. Looking at new beds, in my home state in particular a new private hospital attached to Flinders is about to open. Looking at the number of new private hospitals established over the last 18 months, I think we have a surplus of something like 17 new private facilities, both bed day facilities and hospitals. We are far from the end of the private hospital system.
Again I would just make the point: this is not the way to support them anyway. If we do want to acknowledge that people pay Medicare and wish to use a private hospital, there is a bed-day subsidy which is putting health money into health; it is not putting health money into an insurance product.
Drawing our attention back to the amendment—as you keep wanting of us so that we will not ask too many more embarrassing questions—the amendment actually says that, while we do not want a bar of the measures you are putting before us tonight connected with the rebate, at least we should be quarantining the rebate to those Australians on low and middle incomes so that high income earners do not get something that they do not need.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I just indicate that the opposition will not be supporting these amendments. As I have tried to put, we think there is a need for greater equity in the scheme. But the problem with the amendments of the Democrats is that they reduce the benefits below those currently provided in the PHIIS—
—No, they do not.
—On the basis of the evidence I have seen, Senator Lees, you lower the means test to below the means test levels provided in the current scheme. On our analysis, you will be taking away benefits that people enjoy under the current scheme. Obviously that has caused us a difficulty. On that basis, we will not be supporting the amendments.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—If I can draw senators' attention to the amendments, you will see that we have left in place—and I think we need to go over to some later amendments—the actual existing scheme for those from the current threshold to the new threshold.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—I move Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill amendment (3):
(3)	 Page 43 (after line 23), after clause 19-40, insert:
19-41  Review of operation of Act
	 (1)	 The Minister must cause an independent review to be undertaken of:
		 (a)	 the operation of the private health insurance incentives scheme as provided for by this Act and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance) Act 1998 ; and
		 (b)	 the extent to which the scheme has met the following performance objectives:
			 (i)	 the provision of gap insurance by health insurance funds;
			 (ii)	 the development of simplified billing arrangements between patients, providers and health insurance funds;
			 (iii)	 the reduction in health insurance premiums;
			 (iv)	 the increase in membership of health insurance funds;
			 (v)	 such other performance objectives as the review considers appropriate; and
		 (c)	 the impact of the scheme on the public hospital system, as measured by:
			 (i)	 the impact on public hospital waiting lists;
			 (ii)	 the impact on public hospital waiting times;  

			 (iii)	 such other measures as the review considers appropriate.
	 (2)	 A person who undertakes such a review must give the Minister a written report of the review within 2 years after the date of the commencement of this Act.
	 (3)	 The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days after receiving the report.
	 (4)	 In this section:
	 independent review  means a review undertaken by persons who:
		 (a)	 in the Minister's opinion possess appropriate qualifications to undertake the review; and
		 (b)	 include one or more persons who are not employed by the Department of State administered by the Minister, by the HIC or by a related Commonwealth authority and have not, in the 5 years immediately before the commencement of this Act, provided services to the Department, the HIC or the authority under, or in connection with, a contract.
19-42  Cessation of operation of Act
	 This Act, unless sooner repealed, ceases to be in force at the expiration of 3 years after the date of commencement of this Act.
I will speak to this amendment very briefly. Hopefully, the government will be interested in at least this one. This amendment puts in place a review. We would envisage a review by independent experts, including consumers as well as health economists, and no doubt the department would be involved. This would be specifically to look at the government's claims that this will reduce pressure on the public system. Also, it would look at the ability of this measure to hold down the costs of private health insurance over the two years and to do something about the number of people in private insurance. In other words, we are looking basically at what the government is claiming will happen. Surely the absolute minimum requirement would be to have a review to see whether or not this is working at all.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I just ask of Senator Lees: I understood that you were proposing to split this amendment—and correct me if I am 
 wrong—into two sections. I think we had indicated privately that we were happy to support one but not two. This is amendment 3 which deals with the review of the operation of the act and the cessation of the operation of the act; am I correct on that? I understood that you were going to consider moving them separately. Perhaps I could indicate that we were prepared to vote for the first part and not the second part, and that was why we were suggesting that you might move them separately.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—My advice is that the cessation in the act actually relates to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1998 and—the Clerk may wish to help me here—looking through the amendments, that is the only one that actually relates to cessation of the operation of the act.
—There are two parts, as I understand it: review of the operation of the act; and cessation of the operation of the act.
—Yes, I acknowledge that. I will need therefore to simply move the section on page 43 dealing with 19 to 41, the review of the operation.
—We will put them separately, Senator Lees.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—Just for clarification: could somebody—perhaps Senator Lees—just advise us which of those includes the sunset clause. I think that is what you have been trying to establish. Which of those we are about to vote on does include some element of sunset clause?
—We have not come to the sunset clause. It is in this amendment but it is the second part, and we are putting them separately. It is under the heading `Cessation of operation of the act'.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I indicate again on behalf of the opposition that, as Senator Lees is moving just sections 19 to 41, which deal purely with the review of the operation of the act, we think that is a very sensible measure. While we do not have much confidence about the 
 bill generally or how the numbers are likely to fall tonight, clearly that is a measure worth supporting, and we will be voting for it.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-10,"—I think there is a need for a review of the legislation. My personal view is that this could better be undertaken by a Senate committee; it then could be done in a more rigorous fashion than an independent review, run by a reviewer appointed by the minister. Under those circumstances, I would foreshadow that there should be, in the Senate, such a decision about it at this particular stage. Whether tonight or next year when we come back or, indeed, after 30 June, Senator Lees presumably can nominate whom she likes in that respect.
But quite seriously, I think it would be better if we did it through our committee system and did a thorough job on it. I would certainly be supporting that in due course. I can understand the point that Senator Lees has put, and I acknowledge what she has said: there does have to be a review. But let us conduct the review and let us deal with it in a thorough manner, as of course our committees do in any event.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—I had envisaged that that was where we would go after 1 July next year. After listening to Senator Margetts's comments earlier—and I believe her amendment should have been supported—I must say that some of these other roads will be pursued later next year, and I put the government on notice there. We saw this as simply the first stage of a longer process that would review how successful this measure had been. I take Senator Harradine's point. As long as we have Senator Harradine interested and he will be with us after July next year, then we can all be involved in the process of fully reviewing exactly what is happening with this legislation.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1998-12-10,"—I want to endorse the comments of Senator Harradine. I think the parliamentary committees would be an ideal forum for a full and proper review of this matter. They have undertaken this requirement in 
 parts previously, and a further extension of that would certainly be desirable.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—It is interesting that Senator Knowles should say that because, when she was on her own trying to defend this situation on Friday, she quite clearly indicated that she did not think an inquiry was necessary.
—That is quite incorrect and I ask you to apologise and withdraw that.
—I was at the inquiry on Friday.
—Yes, but you weren't listening. It is quite incorrect and, if you don't apologise and withdraw it, I will speak and put the record straight.
—Feel free. If we were going to have a review on health funding, we should have had it before this nonsense tonight of trying to piece together something workable.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1998-12-10,"—I need to set the record straight. Senator Margetts has not been involved in the previous inquiries the committee has undertaken and which I have chaired. Also, there was the Productivity Commission inquiry. That is the statement I made at the committee the other day. There was no reference to there being no requirement for further inquiries. Unfortunately, Senator Margetts left the committee meeting early and did not bother to stay until anywhere near the end.
—The question is that the amendment in respect of clause 19-41 be agreed to.
Amendment not agreed to.
—The question now is that the amendment in respect of clause 19-42 be agreed to.

Amendment (by Senator Lees) proposed:
(5)	 Clause 20-5, page 44 (lines 13 and 14), omit "", *ancillary cover or *combined cover"". 
",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will be supporting this amendment. The government has not made out a case for subsidising ancillary cover. As we know, 60 per cent of ancillary cover is in dental care. I have made the point in debates previously on this issue that the government's priority in this area is ironic. We are going to fund up to $200 million worth of ancillary care, which largely consists of dental care, for those in society who can afford it, while we as a community cannot afford emergency dental treatment for pensioners and others on low incomes because we have seen fit to abolish the Commonwealth dental scheme and remove the $100 million that was provided for that purpose.
So we have a very stark contrast. We can find $200 million to subsidise dental care for people of all income levels with ancillary cover, but we cannot find $100 million to provide emergency dental care for those people who sometimes cannot even eat because their teeth are in such bad condition but they cannot get care. It is an important representation of the government's priorities in this bill. It is an important representation of the choices confronting the Senate. I do not want to labour the point, but I do not think the government has made a case at all for us underwriting the provision of ancillary care.
Clearly, the government's major argument in all of this—however unconvincing—is that it will take the pressure off the public hospitals. This would do nothing to take the pressure off the public hospitals. These services are not generally provided in public hospitals. In terms of priorities for the use of money, the opposition cannot see any need to support the government's position. We therefore support the Democrat amendment.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—I would like to make a few comments. The government's argument in committee on this was that ancillary services are very important. We have no problem with that whatsoever; they are very important. They are sometimes a part of a hospital procedure but, as Senator 
 Evans has already said, the majority of them are dental and a lot of them are optical.
I have great difficulty with this when there has not been a drop-off in ancillary services. The pattern of private health insurance from 1995 shows that the number of people with hospital insurance dropped from 6.3 million to 5.7 million, but ancillary services remained stable. Roughly six million Australians are covered for those. As Senator Evans has pointed out, I have great difficulty subsidising mostly high income families and individuals, and remember there are already support mechanisms with the old system for those on low to middle incomes.
If this bill is passed tonight, what will really happen is this: of the $290 million that will go into subsidising ancillary services, a good $200 million will probably be spent on those on middle to high incomes, when we cannot find the money for dental treatment for those who are on waiting lists. They were once on waiting lists in the Commonwealth public dental scheme, but that has now been handed back to the states. In some states, such as Tasmania, that scheme is almost inoperable; that is true also for many rural areas across the country. In New South Wales, waiting lists for the public dental scheme are around three years and anyone could imagine what it would be like for someone to have to wait three years to have basic fillings attended to. In many instances, it is a case of having to extract their teeth by the time they reach the front of the queue.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—The critics of the rebate are arguing that the rebate should not apply to ancillary cover. To claim that only wealthy people use ancillary services is nonsense. Ancillary products cover such things as dental, optical, physiotherapy, chiropractic, osteopathy, podiatry, emergency ambulance transport, speech therapy, hearing aids and non-PSB pharmaceutical prescriptions. These services are used by all Australians, not just the wealthy. Indeed, 76 per cent of all people with health insurance have both hospital and ancillary cover, which shows that Australians across all income levels value 
 ancillary cover. It is not just the high-flying football players. It covers all people, especially those who are terminally ill with cancer, children with disability illnesses, the aged and the infirm, paraplegics and quadriplegics.
The majority of ancillary services are not covered by Medicare. Excluding ancillary services from the rebate would deny many less wealthy Australians access to these essential services. These are the very services that can prevent people from needing to go into hospital for acute care. For example, being able to access podiatry services can prevent a person with diabetes from being admitted to a hospital for a limb amputation. For those reasons we are certainly opposed to this amendment.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,—The parliamentary secretary suggested that 76 per cent of those people holding health insurance have some form of ancillary cover.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—This is another example of where a figure is thrown into the debate and, if there are specific questions on that figure in this debate to the parliamentary secretary representing the minister, then there should be some means of backing up those figures. It might be just a debating point or it might have been something that was planned to put into the debate, but it is obvious that if the parliamentary secretary puts figures into the debate somebody is going to ask him about what makes up those figures.
—The question is that the amendment be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye, against say no. I think the noes have it.
—Sorry. I am unaware of how Senators Colston and Harradine are voting on this one. Therefore, I am going to 
 need to put it to a division unless I am able to get some indication of that, because in the chamber I think we are dead even at the moment. No indication? Therefore, I say that the ayes have it.

 professional attention  has the meaning given by section 3 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 .
The legislation before the parliament provides for certain access options to the 30 per cent 
 rebate from 1 January 1999. It provides for access reductions of private health insurance premiums—namely, 30 per cent received by either of three areas: a reduction of private health insurance premiums, a tax rebate or a cash rebate from a government office, presumably the Medicare office. That is precisely what it is in the legislation at the moment.
The rebate could be used to put pressure on funds in negotiation with the medical profession to offer no gap or known gap policies to health fund members. National Mutual already offers such policies to its members in South Australia and in Victoria, and some 30 to 40 per cent of insured South Australian residents have such policies. Under simplified billing arrangements, there are now over 25 simplified billing agents across the country, and many of these also offer known or no gap arrangements for privately insured patients using both public and private hospitals.
These policies require negotiation between funds, hospitals and procedural specialists. Now over 5.7 per cent of all claims are going through simplified billing agencies. National Mutual has processed over 200,000 claims on its own. This amendment attempts to build on this achievement, and that is exactly what this incentive scheme should be doing. I have argued all along that the 30 per cent rebate should deal with the gaps issue. This has been a critical question in my mind in coming to the conclusion that I have come to within the last few hours: that is, to support this measure.
There were other factors which influenced my considerations thereon, but the issue of the gap is one which we have to deal with sooner or later, and the sooner the better. What these amendments do is deal with funds that do not offer these options to their members. These funds would no longer be permitted to offer the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction. In other words, any fund that does not offer to its members a no gap or known gap policy would not be able to offer the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction.
Therefore, the members could only access the rebate as a tax or cash rebate. Many who would be aware of this would move to other 
 funds that did meet the target and therefore could offer the 30 per cent premium reduction. The government cannot provide the committee with modelling to see how this would finally pan out, but anybody with any commonsense would realise that, in a competitive field such as private health insurance, the funds that could offer the no gap or known gap policies and therefore the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction would be at a considerable advantage in the marketplace as against those funds which would be unable to do that.
Those funds which would not offer that sort of policy would not be able to advertise or offer a cheaper premium based on the 30 per cent reduction in premium costs. Of course, the membership would be attracted to those that could. Clearly, it would provide an incentive to insurance companies to enter into agreements with private hospitals and with doctors, particularly specialists, so that they could offer the no gap or known gap policies. This is an advantage which should be considered by the committee as a step in the right direction to try to grapple with this vexed question of the gap.
I remind the committee that the thing that concerns members most is the cost of premiums, but this question of the gap is a matter that comes forward time and time again. People are complaining to us as members of parliament about it. You hear around the place in general conversation, `Yes, I had to go to the hospital. I was on top cover and thought I would be covered and now I'm receiving bill after bill after bill,' and those bills represent the amounts which were not picked up by Medicare or the fund and the person has to pay up out of their own pocket.
This is an attempt to overcome that situation. I appreciate that the funds would need a little time to ensure that this is worked out and to undertake the necessary negotiations with the private hospitals and with the medical profession. If the medical profession does not accept and cooperate and if they then do not themselves bring down their fees, then they are likely to face a real problem. If they do not do that, the whole private health system will be under so much pressure that it 
 is likely to collapse. I therefore submit these amendments to the committee in the hope that, though they are not the optimum, they are at least achievable with goodwill on all sides.
—That's what's needed.
—Yes, I agree, Senator Lees. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work you have done in the committee work and other areas. But at least these amendments are trying to address the problem. It might be argued that the doctors will just grasp this and say, `Oh, well, the funds will be responsible to pick up our tab, so we don't mind if we raise the fees. At least we won't have to send the bills to the patients. The health funds will have to pick up the tab.'
Those that do that I think would be seen as traitors to the private health system by their colleagues. There will be, I believe, a considerable incentive on the part of funds to ensure that costs are kept down, because if they are not then the members have to pay increased premiums. If the members have to pay increased premiums, that is the primary concern of members. That will lead to the destruction of the private health insurance funds and, ultimately, to the private system itself. Those doctors surely would be regarded as traitors to that particular cause.
I submit this as workable and also constitutional. There are other ways to try to pull the doctors, the medical profession, into line. That has been tried in a number of fields. Much of the work therein was useless because it was considered to be unconstitutional. This is not an unconstitutional provision. I urge the Committee to at least accept this as a start.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—Firstly, I say to Senator Harradine that I am pleased to see we have a step in the right direction. Just on that basis we would support it. However, unfortunately I see within this many problems—first of all, the way in which this amendment is worded. It says:
. . . unless the health fund provides its members with the choice of one or more of the following types of policies: 

I think virtually every health insurance company already fulfils this, and I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary if that is not indeed true.
My preferred option would have been that the 30 per cent rebate could only be available on policies where there was going to be no gap—in other words, if we could really have driven down the cost of those policies that really did offer everything. Looking at my home state, I congratulate the largest fund there. It has managed to do that, and a lot of people are now using that option. But my worry is that, given that in each state, except one state, there is a dominant insurer, the no-gap policy could indeed end up costing $6,000 and the premiums for ordinary existing policies for everyday hospital cover, which the minister has the final say in, would manage to stay down because the gaps will still be there. Those full hospital policies are the ones where you often get surgical and other gaps added on at the end, whereas with some policies there are absolutely no gaps.
I ask the parliamentary secretary: is it not the case already that most funds do provide the no-gap policy? In relation to the known gap, I ask the parliamentary secretary a second question: is it not the case already, and it is has been proven at law, that if a person wants to pursue a bill that they had no prior knowledge of they do not have to pay it anyway?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—I would like to respond to the comments of both Senator Harradine and Senator Lees. The government supports Senator Harradine's important amendment, as it goes a long way to supporting initiatives the government is already pursuing to address the issues of the gap. In fact, the Howard government has done more to reduce the incidence of the medical gap fees than the previous government. In the last 18 months we have seen major successes which would have been unimaginable only three years ago. HIC statistics show that an increasing number of in-hospital medical claims are being processed through agreements with health funds and through simpli 
 fied billing agents, many of which have eliminated gaps or shown known out-of-pockets.
I draw attention to this whole issue of the success that we have had in Victoria and South Australia with a number of admissions to hospitals with a no-gaps basis rising exponentially. We have a real prospect of making major changes nationally within the next 18 months. Certainly, in the calendar year 1998, we have gone from no no-gaps product existing in the country to no-gaps products being common place in two states and in early stages of start-up in others.
I know that Dr Wooldridge has talked at length about how we can hasten this. He, of course, has referred to the areas where we will be providing money for computer software development, which is one of the limiting factors, to changing the reinsurance pool to provide greater incentives for funds to offer no-gap products. Within the last week, Dr Wooldridge has brought Medibank Private to his office and instructed work in this area as a matter of urgency.
You will recall that the  Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1998  has just passed through the House of Representatives, and it has a number of measures to help costs, such as attempting to create a wholesale market in private health insurance and removing incentives for in-hospital treatment when a procedure could be done in rooms or as day surgery. Certainly much more needs to be done. Senator Harradine's amendment will help immeasurably in this regard, and we acknowledge its important contribution to this part of the legislation.
Senator Lees asked about the issue of existing policies. I am informed that current covers are only in the area that relates to hospital costs and cover such issues as accommodation, whereas the extension of what is now envisaged in Senator Harradine's amendment picks up new and innovative products that will be available and will move into the wider areas of medical assessment and medical need. We are certainly pleased to support Senator Harradine's amendment.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I will start by congratulating 
 Senator Harradine. I thought his second reading contribution was cogent, reasoned and convincing. I am sure anyone listening would have been convinced—if they had not been convinced when they heard the debate earlier—to vote down the bill. Unfortunately, he then reached a different conclusion to the one the whole logic and force of his argument had taken him to. I do not quite understand why, but I accept that he did.
What we have here is, it seems, a result of some discussions between the government and Senator Harradine this afternoon. The parliamentary secretary has indicated that the government is responding to what I think he described as `Senator Harradine's initiatives'. I suppose that goes to confirm the letter that I was given recently which purports to be from the Prime Minister to Senator Harradine confirming arrangements that they have reached between them regarding health insurance. I want to ask a couple of questions about those matters shortly.
This amendment is a very meagre step in the right direction. And, given all the criticisms that Senator Harradine and others made which highlighted that the bill did not tackle the real issues of private health insurance, this amendment did not tackle the funding of health care in this country. This amendment is a very unsatisfactory sole sign of moving to deal with one of those problems. What we are doing here is providing a $1.7 billion blank cheque and saying, `In addition to that, we might have this small amendment moved, and carried by the government, that would provide some signal that there would be some serious attempt to deal with the problem of the gap.'
I agree with Senator Harradine that the gap is one of the major issues. I think all minor party and Labor senators have stressed that this does nothing for that major issue, that we are throwing good money after bad without any of the reciprocal obligation that the government demands of social security recipients or unemployed persons in this country. In return for $300 a week of pension, all sorts of reciprocal and mutual obligations are demanded. But in return for $1.7 billion we demand nothing. We say, `Take the money 
 and we will have a look at some of the other problems down the track.'
Quite frankly, if Dr Wooldridge was in business, he would go broke very quickly. You never give them the money before you get the service. You certainly do not give them the money before you get some sort of sign of their commitment to provide some service in return. What we have done is provided an underwriting of 30 per cent of whatever the private health insurance funds choose to charge over the next however many years. They can increase premiums, knowing that we will always pay 30 per cent of the bill. I think that is an outrage in terms of public policy. While this amendment has some worthy objectives, it takes us no real way towards meeting our obligation to deal with the real problems or ensuring that we get a proper response from the health insurance industry.
Senator Harradine referred to the problem of modelling and costing that we found with the government's proposals, and I think he indicated that he had similar difficulties in costing this proposal. I think it is important that he or the parliamentary secretary provide some explanation, because the evidence given to the Senate committee of inquiry into this matter indicated that the cost of providing gap insurance would actually increase premiums by some 7½ per cent. I am not sure what the government and Senator Harradine are saying about this measure but, on the evidence of the private hospital industry, gap insurance would increase the total cost of premiums by 7½ per cent. Is that right? Is that the estimate of the cost of this measure—an increase in premiums of 7½ per cent? Is that the government's estimate as well?
And, will we be subsidising 30 per cent of that increase in cost? Is there any limit on the charges that can be applied to gap insurance? Surely it is going to be quite an expensive product, by anybody's reckoning. I would be interested to know what sort of restrictions or flexibility apply in that regard. Will any measures be taken to cap the cost of gap fees? I understood that Mr Chalmers of the private industry stated in his evidence at the committee hearing that there are no mechanisms by 
 which gaps can be quantified or capped. It is unclear to me how this measure is to work, how it is to be funded, or what the government estimates the cost of the measure to be. Obviously, some answers to those questions would assist the committee greatly.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—There are several issues that arise. I am surprised at Senator Evans's cynicism with regard to the bona fides of this particular amendment and the advantages that it certainly will bring. Whilst everyone has acknowledged the role that Senator Harradine has been able to play in brokering this important issue, I am sure there are many other parties whose willingness to reach real solutions should be acknowledged, such as the Australian Private Hospitals Association, the AMA and, in particular, the chairman, Dr Brand—I hope that he will not be undermined by people within his own area that have perhaps a different view to the executive of the AMA; we have certainly been cooperative and willing to pursue this matter very carefully and very properly—and, of course, the Private Health Insurance Association, which naturally has vested interests.
I think the leadership and the cooperation of those people need to be particularly commended. I believe that the challenge of this particular amendment will impose disciplines and special requirements on each of those areas. The doctors themselves, we acknowledge, will have an important role to play in the partnership, as will the hospitals and the various insurance companies.
Senator Evans asked a question with regard to intended premium rises. I am informed that it has been generally indicated that increases in premiums would certainly be much lower than any figures you have used—the seven per cent or so.
—No, as a result of this measure.
—I am sure as a result of this measure that increases would be lower—and also that they would not necessarily be implemented in the normal program of dates, which I think was intended to be about 
 March. It will probably be later. Any deferment in that area will, of course, have advantages as well.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-10,"—I want to ask Senator Harradine about the modelling that no doubt understraps these amendments and the health minister's statement that the government's rebate proposal would increase participation in health funds by three per cent and also prevent a projected fall in participation from 30 to 20 per cent over the coming five to 10 years. How will this measure enhance those figures? If it does not, it will be a failed measure. In other words, is it going to increase the participation rate in the health funds by more than three per cent?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—If I could add to that question, I wonder if Senator Harradine might advise whether he believes a decline in private health insurance is per se a problem or the problem, and whether or not the survival of the private system depends on private health insurance. We have had issues about figures and the inability, as we have all seen, of the government to be able to justify the modelling. We have had dubious claims about the rebate taking pressure off the public health system for all the reasons given to us, including the fact that it is inevitable that money gets taken out of the bottom if there is money going out the top, equity measures, opportunity costs and so on. I wonder if that basic question might be addressed by Senator Harradine: is it his belief that the decline in health insurance is a problem or the problem?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-10,"—If I could respond to the matters that have been raised with me in the order in which they have been raised. Senator Chris Evans indicated that he has a letter to me from the Prime Minister. He has been pretty sharp. I received that letter at 8.10 p.m. on 10 December, which is today. I understand the Prime Minister's office has released that letter, and I gave the okay for that. I think it would be desirable, since the letter is now in the public domain, to have the letter incorporated into Hansard . I seek leave to incorporate it into Hansard .
Leave granted.
The letter read as follows—
Senator Brian Harradine
Senator for Tasmania
Suite S1.38
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Senator Harradine
I refer to our recent discussions on the Government's private health insurance rebate legislation.
I consider that you have raised quite legitimate concerns about the `gaps' paid by people receiving treatment as privately insured patients. The Government believes that the amendment you have circulated would substantially address this problem and, accordingly, will support it. I note that the amendment would have the effect of setting a target of all private health insurance products having no gaps or known gaps by 1 July 2000. Funds that did not meet the target would not be permitted to offer the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction after that date. All fund contributors would, of course, retain access to a taxation or direct cash rebate.
I can also confirm that the Government will promote the facilitating measures concerning out of pocket costs and medical gaps previously discussed with Dr Wooldridge. These include:
.	 providing money for computer software development which is one of the limiting factors;
.	 changing the reinsurance pool to provide greater incentives for funds to offer no gap products; and
.	 asking Medibank Private to work on this area, as a matter of urgency.
We also discussed the provision of measures to alleviate the health problems of the aged and chronically ill. As you know, I made a major commitment at the recent ACOSS Congress to advance substantially the quality of health care delivered to older people, in the context of the International Year of Older Persons. Specifically, we will be:
.	 providing through Medicare for general practitioners to be involved in multi disciplinary care planning in case management for those with chronic and complex needs;
.	 giving incentives at the practice level for Gps to achieve multi disciplinary care plans for those over 65, or with chronic or complex need; and
.	 for those over 75, pay doctors to undertake an annual health assessment to focus on issues of prevention and better management of chronic illness. 
Further, we talked of the provision of a coordinated care plan for disadvantaged elderly people. This would be a very substantial change in our health care system and the Government is prepared to trial 
 it seriously. It is dependent on being able to cash-out hospital costs for a given group of people or a defined geographic area. The Government would also be willing to cash-out Medicare or pharmaceutical costs. I can confirm that in the next Budget, the Government will provide funds in the order of $25 million to run additional coordinated care trials in capital cities and selected regional centres to address the health care needs of older people who are chronically ill or disadvantaged.
The Government would, of course, appreciate your support in securing passage of the legislation in its amended form.
Yours sincerely
John Howard
—Senator Evans raised questions about possible increases in premiums that the covering of the gap would entail. I suggest to Senator Evans that that has not been the experience of the National Mutual company in South Australia, as I understand the situation. These figures are available. I do not have them with me. As I understand it, you have got National Mutual already offering those policies to its members in South Australia.
—Why do we need these amendments then?
—To encourage that sort of activity elsewhere. Perhaps I can deal with Senator Margetts's question in regard to this matter at the same time. The whole point about it is that the medical profession does acknowledge the fact that, if there is a breakdown in the health insurance system, the public hospital system will also go down the drain. We do have to look at the effects not only on those hospitals and on the membership of the funds—and let us understand that 30 per cent of people are now in funds—but also on the public hospital system itself if the other system breaks down. That is something that has been concerning me for some considerable time.
In response to Senator Margetts's question, the decline of the health insurance industry is not per se a problem, if you talk about per se, but the effects of that on both the members of the organisations and the public hospital system would, I believe, be quite disconcerting, if not devastating. Senator Brown, I am not sure I understood your question correctly. Maybe you could clarify it for me.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-10,"—The question comes out of the figures that the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, gave to me where he predicted that his measures in this legislation would increase the participation rate in insurance by three per cent. We would go from 30 per cent to 33 per cent. I know you were keen to have modelling on what the legislation was going to do. I wonder whether you have had modelling or whether you have had it from the government as to what improvement in that participation rate above 33 per cent your amendment will mean.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-10,"—No, I have not. Obviously the legislation does not consist of my measures. In fact, Senator Evans was correct when he referred to my speech. I indicate to the chamber that I prepared that speech—
—A couple of days ago.
—Well, I have been pretty flat out today. It has been a bit of a problem to change it.
—The last paragraph was different.
—Honourable senators might like to have a look in due course at the letter that I have incorporated in Hansard . It might indicate something as well.
In answer to Senator Brown, no, I have not. Surely it stands to reason that, if funds can make arrangements with the private hospitals and with the medical specialists, particularly in certain areas, then clearly it is going to mean that the funds will be more and more attractive—those funds that at least have that no gap or known gap policy. They will be more attractive because they will be able to offer the cheaper premium rates—the rates which are discounted by 30 per cent—whereas those that do not have those policies will not be able to offer the rates. You might see some adjustment amongst those particular funds. There would then be even more incentive for them and others to undertake the necessary discussions and negotiations with the medical profession and with the private hospitals. ",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-10,"—The difficulty with Senator Harradine's response is that it does come down to a supposition that there is going to be improved participation in health insurance because of the amendment he has made. The opposition has already made the point that one outcome is likely to be higher premiums, which has exactly the opposite effect because it would see more people shedding their private insurance. We are in the situation here of not knowing and that means, to some degree, flying by the seat of our pants.
It is a very important matter, because the alternative that the opposition and the Greens have been putting quite strongly is that it would be better for the $1.7 billion to be going into the public health system. This would have a very clear impact for the good on the medical health services delivery to the Australian populace as a whole.
The problem with Senator Harradine's amendment is that while it appears on the face of it that there may be some beneficial effect in increasing the participation in health insurance, beyond that we have nothing to go by. We are being asked to give up the alternative of a much improved public health system—if the money went in that direction—in the hope that there will be some degree of improvement in participation rates in private health insurance.
We have already heard Senator Harradine say that it would be traitorous for doctors to increase fees on the back of this measure. But there is nothing in this amendment or in the legislation to stop that happening. Doctors—and I am one of them—are human beings and past practice has shown that some of them at least will move to take monetary advantage from a system that allows them to do so. The only way we can stop that is by regulating. I would be much happier as a member of the medical profession if that were an outcome that we were entertaining here tonight. But we are not. Therefore, what the argument for this measure comes down to is that it sounds like a good idea.
One thing I would like to know, which might help the committee in deciding whether this idea is going to be effectual, is what the 
 participation rate in South Australia has been compared with other states. Has the participation rate in South Australia improved in recent times because of the availability of the no gap or known gap alternatives or hasn't it? If we could have those figures, it would give us some indication—even though it would be broad brush—as to whether in effect offering that policy option generally to the Australian populace is going to make a difference.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—At the risk of being accused of cynicism, I share Senator Brown's doubts about some of the claims being made for the proposition. Not much can be expected of propositions drawn up in haste without public scrutiny. This suffers from some of those faults. Senator Harradine has already admitted that this can be done and is already occurring, so I am not quite sure what the great impact of this alleged legislative support will be. I will return to it in a minute. There is no implementation for 18 months, so this is not a measure that will have any immediate impact. It suffers from a lack of review and defined objectives. But, as I say, there are some worthy sentiments contained in it.
I raised some concerns earlier. I think the parliamentary secretary may have misunderstood. I was not asking him what the costs of the measure are in terms of the package of the government's legislation; I was asking him what the costs will be of the amendment from Senator Harradine that has been agreed to by the government. Senator Lees asked the very question that Senator Harradine seeks to answer by this measure tonight. Mr Chalmers, from the Private Hospitals Association, provided the answer. This is not one of those witnesses who so upset Senator Knowles; this was Mr Chalmers from the Private Hospitals Association. When asked by Senator Lees about gap payments, he said at page 42 of the Hansard:
Senator, while my colleague is thinking about that, we have just done some quick `back of the notepad' calculations at the table. To answer the question of what would be the premium effect of covering existing medical gaps, that would require a premium increase in the order of 7.5 per cent. However, that would not necessarily ensure that the gap problem would be eliminated because there is 
 no mechanism by which gaps can be quantified or capped.
So Mr Chalmers from the Private Hospitals Association seemed to be indicating that the idea was a nonsense and that it was not feasible.
The parliamentary secretary may or may not agree with that. Given that he is voting for the amendment and co-sponsoring it, I assume he does not accept that view. But does he accept, and has the government done the calculations on, the cost to premiums of the gap insurance? Do you agree with the private hospitals' estimate that it will cost a 7.5 per cent increase in premiums? Senator Harradine has now put this letter into the Hansard. I appreciate his doing that. I was not sure how I would come by it. I wanted to be a bit careful. I was not even sure that it was genuine, even though it was handed to me by Senator O'Brien, who is usually a most reliable source. It just got handed to me a few minutes ago. I am glad that Senator Harradine has corrected the public record.
In this letter from the Prime Minister to Senator Harradine, the government seems to have agreed to a whole range of measures in addition to the one provided for in the amendment. They go to a number of trials, incentives, a reinsurance pool and computer software development. They include $25 million to run additional coordinated care trials in capital cities and selected regional centres. In addition to the question I asked about the cost of the premium increase, I ask: what is the total cost of the contents of the letter to Senator Harradine? What is the financial impact of these commitments on the Commonwealth government?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—I am pleased to note that Senator Evans once again notes how his introductory comments are often couched with cynicism. However, I do take seriously the questions that he has raised. One of the very important issues that must be addressed when we are dealing with private health insurance is the retention rate within the funds themselves. For many years now, the fall-off in membership has been one of the 
 most serious factors influencing the continuation of premiums and, in fact, rising premiums for members who stay within the funds.
Senator Brown referred to the South Australian experience. I know that National Mutual in South Australia has acknowledged that, in the changes to the system this year, the retention of membership has been one of the key goals. It is a very major economic factor in keeping the premiums either stable or as tightly measured as possible.
Senator Harradine's amendments now reinforce that opportunity for the funds to have innovative, new and special products that will not only appeal to retaining membership but also, hopefully, to expanding it and encouraging people in different areas. It will certainly be very focused in that area. The costs will have to be measured by the funds. Naturally, there will be normal economic adjustments based on their membership and participation, which are so vitally important. I believe that this amendment will go a long way to stabilising that area.
Senator Evans referred to the letter from the Prime Minister to Senator Harradine of today's date which acknowledges and puts on the record a number of the government's very important initiatives, not only those that Dr Wooldridge has been keenly pursuing now for some time in a number of particular areas and which I mentioned earlier in the debate this evening. The fact that Dr Wooldridge has been working for some time now in the area of gaps naturally meant that he, Senator Harradine and the Prime Minister were able to reach some very important agreements on this whole matter of the objectives that have surfaced in Senator Harradine's amendments.
Senator Evans refers to the other parts of the letter in which the Prime Minister acknowledges, very properly, to Senator Harradine that there are a number of other ongoing government programs to which he has alluded previously, particularly at the recent ACOSS Congress. Certainly, I am aware of the directives and the determination of both the Prime Minister and Dr Wooldridge in changing the areas of quality health care and how that is to be achieved, 
 particularly measuring outcomes in a number of ways. The Prime Minister has quite rightly set out that there will be initiatives in the context of the International Year of Older Persons and has named a number of specific projects that the government was in the course of developing and has put on the record.
With regard to the area that Senator Evans mentioned, the coordinated care trials, I am pleased to note that the Prime Minister has confirmed a particular amount—and it may even be larger when the budget comes around—for these important projects. The coordinated care trials will have tremendous advantage not only for aged and elderly people but also for people in regional centres throughout Australia. I can speak from personal experience, as there are currently two such coordinated care trials operating in the Northern Territory, specifically in Aboriginal communities. They will have a major impact in delivering important health care outcomes.
I for one would certainly acknowledge that it is important that coordinated care trials should be expanded and built up to address the area of care for people in regional centres. If they are as successful as those that are operating in the Territory and elsewhere in Australia, I am sure that the advantage to people—particularly older people—who are chronically ill or disadvantaged will have a major impact.
I am sure that Senator Harradine welcomed the letter. I would say that most people in the community certainly would have. Many more of the items will be advanced in budget considerations and will certainly appear in full detail in the forward estimates in the budget.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-12-10,"—I will ask the parliamentary secretary two questions but before I do that I will comment on something Senator Harradine said about his concerns at the way the level of private health insurance is dropping. Senator Harradine, even if we went down to only 20 per cent insured, that would cost us only $830 million to $900 million per year and not the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in this spending.
Parliamentary Secretary, I asked you earlier if it was not the case already that if people 
 wished to pursue unknown gaps—in other words, if they went in for an operation believing they were fully covered but then got a gap payment—they could take that through the process and find out that they did not have to pay. Hasn't that already been tried at law? Secondly, the minister has to approve increases in the cost of premiums set for the funds. Will the minister agree to an increase of what I suspect Mr Chalmers is right in saying is going to be about 7½ per cent on top of the increase that is already in the pipeline for next year—an increase that we understand is somewhere between five per cent and eight per cent?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—Whilst the parliamentary secretary is seeking advice on that matter, perhaps I could add a further question. Part of the premise upon which the amendments are based is, I believe, that there will be a choice and an option, once there are further incentives, for health schemes to offer `no gap' or `no known gap' insurance. It sounds a bit like a product for sticking windows together, doesn't it? Once there is that extra incentive, what does it mean for states if they have very few choices already in health insurance packages or products? Does the parliamentary secretary have any specific figures on the coverage of health insurance and the numbers of health insurance products that are available in each state? I believe that in Western Australia we may have three. If that is not true, perhaps you can clarify that. What would happen? Is the government able to take any action if all three funds get together and decide not to offer this package?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—First I will address the two issues raised by Senator Lees. Her first question was in regard to unknown gaps. I am advised that that particular area would be treated as for any other debts. The second question posed was whether the government would agree to any increases on top of what may already be contemplated. Again, I am advised that we do not anticipate that any increases would be in the same proportion as those of previous years. In 
 fact, Senator Harradine's amendment opens the area for negotiation to militate against this.
Senator Margetts raised the question of how the impact would influence states and the agreements. Certainly, the recently negotiated arrangements with the states have been important. With regard to the public health systems area, I would remind Senator Margetts that the Howard government has provided the biggest ever increase in funding for public health systems: over $7.2 billion, an increase of 19 per cent. In forecasting that into the future, we have to be very mindful of the impact on national budgets. Any improvement in the area of private health insurance will militate against those future imposts on states.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—I thank the parliamentary secretary for his answer, but that was not actually the question I asked. I may have said `packages' when I meant `funds'. Does the parliamentary secretary have some information he can provide to us about the number of funds that exist in states or territories? What would happen if, in a state or territory which had only a few funds, none of those funds offered a package for no gaps?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—We will certainly make that information available to Senator Margetts. With regard to the arrangements in states, I am firmly of the view that the innovation proposed in these amendments is going to create a special market pressure on funds, no matter where they are located—in any state or territory—and I am sure that it will be a very competitive market.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I will just follow that up because Senator Margetts raised one of the scenarios. I want to take us back to one of the clauses in the amendments that Senator Harradine has moved. The proposed clause states:
The Minister must not approve an application by a *health fund for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2000 or a later financial year unless the 
 health fund provides its members with the choice of one or more of the following types of policies:
(a)	 a *no gap policy;
(b)	 a *known gap policy.
In effect, that looks like a sanction that is to be applied against the health funds—that is, unless they provided this choice, there would be some sanction. The letter that Senator Harradine received today from the Prime Minister, which has been incorporated, states:
I note that the amendment would have the effect of setting a target of all private health insurance products having no gaps or known gaps by 1 July 2000. Funds that did not meet the target would not be permitted to offer the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction after that date. All fund contributors would, of course, retain access to a taxation or direct cash rebate.
It seems to be a slightly different understanding of the sanction. So I would like some clarification as to whether the sanction is to be applied against the health funds if they do not provide this choice or, as it appears in the Prime Minister's letter, whether the only sanction is that they would not be able to offer that particular rebate as a premium reduction, that people would still be able to get the taxation or direct cash rebate.
Is the sanction on the fund really only restricting them in terms of one of the three options of paying the rebate to people but not restricting them from continuing not to offer the policies that you are suggesting are vital? I just want to get it clear what Senator Harradine thinks the amendment does.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-12-10,"—That is precisely what the amendment does. That is a penalty. Is that not a sufficient penalty? You could then have a number of funds offering the no gap or known gap policies having their premiums presented to potential fund members at a particular rate; others would not. Those that did not so offer could not provide on any of their tables a cut rate from their premium.
In the marketplace—if you are talking about the marketplace—it is an enormous advantage and an enormous incentive for funds to make sure that they offer this particular product, and it is what I propose in this amendment. To do otherwise would be to penalise the 
 fund members for the failure of the fund to do what it ought to be doing. It would be unfair to penalise the fund members by taking away their 30 per cent reduction provided either by cash or through the taxation system. When advertising, the funds that were not participating and were not offering these particular policies would be at a great disadvantage because, in particular tables by comparison with the other funds, their premiums would have to be advertised 30 per cent above the others.
I come back to a point that you made. You are concerned about the failure of this to cap the fees that are charged by specialists. I think it will have the effect of capping them because there will be a lot of pressure on the funds to come to arrangements with public hospitals, particularly with medical specialists. But, let me make it clear to the committee, as most members of the committee must know, that it is, unfortunately, unconstitutional for the parliament to cap the fees of medical specialists. Senator Brown said we ought to be regulating them. Quite frankly, I tell you right here and now that I would be the first one doing that. But we cannot. I have been through it the last few weeks and you cannot do it. The states do have the powers to fix fees, but we do not. I know it is not perfect, but at least it is an advance. I am putting it to the committee and am hoping that it will be carried.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-12-10,"—We ought to have the states come together with the Commonwealth for that purpose. We do it on so many other things, so I cannot see why we cannot do it when coming to an arrangement on capping medical fees. That seems to me to be an extremely good goal.
I want to raise two things. What improvement has there been in the participation rate in South Australia, which has this system that is being advocated or promoted in this amendment, vis-a-vis the other states? Margaret in my office tells me that, in 1997, hospital cover in South Australia—this is an average sort of scheme—had gone to 267 per cent of 1989 levels compared with 220 per cent for the country as a whole. In other 
 words, premiums have gone up faster in South Australia than they have in the rest of the country. Is this related to the fact that South Australia had this rapid change across to a known gap option? I do not know, but that is the sort of thing this committee should know.
It is a pity that we do not have time here to look at the ramifications of this amendment. I suggest, Senator Harradine, that it would have been a more assured outcome for you had the analysis and scrutiny that should have taken place on this amendment been made before we had the vote on it. As it is, nothing is going to change.
The other point evident here is: sure, as Senator Harradine says, some funds will be able to say, `Look, our premiums are 30 per cent lower.' But what is to stop the other funds from saying, `Look, our premiums are higher, but you're going to get a cheque in the mail or a tax deduction as a result of this new scheme coming in, and overall our premiums will be lower.' If the only thing to come out of this is to be an advertising advantage that will induce people into the funds, all of us in this committee know that a good advertising person will be able to put the argument in the other direction if fund participants themselves are to be able to get the benefit of the rebate—even if the fund cannot give it in reduction of cost of premiums.
I think we will not see much good result at all come out of this amendment. But we will see a heck of a lot of money go from the government coffers, into the rebate incentive, into the private system. As a committee, we are left with no figures, no modelling, no argument essentially, other than this being a good advertising way of increasing membership. I just do not think that is good enough, particularly considering the amount of money that is involved.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I agree with Senator Brown, but his arguments against Senator Harradine's amendment hold true of the whole bill. While I think it is a good argument, as I say, the government has not provided any modelling for any of this, so I do not think it takes us 
 much further. Yes, we have another amendment that is uncosted, unmodelled, with no real idea of impact—but then the whole bill is like that. So I have given up on that argument. That has had no weight and no success in moving the Senate more generally.
I do not want to spend too much time on this because, quite frankly, I think it is a very modest minor amendment that does not go to the heart of this bill nor to the heart of the problems of private health insurance. I think the sort of thing that Senator Harradine talked about in terms of sanction is more of a minor inconvenience to the funds. Nevertheless, that is not really essential debate on the bill. I do not think we ought to delay the committee stage too long on that issue. I think there are much bigger issues in terms of the bill.
I think it is unfortunate that we have not got any costings out of the parliamentary secretary in relation to this measure, nor in relation to the undertakings given to Senator Harradine. They obviously add to the total cost of this package; they add to the money that the government is throwing at getting this package through the parliament—and I think it is not unreasonable for us to expect to have that properly costed and be put before the parliament. But that is obviously not going to happen.
Again, I do not want to labour the point, but it is more money thrown at the problem in order to get the bill passed, because that is the political imperative. There is no health imperative, there is no economic imperative. It is just, `Throw money at the problem, get it fixed, get it passed; if we need to give $25 million for coordinated care, we'll throw that in as well; when you've got $1.5 billion, what's another $25 million? It's all big numbers and it's all got out of control, and there's no basis for any of it, there's no modelling for any of it—so, what the heck, what's a bit more? But the failure of the government to provide any costing on that I think is a sad reflection.
I just want to make this clear: the Labor Party is most concerned about gaps. They are a major issue. They need to be treated seriously. They need to be treated more seriously than was possible, it seems, in a couple of 
 hours of discussions this afternoon in order to get a compromise to get the bill passed. What we proposed—and what the Democrats and the Greens proposed—was a proper look at these issues; that we would not pass this bill until we dealt with the gaps issue, until we dealt with the premium rises issue and had a coordinated thorough look at how to get good health policy. What we have instead is a slipshod bill that is throwing money at the problem, throwing money at people who do not need support, and denying that health support to people who do need it.
As I say, I do not want to labour this issue any longer. I do not disagree with the objectives; I think they are worthy. It is a major issue that needs to be tackled. I do not think this amendment goes anywhere near far enough in dealing with that. But that is not to say that it is not worth supporting, in the sense that it is at least giving some recognition to the problem and some recognition to the fact that we need to do much more about gaps and premiums. But, as I say, we will not solve those problems tonight because there is no serious attempt to deal with those problems in this bill.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—Senator Brown raised the issue of the statistics based on South Australia. Obviously he has put them together based on anecdotal comment, whether in his office or elsewhere. But I appreciate his concern. I will seek that information for him. I was under the impression that what he was seeking was rather like comparing apples and pears, particularly with regard to the time scales covered. Looking at the prospective nature of what is intended in this legislation and the advantages of keeping people in a good and proper and balanced system, I thought they would be more the objectives and the purposes that we ought to be focusing on.
Both Senator Evans and Senator Brown have raised a number of commercial and economic issues in that area, whether relating to the sanctions or other issues. All I can say is that, from my experience in business, obviously there is a big difference between 
 us: with their appreciation of the factors of commerce and economic priorities and business operations, I would say that they are way off the track.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-12-10,"—Just quickly, I would put one little perspective on this. If the competitive market is used as the model for the way this particular measure will work, you have to keep in mind that a competitive model works on full information. So I guess that people actually would have to go off and find out the information from the various health funds.
But also with the ability to quickly transfer, I believe—and, okay, these are my personal feelings—that people generally stick with a fund, unless they make a major decision to change. If I am not mistaken, that usually happens because there are substantial penalties with what you can claim and what you cannot claim. I do not know that you can transfer those over from one fund to another, but for many kinds of health care you have to wait a certain number of years.
The private health insurance market operates in such a way that people will not transfer from one fund to the other, like in superannuation, because they are concerned about losing benefits they have to wait several years to obtain. The reality is that this market does not operate in the way a lot of other markets operate—not even in the way superannuation funds operate—and we have to keep those issues in mind when we think about incentives we are offering to create a market situation or to keep people in a market. It might have an impact on attracting new people to the market, but this has been unproven in all the statistics we have been asked to believe. In reality, it will not necessarily operate as a real market incentive for those existing clients of health insurance, because you are unable to easily move from one fund to the other without losing some of the benefits you have to wait for.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech

I can also confirm that the Government will promote the facilitating measures concerning out of 
 pocket costs and medical gaps previously discussed with Dr Wooldridge. These include:
.	 providing money for computer software development which is one of the limiting factors;
What precisely is meant by `one of the limiting factors'? I do not understand what is meant by that. What are these limiting factors?

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I will pursue that one at estimates with a great deal of interest to look at the privacy aspects in a few of those. It is the third point that really interests me, which states that the government will be:
. . . 	 asking Medibank Private to work on this area, as a matter of urgency.
What compensation is going to be put in place for Medibank Private to undertake this work? What are the guidelines and the terms of reference for the work that Medibank Private will undertake?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—Given that Senator West is quoting from a letter of today's date, I think it is quite appropriate to point out that these are matters that will be developed between the various parties.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-10,"—It is a bit like a pig in a poke. Medibank Private was separated from Medicare some time ago as far as its accommodation was concerned, because there was a need, we were told, for it to be able to compete and it had to be put on a level playing field. I want to ensure that Medibank Private remains on a level playing field. I would have thought this had already been considered and, according to this letter, this is not the first time this discussion has happened. What guarantees can the government give to ensure that Medibank Private remains on a level playing field?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—This is not a matter that really relates to this particular legislation. Whilst the Prime Minister's letter and my comments earlier this evening referred to the conversations between Dr Wooldridge and Medibank Private, they are matters that will be pursued and Medibank Private will be competing with other funds already offering no gaps.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I do not understand how the parliamentary secretary can make that point. We have in our possession a letter from the Prime Minister to Senator Harradine, which has kindly been provided, that commences:
Dear Senator Harradine
I refer to our recent discussions on the Government's private health insurance rebate legislation.
And it concludes:
The Government would, of course, appreciate your support in securing passage of the legislation in its amended form.
The issues of substance that Senator West raised happen to be in the body of the letter. How can the parliamentary secretary seriously say to this committee that this matter is not relevant to the legislation that is being debated by the committee at this time? It is obviously an element of the deal that has been struck between Senator Harradine and the government. That must be obvious to everyone. I am sure even Senator Harradine would accept that is the case. I think it is quite disingenuous for the parliamentary secretary to come into this place and make that point in response to a serious question raised by Senator West.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—It is a pity Senator Faulkner has not taken the time to read the letter very carefully. In the third paragraph of the letter, the Prime Minister says:
I can also confirm that the Government will promote the facilitating measures concerning out of pocket costs and medical gaps previously discussed with Dr Wooldridge. These include:
And then three points:
.	 providing money for computer software development which is one of the limiting factors;
.	 changing the reinsurance pool to provide greater incentives for funds to offer no gap products; and
.	 asking Medibank Private to work on this area, as a matter of urgency.
I mentioned earlier in the debate this evening that the minister for health is pursuing those matters at length and has been for some time. The Prime Minister's letter confirms to Senator Harradine that those important objectives have a good standing. They are matters of government activity that very rightly were confirmed to Senator Harradine.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-12-10,"—We know that the negotiations have not just been limited to one discussion between Senator Harradine and the Prime Minister and one letter from the Prime Minister to Senator Harradine. Surely the parliamentary secretary is not going to suggest that is the case. Really and truly, you cannot con all of us all of the time, Senator Tambling. It is quite clear what has occurred here.
These things happen in politics. Deals are struck. Arrangements are come to. This is a done deal, Senator Tambling. Don't try to con me that this isn't an element—and it might even be quite an important element—of the deal that has been struck. Don't suggest for one minute, just because there were preliminary discussions and negotiations, that they don't form part of the deal. That is why I happen to believe that Senator West is entitled to a proper response to a serious question in relation to this matter when a letter like this is made public in the fashion it has.
We all know why it has been made public. We all know that, in order to get this piece of legislation through this committee, through the Senate, these arrangements have been come to between the government and Senator Harradine. A lot of people would say, `Well, that is the way the place works.' It is not that 
 unusual in politics. It is part of the political process for a deal to be struck. But let's not have sanctimonious hypocrisy from the responsible parliamentary secretary handling the bill for the government suggesting that that is not an integral part of the arrangement that has been come to.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,"—It is strange that Senator Faulkner would want to play theatre in an Alice in Wonderland  type of environment. Surely he is aware from his experience, both as a minister and in this place, that governments do operate multifaceted and complementary policy initiatives. The Prime Minister's letter merely confirms that there are a number of complementary policy initiatives in this area. It is quite within very good grounds to establish that in any letter to Senator Harradine, as he would with many other constituents on health issues.",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-10,"—We know that initially the government was saying that this 30 per cent tax rebate was going to cost $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. We found out last Friday from the department that there was a mistake; it is now $1.7 billion. But on the Medibank Private work area alone, what is this going to blow the budget out to? Where is this going to take the additional costs out to?",SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-12-10,—I think the Labor Party is engaging in catch the trick type questions. This is irrelevant to this legislation. The issues relating to Medibank Private are matters relating to other areas of government policy and will be appropriately funded in those areas of government.,SENATE,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-12-10,"—I say to the parliamentary secretary that this is not irrelevant to this legislation. We are talking about the gap part of the insurance. We are talking about private health insurance rebates. There are costs in this to the government. What we want to know is what are the costs to the government. Is there an estimate, a guesstimate? Or are we just buying, as I said earlier, a pig in a poke—you 
 don't have any idea what it is going to do to the budget? We have the right, as a responsible opposition and as a responsible parliament, to ask what the ramifications are for these changes in terms of cost.

Leave granted.
The report read as follows—
The References Committee met on 10 December 1998 and considered references not disposed of at the end of the 38th Parliament.
The Committee resolved to recommend to the Senate that:
The following inquiry of the 38th Parliament not be re-adopted:
The Rights and Obligations of the Media.
The Committee first reported on this matter in 1994, with its report `Off the Record: Shield Laws for Journalists' Confidential Sources'. Although the Committee believes this issue is important, it does not consider it appropriate to continue with a matter that was first referred in May 1993. It would prefer to start with a new reference on the matter and will consider this at a later time.

That the report be adopted.
—I think it is always good that, when a motion is sprung on, we know what we are adopting. A report being noted is one thing. In relation to a report being adopted, it is nice if we know what we are adopting.
—It is renewal of references from the last parliament.
—Senator Margetts, I was handed this particular matter on behalf of Senator McKiernan, who I see is in the chamber. My understanding is that the references committee met on 10 December 1998 and considered references not disposed of at the end of the 38th Parliament. The committee resolved to recommend to the Senate that, firstly, the following inquiry of the 38th 
 Parliament—the rights and obligations of the media—not be re-adopted, the committee's first report on this matter in 1994, and its report of off-the-record shield laws for journalists' confidential sources. Although the committee believes the issue to be important, it does not consider it appropriate to continue with a matter that was first referred to it in May 1993. It would prefer to start with a new reference on the matter and will consider this at a later time.
—Thank you for that clarification. You can imagine why I, over the last couple of days, have been a bit careful about what I am adopting and voting on in relation to committee reports.

That the Senate do now adjourn.
It has been a momentous year for all sorts of reasons. The election result was one that I am sure many opposite did not expect. In fact, they were very confident that they would get the opposite result. They did not and they now consign themselves to three more years of hard labour.
I do want to pay tribute to my colleagues, particularly those in the Liberal and National parties—Senator Boswell in particular for his sterling leadership of the junior coalition partner. He was there shoulder to shoulder when he was needed. He did understand the real benefits for rural Australia in a number of the policies that we took into the last election and he was prepared to see it through. So I think he deserves a particular commendation.
I would also like to pay tribute to the work of Senator Hill, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and to you, Madam President, for the way you have conducted yourself under very difficult circumstances on many occasions from the likes of me and others. You have always managed to control proceedings in a manner that has ensured that people at the end of the day respect the chair and all that ought to be respected in this chamber.
I would also like to pay particular tribute to the work of the whip and the whip's clerk, Senator Calvert and Claire Dace, who is taking leave of absence—this is well earned and I hope that we will be seeing her back here in the not too distant future. I also pay 
 tribute to Senator Coonan for her rapid ascension to a position of high eminence and her great enthusiasm and enjoyment for the role. We have certainly appreciated the work that she has carried out on our behalf.
I also pay tribute to the tremendous work of the Senate PLO, Gail Bansemer, and her assistant, Jacquie. They go beyond the call of duty, but nonetheless they are always there when needed. I would also like to thank the officials and the clerks, John Vander Wyk in particular, all Senate staff, the attendants, security, transport, Hansard and Library officers—all of whom ensure the smooth running of the Senate.
I simply conclude by hoping that the Christmas season will enable all of us to have a well-earned rest, to reflect on what might have been and what is ahead of us in the year to come. I trust that those on the other side of the chamber will come back to this Senate chamber refreshed, aware of the errors of their ways and prepared to be constructive and embrace sensible government policy.

Therefore, statistics in relation to federal unfair dismissal claims can only be provided for parts (a), (d) and (e).
(a) There were 8,092 termination of employment applications lodged under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 in 1997-98. Of those applications, 6,303 (78 per cent) were settled by agreement (ie had been withdrawn, settled or otherwise discontinued prior to conciliation or settled at conciliation or withdrawn, discontinued or otherwise settled after conciliation but prior to final orders).
(d) There were 774 contested federal cases decided in 1997-98, with 311 (40 per cent) decided in favour of the employer and 463 (60 per cent) in favour of the employee. (It may be noted that 282 of the decisions in favour of the employee involved applications against Gordonstone Coal Management based on the same fact situation; if these 282 applications are treated as one class action, then 63 per cent of contested cases would have been decided in favour of the employer and 37 per cent in favour of the employee.)
(e) Reinstatement was awarded in only 17 (2 per cent) of the 774 contested federal cases.
(2) The Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, Mr Rob Bastian, based his estimate that 50 000 jobs would be created if small businesses were exempt from federal unfair dismissal laws on the, in his view conservative, premise that 1 in 20 small businesses would hire at least one more employee if the exclusion was to come into force.
Applying this formula to the percentage of small businesses in each State or Territory (according to data published in Small Business in Australia 1997, ABS Cat No. 1321.0), approximately 16 500 jobs would be created in NSW, 12 500 in VIC, 9 500 in QLD, 4 000 in SA, 5 500 in WA, 1 000 in TAS and 500 each in the ACT and NT.
(3) Figures for the number of jobs created in each State and Territory in 1996 and 1997 (trend series annual averages) are as follows. (Source: ABS Labour Force Survey.)

There are a number of factors that contribute to the differences in labour market performance across the States and Territories. For example, the States and Territories generally rely on different industries for economic and employment growth. As such, any changes in policy or economic conditions which affect sectors in a non-uniform manner can be expected to have different impacts on employment. Similarly, characteristics such as population size and growth, natural attributes and climatic conditions also contribute to the differences in employment growth.
The reduction in the number of unfair dismissal applications indicates that progress has been made under the current legislation in discouraging inappropriate applications. This in itself would not be expected to create additional jobs in the small business sector. The Government considers that further change is required to recognise the particular circumstances of small businesses as well as to provide greater certainty for employers about the length of an employee's employment before that person can initiate an unfair dismissal application (no change is proposed in respect of unlawful dismissal applications). It is necessary to provide security for employers that they will not be subject to inappropriate applications. This is provided for in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998, presently before the Parliament.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Unfair Dismissals</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,50,1,answer
