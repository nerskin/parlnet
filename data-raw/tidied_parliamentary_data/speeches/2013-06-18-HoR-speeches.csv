Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:19):  The report-once, use-often framework will allow charities to report once to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and for authorised government agencies to then access this information, therefore eliminating the need for charities to report the same information to different government agencies. While the initial focus of the commission is to reduce reporting duplication at the Commonwealth level, it is also discussing the role it can play with states and territories. The commission is already proving to be an invaluable resource for charities and not-for-profits and demonstrates that this government's reforms are transforming the sector.


The bills we are debating today, the Charities Bill 2013 and the Charities (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, are a part of this government's reform agenda. These bills introduce a statutory definition of 'charity' that applies to all Commonwealth legislation. The meaning of 'charity' and 'charitable purpose' has not been previously comprehensively defined for the purposes of Commonwealth law, but, rather, it has been administered on the basis of principles derived from common law. This has resulted in a charity law that is sometimes inconsistent and does not necessarily reflect the contemporary Australian charity sector.


The development of a statutory definition of charity and charitable purpose was first recommended in the report of the 2001 inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations. It was reiterated in the recommendations of the Australia's Future Tax System Review in 2010. The Productivity Commission, in its 2010 report Contribution of the not-for-profit sector, also recommended the introduction of a statutory definition. A single statutory definition of a charity will provide greater clarity and certainty for charities, the public and regulators in determining whether an entity is charitable. In keeping with the government's broader reform agenda, it will also cut down on compliance costs for those wishing to establish charities and make the definition more accessible and easier to understand for the community. Importantly, the statutory definition will not be absolute; rather, it will retain the flexibility inherent in the common law that will enable the courts and parliament to continue to develop the definition within the statutory framework, maintaining its relevance to this evolving sector.


I would like to take this opportunity to commend the public consultation that has been undertaken in the development of these bills. In my electorate of Canberra, we are home to a great many charities and not-for-profit organisations, as well as those that service the Canberra community, and we are home to many national and international organisations who choose to be based in our nation's capital. I know that these organisations were actively involved in the development and consultation on the statutory definition and I thank them for their contribution.


Finally, on Saturday I visited a wonderful charity in my electorate, the St Vincent de Paul Society—or 'Vinnies', as we know it—op shop at Narrabundah. I am sure many of my parliamentary colleagues all have a Vinnies op shop operating in some capacity in their electorates and know of the important work they do to help those less fortunate in our communities. Last Friday, Vinnies at Narrabundah celebrated its 50th anniversary of serving the Canberra community. It is an incredible milestone. Vinnies is an example of a charity that works tirelessly to support the community, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the countless volunteers who have given up their time and effort and energy to work at Vinnies over the past 50 years, particularly Maureen Johnston, the store's current manager. It has remained in the same location in Narrabundah for 50 years. While there have been a few revamps to the shop and the shopfront, it is essentially in the same location, serving the same strong community for 50 years. It is an extraordinary achievement.


This government is dedicated to supporting a strong, vibrant, diverse and independent charity and not-for-profit sector. These bills enable that and I know that they will be welcomed by the charities and not-for-profits in my electorate. I commend these bills to the House.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (12:24):  These bills seek to introduce a definition of 'charity' and 'charitable purpose' that would apply across all government legislation from 1 January 2014 and constitute yet another example of Labor's regulatory overreach. The definition of charity and charitable purpose has not previously been comprehensively legislated in this country. Since Federation, the definition of charity has remained clear and consistent. It has remained a cornerstone underpinning what constitutes a charitable endeavour and what constitutes a charitable activity. The definition is based on a legal concept from 1601. It is widely understood and it is unilaterally accepted, having evolved over a 400-year evolutionary period in a manner that properly reflects changing community and societal standards.


But now that definition that has served us so well is in this government's firing line. The government wants to abandon what works, what has been proven and what has been broadly accepted by society and replace it with the government's own definition. Not even charities are safe from this government's obsession with regulatory overreach and the ever-present need for it to create more and more red tape, and so it goes. Now it has charities in its sights.


Australian charities law has closely followed the definition of charity based on the preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth. English common law is the principal basis for charities law in Australia in both state and federal courts, and each of the state jurisdictions has retained almost identical interpretations of the common-law definition of charity. The government is now seeking to pretend that there is some desperate need to legislate in this area, acting as if it is charting new waters.


The great reality of all this is that the former, Howard government looked at the issue of creating a common-law definition of charity. Former Prime Minister John Howard announced an inquiry into the definition of charity on 18 September 2000. The inquiry reported in 2001 and it made 27 recommendations. Former Treasurer Peter Costello released draft legislation in 2003 which took the traditional four heads of charity and divided them into seven heads of charity, in line with the inquiry's finding—namely, the advancement of health, education, social or community welfare, religion, culture, natural environment and any other purpose that is beneficial to the community. The Board of Taxation reported on the workability of the draft legislation in 2004 and the then government, through the then Treasurer, announced that the common-law meaning of charity would continue to apply but that the definition would be extended to include certain childcare and self-help groups, as well as closed or contemplative religious orders. The government decided not to proceed with the draft charities bill. The former coalition government enacted the Extension of Charitable Purposes Act, which confined itself to enlarging the legal definition of charity for federal purposes to include childcare and self-help groups and closed religious orders. The Commonwealth's definitional extension has not been adopted by any state jurisdiction.


This bill would be the first time that legislation has sought to so comprehensively define it in statute for the purposes of Commonwealth law. Our concern is clear: why create statute where the common law has served and does serve us so well? Why depart from 400 years of clarity and consistency? There is a fundamental philosophical divide between the approach of the coalition and that of the government. The coalition's approach to charities is somewhat different to that of the government. Labor prefers unwanted, unwarranted intervention, and approaches the sector with distrust, demanding huge amounts of information and draconian reporting requirements, making it so tough for the volunteers and charities the government claims to support. They go along every day doing countless hours of volunteer work out there in the community.


The coalition's approach is all about empowering people, not exercising power over them. It is an approach that the Leader of the Opposition utilised when he referred to Abraham Lincoln's famous description of democracy as 'of the people, by the people and for the people'. It is not a new approach, but it is one which both the Rudd and the Gillard government have trashed beyond recognition. The coalition has confidence in civil society, and we believe that the political community should be of service to civil society.


Australian not-for-profits lend a hand to those in need and they make our country so much a better place through education, volunteers, sports, arts and welfare organisations. Every day Australia's charity and not-for-profit sector repeats countless hundreds and thousands of acts of kindness, and their generosity makes our country a much better place to live in. That is why the coalition is standing up for not-for-profits and charities in opposing Labor's proposed Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission, which will result in the kind of regulatory overreach that has become so typical of the Gillard government—more red tape and more costs on a sector that is already under great pressure. Labor's proposed Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission, the ACNC, is predicated on the belief that Australia's charities and not-for-profits are doing something inherently wrong and need greater government oversight. The coalition rejects this belief. The ACNC will make life harder for volunteers and it will discourage involvement in the voluntary and community sector. By failing to work with the states and territories to create a single national framework, the Gillard government will increase the costs of running a charity or not-for-profit organisation and give the government more say in how charities and not-for-profits are administered. Instead of reducing red tape and unnecessary costs, the ACNC will add more red tape for charities and for not-for-profits. 


While the ACNC will initially only cover those charities with exemptions, Labor's framework will allow an eventual expansion. Under these bills, the ACNC will require more information from yet another agency of government: a new national charities and not-for-profits register will be created to include information regarding contact details, governing rules, financial and information statements of NFPs, and the information will be made available on the internet. It will increase reporting requirements. A new reporting framework will be established and all registered entities will be required to provide an annual information statement. Medium and large entities will also be required to provide annual financial reports.


What the government is calling the 'charities passport' is really a new 'red tape passport'; that is what they should call it. It will provide government with more powers to deregister charities. The ACNC will have the power to register and deregister not-for-profit entities. Registration would be required for organisations to access Commonwealth exemptions, concessions and benefits, including tax concessions. It will provide the ACNC with more powers than the regulators of Australian businesses. The ACNC will be able to demand information, search premises and inspect items on premises, and seize documents or electronic equipment found on premises. Enforcement of a range of laws will be the responsibility of the ACNC. The ACNC will have powers to issue warning notices; issue directions; enter into enforceable undertakings; apply to the courts for injunctions; suspend or remove responsible entities; and appoint acting responsible entities. The ACNC will also be able to remove responsible officers. It will give government a bigger say in the operations of registered entities. The ACNC sets up a framework for a set of governance standards which will apply to registered entities and have a set of external conduct standards which apply to all registered entities, regardless of entity type. These standards can cover such things as the content of a registered entity's governing rules, the conduct of the registered entity and the processes that the registered entity must have in place. 


Nowhere are these unwelcome and unwarranted intrusions resulting from these bills more apparent than for schools and charities based in my electorate of Brisbane. Charities like the Red Cross, which is headquartered in Brisbane, Rosie's Friends on the Street, who work with homeless people, the 139 Club, and Communify in the suburb of Paddington, who work with refugees and the homeless, will all be impacted by these changes. In addition, the electorate of Brisbane is also home to many independent schools who have raised significant concerns with me about the impact of these bills.


In terms of the compliance and reporting regime prescribed by these bills, independent schools already report through the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations on their full financial status, and they are already required to submit audited financial statements to DEEWR annually. Independent schools in Australia already have extensive information available to the public on ACARA's My School, and this applies to all independent schools regardless of which ACNC registered entity category they are in. Requiring independent schools to report similar but different data to ACNC is another addition to Labor's smorgasbord of red tape.


In addition, independent schools provide financial reports to the state government. These bills will result in independent schools requiring more administrative positions to fulfil all of the reporting requirements, taking away funds from much-needed educational positions. The proposed compliance prescribed by these bills rivals that of public companies, and we have to remember here that these are charitable organisations we are talking about.


Independent schools are also concerned about the reporting requirements when they receive donations. For instance, will there be an additional level of reporting when they fundraise? In terms of the proposed statutory definition of 'charity', the independent schools sector is concerned at the time and financial costs of having to prove public benefit, when it has been long established. It is important for these schools to remain charitable in order to be able to reduce compliance costs and instead be able to concentrate and focus on education and reduce fees to parents. As to governance of entities, the regulations are yet to be defined. So we do not know what they will be and how they will impact on schools.


Taxation of 'unrelated income' and its definition is another area of concern for independent schools when there is already legislation in place to tax unrelated income, and especially when no definition has been established and there has been no consultation whatsoever with the school community. I want the minister to answer whether or not P&C shops selling uniforms and books will be taxed if they are separately incorporated. Will tuckshops selling goods be taxed? And what happens when these schools hire out their facilities for extra income to reduce fees or improve facilities?


The bills also provide no clarity as to the meaning of the phrases 'likely to contravene' and 'likely to not comply', as set out in proposed section 35-10(1)(c). Quite reasonably, a number of independent schools have raised with me their concerns as to what those words likely mean and how they will impact on schools. Section 35(10)(c) refers to an apparently discretionary power of the commissioner whereby the commissioner may revoke registration where the registered entity has contravened, or is likely to contravene or not comply with, a provision or governance or external conduct standard. No guidance or assistance is provided in the bill as to how the commissioner is to determine the intent or the mind of the entity being 'likely to contravene or not comply' with the act and the consequences of revocation of registration are significant to the entity. This is an example of particularly poor drafting and constitutes further evidence showing how little the minister and the government actually understand about the impacts of this proposed legislation on the sector. The phrases 'likely to contravene' and 'likely to not comply with' should be removed from this section entirely.


The independent schools in my electorate of Brisbane, like the rest of Australia, do not mind being transparent. It is just very hard for them when they need to redo their numbers in four different formats depending on which level of government they are reporting to.


As I have said, these bills are a classic example of regulatory overreach by a government with a history of legislative and public policy failures—yet another case of the Gillard government in action, with their reverse Midas touch at work. They are bad and unnecessary bills. (Time expired)

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:39):  I rise to speak on the Charities Bill 2013 and Charities (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. Hundreds of thousands of Australians each year participate in volunteering across Australia through local sports clubs, Scout groups, surf-lifesaving clubs, religious groups and many other community organisations. The most recent census showed that more than three million Australians participated in voluntary work for an organisation or group. Of course, this figure does not include the many millions of Australians who conduct selfless voluntary work for others in the normal course of their lives without even considering it to be volunteering their time. This disparity is reflected in the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2010 general social survey, which indicated that more than six million Australians volunteer every year, including many from different cultural backgrounds who are frequently not even aware that some of their work in the community is actually volunteering. Their work is funnelled through the charities and not-for-profit sector, with thousands of Australians managing and handling the many hours of administration, financial accounting and reporting, and compliance with federal, state and territory regulations.


These bills seek to replace the common-law definition of charity and charitable purpose with a statutory definition which would apply from 1 January 2014 and would apply across all Commonwealth legislation. The coalition oppose this legislation because we believe that it is not a response to a genuine need or a solution to challenges within the current framework in which the Commonwealth treats charities. It instead imposes further prescriptive regulations on charities already struggling to keep up with administrative and compliance burdens.


The Labor government first announced in the 2011-12 budget that it would introduce a statutory definition of 'charity' based on the 2001 Report of the inquiry into the definition of charity and related organisations, also taking into account subsequent judicial decisions. Key features of the new definition include: an entity must have charitable purposes and must not have an independent, non-charitable purpose; an entity may have incidental or ancillary purposes that may be non-charitable when viewed in isolation but which must aid or further the charitable purpose. Furthermore, the following are presumed as being for the public benefit, unless there is evidence to the contrary: the purpose of preventing and relieving sickness, disease or human suffering; the purpose of advancing education or relieving poverty, distress or disadvantage of individuals or families; the purpose of caring for and supporting the aged or people with disabilities; and the purpose of advancing religion.


The public benefit test does not apply to open and non-discriminatory self-help groups, to closed or contemplative religious orders or where the purpose is directed to one or more individuals in necessitous circumstances as described in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. A purpose of engaging in, or promoting, activities which are unlawful or contrary to public policy is disqualifying, which refers specifically to such matters as the rule of law and system of government, as opposed to government policies. A purpose of promoting or opposing a political party or candidate is a disqualifying purpose. Categories of charitable purposes include: advancing health, education, social or public welfare; religion; culture; promoting reconciliation, mutual respect and tolerance between groups of individuals that are in Australia; promoting or protecting human rights; advancing the natural environment et cetera.


The list of categories and the definitions of charitable purposes go on—and on and on. With so much complexity in this bill, no doubt there will be many unintended consequences which could negatively affect the charitable sector. In fact, despite these extensive categories and definitions, the government has somehow managed to leave out 'housing' as a defined charitable purpose. I understand that stakeholders in the housing sector are therefore concerned about whether there is the potential to jeopardise future investment in public-private partnerships in that area.


The coalition believes that there is no significant reason that the government has outlined as to how the common-law definition of charity and charitable purpose is deficient. Therefore, Australia should maintain the definition of charity and charitable purpose which has been determined based on over 400 years of common law. This reflects the general conception developed over time of charitable purposes, rather than draconian definitions, categories and public interest tests of charity and charitable purposes, as proposed by this government.


There are over 600,000 not-for-profit entities in Australia, including approximately 56,000 charities. The government should be supporting the volunteering, charity and not-for-profit sector in this country as best it can. Instead, for years this Labor government has failed to provide certainty with regard to the obligations and responsibilities of organisations and of those governing these organisations. In 2011, the Labor government changed occupational health and safety laws, which effectively turned volunteers into workers, leaving community groups burdened with strict regulations accompanied by harsh punishments for noncompliance. Last year—in 2012—the government created the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, or ACNC, which, as I noted at the time, would increase red tape and increase compliance costs for the sector.


A fundamental value is the independence of the charities. Their ability to organise their structure and governance to suit their own activities should not be compromised by prescriptive and unnecessary standards. The coalition believes a one-size-fits-all approach to every charity and not-for-profit, which this Labor government continues to advocate, will decrease versatility within the sector. Once the ACNC comes into effect on 1 January 2014, these bills today may result in further transitional costs for some entities. I understand that there are concerns in the community about the conduct of some organisations to which they donate their money, but the government has not addressed those concerns in continuing to apply burdensome regulation to each and every charitable and not-for-profit organisation.


The coalition does have a plan to assist Australians effectively in this area. The shadow minister for families, housing and human services, the member for Menzies, has reaffirmed the coalition's commitment to reduce red tape for the charities and not-for-profit sector. A coalition government will shift the focus of the new Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission away from endless compliance and regulation to a smaller body that encourages innovation, education and best practice in the sector. This could entail a small, independent charities commission, which would serve as an educative and training body for the sector. Such a commission would indeed support the sector by providing information about the process of registration for new organisations, it would advocate for the rights of these organisations and, further, it would help facilitate the interaction between government and the charitable and not-for-profit sector. This type of coordination is what the coalition supports: real on-the-ground support for community organisations rather than a centralised government legislating the definition of charity and charitable purposes and introducing burdensome reporting and conduct requirements for charities.


Members should resist any push that proposes a 'government knows best' view and, indeed, any push that centralises functions of government to the Commonwealth where there is no rational basis to do so. Indeed, in this case, the government has not outlined why there is an urgent reason for implementing a statutory definition of charity and charitable purposes at this time. We must respect personal and community responsibility, which we see so often in the charity and not-for-profit sector. We know that by fostering community spirit we reduce reliance on government. I do not believe that implementing a statutory definition of charity and charitable purposes enhances these values. If elected, the coalition will repeal this bill.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (12:48):  I rise to speak on the Charities Bill 2013 and the Charities (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. The Charities Bill seeks to introduce a definition of charity and charitable purpose. The new definition would apply from 1 January 2014 across all Commonwealth legislation. This bill serves no purpose and is unnecessary. The definition of the word 'charities' is ingrained into our history and our culture, and it is a definition that is universally understood. The definition of charity has stood the test of time and is some 400 years old. British Commonwealth law has served us well. Since Federation, the definition of charity has remained clear and consistent. It has remained a cornerstone of what constitutes charitable endeavour and charitable activity across this nation.


The government are seeking once again to rush through legislation that has not been properly considered, with a lack of public consultation. The public consultation phase on the draft definition was open for less than four weeks. It is astounding to me that this government would think that they know better and, without extensive consultation, would seek to change 400 years of history that has served civil society well.


Let me remind the House what happened in September 2000, when the then Prime Minister John Howard announced an inquiry into the definition of charity. The inquiry reported in 2001, making some 27 recommendations. Former Treasurer Peter Costello released draft legislation in 2003 which took the traditional four heads of charity and divided them into seven heads of charity in line with the inquiry's findings—namely, the advancement of health; education; social and community welfare; religion; culture, natural environment; and any other purpose that is beneficial to the community. The Board of Taxation reported on the workability of the draft legislation in 2004 and the then government, through the then Treasurer, announced:


The common law meaning of a charity will continue to apply, but the definition will be extended to include certain child care and self-help groups, and closed or contemplative religious orders. The Government has decided not to proceed with the draft Charities Bill.


It perplexes me then why, after an extensive inquiry has already been completed into this issue and found that the common-law meaning of charity is still relevant and the most appropriate to use, this government is tracking down an alternative path. Why depart from 400 years of clarity and consistency that is relevant today and has worked and continues to work? Let me be clear in this House that we will seek to repeal this bill if elected. The coalition's approach to the charitable sector is based on the belief that Australian charities and not-for-profit organisations strengthen our nation through their contribution to communities right across Australia. We believe in empowering this sector. We understand that the charitable sector plays a role and fills a gap that government never could.


Before entering parliament I worked as a social work across Greater Western Sydney for 20-odd years. In my work I saw many charitable organisations on the ground doing incredible work in their local communities—some at a local level, some at a national or more regional level. These organisations are made up of mostly volunteers. Volunteers are on management committees. Volunteers develop and share a vision and a dream to make a difference in the communities, whether it is helping those who are disabled, empowering young people to have a better future or the continuing work done over the years by St Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army and so on. The many organisations that make up the charitable sector are trusted pillars in our community and our nation. The Red Cross, St Vinnie's, Wesley Mission—the list goes on. They continue to have a significant impact on our society and our communities. Families, single parents, the elderly and troubled youth rely on the helping hand of these organisations to bring support and hope during the tough times.


The community trusts civil society, and the coalition trusts civil society. It is Labor that assumes that we should look over their shoulder and force them to comply with overburdensome regulations. This is why we have announced that, if elected, we will abolish the ACNC. The purpose of the ACNC is to create more red tape and more costs for a sector that is already under great pressure. The ACNC is predicated on the belief that Australia's charities and not-for-profits are doing something inherently wrong and need greater government oversight. I reject this belief. The ACNC has made life harder for volunteers and will discourage involvement in voluntary and community endeavour. By failing to work with the states and territories to create a single national framework, the Gillard government will increase the cost of running charities and not-for-profit organisations and give the government more say in how they are administered. While the ACNC will initially only cover those charities with exemptions, Labor's framework will allow an eventual expansion.


Only the coalition understands that a government's role is to support and serve those organisations that are looking after the needs of our community. The last thing that the coalition want to do, especially in these fiscally difficult times, is hamper the activities of civil society in delivering on its aspirations and responding to the needs of individuals, families and communities. The coalition will oppose this bill, and, if we are elected to government later this year, we will repeal it.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (12:55):  I appreciate the offer from the Assistant Treasurer to hand some notes over to help me make this contribution, but I will not need them. We stand as one in opposition to this bill. It is another step in the Labor Party's dream of regulating every aspect of our society. This is of course an area that has operated in our country at law prior to Australian courts being established. In fact, the definition of charity came under an English statute. This really gets to a difference in view between the Labor Party and our side of politics. The Labor Party seek to put strict black-letter law definitions around these sorts of organisations, whereas we think the common law definition has operated very successfully for a very long period of time. I know we should not breach the standing orders and discuss these matters across the chamber, but during one of the contributions it was mentioned that the former Treasurer, Peter Costello—Australia's greatest ever Treasurer—had looked at this issue when he was Treasurer of our country for 11½ years and he decided that it was not worth defining in legislation what charities are.




Mr Bradbury:
  He said it was too hard.




Mr BRIGGS:
  The Assistant Treasurer is right. He said it was too hard to define what charities are because they have varied operations, tasks and, more importantly, purposes. That is why we think that the common law definition, which has operated so successfully, should continue.


This is a government that is obsessed with regulation. The Assistant Treasurer's colleague, I think it was the member for McMahon when he was the Assistant Treasurer, promised in the lead-up to the 2007 election there would be 'one regulation in for one regulation out'. I think the record is 14,000 new regulations in and one regulation out. That has been the record of a Labor government. You cannot trust the Labor Party to make things simpler for business and charities. You can only trust them to make things harder because that suits their political desire to regulate our society to within an inch of its operation.


We saw that with the charities bill that they moved in this parliament some time late last year. We do oppose this bill. We, on our side of parliament, believe in civil society, we believe in community organisations and their ability to deliver services in our society that governments could not possibly ever seek to deliver or deliver well, because, ultimately, volunteers—



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr BRIGGS:
  Assistant Treasurer, that is the belief, on our side of politics, about our civil society. I can defend them from your vicious and ongoing attacks of trying to regulate every moment of their lives. We stand for charities in our society. We stand for our civil society. We stand in defiance of a government that is trying to make it harder for them to get on and do what they do so well. So many of our volunteer organisations, which deliver so many services in our communities, are there for the good of their people. It could not be delivered by government because, ultimately, government is too far detached—whether they have good intentions or not—compared to community organisations, charities and people who are doing it because they genuinely care and desire to do better in our society.


We will abolish this legislation if it does pass. I think it is one of about 40-odd bills still to pass the parliament between now and whenever the parliament rises, although I suspect the current Prime Minister wants the parliament to rise at 5 pm on the dot next Thursday afternoon. I suspect it is the first time in a very, very long time that the final sitting day of parliament before the election will actually be the allocated final sitting day, and I think we all know why that is. I suspect the Prime Minister is in her office making sure that COMCARs are ordered to be at the door for members: 'Is the member for McMahon's COMCAR ready to go at 4.45 next Thursday? Yep? Done—bang. Who's the next on the list? Make sure the member for Reid, from Western Sydney, has his car.' They do not want to be here for a moment longer than they have to be, so this might be one of those bills that do not quite get through, but it does again give us an indication of what the Labor Party's attitude to our civil society is.


Of course, what we suspect might be going on here is that the Labor Party would like to use black-letter definitions of charity to reward some of its preferred charities—can we put it that way?—or organisations it would like to create the scenario to fund. As we have seen in the UK experience, it demonstrates how dangerous it would be to empower public servants to determine whether an organisation is a charity or is not. We do not need more bureaucrats to tell us what charities can do good work in our civil society. We believe in our people and in the way that the law has operated for so long. That is why we have such a great tradition in our country of such a strong civil society and such a strong charity sector. And that is why we are opposed to this bill. The former Treasurer, the greatest Treasurer the country has ever had, looked at this. We should follow in the wise direction that that Treasurer took, because he is a wise man and he understood that it was too hard to define what it is to be a unique organisation in our society that can deliver such important services.


We stand in contrast to those on the other side, who believe in regulation, believe in bigger government and do not believe in our people. We, on the other hand, believe in our people. We believe that they know what is best for them and are able to deliver the services as such. We stand opposed to this bill. We will repeal it if we are elected in September—if we get to September—because we do not believe it has good intent at heart.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (13:02):  I rise today to speak on the Charities Bill 2013 and Charities (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013. To begin, I would like to pay tribute to all of those people who work, both paid and unpaid, in the charitable and not-for-profit sector. They are a critically important part of the Australian way of life, doing good works, and I commend them for that. All those thousands and thousands of volunteers simply work for the satisfaction that they receive from seeing the positive difference they make to other people's lives. It is only through the work of these very special and dedicated volunteers and the people who work in the charitable and not-for-profit sector that some of society's most important organisations are able to survive and do the work that they do—organisations like St Vincent de Paul, the Red Cross, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Salvation Army, to name just a few. These organisations heal the sick; they feed the hungry; they shelter the homeless. That is why it is so important that we as a parliament must never put in their way barriers or impediments to make it harder for them to do the work they do. Far from that, we should seek to make it easier for them to continue these good works.


One of the ways that we can do this is to ensure that we have the right regulatory framework. We must ensure that the demands on the volunteers and employees who manage these charities and not-for-profits are not unduly onerous and that any changes—any increased burdens—are properly evaluated to see if they are actually necessary. Importantly, we must look at the cost-benefit analysis.


We on this side of the chamber are very concerned that the government has not done this fundamental work. We are very concerned that the increased regulatory burden from the government, in setting up this new bureaucracy, will discourage people and organisations from pursuing the good works they do. The introduction of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission is flawed. It is flawed because the government said in the first instance that the reason it needed to bring about this new regulator is because it did not have confidence in the people who were working in this sector. It did not have confidence that they were doing the right thing. Based on no evidence whatsoever, it thought that a new regulator was required.


Secondly, the government said that the reason this new regulator was so important and why it needed to come out was to simplify the regulation that surrounds charities and not-for-profits. But far from simplifying red tape and regulation we have seen it do the opposite. The concerns that I raised at the time are the concerns that I still have today: that far from decreasing the regulatory burden on the not-for-profit and charitable sector we are going to see a significant amount of duplication. There will be no simplification because predicated on simplification is the view that states and territories come on board. They have not done so, so the government is proceeding on the basis that it will have support which it does not. There is no agreement with the state and territory governments to hand over powers.


I also have significant concerns about the scope of powers of this new regulator, that the regulator will be able to interfere and intervene in not-for-profits and charities without good cause. And I am still incredibly concerned that we are going to put off a number of very good people who would otherwise participate in our local communities by volunteering their time in these charities and not-for-profits by becoming directors and by serving them in other ways—on committees and the like. They will not do that because of the new onerous regulations and burdens that will be imposed upon them. I want to take the time today to touch on a couple of aspects of what I have just raised.


This new centralised statutory authority will add massive regulation and compliance costs that are simply not justified or warranted. In order to receive access to charitable taxation concessions from the Australian Taxation Office, it is going to be mandatory to register with this new regulatory body. The ACNC will have a new reporting framework which will require all registered entities to provide an annual information statement. Both medium-sized and large entities will also be required to provide annual financial reports. This is, obviously, over and above what currently applies. The ACNC will also have significantly increased powers: powers to register and the registered charities, and that power may be extended to all not-for-profit organisations.


What concerns me is that this will make it very easy for the regulator to reach into organisations that have been free from government interference and control up until this point. They have been free to innovate and free to go about doing the work that they do. Instead, they will now have to spend time satisfying the new regulator that they are, in fact, not in breach of any new piece of red tape or regulation.


What concerns me is that in order to enforce these new regulations, the ACNC will have unprecedented powers to demand information, to search premises, to inspect items on premises and to seize documents or electronic equipment found on premises. These are indeed new and uncharted waters. The ACNC will also have the power to issue warning notices, issue directions, enter into enforceable undertakings, apply to the courts for injunctions, suspend or remove responsible entities and appoint acting responsible entities. Finally, they will also have the power to remove responsible officers of charitable organisations. Who would want to work in, let alone run, a charitable organisation when the charity police can knock on your door at any moment and interfere with what it is that you are doing. We are not saying that those who do the wrong thing should not be punished for doing the wrong thing, but there are already existing laws in place for those who do the wrong thing. The circumstances in which that occurs are few and far between.


The government here in setting up this new regulator is finding a solution in search of a problem, which is so typical of this government's approach to everything. Its view is that government should be involved in every facet of people's lives, that government is the solution to every problem. We have a very different view on this side of the chamber. We believe that individuals should be able to shape and control their own destiny and that we should only involve government where it is absolutely necessary to do so. With the ACNC we are going to get a massive new bureaucracy with unfettered powers that will be able to intrude into charities and not-for-profits. 


We have a different view of the charity and not-for-profit sector. We have faith in Australian charitable and not-for-profit providers, and we know that where there is misconduct those who are found guilty will be punished to the full extent of the law. We will not reverse the onus of proof, which is, in effect, what this government has done, and which will assume guilt until proven otherwise. That is why we have made a very clear commitment that we will abolish the ACNC and we will give people the confidence to remain involved in their charities and not-for-profits with the full knowledge that they can go about their business without increased burdens upon them.


What this particular bill will do is specifically define 'charity' and 'charitable purpose'. It is a new definition that will apply from 1 January 2014 right across Commonwealth legislation. It seems a strange thing that we are defining, in statute, 'charity' and 'charitable purpose' when there has been no misunderstanding as to these terms for more than 400 years of common law. The common law has been very clear on who is included in this definition, and that has been sufficient for legal processes to date. We cannot understand why the government is introducing new laws, new regulation, new regulators and new definitions when no case has been made. Importantly, it seems that no jurisdiction will adopt the new definition, which will lead to increased confusion and inconsistency, far from what the government says it is trying to promote. Why on earth would you create confusion where there is clarity? Why on earth would you create a mess for no discernible reason? These are the questions that the government needs to answer. The government needs to answer them in the chamber.


At the end of the day, this bill really does sharply define and highlight the distinction between this Labor government and the coalition. This Labor government is a government and a party that chooses intervention at every opportunity. This stands in contrast with the coalition and our approach. We trust people and we support a strong civil society. We want to make sure that people have faith in our charitable organisations. The only people to undermine the faith that people currently have in charitable organisations are, in fact, those from the Labor Party and this government who have called that into question for no reason whatsoever.


In conclusion today, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of those who work in our charitable and not-for-profit organisations. I want to thank them for the work that they do. They work so hard for so little reward. They work to try to make a better Australia for all of us, and I want to give them our assurance that we will not bother them with more meaningless regulation and red tape. We will restore hope, reward and opportunity for all.

Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (13:15):  The Australian Charities Bill 2013 is a throwback to the lazy philosophy of Labor and the misguided principles of centralisation. Centralised policy is slow, ineffective and expensive. Liberals believe in establishing a minimal charity commission. This body would have the explicit and transparent objective of education and training. Devolution and a competitive marketplace of ideas are the key tenets of the Liberal philosophy.


This bill will enshrine a negative outlook in legislation—a normative framework that sees people as inherently corrupt, failing and in need of protection from one another. But we need protection from the real threat: government overreach. What Labor are proposing with this bill is no great surprise. It is no surprise in the sense that they will introduce yet another layer of bureaucracy and red tape, but it is frightening for small charities and not-for-profits.


There are a number of areas of the bill which trouble both my constituents and me. The stated goal of this bill is to establish 'one-stop, many uses' and to streamline the regulatory process surrounding the operation of charities and not-for-profit organisations in Australia. It is streamlined regulation with a new level of federal red tape. I cannot see how states would give up this right of jurisdiction. Without states jumping out, the new commission is simply jumping in with more regulation and more administrative burden. Constructive engagement was never really a priority—not with the states, not with the charities and not with Australians.


The only certainty is the additional $4.8 million net expense settled on the taxpayer this financial year. Remembering the fiasco of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012, page 5 of the explanatory memorandum states:


The compliance savings from introducing the ACNC and a new regulatory framework are hard to quantify, particularly for this sector, due to limited data availability.


Limited talent more like!


There is a $4.8 million net expense to make doing good in our communities more difficult, not less. This is the sentiment of David Gonski, the chair of the government's education review panel. He said that we are the first country in the world to make being a director on an NFP more onerous than being on a for-profit. This tired and troubled government is out of touch with reality. Labor is good at spending other people's money. That $4.8 million of extra red tape would keep many of my constituents' bank accounts out of the red.


In WA, the Water Corporation have thrown an extra $21.6 million on the backs of their customers because of the carbon tax. That $4.8 million would go a long way. The reality is that good and honest people in my electorate like Mr Colin Waddell and managers in local not-for-profit community enterprises are frightened. In a submission to the Catholic Church during the committee hearings, fear was the factor—fear of the unknown.


With so much regulation and so little time, organisations and individuals are afraid. The penalties are real, immediate and consequential. With so much regulation, so much legislation and so much dislocation, mistakes will happen. I support the recommendations and the views taken by the Catholic Church. If the prime objective is simplification—and I am in favour of that—then instead of having categories of 'deductible gift recipient' and 'basic religious charity', why not get them all to register for an ABN? Charity begins at home. President Reagan used to quip that the most important charities are made at the kitchen table. The bill before us today will make those decisions much easier—easier to put off saying: 'I can and I will give back to my country.' 


Again, the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill acknowledges that the total cost of action will increase with the cost of compliance increasing exponentially for small not-for-profits and charities. Small entities that currently have no reporting obligations are a minor exception. These entities would be required to report to the ACNC, increasing compliance burden. The coalition will go big for the little guy. If we do not, there is no doubt the ACNC will only grow in its scope and power to go big.


It is explicitly stated as such in the bill, and page 13 of the explanatory memorandum says that the role of the ACNC will expand. From an economic perspective, having many efficient, competitive regulatory markets is optimal. Having a minimal incidence of regulatory capture is ideal. Common sense, that rarest form, dictates that one should not fix something that is not broken.


What does a small charity or a not-for-profit in Tangney have to gain from the introduction of this bill? The one thing that a small charity is set to gain from the ACNC is an online presence through the web portal infrastructure. And yet the very same experts have an average of 350 views on their own YouTube channel. Paint drying has more channels and, on average, the paint drying clips have more views. This is not value for the trade-off: a new powerful federal body, the ACNC, with oversight and monitoring powers for 350 views.


A page on the ACNC website is the benefit they are selling us. Our charities and not-for-profits are more than circumspect about this; their fear is well founded. The government knew this all along, and that is the reason that one group was given just 11 days to make a submission—on a bill where the explanatory memorandum alone is 351 pages long. I ask: how can the bill' principals call this 'constructive engagement with stakeholders'? The machete management mafia will goad the unwilling into the light. It looks like intimidation. It smells like compulsion. In WA we call it Labor.


The Gillard government is saying that it is a voluntary sign-up. But if an organisation does not sign up then tax and concessions are withheld. They have six months to opt out, and it is only reviewed every five years. Never in the course of a government has so much been found so wrong with what is so right by so few.


I will just list a few highlights. The Charities Bill establishes a charity passport. What is it? Why do we need it? The Charities Bill also defines what a charity is. The bill states that receipt of government grants precludes an entity from being a basic religious charity. Why? With the not-for-profit sector being worth $43 billion and employing eight per cent of the labour force, and given the Charities Bill has information-gathering powers, the checks and balances for this commission are more than insufficient. This bill is the epitome of a federal government that takes too much tax from people, takes too much authority from the states and takes too much liberty with the Constitution.


Simple, honest enterprise is the Australian way. The coalition will honour those values and support them in every endeavour. The Charities Bill is typical Labor. Labor finds something that is working and tries to break it. We know from 'red-tape' Rudd to 'go-slow' Gillard that bureaucracy wins over business. The Charities Bill will have real consequences. Most serious will be the impact of unintended consequences. Unintended consequences brought the evil empire of Soviet Russia to its knees. Let it not take down our pride in our communities. Let us not change the current common law definition just for the sake of change. Further clarification is needed with regard to the treatment of housing as a charitable purpose. We are proud of our people and optimistic of their goodness, knowing always that a government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (13:27):  I rise to speak on the Charities Bill 2013 and the Charities (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions Bill) 2013, and much like the member for Tangney, who spoke before me, but with a slightly less eloquent flavour. I come to this from a very pragmatic point of view.


If you are talking about charities and about helping people, it should be about getting the dollars to the pointy end. It should be about how we maximise getting the dollars to the pointy end. I was speaking to Bruce Harmer from the Salvation Army in Townsville. They are very proud of the fact that 81.5 per cent of every dollar—81.5c of every dollar—that goes to the Salvation Army goes to front-line services. That means that only 18½c in the dollar goes to admin and all the costs. That, surely, should be our model. That, surely, should be what we as a parliament and as a society are trying to achieve. They are very proud that nearly 20 per cent of their money does not go to the back end, but goes to everyone.


This bill seems to be more about setting up a system. When you are thinking about systems the first thing that comes out of a system is to find a way around it. By way of explaining my position on that, can I go back to my banking days when I was in the credit card department of the Bank of New South Wales and Westpac. We used to let the branches decide who would get credit cards approved. We had a problem when the credit cards first came out because , if someone had money on term deposit, we automatically sent them a credit card—a Bankcard. But as we went through the eighties and credit card legislation started to come in, we came up with a system where the bank manager would sit there and say: 'What's your job? What are your prospects of making a repayment? How much is this actually going to mean?' And then he would sign off and approve it. 


When banks became very aggressive in chasing market share, Westpac came up with a system called 'credit scoring'. With credit scoring the branch could still say yes or no, but if the branch said no we would take the decision out of the branch's hands and hand it to our credit-scoring system. It went on the length of time at your address, the length of your time in employment and all those technical things that would gloss over it. So the branch where the people were actually known could no longer say no. It came down to that.


At that time I was in credit cards. We used to call them 'wild cards', where people would get a credit card and rack up debts. It was before the magnetic strip, before you could get it all done, and they would have to ring up for authorisation, so if you knew what you were doing you could go. We had this bloke from Cooktown who got a new Mastercard. He had had the Mastercard for three days, he had a $2,000 limit and he was up to 6½ thousand dollars by then. So the first thing you do is try the work and home phone numbers. He did not have either. So you go and pull out the application. I rang the branch to complain about who the hell approved that application. They said, 'We didn't approve it, you guys approved it.' For your edification, Mr Deputy Speaker, can I walk you through the application and why this thing went through. Occupation? Unemployed. How long had he held that job? He had held that job for 32 years. Address? Care of the Lions Den Hotel in Cooktown—where every other hobo and desperate in the world gets his mail collected. How long have you been at that address? Twenty-five years. He got a credit score of 29 points. Someone like Kerry Packer would get a credit score of 30 points. So you would have this system where, if the information is put in incorrectly, all common sense goes out the window. That seems to me to be what is going on here.


We first went to common law for our definition of charities in the 1600s. We have had that definition for 400 years and it has worked. Tell me where it hasn't? I think that before we change things it should be demonstrated where the system is going so terribly wrong. That is what we have to get right—what is going wrong in the first place? Don't just see something and say, 'Hey, we can change that,' because as soon as you get a system there will be people who will find a way around it. Yes, there are people in our charities and not-for-profits who abuse the system and abuse their status, but this is not the way around it. The police are the way around that, and that means working with state governments, but this government would know nothing about working with state governments. What we should be doing as a parliament is speaking to our charities and not-for-profits about how they can get more dollars to the pointy end. What we should be doing as a parliament is getting rid of paperwork, not loading people up with it.


I will briefly go to the ACNC legislation, which we have said we will repeal. I am 100 per cent in lockstep on this with Kevin Andrews, the shadow minister, who will be the minister should we be fortunate enough to win the next election. When I had the shadow minister in Townsville we spoke to an aged-care facility. They have a facility in Townsville and there were two failing facilities, one in Ayre and one in Ingham. Ayre is 85 kilometres south of Townsville and Ingham is about 115 kilometres north of Townsville. Administratively, they were just getting killed, it just got too hard. So the Townsville operation said: 'We'll take you over. We'll do your paperwork centrally here, spreading the costs, so that you can provide the information and you can still do the services.' They sent their forms, the reports they have to do, to the government. The government came back and said, 'There are three organisations here.' They said, 'Yes, there are three organisations here, but we are doing the central thing here.' The government said, 'No, you have to do that report three times.' They said the report would be exactly the same. 'It doesn't matter,' was the reply from the Public Service, 'it simply has to be done.' 


First and foremost, all this paperwork for these people is just loading them up. They know we are not reading it; they know the Public Service simply cannot get through all these forms. There are spot checks done. Aren't we better off saying to charities and not-for-profits: 'Listen, we are going to come down hard on those people that we think are doing the wrong thing. We are going to use the police and, as a federal parliament, we are going to work hard in cooperation with the states. We are going to have a look at taxation, we are going to do all these things and we are going to come down hard on those people'? That is better than going around and completely vilifying the whole organisation and then going and changing things.


Can I just say for the record that the coalition is committed to retaining the common law definition of charity. We have made this commitment on the basis that the government has not made out the case for the common law definition being deficient and that to change the current definition risks disadvantaging some charities and creating a new wave of legal disputes and test cases at a great cost to the sector. I think that is a fair statement. I think when a government are trying to make their case they should, in fact, make their case. If this was being driven by the charities and not-for-profit sector then I would understand it a little bit more, but it is not. It is not being driven by anyone I am speaking to in the charities and not-for-profit sector. As a matter of fact, they are running as far away from this as they possibly can. The shadow minister has said:


Stakeholders in the housing sector are particularly concerned that housing has not been listed as a defined charitable purpose and believe this has the potential to jeopardise future investment in public-private partnerships. They have stated that they will be more disadvantaged under the statutory definition than the current common law definition and have called for the bill to be amended to provide further clarification with regard to the treatment of housing as a charitable purpose.


Using that as an example, does this just become like the Family Law Act or the Child Support Act and we have amendments? You cannot amend it every time for every single thing, so then we will have cracks through which people fall. Aren't we better off concentrating on what we have and fixing the very real things that this government has got broken, fixing the very real things that are in front of this parliament that could be fixed, instead of going around and hunting for things that could be done? The list of stakeholders is just phenomenal. I will also read for the record here from a speech delivered by shadow minister Kevin Andrews where he said:


Former Prime Minister John Howard announced an inquiry into the definition of charity on 18 September 2000. The inquiry reported in 2001, making some 27 recommendations.


Former Treasurer Costello released draft legislation in 2003 which took the traditional four heads of charity and divided them into seven heads of charity in line with the inquiry's findings.


So they have gone out and consulted, then he came back and released proposed legislation for discussion in line with the inquiry findings—


namely, the advancement of health, education, social or community welfare, religion, culture, natural environment and any other purpose that is beneficial to the community.


The Board of Taxation reported on the workability of the draft legislation in 2004—


so, again, it has taken some time because you want to get it right. And, as Kevin Andrews went on to say:


The then government through the then Treasurer announced:


… the common law meaning of a charity will continue to apply, but the definition will be extended to include certain child care and self-help groups, and closed or contemplative religious orders. The government has decided not to proceed with the draft Charities Bill. The former coalition enacted the Extension of Charitable Purpose Act which confined itself to enlarging the legal definition of charity for federal purposes to include child care, self-help groups and closed orders. The Commonwealth's definitional extension has not been adopted by any state jurisdiction. 


This bill would be the first time that legislation has sought to comprehensively define in statute, for the purposes of Commonwealth law, charity …


and here is the rub—


why create a statute where the common law has and does serve us well?


I think the onus is upon the government to prove that case beyond all reasonable doubt. 


Why depart from 400 years of clarity and consistency? 


There is no logical reason.


As an aside, every member in this House had the Oaktree Foundation come through to us about increasing our foreign aid to 0.5 per cent of GDP. It is a worthy goal. But when those guys sat down next to me, I said: 'Do you know what you are actually chasing? Are you chasing more money going into the system, or are you chasing a better result?' They are not the same. Some of the money we send overseas has as little as 16c in the dollar getting to the pointy end. So I said, 'Aren't we better off working with the money we have to get a better result on the ground?' Aren't we better off trying to raise that 16c to get to the Salvation Army's 81½c? Isn't that the goal—to make people better off? If someone could tell me how this place and this bill are going to make all the charity sector and all the not-for-profit sector and all the churches better off, I will be available for that meeting. 


This just puts another border around which someone must work. This is just giving work to solicitors to come up with those sorts of things. It lets governments of whatever persuasion pick on someone and say, 'You do not quite fit that so out you go.' We are running a real risk with this, because we have a great number of things which must be done by this parliament. 


I do not think that this is one of the things that we should be concentrating on. We should be concentrating on the things that make people's lives better. I want to see a bill in this place about homelessness. I want to see a bill in this place about doing all sorts of good things. This sort of mucking around with definitions and regulation for regulation sake does not do anyone in here any good. You are alienating an entire sector of the community. If this does go through, we will repeal it, and I am calling on all the charities and not-for-profits to make sure that their position is known to every Labor member and every Labor candidate and that what this government has done: load up red tape on this sector. We should be getting rid of red tape. Our aspiration should be at least the Salvation Army's 81½c in every dollar going to the front line of services. This bill is absolute rubbish and we should vote against it. I thank the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-06-18,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (13:41):  I rise to speak on the Charities Bill and the Charities (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, and in doing so emphasise the fact that the coalition—those members on this side of the House and certainly the member for Herbert who has just spoken so eloquently on this bill—support civil society. We in fact trust what civil society has done and the fact that it has taken generations upon generations of hardworking Australians and common-sense approaches to all matters of importance to communities to get to where we are now, and we want to empower civil society with those rights which have been enshrined in law since Federation and before.


The government's approach is, unfortunately, to treat civil society with a degree of distrust and suspicion, to seek to enforce laws which are onerous and uncalled for and certainly unnecessary. This government is all about applying burdensome regulation and creating more and more levels of unnecessary bureaucracy—agencies over the shoulders of organisations which have done a power of good for their communities over generations and a power of good for society over decades. The definition of charity, as we heard the member for Herbert just indicate and as we have heard the shadow minister Kevin Andrews tell us, is 400 years old. Common law has served us well. Why is there any need for this Labor government, which has been there for five years, a blink of an eye—really it is only this particular government in this particular term after the former Prime Minister, the member for Griffith was tapped on the shoulder by the member for Lalor on 24 June back in 2010—to overturn or change something which has served the Western world well for four centuries?


The coalition under the former Treasurer Peter Costello—and he was a great Treasurer—looked at the issue in great detail and put in place appropriate public policy. But that came after careful consideration and after consultation with key stakeholders. That came after doing something that this government has never had a wont to do and that is to talk to the people and the organisations that would be affected by it and to bring about not necessarily change for change sake but something that might improve the situation as it was then.


The United Kingdom experience demonstrates how dangerous it would be to empower public servants to decide what is charity and what is not charity. As the member for Herbert and the shadow minister have indicated in their speeches on this important topic, the coalition, if we are fortunate enough to be elected on 14 September, will seek to repeal this particular bill.  


In this place we need to talk about our opposition to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and certainly members on this side are doing just that. We have announced that we will abolish the ACNC and repeal this legislation if we are elected to govern. One thing we do not need is a plethora of new bureaucrats. In my time in this place I have seen how onerous more and more bureaucrats can be. We have enough problems at the moment, with so many crossovers between federal and state departments, federal and state bureaucrats, and federal and state governments without putting another layer of bureaucracy upon those organisations which have long been regarded as pillars of the community—organisations such as St Vincent de Paul, the Red Cross, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Salvation Army. We all know those organisations; they are household names. They are respected organisations within our communities. When we speak of those organisations and others, we know what a power of work and a power of good they do when things go wrong. I refer to some of the natural disasters we have, unfortunately, experienced in recent years—floods, fires and droughts. Those are the organisations to which many people in the community who fall on hard times either through natural disasters or when other things go wrong often turn to first because they know they will be there when they are most needed. 


Those sorts of organisations—Vinnies, the Red Cross, the Brotherhood, the Salvos—do not need a layer of bureaucrats looking over their shoulder, telling them what they should or should not be doing. We have seen this Labor government, in so many other ways, enforce and impose upon our society that creeping federalism, those Big Brother tactics that this government seems to think are necessary to enforce upon so many different sections of society which have existed since Federation very well and very nicely, thank you, without this government's intervention but which this government now thinks it needs to impose upon them at this juncture. It is Labor which assumes that we should look over these organisations' shoulders and, as I say, tell them what to do and, more specifically, tell them what not to do with overburdensome regulation.


The government have not demonstrated that the absolute mischief that the ACNC was established to deal with actually exists. They want to enforce and impose these regulations but have not really told us why it is absolutely necessary.


The coalition have announced that they will streamline regulation as it applies to family service agencies. Organisations certainly need to be transparent, something which the government is not. They certainly need to tick the necessary boxes to meet compliance measures, they need to ensure that the money that they are entrusted with is spent wisely and in the way that the community would expect and that it is spent for the good of the people they serve. These organisations are already self-regulated and are already governed by laws of the various states.


We heard the member for Herbert say, 'There's a problem with the way in which some individuals operate in some organisations.' I am certainly not pointing the finger of blame at anyone. But if there are problems, that is why we have the state police forces and it is why we have fraud squads. I am not suggesting in any way that there is a problem. But if ever a problem comes about then that is the correct and proper way for those problems to be dealt with, not through some new layer of bureaucracy or new layer of enforcement imposed upon it by a government which already has its tentacles stretched out far and wide in so many other sectors of society. 


That is why this bill needs to be rejected, it is why this bill is totally unnecessary and it is why we should have great suspicion about this government when it wants to impose itself like Big Brother over our charities, which have worked well for many decades without an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy hanging over their heads.


As I said, when we do need our charitable organisations to serve us, they do it superbly, particularly in regional areas. I know you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, in your electorate of Maranoa of just how well charities operate and, as I mentioned before, particularly when they are most needed in times of crisis. 


I note that the shadow minister in his speech talked about the history of the coalition and what we have done to improve certain areas involved in charities to ensure that there was greater transparency. This particular bill does not provide that. But we have certainly helped to enhance these organisations and to help them to better do the job that they are expected and required to do—that is, to help in their communities—and, as I have mentioned, they do a wonderful job in regional Australia.


The shadow minister said that this government is now seeking to pretend that there is some desperate need to legislate in this area, acting as though it is charting new waters. These new waters do not need to be charted. The reality is, as the shadow minister indicated in his speech on this particular bill, it was the former Howard government—and I might just add that that was a good government—that looked at the issue of creating a common law definition of 'charity'. Former Prime Minister John Howard announced an inquiry into the definition of 'charity' on 18 September 2000. The inquiry reported in 2001, making some 27 recommendations. Those recommendations were there to enhance the law as it then stood. They were not there to be some great big octopus like this government is, spreading its unnecessary federal tentacles into every way and means of life, as we now know. They were not there to be onerous, burdensome and unnecessary Big Brother tactics.


Former Treasurer Peter Costello released draft legislation in 2003 which took the traditional four heads of charity and divided them into seven heads of charity in line with the inquiry's finding: the advancement of health, education, social or community welfare, religion, culture, natural environment and any other purpose that is beneficial to the community. Certainly, when it comes to health and education there are no two more important aspects of society for most Australians than health and education. The Board of Taxation reported on the workability of the draft legislation in 2004, and the then government through the then Treasurer announced the common law meaning of a charity will continue to apply but the definition will be extended to include certain childcare and self-help groups and closed or contemplative religious orders. The government decided not to proceed with the draft charities bill. There we have a good government of the day—a Liberal-Nationals government of the day—seeing that there possibly needed to be an inquiry done, enacting that inquiry, consulting with stakeholders, taking the views of all concerned whether they were for or opposed to the inquiry, discussing it in a common-sense fashion, letting it sit on the table for some time while other people could have a say and then coming out and deciding that there was no need to proceed with the draft charities bill.


Why then, in 2013, when we have a government wracked with leadership problems and debt, and which is trying to spread its tentacles into lots of matters which used to be the prerogative of the states, do we have this federal Labor government, which thinks it knows better about everything and which the community knows does not, wanting to force this legislation through in the second-last or last week of the 43rd Parliament and expecting it to be of benefit to those charities which have served us so well for so many years? That is why this bill needs to be rejected. That is why this is not supported by the coalition. That is why I hope that the Greens member, whom I heard chattering behind me a moment ago—no doubt he was supporting what I am saying—does not support it. I know the member for Dobell is behind me, and he calls himself an Independent, but his voting record suggests otherwise. 



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  I am watching my back, but I am sure the cameras are there to watch my back for me. But I hope they support the coalition's rejection of this particular piece of legislation. I hope they do it for the benefit of the charities, which, as I say, have supported us so well for so many years and do not need another layer of bureaucracy placed over them by this debt ridden government in a leadership crisis.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (13:56):  If you wanted a better example of the philosophical divide between that side of the chamber and this side of the chamber, I think it is best encapsulated in the legislation that is before the House today. The Charities Bill 2013 and Charities (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 really go to the core of that philosophical divide between the approach of the social democrats on that side and those of us who believe in the supremacy of the individual and the fact that the individual reigns supreme over the state, which is very much on this side of the chamber with perhaps a couple of exclusions—in particular the Greens, of course, who sit up in the crossbenches there.


The reality is that this bill is not a good bill. The coalition do not support it. We will repeal this legislation should we be fortunate enough to get elected on 14 September. At its core this bill represents another very large step in the ever-growing demand by the Labor Party to see more bureaucrats, more bureaucracy and a greater reach for state power. It is the coalition that virtually has a monopoly in this place on defending the opportunity for individuals and charities to stand up against the state. It is the Labor Party that hold at its core the view that the very best way any government can go about assisting the community sector or an individual is for the government to ensure that there are new regulations in place and a whole new mechanism which rolls out bureaucracy that will apply in this particular instance to the charitable sector.


This is nothing new. We have looked at this before. The previous coalition, when we were in government under John Howard, looked at this sector in great detail and took a number of decisions about what needed to happen. But it goes back even further than that. The definition of 'charities' dates back to 1601. It has been a common law definition that has applied since 1601—over 400 years—and that has well and truly stood the test of time. Yet, despite the fact that there are 400 years of precedent, the reality is that the Labor Party gets elected and, lo and behold, we have a new minister who says: 'We know better than the last 400 years of common law. We know better about what is good for the charitable sector.' The simple fact is that, in attempting to codify common law definitions of charities and put in place a whole new bureaucracy that applies to charities, the Labor Party will succeed in doing nothing more than applying a whole raft of regulation and bureaucracy to a sector that, frankly, does not need it.


If there is one part of Australian society that does not need extra red tape, it has to be the volunteers who work hard in the charitable sector. On this side of the House we understand the demands for the charitable sector. We know the volunteers who roll up their sleeves and go about undertaking the work they do to make Australia a better society. We know they have been working harder in the last six years than they had to for a great deal of time. The reality is that those people do so because of their passion for the cause. They do not do so because they have got a bureaucrat in Canberra who says to them what they must do. 


The last thing they need is to divert their attention away from worthy recipients of charitable sectors towards other activities like red-tape compliance. That is precisely what this bill does. The simple fact is that there are some great charities out there. I think about one, for example, called beyondblue. Beyondblue, as we know, is chaired by a high-profile former Liberal, and I do not think that there is any demand for them to suddenly go about changing their name since the comments from the Prime Minister last week.

 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  I genuinely, genuinely thank the Leader of the Opposition for this question, because, of course, the Leader of the Opposition and his team are the creators of and contributors to this national mood. They are out there with their reckless and ridiculous claims about a budget emergency. He quotes Cameron Clyne from the National Australia Bank—



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business is warned!




Ms GILLARD:
  He quotes the CEO of the National Australia Bank. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition get him on the phone and ask him whether or not he would endorse the opposition's language of 'budget emergency'. Of course he would not, because responsible businesspeople know that the Leader of the Opposition and his team are seeking political advantage by talking the Australian economy down. What they seek to do every day is to pretend that the Australian economy is somehow weak, to pretend that there is somehow an unsustainable burden of debt. 


The Leader of the Opposition ought to know—though, given his lack of knowledge of economics, perhaps he does not—that, compared with countries around the world, the Australian economy is standing resilient and strong, having come through the global financial crisis by unions, businesses, this government and the Australian community working together to ensure we kept Australians in work. Having come through that global financial crisis strong, we are here today with sustainable public finances, a AAA rating by every major ratings agency for the first time in our nation's history and, despite all the ridiculous claims of the opposition, with modest debt—the equivalent of someone earning $100,000 a year having a $12,000 mortgage. We are in a position, therefore, having come through strong with strong public finances and a AAA rating, to build and invest for the future, which is precisely what this government is doing: investing in a clean energy future, which the Leader of the Opposition wants to wreck; investing in a National Broadband Network, which the Leader of the Opposition wants to wreck; investing in infrastructure, which the Leader of the Opposition wants to wreck; and, of course, he is wrecking our chances for our children to have a high-quality, world-class education so we can be a strong and prosperous nation in the future—something the Leader of the Opposition wants to wreck.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:04):  To the Leader of the Opposition: when will you stop this nonsense and start articulating policies for the nation's future? He comes into this parliament and quotes Cameron Clyne from the National Australia Bank. Get him on the phone and find out how he feels about your company tax increase, get him on the phone and ask him how much you are going to cost that bank, and get him on the phone and ask him how much of that is going to be passed through to people who have mortgages with the National Australia Bank. That should give you some information about how interest rates for people who are seeking to work hard, raise their families and buy their own home will be increased by your reckless policies and plans—just one thing you intend to do to hurt Australian families. Their interest rates will go up, their school kids bonus will be gone and their future that could be in high-wage and high-skill jobs will be destroyed by your recklessness. 


The Leader of the Opposition has peddled falsehoods and nonsense for too long. He cannot—he is obviously unable to—articulate a vision for this country's future, other than the secret cuts that he does not want families to know about, and there is no better example than this question in question time today.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change, Industry and Innovation) (14:55):  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He has a lot of workers from the car industry in his electorate, and so he has a very keen interest in the industry. Of course, auto manufacturing is a very important industry in this country, and it is also a very graphic example of how the stupid and irresponsible policies of the opposition are undermining business confidence, how they are undermining investments and how they are destroying job security. This is an industry that provides jobs directly and indirectly to about 250,000 people in this country. It is an industry that generates skills, research and development and industrial capabilities, like robotics and advanced manufacturing, that are very important for the economy. Those are some of the reasons why the government remains very committed to auto manufacturing in this country.


Our new car plan provides for $5.4 billion of assistance to the sector to the year 2020. But what an astonishing thing: at a time when we have pressures from the high value of the Australian dollar, the pressures of global economic uncertainty, the pressures of intense international competition and the transition that is taking place in our country, how astonishing that notwithstanding all of those things the greatest threat to every motor-vehicle-manufacturing worker's job in this country are the opposition leader and the coalition's policies. They are the ones threatening this industry.


This is the fact of the matter: the opposition plans to cut assistance to this industry by $500 million to the year 2015—over the next two years—and to put at risk a further $1½ billion beyond 2015. You could not have a more concrete example of a policy position that can destroy an industry and destroy tens of thousands of jobs. That is exactly what the coalition is proposing to do, and it could not have been made any more clear than by Mr Mike Devereux, the general manager and CEO of General Motors Holden in Australia, just last week. He spelt out exactly what the coalition's policy will mean. This is important for many, many workers and their families in South Australia and in Victoria in particular, because Mr Devereux said quite clearly that Holden would cease manufacturing in this country should the coalition's policy be implemented. It would destroy tens of thousands of jobs. You could not get a more concrete example of the choice that people have at this coming election. If you stand for the car industry and workers in it, vote Labor!

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:16):  With the standing of the government and respect for this parliament at near record lows I regret to say that this parliament, the parliament now drawing to its close, has been a low and dishonourable one.


At the beginning of the life of the current government, the Prime Minister stood and said to the Australian public that she would be:


… faithful to the trust that has been extended to us.


In 88 days time the public will finally have their chance to pass judgement on just how the Prime Minister has been faithful to the trust that was placed in her. I suspect that that will be a critical judgement because, wherever you look, this is a parliament which has let down the Australian people and a government which has betrayed the trust that the people extended to it—only just, nevertheless, they did extend to it—at the last election.


There is the carbon tax that was never going to happen, which did happen. There was the surplus—the 'no ifs, no buts surplus'—that would happen come hell or high water and that has never happened. Instead, we have a debt that is now racing towards $340 billion. There is the mining tax, which has achieved the extraordinary outcome of damaging investment, damaging confidence and employment, without actually raising any revenue. 


There was the live cattle ban, in panic at a television program—perhaps the most disastrous decision ever taken towards one of our near and important neighbours in our country's history. There was the political execution of an excellent Speaker because it suited the political convenience of the Prime Minister. We have had three leadership challenges in three years. We have had the protection racket that has been extended towards the member for Dobell by a Prime Minister only too familiar with the operation of union slush funds—




Ms Roxon:
  Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You have ruled before that that language is not appropriate to be used with regard to the conduct of the Prime Minister in relation to the member for Dobell. I ask that the member withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition has the call but I will advise that, as the member for Gellibrand rightly points out, the language has been asked to be withdrawn. I am not going to do it on this occasion, but I will be mindful of other words in the member's statement.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I appreciate your forbearance, Madam Speaker. There was the Australia Day riot, which turned out to have been orchestrated out of the Prime Minister's office. But, above all else, there was the failure that will haunt the memory of this parliament and this government: the ongoing disaster on our borders, a disaster that the Prime Minister promised to fix on 24 June 2010.


We have had almost 45,000 illegal arrivals by boat—more than the population of Gladstone, more than the population of Coffs Harbour, more than the population of Shepparton and more than the population of Mount Gambier. No-one wants to see any Australian government fail. No-one wants to see any Australian government give up on governing but that, I regret to say, is what this government has done.


We have 88 days until the election. The people will then have their chance to pass judgement on this government. They will have a choice between an incompetent and untrustworthy government and a coalition that will stop the boats, that will repeal the carbon tax and that will get the budget back into the black. That is the pledge that we make to the Australian people and that is a pledge that we will honour.


As things stand, the Australian people are frustrated and angry. They are frustrated and angry with a government that has let them down and a government that has repeatedly betrayed them. Indeed, Labor people—decent, honourable Labor people—are embarrassed and even ashamed at the performance of this government. I am pleased that the member for Hotham has stayed in the House to listen to this MPI, because the member for Hotham called it for Australia. That is what he did: he called it for Australia when he said he could no longer serve on this Prime Minister's frontbench. I regret to say that this particular government is now beyond cure. This particular government is now past the point of no return. The poison is so deep, the division and dysfunction so deep that there is nothing that can save the contemporary Labor Party except time out to decide what it actually stands for and what it now believes.


The Australian people are an optimistic people. We know that better times can come. We know that better times are ahead of us but what we need is a government that you can trust and a government that is competent to deliver effective administration. I want to say to the Australian people: I am proud of the team that I lead. I am proud of the fact that the team I lead is representative of the breadth and depth of the Australian people. I am confident that there would actually be more former tradesmen on this side of the parliament these days than on that side of the parliament. I am proud of the fact that the first Indigenous member of the House of Representatives is sitting on this side of the parliament for the Liberal Party. I am proud of the fact that, if every coalition candidate in this election were to come to this parliament, the most common name in the Liberal Party party room would be Nguyen. It is a sign of just how much the modern Liberal Party is standing foursquare with the decent people of our country.


I know that our team is ready to form a stable and competent government. My team does not need to learn on the job, because my team has done the job before. Sixteen members of the shadow cabinet were ministers in a government that did stop the boats, that did bring the budget back into the black, that did get taxes down, that did abolish unnecessary taxes. We have done it before and we will do it again. We understand in the marrow of our bones that you cannot have a strong society, you cannot have strong communities without a strong economy to sustain them, and a strong economy pivotally depends upon profitable private businesses. We understand this. We get this. We know that it is not government that creates wealth; it is business that creates wealth. No government has ever taxed a country into prosperity. Plenty of governments have taxed a country into the ground. Not one has ever taxed a country into prosperity.


So our economic plan starts with abolishing the carbon tax and the mining tax. We will cut red tape. We will boost productivity so that the creative businesspeople of this country can get a fair go to survive and prosper, and so the workers of Australia can get a fair go to keep their jobs and to prosper. A strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia—that is how this coalition will deliver hope, reward and opportunity should we be entrusted with the government of this country in 88 days time. We will relieve the pressure on families. We will relieve the pressure that we know the families and households of Australia are under. Under us they will keep the tax cuts and pension and benefit rises, but they will most assuredly lose the carbon tax.


This is not just about creating a richer country; it is about creating a better country too. What I want to achieve—what my team wants to achieve—is giving the Australian people confidence that we can come closer to being our best selves. We are all conservationists now. That is why I want direct action to improve our environment, not a great big new tax that will clobber the economy without actually reducing our emissions. As well as an emissions reduction fund for more trees, better soils and smarter technology, there will be a green army 15,000 strong marching to the help of our degraded land and waterways. Anyone who looks at our country knows that land care needs more than the largely volunteer efforts of farmers and of understaffed local councils. We will give our country the workforce it needs if our remnant bushland is to survive and if our creeks are to run clean. We will give idealistic young people and older people a way to turn their environmental commitment into practical action so that our gift to the future will be a country in better shape than that which we inherited.


Should the coalition win the election, I will continue my practice of spending a week a year as a volunteer in a remote Indigenous community. If people are expected to live there, a Prime Minister should be prepared to stay there and senior public servants should be prepared to stay there too. Nothing would focus people's minds more on the issues of remote Australia than conducting the government from there even if it is only for a week. I do not underestimate the challenges of crafting an Indigenous recognition amendment that will be an advance for Aboriginal people without creating two classes of Australian. No, I do not underestimate the difficulty of this challenge; but, should there be a change of government on 14 September, we will persevere and get this right. In so doing, this nation of ours—this great nation—will finally be made whole.


Everyone knows that I am a late convert to the cause of a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme. I am a late convert, but I tell you I have a convert's zeal. Why should people get their full pay while on holiday and on sick leave and just a welfare wage while on parental leave? If blokes had babies, this never would have been tolerated. I did not always understand this, but I do now. A fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme is an important economic reform. It is good for population, it is good for productivity, it is good for participation—in fact, all three of the Ps which economic strength requires. Most of all, a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme is an issue of justice—justice for the women of our country that will finally be delivered under a coalition government.


I know I surprised people three years ago with this commitment to a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme, but serious people do have the capacity to grow and I am pleased to say that I understand this issue much better now than I did a decade ago. I have learnt from watching the example of good leaders—people like Bob Hawke as well as John Howard, who made the transition from tribal chief to national leader. I understand that a Prime Minister should never set out to deliberately divide one Australian from another, as we have seen in this current parliament. A Prime Minister should never think that he or she is somehow bigger than the party or the country. Prime ministers must always be the servants of their party and, above all else, the servants of their country.


Finally, should there be a change of government on 14 September, this parliament must be a better place. There has been too much venom and too many baseless accusations of bad faith—and I suspect we might even have a few in a few moments. We are better than that, and I hope to have a chance to demonstrate that we are better than that. After 14 September I am confident that the people of Australia will be able to have more pride in their parliament. (Time expired)

He tried to destroy the reputation of this parliament to create a sense of chaos every day in an economy and in a society that has actually been going pretty well. 


The objective evidence of that is actually provided by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which only a few weeks ago completed its analysis and released it publicly. On a range of 11 different indicators—not only economic indicators but also quality of life indicators, such as longevity and sense of community—where do you reckon Australia came? No. 1 in the world; Australia is the best country in the world. But you would not have known it from this coalition after the last 2½ years, because they have spent every day in this parliament spitting venom and trying to trash talk the economy in the hope that, although it would cost tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Australian jobs, it might advance their own pathetic, personal ambitions. That is what has happened in this parliament. The interests of the coalition and their ambitions to climb up the ladder have stood and ranked above those of the everyday Australians who we are here to represent. 


This is a matter of public importance debate about the strength of the economy. Now let us go to the strength of the Australian economy. The OECD projects that in the coming two years we will grow faster than any major, advanced country on earth. When we came to government, the Reserve Bank cash rate was 6¾ per cent; it is now 2¾ per cent. That is such a large reduction in interest rates that it is saving an average household with a mortgage of $300,000 at least $5,000 a year. That is unambiguously good news for mortgage holders and also for small businesses. Why have interest rates been able to fall? Because inflation is contained. The Reserve Bank is an inflation-targeting reserve bank and it has been comfortable with the inflation rate under this government. Compare that with the inflation rate and the interest rate performance of the previous coalition government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a cabinet minister: after the 2004 election, when John Howard promised to keep interest rates at record lows, they went up 10 times because inflation went up. The Reserve Bank's arm was forced because the previous coalition refused to invest in skills, refused to invest in the education of our young people and refused to invest in infrastructure. 


All of those investments are now taking place under the Gillard Labor government. We have eased those capacity constraints and as a consequence of that we have had very strong growth compared with all major advanced countries at a time when 28 million jobs were lost around the world because of a global financial crisis—a debate through which the Leader of the Opposition slept—which senior members of the coalition now claim did not exist: 'It was a little blip in the Northern Hemisphere.' Through that period, when 28 million jobs were lost through a so-called 'blip' in the Northern Hemisphere, 961,000 jobs had been created in Australia because the Labor government puts jobs first. That is in our DNA. We were created as a political party to advance the interests of the working men and women of Australia, and we stood up for the working men and women of Australia during the global financial crisis, which became the deepest global recession since the Great Depression.


The truth is the former opposition leader at least provided some support for our stimulus package, but the present opposition leader has senior frontbenchers, such as the Manager of Opposition Business, saying, 'A coalition government would never have gone into deficit.' Confronted with a write-down, a reduction, in expected revenues of $180 billion, the prescription of the Leader of the Opposition's team would be to match it with cuts of $180 billion. That would deliver in Australia, over that time, a deep and prolonged recession. But that was not just a mistaken quote from the Manager of Opposition Business. The shadow Attorney-General said the same thing. That it should never have gone into debt. 


What did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said, 'I cannot see what was wrong with the New Zealand response to the global financial crisis.' Well, I can tell you what was wrong with it—a recession lasting more than a year. But the opposition do not mind recessions because they focus the attention, as far as the coalition is concerned, of the workers on their jobs so that they are good compliant workers because they are fearful every day of losing their jobs and worry if they can ever get one during a recession and its aftermath.


The indicators of a strong economy are the AAA rating of the Australian economy not by one or two but all three international ratings agencies. That is a gold standard assessment, yet we have the coalition every day in the parliament saying the economy is a disaster and a mess. Their policy prescriptions are a worry if the diagnosis from the coalition is that the economy is in an emergency situation and a mess, notwithstanding that we have inflation contained, interest rates down, a AAA rating and growth stronger than every major advanced country. They say that is an emergency. 


When that is the prescription and the diagnosis, what is their policy? We know what their policy is. Their policy is to cut to the bone. They believe that we should never have had debt in this country. They think that, if they get into government, the objective is to race for a surplus. How do you race for a surplus? By cutting jobs and services. We know already that they have promised to cut 20,000 jobs in this country. They have also said that they will cut services. They will cut Medicare Locals and they will cut GP superclinics. They will cut the services on which the Australian people rely. We know some of that, but we do not know all of it. The reason we do not know all is that the mechanism that they have already announced is a commission of audit, otherwise described by the Treasurer as a commission of cuts. 


There is form for this. We can check the form guide. Not only has Campbell Newman in Queensland used this device to conceal from the Queensland people the extent of the savagery of the cuts from which the people of Queensland are still reeling but the previous Howard government did the same thing. After the 1996 election, instead of laying out what they were going to do if they were elected, they had a commission of audit. What did they do? They cut training. They cut the vital services that were so important—TAFE funding—and we are only just recovering from those savage cuts. They lacked the courage to tell the Australian people and now what is the Leader of the Opposition—the big he-man who says, 'Look at me'—doing? He is hiding behind the commission of cuts. If he is elected, he is going to use exactly the same device as Campbell Newman. Campbell Newman's cuts are but the curtain-raiser to the cuts that the Leader of the Opposition would implement. Why? Because the shadow Treasurer has said that we are in an emergency. He has said economic growth is flatlining at trend. This is a new concept. This is the level of economic literacy. No wonder the Leader of the Opposition has been described as economically innumerate and illiterate.



A government member:  Who said that?




Dr EMERSON:
  It was actually Professor John Hewson and Peter Costello. They would know a thing about it because they have been in shadow cabinet with the guy. He was employed by Professor John Hewson. He knows the form of the Leader of the Opposition very well. I will tell you who knows it even better and that is former Treasurer Peter Costello. They described the Leader of the Opposition as economically illiterate and innumerate. But his diagnosis is that the economy is in an emergency situation. Why? Because of flatlining at trend. You cannot believe the economic incompetence of these people in the coalition. So they say, 'We need a commission of audit.' But we have been able to ascertain a few of the decisions that they have made.


We have coalition members of parliament writing to our minister for families saying: 'Some of our families are missing out on the schoolkids bonus. What are you going to do about it?' For goodness sake, write to the Leader of the Opposition and ask him what he is going to do about it. He has a sense of equity. There will not only be a few who miss out on the schoolkids bonus. He is going to be fair. Everyone misses out on the bonus because it is going to be axed. That is $15,000 for two kids over the lifetime at school of those kids. That is $15,000 ripped out of families trying to send kids to school and getting a bit of support from us to do so.


Wait, there is more! We have had a debate about superannuation in this parliament for about 20 years. The defining feature of superannuation is that Labor introduced compulsory superannuation to extend it to the men and women of Australia for universal retirement income. The defining feature of this coalition is they have opposed every single increase in superannuation that has been implemented by a Labor government. The shadow Treasurer went public and said, 'We support the legislation to increase superannuation from nine to 12 per cent.' That is blatantly untrue. They came in here and voted against it. Worse than that, not only did they oppose abolishing the superannuation contributions tax for people on low incomes, part-timers, students—mostly women—but they have promised to reimpose it. We have here in the parliament a speech by the Leader of the Opposition saying: Look at us. We are the party of lower taxes.' The party that has a policy to increase taxes is the Liberal Party. It has promised to reimpose a 15 per cent contributions tax on 3.6 million low-income, vulnerable Australians—casuals, part-timers, mostly women—and it says it is the low-tax party!


What else are they doing on the tax front? They actually opposed the reduction in the company income tax from 30 per cent to 29 per cent, which ended up, because we could not get it through, funding the schoolkids bonus, which they are going to axe if they get elected. What else are they doing? There is that great big new tax on everything you buy, their paid parental leave. Their gold-plated paid parental leave: a 1½ per cent increase in the company tax rate and the Leader of the Opposition said: 'Coles, Woolies, the banks and the petrol companies will absorb that. They won't pass that on. They're the good guys; they won't do that.' Of course they will. In fact, the banking industry is complaining because they are saying they will pass it on, so everyone will pay for this gold-plated paid parental leave scheme with increased taxation. And the Leader of the Opposition said, on climate change, 'We'll get rid of the carbon price and we'll put in this kind of like costless direct action plan.' Costless? At $1,300 per household! That is an increase in taxes. No wonder they call him economically illiterate. That is an increase in taxes.


The truth is it is not just a philosophical divide between Labor and the coalition; it is a chasm. You have Labor, which has presided over a resilient economy, which has reached out to people, making sure that no-one is left behind—a middle of the road party—and you have an opposition leader, who has dragged the Liberal Party to the hard Right, a party which has promised, with great zeal, that if it got elected it would scrap the national school improvement plan because it does not believe that every young Australian deserves a great education. From our hearts, that is what we believe in, that is what we have fought for. And the coalition is saying to state premiers, 'Don't do that, because our ambitious, our plans are more important than theirs.' It is a complete disgrace.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2013-06-18,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:47):  Just 88 days to go. Just 88 days for the people to decide whether this government deserves another term or whether they have had enough. It seems to me, as I walk around Australia and talk to voters, they are looking forward to 14 September just like children are looking forward to Christmas. They have had enough. For almost three years this government has fallen further and further into the mire and the moral abyss. The Prime Minister drank the Kool-Aid that the Greens had served up, and she accepted the poisoned chalice of the new paradigm from the members for New England and Lyne, and set about establishing this government. These colleagues, the Greens and the Independents, have been with Labor through every stumble, through every misstep along the way over the past three years. As this incompetent government lurched from one disaster to another, the Greens and the Independents were there with them, propping them up. Their full-throated support for the carbon tax and all of Labor's legacy fiascos has reduced them to an echo of this Prime Minister and the people have stopped listening to all of them.


At what point during these three years did it first occur to the Prime Minister to go back on her solemn promise to the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led? Was it seconds or just milliseconds? Was it even a consideration? Did her word ever matter to her? She lost the trust of the people of Australia in her very first days after the last election. Did she ever give a thought to the rank betrayal that she was inflicting on the entire nation? No, her political survival was always at the top. Honour and integrity have had no role in the life of this government and the Australian people have endured an endless chain of bungles, scandals, backroom deals and lost opportunities.


The national accounts show that this government has squandered the resources boom. Labor headlined its previous two budgets as spreading the proceeds of the boom and then set about spending the money that it expected to be raised over the years ahead. But in fact the boom has not come. Labor busted the boom before it even existed with its ill-considered new taxes and incompetent policies. This budget was something different. It forgot about sharing the proceeds of the boom. We were told it was a budget that was about growth and jobs, except it was predicted to have lower growth than the previous year and higher unemployment. So the very objectives that the Labor Party set for itself in its budget were in fact shattered by its own predictions for the year ahead. The truth is businesses are cutting investment, and that means lost opportunity. Consumers are not spending, and that means fewer jobs.


Our domestic economy is going backwards with just paper thin growth, just over 0.6 per cent—and, frankly, we would not have had that if confidence was not so low that imports have been declining. At the heart of what is afflicting our nation is a debilitating case of despair. I think of the words of Cameron Clyne, chief executive of the National Australia Bank, when he said that there is a 'bias towards pessimism' among the business community. He said:


We have a national mood of gloom …


Well, if the head of a bank thinks things are gloomy, what do their customers think? If the banks are worried, how can small businesses ever hope to succeed? We could call the Treasurer's Fix-o-Gram to find a solution. You will not find any fixes in the budget; you just have to subscribe to his app Fix-o-Gram. Unfortunately, this government has been too much about fixes over the years—deals, fixes—but no solutions to the issues confronting the Australian people.


The lack of confidence that this government inspires spreads throughout the business community and households really like a cancer. Their record is of failure and of ineptitude, of a people incapable of governing let alone in the national interest. They are unable to govern themselves. Here we are, only 88 days away from an election, and we still do not know who the Prime Minister is going to be on that day. Is it going to be the Rudd-Gillard government or is it going to be the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government? We have another few days and so it might be the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd-Gillard-Rudd-Gillard government. This is because Labor cannot even make up their own minds about who should be their leader. How can the public have any confidence in that kind of rabble?


Is it former Prime Minister Rudd who failed on border protection or is it Prime Minister Gillard, who on election promised to fix it? Should we be holding former Prime Minister Rudd to account for the failed mining tax or should we be holding to account Prime Minister Gillard, who promised to fix it and did not do it? Should we be holding the Prime Minister to account for the carbon tax that she promised to fix? Or do we hold the inventor of the tax, former Prime Minister Rudd, to blame for all of these debacles?



An opposition member:  Both!




Mr TRUSS:
  Yes, as I have just heard, they have both failed. They have both failed their party and, more importantly, they have both failed the Australian people. There are so many examples of failure: the carbon tax that the Prime Minister said in government she would not deliver; the supposed community consensus before any action would be taken on climate policy; a people's assembly to build that consensus. These are all government election promises and they have just disappeared. There are the secret deals with the big three miners, who carved themselves out of the mining tax and left the small miners to carry the can; the roof batts program that burnt down people's houses; the overpriced school halls; and GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch that never got off the ground. Now we have, of course, 'asbestos watch' while the NBN continues to squander the nation's savings. The NBN itself is an example of a $90 billion white elephant which no-one is signing up to. Clearly, there are more years of costly delays ahead. They gave Telstra $11 billion to stop using their own perfectly functional network and they have got nothing much to replace it with.


Take the private health insurance rebates that Labor swore were part of the family budget and as such were guaranteed would remain untouched. In almost every budget Labor have sought to reduce the private health insurance rebates. They have offered to take five asylum seekers from Malaysia for every one person sent by them: 'Hey, we've got 44,000! How many are you going to take?'



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr TRUSS:
  Yes, this is a good deal for Tom Waterhouse! Of course, there was the mining tax that collected only 10 per cent of what was expected and the near destruction of Australia's northern beef industry because of a panicked overreaction to a television program. On this government's watch a manufacturing job in Australia has been axed every 20 minutes. How is that for the party for jobs? Now we have got Ford, after being given $34 million to save jobs, closing its plant down. What about the future of Simplot and SPC, the last of our major food-processing establishments in this country? Labor has no answer. It is doing nothing for employers and it is doing nothing for employees as factories close down one after the other.


There has to be a change. We do need to have a government that has actually got a plan, a vision, for our country. All this would be laughable if it were not so insulting to the people of Australia. In 88 days the people will decide whether they want this tragic soap opera as a rerun or they want a change, a coalition government that has a plan to bring the budget into balance and to start paying down Labor's runaway debt. Abolishing the carbon tax is a positive action to reduce costs for families and businesses, as is abolishing the mining tax, cutting red tape by $1 billion a year to give small business the relief that they need, or creating two million new jobs. We will cut the green tape and will have a no-nonsense, one-stop shop to fast-track approvals. Our plan provides families with the surety that they need to be confident for their future. We have the experience. We have the record. We have done this before. We have created jobs and we will make sure that Australia grows— (Time expired)

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-06-18,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Government Whip) (15:57):  I rise to speak on this MPI, having listened to the member for Wide Bay's contribution—and, unfortunately, it is a bit of my life that I will never get back—but I was looking for him to be a bit fair dinkum. As he is a Queenslander, I thought he might have touched on a couple of the significant things about stable government. I thought that, rather than talk about his dream of two million jobs, he would have spoken about the 960,000 jobs that have actually been created since he has been sitting on that side of the chamber. I thought he would have spoken about that. I thought that perhaps he, as a world-travelling man—and I have travelled overseas with the member for Wide Bay—might have touched on what conditions were like around Europe. We have 5.5 per cent unemployment—and it went down last month—but you can look at places in Europe where it is 11.9 per cent. There are places in Spain where one in two young people are unemployed. I thought he might have mentioned that because he does come from a part of Queensland that has higher unemployment. I thought as a Queenslander he might have mentioned that.


I thought he might have mentioned how proud he was to be in a nation that has a AAA credit rating from all three ratings agencies. I thought he would have been bipartisan enough to say that that is a good thing, but he forgot to mention it. Only eight countries of 200 countries around the world have this status. That is an empirical fact. That is not a press release; that is an empirical fact from the ratings agencies. Since he moved to that side of the chamber, how have we performed in terms of the size of our economy? He talks about doom and gloom and the need for stability. We have changed from being the 15th biggest economy in the world and moved up to being the 12th biggest economy in the world. I thought he would have said, from pure pride as an Australian, that he is proud—but no mention of that. And we have performed six times faster than those powerhouse countries like Germany and the United States.


He did not mention the global financial crisis. That two years has been taken out of the LNP history books. It is almost a Goebbels-type experiment in removing things from history: 'This did not occur.' The reality is we did have a global financial crisis. You look around the world and see the results of that and how they are still flowing through—how homes have been destroyed, how jobs have been destroyed, how whole communities have been destroyed by the impact of the global financial crisis. Under the Labor government, under Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard, we have steered through with a focus on jobs. That is the reality that I thought the member for Wide Bay would have touched on. That is the reality I thought the Leader of the Opposition would have touched on. The Leader of the Opposition understands these facts. I think he has a degree in economics. I thought he would have been aware of this. 


The reality is the world has changed for those on that side of the chamber on two significant dates. Obviously, 24 November 2007 was a tough day for many of them when they got thrown out of government by the people of Australia. That was tough and some of them have never recovered. They churned through a couple of leaders—not deputy leaders, we still have a deputy leader who has loyally served three different leaders. We went through Brendan Nelson and the member for Wentworth and then moved on to the member for Warringah.


Then there was 1 December 2009—and didn't the world change for that side of parliament from that day onwards? I have only been a member of parliament since 24 November 2007, so I can only see it through that prism. I have had two parliaments to see it through—the 42nd Parliament and the 43rd Parliament. That is what my observations are based on. Remember 1 December 2009, when the Leader of the Opposition was wholeheartedly endorsed by his party room by one vote, with one spoiled ballot and one absent vote? But for that moment in history, the history of Australia could have been changed perhaps. 


Then we go through to the election day and those 17 days of desperate negotiations from the Leader of the Opposition, where he was prepared to do anything. He made that clear. He made the call to the member for New England, saying, 'I will do anything.' I think he made it very clear as to what he would do to grab power. He was happy to have power without glory. That has been the journey ever since.


Let us look at what has gone on in the 43rd Parliament in particular. As I said, I am comparing the 42nd and 43rd parliaments. Let us look at some of the little things that have happened around this place under the Leader of the Opposition. First a simple little thing. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition when he was in government used to play touch football every morning. The member for Rankin used to play—



Dr Emerson interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  I think the member for Rankin might be misleading the parliament there!




Dr Emerson:
  But not deliberately!




Mr PERRETT:
  But not deliberately. It was a very harmonious place, where people, irrespective of the party they came from, would go down and play touch football together. From 24 November 2007 the member for Warringah said he would not play touch football anymore. Then in the 43rd Parliament it changed again. He has actually frowned upon people even playing touch football together. So that has ceased. 


What are the other things? I notice a member from the Labor Party on the Speakers' panel. The member for Warringah said, 'No member of the Liberal and National parties will be a member of the Speaker's panel, apart from the member for Maranoa.' He ordered that they would not contribute to the democratic process, thus on one level saying, 'We support the democratic process,' but on the very other giving specific direction that undermines the political process.


Let us look at some of those other white-anting processes—not just removing people from the Speaker's panel and not just removing people from participating in sports but saying no to everything in the legislative program. If you look at the percentage of votes in the 42nd Parliament where we had unanimous support from the parliament compared to the 43rd Parliament, it has decreased about 15 per cent. All those common-sense pieces of legislation that parliament just grinds out, irrespective of who is in power—which parties are on which side of the chamber—the member for Warringah has made it specific, has made it clear, has given directions to the Liberal and National parties that 'No!' is the starting point for any piece of legislation and then negotiations occur from there. What are the ramifications of that? That means that someone who has a sick child cannot even get a pair to go and see their kid. He has been white-anting democracy throughout—ever since 1 December but particularly since that election in 2010.


Why is that so? Maybe he has to examine his own soul in terms of the trap that he has laid for Australian democracy. Because he has such a naked desire to grab power at any cost, he has betrayed Australian democracy. Maybe that is something that happens. We are not dissimilar in age. Maybe as the member for Warringah is getting on in years he thinks: 'This is my chance. This is the time for me to make a mark on the world stage or the Australian stage'—or whatever stage he thinks he is strutting on. The reality is that he is prepared to do anything and bring down Australian democracy in that process—and to do so in a way which is so hypocritical. On the one hand he says, 'Oh, no, we are very bipartisan,' but at the very same time he is putting dog whistles out there in the community, sending out his spear throwers to attack great Australian institutions like the Public Service. Things that are normally supported in a bipartisan approach, this member for Warringah has undermined. He has undermined those democratic processes. 


We all know that saying about power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely. That is what we are staring at—the fact that we might be contemplating on 14 September. Imagine a leader of the government, a leader of this nation, who is prepared to do anything to gain power. If you do not have the moral compass, if you do not have a soul that dictates what you do, then you are a rudderless person. You are unable to make the correct decision, the moral decision, the right decision—the decision in the nation's interest. This 'hate song of J Alfred Prufrock' that we have been hearing since election day from the member for Warringah has, I think, created a festering in Australian democracy, and it will come home to roost if on 14 September the Leader of the Opposition is made the leader of the government—and heaven help us if that does take place.

"Roy, Wyatt, MP",LP,2013-06-18,"



WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (16:07):  It is interesting to follow the bizarre lecturing of the member for Moreton on politicians doing anything to seize power. Perhaps he should spend some more time speaking to the Prime Minister or the member for Griffith, his neighbour in Queensland. But I rise to talk about what is becoming a matter of urgency: the need to install a new government of Australia that will put an end to the chaos and confusion that have seeped into everyday life, sapping confidence and dulling spirits. We are so much better than what the Labor Party has determined for us over the last 5½ years, and that is at the crux of this sorry story of the federal Labor government.


On our side of this place, we believe all Australians should have the right to self-determination along the precious journey that is their life. That is freedom to choose their path, not have it charted by the government. We believe that a hand-up will always be better than a handout; we believe in the idea that equality of opportunity is the great leveller in our society, not subsidy; and we believe in the principle that if you work hard you should be fairly rewarded for that hard work, not penalised. Indeed, we are bound by the idea that liberalism is the path to fairness and the knowledge that, conversely, enforced equality never liberates anybody.


Our nation deserves and is now hungering for a strong, steady, reliable government to fuel and reinvigorate our economy and return it to prosperity. To make that happen, we need to unlock the potential of the Australian people by removing government from their lives. On 14 September, the Australian people will have an important choice. On one side is a divided and dysfunctional Labor Party that is only focused on itself. As the member for Swan has often said to me, the Labor Party wants the Australian people to re-elect it on another dubious promise, not its performance. On the other side is a coalition that has positive plans for real solutions for all Australians.


We are ready to govern. We have the experience, the know-how and the attitude, and we have 12 rock-solid layers of policy priority. First, the coalition will build a strong, diversified economy by lowering taxes and delivering more jobs, higher real incomes and better services for all Australians. We will then secure this prosperity by reining in the budget and cutting the waste and mismanagement of Labor. The coalition are proven prudent financial managers who will keep interest rates as low as possible and safeguard the Australian economy from economic shocks. We will help families get ahead by abolishing the carbon tax, the world's largest carbon tax, which has proved a springboard for electricity and gas prices. By reducing taxes, regulations and onerous reporting requirements, we will help small businesses grow and expand to employ more Australians. We will cut red and green tape by $1 billion every single year. We will create even stronger job growth by building a diversified five-pillar economy, generating one million new jobs over the next five years and two million jobs within 10 years.


We are committed to building better and more modern roads and infrastructure to get things moving, with a special emphasis on reducing the bottlenecks on our gridlocked major roads and highways. We will deliver better services, including health services, by increasing cooperation with the states and territories and by putting local communities in charge of improving the performance of hospitals. Similarly, we will deliver better education by giving communities, parents and principals carriage in the running of their local schools. On the environment, we will take direct action to reduce carbon emissions within Australia, not overseas, as well as establishing a 15,000-strong standing green army to clean up the environment. We will deliver stronger borders when the boats are stopped with proven tough measures. Finally, our united and experienced team will deliver a strong and stable government set on restoring confidence and accountability. We are the team that will not only rebuild the economy but renew the bonds of trust between the Australian people and the parliament. 


Perhaps it is because I am a product of generation Y or perhaps it is because, like my colleagues, I care about the future, but I am alert to the fact that Australians can no longer turn a blind eye to what is a brewing coalescence of intergenerational issues. We are now a land uniquely placed in the heart of a globalised world, between the dominant West and a rising Asia. While this changed landscape will assert its own influences, the next generation will face additional changes such as the ageing of our population. There will be a greater burden on a government drawing from a smaller revenue base. When the baby boomer generation fully leave the workforce, they will take with them not only their skills but their taxpaying capacity. While the preceding generation saw 2½ million Australians enter retirement, we are now on the brink of four million Australians edging towards retirement, about to draw on age pensions, pharmaceutical benefits and other assistance from government.


As a nation, it is absolutely critical that we meet this challenge from a position of strength. But instead, with the approach to this watershed challenge ticking down, this Labor government has chosen to pursue its own agenda and to turn inward and concentrate on its own political survival ahead of listening to real Australians—those hardworking Australians simply trying to make their way in life. In the shadow of an epoch of intergenerational challenge, this government has embarked on a sustained preoccupation with incompetency, broken promises and spin. Labor promised that there would be no carbon tax, yet we have a carbon tax. For this deceit, I am sorry to say that we are about to pay more. From 1 July, struggling businesses and family budgets will be hit with a five per cent rise in the carbon tax. It is another cruel blow for an already hamstrung economy, adding to cost-of-living pressures and placing jobs at risk. Under this federal Labor government, electricity prices have risen by 94 per cent nationwide and gas prices have increased by 62 per cent. On 1 July they will go up again.


A few days ago, I received an email from a local businessman who was closing his small to medium enterprise as a result of this government's taxes and regulation. He said:


I have conceded. That's it; I'm out.


While his story is especially tragic, the thrust of it has been echoed by many hard-working local business owners and managers who I have met over recent months.


One shop owner in Burpengary told me he was coughing up an extra $1,300 a month in carbon tax bills. Meanwhile, small business across the region has been damaged further by this government's overregulation and inflexibility in the workplace. A popular local coffee shop owner told me he wanted to expand and hire more staff, but rising overheads and reams of paperwork were a serious barrier.


In 5½ years, the Rudd-Gillard—now possibly Rudd—government has created 21,000 new regulations and 39 new or increased taxes. If a strong and stable government—a coalition government—are elected in September, we will keep income taxes cuts and fortnightly pension and benefit increases. So, that is tax cuts without a carbon tax, and, yes, we will cut red and green tape by at least $1 billion every year to give small business the chance to breathe, grow and thrive again.


While this Labor government has turned a $20 billion surplus under the Howard government into nearly $300 billion of debt, the next coalition government will draw only on its political pedigree and inheritance. It was Sir Robert Menzies who said:



We are a tax
-
reduction party.



Menzies understood, as the coalition does today, that:


… real tax reductions would be the best of all incentives to increased effort, earnings and production.


Australians require a government that will scrap unnecessary taxes, cut wasteful spending and reduce the tax burden on business. We need a government that is guided by the discipline that governments do not have any money of their own, just the people's money held in trust. We need a government that recognises that it may not have a solution to every problem, but, all too often, it is the problem. We need a government that does fewer things, but does them better.


This is the territory of the coalition: a government of hope, reward and opportunity. On 14 September, the could not be clearer.

"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2013-06-18,"



Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (16:17):  It is a great pleasure to speak on today's matter of public importance about stable government and a strong economy. Stability of government can be measured in a very simple fashion. The measure is: can the government of the day propose and pass its legislative program through the parliament? The answer for the Gillard-Labor government is, definitively, yes. That is why more than 400 bills—I think, by my rough counting, 482—have passed this parliament since September 2010. There are a few people here saying that it could be even more than that, and they may all be right. I hope it is because it is a bigger measure of our success.


Every sitting day in this place since September 2010, we have heard the ranting, the complaints and the stream of abuse from those on the opposition benches and, dare I say it, their fellow travellers in the media. It is a common perception. The story of the day that comes up from the other side is usually read in the paper that morning. Despite all the words and rhetoric of September 2010 in the lead-up to Labor forming a minority government, the reality is that the Liberal and National parties have never accepted that they lost election in 2010. As the Leader of the House has said on so many occasions, it is the longest dummy spit in Australian political history, and I have to agree with him.


During the 17 days following the 2010 election, we saw statements from the Leader of the Opposition. He said he would dignify the parliament and respect whatever decision the crossbenchers made. We had the parliamentary reform agreement, which went to a point where the speakership would not have even been partisan, if that had gone the whole way through. The Liberals and the Nationals agreed to it, not under coercion, but voluntarily. It was signed by the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the Opposition as well as the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House and the crossbenchers. 


Every sitting day, the Liberal and National parties' whole political strategy has been to wreck the parliament and disrupt the daily proceedings. The Leader of the Opposition has boasted about wrecking about the parliament. He has tried to do it on issue after issue. Who can forget the moving of more than 50 suspensions of standing orders by the opposition during question time in this parliament? Too lazy or too arrogant to ask questions of ministers during the time specially allotted to it, the opposition have repeatedly used up this time put aside for question time as a platform to deliver their media line of the day.


What we see, and continue to see, is the first opposition in Australia's is history that are not actually worried about policy, the details or the details of what is happening during the parliamentary day. They are more concerned about what the media line is for their side rather than worrying about the debates that affect the future of our country. I think the Australian public deserves far better than that. With their current numbers, the opposition form almost half the House, yet in spite of the fact that they are in a position, if they were to win support from the crossbenchers, to make a difference to the way this nation operates, in terms of policy, they have achieved nothing through this term of the 43rd Parliament.


The constant talking down of the Australian economy by the opposition for political advantage is proven wrong time and time again, yet it is so often repeated in the conservative press that one may well think it is Groundhog Day. For example, on 12 June this year a story ran that cited the private economist from Goldman Sachs who predicted that there was only a 20 per cent chance that Australia would head into recession. I suppose that is fair enough; he is entitled to his outlook as an economist, but so are the hundreds of other private-sector economists not all of whom share that same despondent outlook. So instead of fair or balanced coverage—let alone positive coverage—on that day we saw journalists, who should know better, blindly taking the hook, splashing the word 'recession' all over the headlines and lead paragraphs as though there was some consensus to this and that it was a credible view of our economy. The consequences, as we know, of this kind of misrepresentation about our economy live on for much longer than the 24-hour news cycle.


I would much rather rely on a credible authority, one who works as a highly respected senior public servant—indeed, the Secretary of the Treasury. As the Treasury secretary, Martin Parkinson, said earlier this month:


I do not think anybody should lightly throw around accusations that we are in recession or on the verge of recession. The most important thing when you think about economies is confidence. Trashing confidence, for whatever reason and however it is done, is not something that I think is in the national interest.


That was what Martin Parkinson, the Secretary of the Treasury, had to say, and I completely concur with that statement. But the newspaper report on 12 June was the third time in the last five years that economists from Goldman Sachs have predicted the same chance of a recession in Australia. Did these predictions come to be? No, they did not. But was it mentioned in any of the TV spots or newspaper headlines on the day? Of course not.


Too often we see both the Liberal and National parties—the opposition—determined to talk down our economy at every turn; to be slippery with the truth and to tell straight-out untruths about the economy. In particular, I am reminded of the opposition leader's pledge to return growth to the economy, which I find a bit strange. It is actually more than stretching the truth; you cannot return growth to something that already has it. Our economy is growing, so it is impossible to return growth to it.


Just because the Liberal and National parties cannot accept the facts it should not give licence to others outside this place who do know better but then ignore their responsibilities to base their assertions on reality. I think that is all that anyone can ask in this place—that the facts are put out there and that people can judge those. But when other assertions are made that have no factual basis, they should not get the same sort of coverage nor, indeed, any coverage unless they can be proven.


Australia has been through the GFC and we still, of course, have the effects of the GFC. But like so many of us who have been elsewhere during that time and seen the effects on other countries, I am always amazed at how much our domestic economy is talked down by people here, almost blindly, with regard to other countries across the world. I have been to Europe and other countries in that time and seen the effects on employment rates, on investment rates and on company profitability. It is something that is pervasive; it goes right through an economy and it drags people's wills down. I think that in Australia we are an optimistic bunch, most of us. We do look at the bright side of things because we have very good reasons to in this country—and that is a great thing.


Since late 2007 our economy has grown more than any major advanced economy to become the 12th largest in the world, climbing up from 15th. But if you look at that in terms of population we are only the 51st-largest country in the world. That is not a bad example for anyone to follow. We have unemployment with a rate that starts with a 'five' and an official cash rate at 2.75. And, even more importantly, from the point of view of someone who has a mortgage, we have a variable mortgage rate now at the bank that I use—Members Equity—of 5.63 per cent. One only has to think back to a few years ago when it was almost impossible to get a variable rate loan under 10 per cent. In fact, when my wife and I first took out our loan our house it started at nine per cent, and within six months it had gone over the 10 per cent rate. So if we look at how much mortgage rates have gone down over that period of time, the savings to households are huge.


The wiser households, rather than just spending that money on something else, of course have used it to pay down their debt. That is a good thing; that is a great thing, because so many people do worry about how much money they owe. That is fair enough. Having low interest rates is one of the best things that a government can do for our economy to help out people in that situation.


The position of strength that our economy faces is better than just about everywhere else in the world, but it is not the same world that we see those opposite living in. It always strikes me that where we see opportunity and where we see a future, from the other side of this place we see this never-ending stream of negativity. One would have thought that Australia had gone down the drain. Of course, it is far from it, and I will finish on this positive note: I know that the Gillard Labor government has been a great force for our economy through the GFC, to take us to where we are now and to lead us on to even better and brighter things in the future.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2013-06-18,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (16:27):  I do appreciate the opportunity to speak on the MPI today. This MPI is about stability and this MPI is about a stronger economy. Having just listened to the member for Deakin, there was a fair bit of paranoia there. It was as if the media were against them; it was as if the opinion of the public had nothing to do with this. You would think that it was all just about our opinion over here as opposed to what so many people around the country are saying. If you look at the letters to the editor and if you look at not just the front pages but even the ABC—that network really does represent mainstream Australia, whatever that is: 41 per cent Green voters and 32 per cent ALP voters—



A government member interjecting—




Mr SIMPKINS:
  Even the ABC casts doubt on you guys! It is not just some right-wing media. Even the ABC has a go! The government just dismisses the instability. Have you really read what is going on? Do you really have confidence in the fact that people are behind you and your Prime Minister? The contrast on the other side is a team that is absolutely united behind someone who people can have trust in.



A government member:  Who is that then?




Mr SIMPKINS:
  Yes—you would know that. It is the guy that the government has been talking about. Not a sentence goes past without the government mentioning Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition. Not a sentence goes past! It is like word bingo—



Government members interjecting—




Mr SIMPKINS:
  You guys have to live with it! You keep thinking that there is a liability here, when he is our greatest strength. He is someone with integrity, and that is in contrast to the Prime Minister—



A government member:  Oh, it's Tony!




Mr SIMPKINS:
  That is so clear now. Even the ABC says that. Even the media says that. The Australian people say that as well. That is why there is so much instability over there, because you guys know it as well. You know what the liabilities are—and they are all sitting over there.


When we talk about what is going on around here, what the Australian people look to this place for, and look to any government for, is to make their lives better. That is why we are here. We are not here because we suddenly want to sit on that side. We are not here because we want the chequebook. We are here because we believe that this country can be a better place and that our role, everything we do, is about making the lives of people on the streets of our country better. That is what it is all about. It is not about who sits on that side. It is about the lives of the people of this country. That is why we are meant to be here and that is what we should be concentrating on.


I go out on the streets and I doorknock a lot. People come up to me in the shopping centres of my electorate, and even in some other places as well, and they talk about the things that are most important to them. They talk about three things constantly when I am out in my electorate. The first points are about trust and failures, which they talk about with regard to this government. There is the carbon tax: five days before the election the Prime Minister said 'no carbon tax under a government I lead' and after the election there is a carbon tax. Of course the deal had to be done with the Greens, so that was the very clear betrayal of the people by the Prime Minister.


On failures, there is the mining tax: the tax that has been negative for investment and cannot even recoup the money that the government now spends against that tax. There was a ban on cattle—that overreaction. What happened with that? It cast all sorts of problems on the north of Australia. It put Indigenous people out of work, caused businesses to fail, destroyed or damaged the livelihoods of so many people in the north and damaged our reputation with Indonesia. It was: 'Oh, yes, I've got a good idea'—because of some social media program, some ABC report—'let's suddenly just tell Indonesia we're not sending them any more food, just cut off the food.' No wonder they took that pretty hard. The surplus is another failure of this government. So many promises, so little delivery—pretty typical, sadly. And there is the NBN: a lot of problems these days, massive cost blow-outs, way behind schedule and now the asbestos fiasco as well. It just goes on and on.


Today the minister of mendaciousness, the man who uses the thesaurus to cast the word 'lies' across the chamber, had the gall to lecture us on Holden when this government presided over the departure of Ford from this country—$34 million and Ford ceased production on the day before the government's new emission standards started. That is not exactly a record they should be proud of.


The next point that people are raising is about the budget. Throughout my time here, since I was first elected at the end of 2007, on no occasion have the budget figures of surplus or deficit or even the predictions of the government figures ever matched up. They have always been worse than the government have predicted. There have also been the massive borrowings that now see gross debt closing in on $300 million, and apparently it will exceed that before the end of the year. And another betrayal, which I missed mentioning before, was on the private health insurance rebate: the government said they would not touch it but they have.


I am now running out of time, but the next point—which is a Western Australian thing, though I guess it is raised more and more across this country—is the government's failure on boats. This is the failure that former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd presided over. He assured us in this place that the changes he would make would not see the boats commence again. How wrong that was. We are now up to more than 700 boats and more than 44,000 illegal arrivals—all, of course, at the cost of those legitimate refugees who are out there in refugee camps around the world and do not have money to bypass the system. I ask: how compassionate is that?


This government is constantly on the lips of people who come up to speak to me about trust and failures, about Labor's budget failures and their mismanagement of the boats, the borders and immigration. Alternatively, what is required? What is required is the return of hope, reward and opportunity in this country, with a leader that can be trusted, backed up by an experienced team. As was said earlier, on the opposition front bench there are 16 former ministers and a team of people who have great experience from across business, from trades, from science, from so many different areas. That is what is available to the Australian people. So there is an alternative option here: a proven track record from a successful government, a government that knew how to control the borders, how to balance a budget, how to keep this country in good shape. Australians may choose to take up that opportunity, and that opportunity is coming in some 88 days.


There is a contrast. There is a leader with integrity, a front bench with experience and a back bench with a great range of skills across so many different areas. Alternatively, what have you got? The latest government play book will be about blue ties, raising state issues like abortion as if that is suddenly some sort of banner the Prime Minister can hang her hat on, and 457 visa attacks. That really does go to it, doesn't it? The Prime Minister would not want to talk about visas when she herself has a 457 visa holder in her office, but 457 visas is something the government wants to pursue. So there is a great contrast between integrity, trust and experience on this side and a proven mob of failures, of people without trust and with failures on budgets, immigration and boats.

Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (16:38):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Sugar Research and Development Services Bill 2013 and the Sugar Research and Development Services (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 were introduced into the House of Representatives on 5 June 2013. These bills provide the mechanism to implement key elements of reforms to sugar research and development (R&D) arrangements requested by the sugar industry.


Under the reforms, the Sugar Research and Development Corporation (SRDC) and BSES Limited will be wound up and their assets and research and development functions, along with the research coordination activities of Sugar Research Limited, transferred to Sugar Research Australia Limited (SRA). SRA is an industry owned company recently established by the sugar industry.


The Sugar Research and Development Services Bill 2013 provides the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry with the power to enter into a funding contract with an eligible company, currently proposed to be Sugar Research Australia Ltd to enable it to receive and invest levies collected by the Commonwealth for research and development. It will also allow it to receive the Commonwealth's matching funding for eligible research and development expenditure up to a determined funding cap. 


Once the funding contract is in place and the minister is satisfied that SRA will comply with its contractual and statutory obligations, the minister can declare the company to be the industry services body.


The industry services body will be funded by a statutory levy of 70c per tonne of sugar cane that is processed, or sold for processing, to be paid equally by growing and milling businesses—35c per tonne each. 


Currently, the Sugar Research and Development Services (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 includes provisions that relate to imposition and collection of the sugar cane levy. It also covers matters arising from the transition to a new industry services body. 


Section 55 of the Constitution states that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.


Consequently, this bill together with the government's amendments to the Sugar Research and Development Services (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013, are required to ensure that the sugar reform legislation does not contravene section 55 of the Constitution.


The government has prepared amendments to the Sugar Research and Development Services (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 to separate those provisions relating to imposition of the levy from those relating to collection and transitional matters by removing the imposition provisions. The imposition provisions are now included in this bill. 


This will ensure the provisions relating to collection and transitional matters will have full effect. The policy and provisions remain unchanged. Thank you.


Debate adjourned.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-06-18,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (18:18):  The purpose of this bill is to provide a framework of standard regulatory powers exercised by Commonwealth agencies. These are the powers of agencies to enter and search premises, require the production of documents and compel attendance for examination under oath. Familiar examples include the powers in part 3 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and section 155 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, although many regulatory, security and law enforcement agencies have similar powers of entry, search and investigation.


The matters to be subject to the framework are monitoring, investigation, civil penalties, infringement notices, enforceable undertakings and injunctions. The framework has no immediate effect. Rather, it is intended that any new or amended legislation affecting the coercive powers of agencies will be expressed by reference to this bill. Should the framework be inappropriate for a particular agency—for example, security agencies—there is no requirement to adopt it.


The coalition has reservations about the extent and use of coercive powers by Commonwealth agencies and particularly about their increasingly arbitrary use and the impositions that they place on business. This bill does nothing to alleviate those concerns. Important matters such as the right to legal representation under coercive questioning have not been addressed. The framework template in relation to investigation, enforceable undertakings and injunctions appears to have been largely lifted from the Competition and Consumer Act, the relevant provisions of which have been unchanged for 15 years and are unlikely to be controversial.


Other components of the framework are also of familiar construction and relate to entry and seizure under warrant, infringement notices and concurrent liability for civil penalties and criminal prosecution. However, there is some concern that the existence of this framework legislation may facilitate the proliferation of the use of coercive powers by ever more Commonwealth agencies and that the framework does nothing to constrain the use of these powers by agencies that already have them.


The government has introduced amendments today to this bill and the coalition is supportive of them. Therefore, we do not oppose the passage of this bill through the House, although, as ever, we reserve our right to have another look at it in the Senate should the need arise. This is one of the many bills that pass through this House that is not particularly controversial. Normally, we would deal with these sorts of issues within the Federation Chamber, but the fact that the government have moved their own amendments to it means that it did need to come back before the House. It is very difficult for me to use up much more of the 30 minutes that I am allocated as the first opposition speaker and the only contributor in this debate. Clearly, it is one of the mechanical things that governments need to do. In light of that, the bill is not opposed by the coalition.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2013-06-18,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Attorney-General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (18:22):  I thank the member for Stirling for his contribution to this debate. In 2012, this parliament had 188 bills, totalling 8,203 pages, introduced to this chamber. If it were not for bills such as this, a bill which cuts legal red tape, the number of pages that we would have to consider would be significantly larger. A primary function of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Bill 2012 is to provide a statutory framework that will reduce the size of legislation by standardising common regulatory powers provisions across Commonwealth legislation.


The 2003 report of the Australian Law Reform Commission Principled regulation: federal, civil and administrative penalties in Australia, ALRC 95, recommended that a bill of general application should be enacted to govern non-criminal contraventions of federal law and led to the provisions in this bill. Over the years, regulatory powers provisions have been amended or new provisions added without particular regard to the overall clarity of this legislation. Many of the provisions also retained the old drafting style of the early to mid 1900s and are no longer appropriate to the work of the regulatory agency.


This bill addresses these issues by providing a consistent and central framework of regulatory powers so that regulatory laws affecting agency performance are both consistent and flexible. This will mean that the law is sufficiently certain and predictable but still flexible enough to take into account differences in the functions of regulatory agencies. This bill represents an important step for the government in improving Australia's law and justice system. It is a key achievement of the Attorney-General's Department clearer laws project. By improving the accessibility and consistency of the Commonwealth statute book, the law can be better understood, complied with and administered.


The standardisation of Commonwealth regulatory powers will help to reduce the complexity and inconsistency of legislation that has developed since Federation. Complex and inconsistent legislation makes it difficult, expensive and time-consuming for people to understand their legal rights and obligations. This creates burdens for business and restricts access to justice. Lack of knowledge about the law often means that individuals and families do not get a fair go under the law. This bill is therefore an indication of the government's ongoing commitment to take measures to improve the clarity and accessibility of laws. I thank the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for the significant time and effort that went into preparing this bill. I commend that office for the quality of the bill and its commitment to maintaining the accuracy and clarity of the Commonwealth statute book. I also thank the members of Parliamentary committees: the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for their consideration of the bill. I commend this bill to the House.

In response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report into the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Bill 2012, the government has made a number of amendments. The report was tabled on 18 March 2013 and recommends that the bill be passed, subject to four substantive recommendations. The government has accepted, or accepted in principle, all of the recommendations. First, the government has accepted the committee's recommendation to remove the power to trigger the provisions of the bill by regulation. This will enhance parliamentary scrutiny. Second, the government has accepted in principle a recommendation for all new bills to explicitly articulate and explain that the standard provisions will be triggered in the explanatory memorandum. Third, the government has accepted in principle a recommendation for new bills to clearly set out the agency's current regulatory powers, a comparison with the powers in the bill that will be triggered, and, where there may be any expansion of the agency's powers, a detailed explanation of the reasons for the expansion of powers. Fourth, the government will review legislation currently before, and recently passed by, the parliament that deals with regulatory powers to assess whether it would allow regulations to be made that would provide regulatory powers to an agency and consider amendment where appropriate. I commend these amendments to the parliament and thank the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for this work on the Clearer Laws project and this legislation.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (18:18):  The purpose of this bill is to provide a framework of standard regulatory powers exercised by Commonwealth agencies. These are the powers of agencies to enter and search premises, require the production of documents and compel attendance for examination under oath. Familiar examples include the powers in part 3 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and section 155 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, although many regulatory, security and law enforcement agencies have similar powers of entry, search and investigation.


The matters to be subject to the framework are monitoring, investigation, civil penalties, infringement notices, enforceable undertakings and injunctions. The framework has no immediate effect. Rather, it is intended that any new or amended legislation affecting the coercive powers of agencies will be expressed by reference to this bill. Should the framework be inappropriate for a particular agency—for example, security agencies—there is no requirement to adopt it.


The coalition has reservations about the extent and use of coercive powers by Commonwealth agencies and particularly about their increasingly arbitrary use and the impositions that they place on business. This bill does nothing to alleviate those concerns. Important matters such as the right to legal representation under coercive questioning have not been addressed. The framework template in relation to investigation, enforceable undertakings and injunctions appears to have been largely lifted from the Competition and Consumer Act, the relevant provisions of which have been unchanged for 15 years and are unlikely to be controversial.


Other components of the framework are also of familiar construction and relate to entry and seizure under warrant, infringement notices and concurrent liability for civil penalties and criminal prosecution. However, there is some concern that the existence of this framework legislation may facilitate the proliferation of the use of coercive powers by ever more Commonwealth agencies and that the framework does nothing to constrain the use of these powers by agencies that already have them.


The government has introduced amendments today to this bill and the coalition is supportive of them. Therefore, we do not oppose the passage of this bill through the House, although, as ever, we reserve our right to have another look at it in the Senate should the need arise. This is one of the many bills that pass through this House that is not particularly controversial. Normally, we would deal with these sorts of issues within the Federation Chamber, but the fact that the government have moved their own amendments to it means that it did need to come back before the House. It is very difficult for me to use up much more of the 30 minutes that I am allocated as the first opposition speaker and the only contributor in this debate. Clearly, it is one of the mechanical things that governments need to do. In light of that, the bill is not opposed by the coalition.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Attorney-General, Minister for Emergency Management, Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (18:22):  I thank the member for Stirling for his contribution to this debate. In 2012, this parliament had 188 bills, totalling 8,203 pages, introduced to this chamber. If it were not for bills such as this, a bill which cuts legal red tape, the number of pages that we would have to consider would be significantly larger. A primary function of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Bill 2012 is to provide a statutory framework that will reduce the size of legislation by standardising common regulatory powers provisions across Commonwealth legislation.


The 2003 report of the Australian Law Reform Commission Principled regulation: federal, civil and administrative penalties in Australia, ALRC 95, recommended that a bill of general application should be enacted to govern non-criminal contraventions of federal law and led to the provisions in this bill. Over the years, regulatory powers provisions have been amended or new provisions added without particular regard to the overall clarity of this legislation. Many of the provisions also retained the old drafting style of the early to mid 1900s and are no longer appropriate to the work of the regulatory agency.


This bill addresses these issues by providing a consistent and central framework of regulatory powers so that regulatory laws affecting agency performance are both consistent and flexible. This will mean that the law is sufficiently certain and predictable but still flexible enough to take into account differences in the functions of regulatory agencies. This bill represents an important step for the government in improving Australia's law and justice system. It is a key achievement of the Attorney-General's Department clearer laws project. By improving the accessibility and consistency of the Commonwealth statute book, the law can be better understood, complied with and administered.


The standardisation of Commonwealth regulatory powers will help to reduce the complexity and inconsistency of legislation that has developed since Federation. Complex and inconsistent legislation makes it difficult, expensive and time-consuming for people to understand their legal rights and obligations. This creates burdens for business and restricts access to justice. Lack of knowledge about the law often means that individuals and families do not get a fair go under the law. This bill is therefore an indication of the government's ongoing commitment to take measures to improve the clarity and accessibility of laws. I thank the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for the significant time and effort that went into preparing this bill. I commend that office for the quality of the bill and its commitment to maintaining the accuracy and clarity of the Commonwealth statute book. I also thank the members of Parliamentary committees: the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for their consideration of the bill. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (21:30):  The exciting news is that the Socceroos are off to Brazil. They had a 1-0 win tonight against Iraq, and, rightly, the team will be recognised as national heroes. Our nation will get behind that team and support them. They will take on the world with our best wishes and our support.


What will not be celebrated tonight, but should be celebrated every day, are our national heroes: the small business men and women of this country. They apply themselves. They take risks. They create rewards and opportunities for themselves, their communities and those who depend upon them for their livelihoods, but they will not get the accolades that will be showered on the Socceroos. In fact, the opposite so often applies. Many small businesses that are competing for markets here against overseas competitors need to be world-class every day. The small business manufacturers need to be world-class every day. They have a World Cup contest not just in Brazil but around the globe every day to compete for markets and to try to run profitable enterprises in this country, which amongst them employ almost half the private sector workforce in this nation and provide about one quarter of the gross domestic product. They deserve our support and encouragement.


As I have travelled across this country for four years now, advocating strongly and consistently for better policy to support those courageous men and women, I think the bell is starting to toll for this Labor government that has failed to take any interest in their wellbeing, success, viability and contribution to our national economy and our communities. You need not look too far. The clarion call from Peter Anderson of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in his National Press Club address last week should have been ringing in the ears of Labor members. Those on the coalition side understand the grief and pain and the sense of a lack of support and a lack of opportunity that have been the product of this Labor government.


On this side of the House, we have been campaigning to put the 'business' back into 'small business' for years, up against a government that seems only to be interested in the businesses at the big end of town or in union business. That is all we have seen—not creating an environment of support and not creating a sense of hope, reward and opportunity that are so desperately needed.


Mr Anderson characterised this climate, he said:


I'm talking about the actions of government and how your interests usually end up on the losing side when hard choices are made.


Instead of enterprise being rewarded, it's taxed.


Instead of allowing success to grow, it's redistributed.


Instead of thanks for employing, you're demonised as an exploiter and now a bully.


Instead of giving you time to succeed, you're loaded night after night with government red tape and compliance burdens.


This is the message that I have been sharing and hearing amongst the small business community. This is the message that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a number of small business organisations have encapsulated in their 'Small Business: Too Big to Ignore' campaign—a sentiment that we on this side have been advocating for years.


But what do we see from this government? We understand that they had no new ideas at the 2010 election and simply went to that election without any new policies and without any new contribution to support the enterprise of small business men and women and family enterprises in this country. Will we see the same again? In the intervening period, the only policy initiatives that the government have come forward with have been diluted and poorly executed carbon copies of coalition policies. They cannot think of any of their own; they have had to pinch the coalition's small business policy agenda.


As Mr Anderson and the small business community has made clear, and as is outlined in so many of the examples calling for policy action, the coalition already have policy commitments in so many of these crucial areas. We want to see a turnaround in the halving of small business formation that has occurred under Labor. We want to have it recognised that 243,000 fewer Australians are employed by small businesses in this country than when Labor was elected. We want it understood that there are now 3,000 fewer employing small businesses now than when Labor was elected. This needs to turn around. If you think about what the over-the-horizon economy looks like for this nation—when this government that we have under Labor continues to wallow in the good fortune of the mining boom and people wonder about the diverse, resilient economy we really need for the future—small business needs to be front and centre in that vision and ambition.


That will be the case if the coalition can form government after the next election. I have been there for four years. I have seen six ministers now, very few of them with any idea at all. But consistent amongst them is one shared point: they do not have a feel for, a commitment to or a belief in small business. The coalition do, and I hope we have the opportunity— (Time expired)

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-06-18,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (12:16):  I want to draw honourable members' attention to the dissenting report by the coalition members and senators which sets out some very disturbing facts about the disastrous state of this project. The debate over the NBN, of course, has been contentious, but the rollout has been proceeding for long enough now for there to be some objective facts on the ground and, indeed, in the ground.


The first point that the coalition have made is that the fibre rollout is well behind schedule. The original NBN Co. corporate plan published at the end of 2010 forecast that fibre would be available and connected to 950,000 brownfield and 319,000 greenfield premises by June 2013. As at the end of May the fibre network had passed 71,000 brownfield and 32,000 greenfield premises. That is a catastrophic shortfall. It is not just a question of falling short of the 2010 forecasts. By brownfield, of course, honourable members understand I am talking about the already built-up areas as opposed to new developments. I mentioned that the first forecast was 950,000 to be passed by end June 2013. In August last year their new corporate plan slashed that down to 286,000, then in March 2013, just a few months ago, that target was again reduced to between 155,000 and 175,000, and as of mid-May the fibre network had passed only 71,000 brownfield premises. This is one shortfall after another.


There have been cascading forecasts, the target is dropping down, and it says something about the management of this business and their capacity to forecast. They set a new target in August last year, they then had to dramatically reduce it in March this year, and now it appears they are going to fall short of a target that was set 90 days prior to the target date. There are no forecasts in the corporate plan that one can take seriously.


This slowness of the rollout is a very significant issue. Honourable members will understand that one of the arguments in favour of the National Broadband Network has always been that having everyone in Australia connected to very fast broadband will deliver economy-wide benefits, big spillover effects, externalities. We do not doubt that those benefits are there to have ubiquitous connection to very fast broadband. The big question is: what is the incremental benefit, if any, between having people connected to very fast broadband at the speeds it can be achieved under the approach we favour—in most built-up areas, fibre-to-the-node—and having fibre-to-the-premises? The one thing that is clear—and there is no argument in any of the literature or in experience—is that having everyone connected to very fast broadband, even at speeds much slower than the peak speeds available on fibre, is a real benefit. The problem that we face, therefore, with the NBN's slow rollout is that we are not getting the benefits of ubiquitous connectivity any time soon, and perhaps we might not be getting them for 20 years or so. At the current rate of progress the completion of this network will take many decades.


In our re-examination of the NBN's financial model, in our alternative policy, we assumed that it would take another four years to complete. That is a very optimistic assumption. At the moment the NBN is passing less than a quarter of the number of premises it should be passing, even according to its revised corporate plan. For a project that is passing around 350 premises a day, as it is at the moment, to seriously imagine that in 18 months or so it is going to be passing well over 6,000 a day is just incredible.


The reality is that this project is going to be long delayed. That means that the benefits of universal or ubiquitous connectivity will also be long delayed. It is cold comfort to say to somebody—and there are at least two million premises in Australia in this category that have, effectively, no broadband at all since they do not have broadband at a speed that would enable them to watch a YouTube video—'Don't worry, you are going to get the Rolls Royce option, the fibre-to-the-premises option, in 10 years or 20 years time.' That may well be beyond the lifetimes of some of the occupants of these premises, and it is certainly beyond the time their children will be at school.


The issue really boils down to a fundamental one of management. There is an argument about technology, but even if you accept Labor's argument about technology the fact is that the project is just not getting there. One of the problems that we are seeing is that the civil contractors who have been employed—Silcar, Transfield, Syntheo and Visionstream—have not been delivering the premises that they have been contracted to deliver. It is common knowledge in the industry that they are all losing a huge amount of money. The word on the street, as it were, is that these contractors will need to have contract prices increased by something in the order of 30 per cent of the current contracted rates if they are able to make any money or any margin at all.


That being the case, what does that tell us about the reliability of the NBN Co.'s cost forecasts? It has a corporate plan that its management tells us is based on the current contracted costs, yet we know that the contractors are going backwards financially. This has had some pretty dramatic results: the Silcar CEO Peter Lamell left the company in May; the Service Stream managing director, Graeme Sumner, left the company in April; and the Syntheo joint venture appears to be about to be dissolved.


The failure to have satisfactory commercial relationships with the civil contractors is a profound failure of the NBN Co., because it does not have a huge civil workforce of its own and is not proposing to have a huge workforce of its own, although it has sought to take over the management of the construction in the Northern Territory. But it needs to have a satisfactory relationship with its civil contractors and it needs to have contracts with them that enable them to pay their subbies a fair price and make a margin for themselves. If they cannot do that, it simply will not continue. We have set them out in some detail in this dissenting report.


I spoke earlier about the asbestos issue. I will not go over all of that ground again. But the coalition are very concerned that the Commonwealth will be liable for asbestos risk, notwithstanding that it is in Telstra pits that are being remediated by contractors working for Telstra. As you know, the Work Health and Safety Act imposes on NBN Co. a duty to workers, including workers employed by—for example—Telstra or contractors to Telstra if their work is influenced or directed by NBN Co. It is very arguable, it seems to us, that NBN Co. is in that position of influence and therefore could have liability for this asbestos risk.


We are particularly concerned that the issue of asbestos has been well-known for a long time and this does not reflect well on either Telstra or NBN Co. There has clearly been a failure of supervision on the part of both companies. I simply note and draw the attention of honourable members to the comments that we have made there.


I want to now turn to the question of the fixed wireless rollout, which has not had enough public debate or discussion because the fibre-to-the-premise rollout is so much bigger. Fixed wireless is the technology solution for about four per cent of the country. Under the plan, 93 per cent gets fibre-to-the-premise, four per cent gets fixed wireless and three per cent gets satellite. I might say that under the approach that we would sake many of those premises or households in the fixed wireless footprint at present will get wire line, fixed line, very fast broadband. They are in towns that have less than 1,000 premises, which will not get fibre-to-the-premise under Labor's approach but which will be eminently suitable for a vectored VDSL fibre-to-the-node solution of the kind that we are proposing. There are many smaller communities in rural and regional Australia that will get much faster and much more convenient broadband services under our approach than they will under Labor's approach.


Looking at the way the NBN Co. is tracking at the moment, it has been reported that even on their best case scenario their fixed wireless network will cover only 31,291 premises by the end of June, which is only 45 per cent of the 70,000 target. The explanations for this shortfall given by the NBN Co. management frankly beggar belief. Their explanation is—and this has been given by the minister as well—that there has been an unanticipated level of tall trees in rural and regional Australia. I will quote the evidence from the NBN chief technology officer, Gary McLaren, in estimates of 30 May in which he talked about these trees. He said: 


We have always expected there will be some areas, mainly due to vegetation—trees and the like—that will cause those installations to not be able to pass through that qualification step …We are seeing those being slightly higher than we would have originally expected.


Being ambushed—bushwhacked—by the presence of tall trees in regional Australia is a fairly pathetic excuse. But it does underline the poor planning and the poor management of this project.


Finally, I want to touch on the very, very troubling issues about management. We have at the moment a new chairman, Siobhan McKenna. She has been on the NBN board from the outset but she became chairman on 21 March, replacing Harrison Young. She has said publicly that she is taking a much tougher approach to management. She has said that she does not want Senator Conroy, the minister, being able to communicate directly with NBN Co. Chief Executive Mike Quigley, although Senator Conroy seems to have said that he will not play along with that.


More troublingly, it is being widely reported—and has not been anywhere denied—that Siobhan McKenna has, on behalf of the board, sought the dismissal of the Chief Executive, Mr Quigley, and that she has no confidence in him. If this were a publicly listed company, belonging to a bunch of superannuation funds and private investors, and there was published in the newspaper a report saying that the chairman had no confidence in the chief executive and wanted the chief executive sacked, that matter would have to be resolved within hours. And, yet, we have at the moment with this company, the biggest infrastructure project in our history, a situation where the management is tearing itself to pieces, the board is opposed to the chief executive—it sounds like the Labor Party caucus, frankly—and there is no denial, clarification or confirmation. When Mr Quigley was sought to be questioned about this in estimates, as we have set out in this dissenting report, Senator Conroy prevented him from answering any questions. This project, sadly, is in utter chaos. This dissenting report, which I commend to honourable members, sets out in some detail the sorry tale of mismanagement that the NBN project is today.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-06-18,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (12:31):  It is a great pleasure of mine to be able to speak to this report—the fifth and final report of the joint committee. It is a project that has had a great degree of oversight in the rollout and in the management of the project itself. In fact, I have from time to time been concerned that we have overlaid too much oversight. I am certainly one for, obviously, the parliamentary ability to probe and test the way in which government business enterprises like this operate. But, when you consider all of the ways in which this project has people looking at it, you would not have a similar level of investigation imposed on an organisation external to government.


Having said that, NBN Co. has always sought—from my impression, and I am sure it would be the impression of others, particularly on the government side—to cooperate with questions and to be available to answer inquiries from members of parliament. Be it in estimates, the joint committee or the public hearings, they have tried to do the right thing, to talk about a project that is going to transform this nation. There is no doubt that this will economically transform the way that we operate, and it will put us at an advantage compared to other countries that have not been able to do this to the same breadth and the same level of detail that has been undertaken in this project.


It is an investment of just over $30 billion in a technology that is already, through the internet—if you take on board the Deloitte study—contributing about $50 billion in economic value to this country currently, and will contribute $70 billion into the future. It has already been indicated that that investment will have a return of seven per cent, but, to be honest, I see that the actual return itself will come when you look at the way that it will change the manner in which the economy operates, the way in which firms operate, the way in which communities connect and interrelate, the way that education is delivered in this country, and the way that health care is delivered in this country. On top of these things, the fact that there are applications and there are ways in which technology that is not currently known will do the same thing, is something to note.


I had the opportunity recently to speak to a venture tech firm, BlueChilli, that operate out of Sydney. They bring together capital and people who want to transform the way in which things are done at the moment through their own ideas, their own innovative energy, and completely alter the way in which people operate and conduct their business. These types of firms, from what I have seen—and this firm is based in the Sydney CBD—are doing remarkable things in terms of changing the way the business operates. And they certainly always encourage the innovators within their organisations to continue to think differently about what can be done, what we do now and how we can do it differently, and how we can add value to the economy. These are the types of firms that get unleashed when they have access to a technology that has been using, as a platform, what we are doing through the National Broadband Network.


Through this process we have tackled a massive capacity constraint. It is well known that the former government was told by bodies such as the Reserve Bank that capacity constraints would limit the ability of the economy to grow and that failing to do so would hurt the economy into the longer term. Those opposite tried, as has been reflected upon here, 19 times to address the fact that people could not get access to broadband. I represent people who had previously been stuck in a dial-up world—or a broadband wasteland, as I have described it—and faced very little chance that they would actually get access to modern telecommunications infrastructure. As a result of what we have been doing, we have been able, through a combination of the work being done by Telstra and the rollout being done by NBN Co., to free these people from being stuck with dial-up, which in this day and age is the technological equivalent of a dinosaur. We have freed suburbs such as Woodcroft and Doonside from that.


Last week my colleague the member for Greenway and I were proud to turn the NBN on in Blacktown with the minister for communications, Stephen Conroy. This has already seen 1,300 homes having access to the NBN at the outset. What has also been great is that RSPs like Telstra and Optus are out there now actively seeking customers and getting a tremendous response from customers who are wanting to sign up. In actual fact, if you look at the fifth report itself—and this is important—on page 19 it indicates that the revenue that NBN is receiving as a result of the RSPs going out and connecting customers and having this then flow back to NBN Co was $5.3 million and has risen by nearly $2 million since June of last year. So, in a short space of time it is already increasing the amount of money that it is generating as a result of customers coming onboard. And, as has been anecdotally indicated to me, once the customers get onboard with the NBN their usage changes. They use more and they want to be able to—and are certainly happy to—change their plans, because they are getting value for money per gigabyte that they are using as a household. And households like small businesses—for example, accounting firms that operate from home and design firms that operate from home—are now able to access a network. The more these home based businesses operate and the more people can change the way in which they work through telework, the more we will see other benefits. For example, in Western Sydney we are plagued very much by this issue of congestion in terms of traffic and the like. Being able to have economic development in local areas rather than having people feel that they have to travel long distances to conduct work will have huge economic benefit.


I mentioned earlier that there are other countries that have tried to do what we are doing. If you look at the US in particular, Verizon, through its fibre optic service, had gone to five states but has slowed down in its delivery because it does not have a dedicated investment program, unlike what is happening here. And Google is now rolling out fibre in Kansas and Utah and is expecting that these networks will operate profitably. Others are catching up and recognise that the use of this fibre instead of copper—fibre that delivers light at 300,000 kilometres per second and delivers a signal that has much more capacity and benefit and ability than anything that can be delivered on fibre—is a serious way in which to construct a future network.


That is why, when the opposition were in government, they had committees looking at this, and the member for Sturt even indicated in reports that he authored that, hands down, fibre is the best form of technology to deliver a modern broadband network. Certainly that has been evident, and there is very little to suggest otherwise. There is a suggestion that there will be a better form of technology—for example, a reliance on vectoring. Yes, vectoring does have its benefits, but most people will tell you that it is nowhere near as good as having fibre to the premises. Those opposite have had to come up with a policy for the sake of a policy but, having spent the best part of this parliamentary term determined to kill off this project, they have been unable to, due to two things. Firstly, they have an idea that nothing is wrong with the current broadband network in this country—and that does not stack up. Secondly, they have realised that businesses and the community expect a modern, robust form of infrastructure that will ensure that the country can progress in the years ahead and not stumble along in the way that they had been overseeing it when they were in office.


The opposition are continually focussed on the claim—and we continue to get this; we heard it from the member for Wentworth, and others, not necessarily those currently in the chamber, will probably bleat on today in reference to it—that NBN Co has failed to meet its forecast. In fact, the member for Wentworth today used the term 'catastrophic failure'. 



An honourable member interjecting— 




Mr HUSIC:
  He is using a word that denotes something extremely harmful either in a physical or financial sense. Financial ruin would occur as a result of the failure, in their words, to meet the targets. It is an absurd claim. They well know that the 2011-13 corporate plan was produced well before any definitive agreements had been signed up, before one of the biggest corporate agreements was signed with Telstra and before the Optus deal was even finalised, to ensure the handover of their network and their agreement in terms of the way in which NBN Co rolls out the network. They know that no-one in this country could have predicted that the ACCC would have brought down a points-of-interconnect decision that would see the points of interconnection increase by a multitude, from 14 to 121. Those opposite had never predicted it. It suits their political argument to say that it does not meet the target, while neglecting to mention the things that have happened in between. Any company will have to, from time to time, confront roadblocks and work out how they structure their corporate plans accordingly. Those opposite are unable to have the decency to tell the Australian public why these figures had changed.


There is no doubt that this project, as it picks up speed, will roll out further and further, and will not necessarily be held up by the type of scare campaigns that have been put by those opposite. We had the member for Wentworth, for example, picking up on this issue of asbestos. No-one doubts for one moment that the issue is one that is critical and needs to be managed properly. Asbestos has sat in the Telstra system for decades, and then the member for Wentworth says in an offhand remark that this has been known for some time by NBN and Telstra. Yes, it has been known by Telstra. I would be interested to go back to the initial prospectus that was put out as it was being privatised to see whether or not it was denoted as a risk. What did those opposite do, when they were in government for 13 years, about the issue of asbestos? In any due diligence process you would know that it is an issue and you would have to deal with it. I would be interested to know now what the opposition, in government, did to mitigate risk.


The fact of the matter is that there are very smart people in Telstra, who, while they will not be able to pinpoint right now where these things are on a network map, will be able to determine this, based on likely roll-out. They will be able to deal with it where the roll-outs occur, at any point in time, and they do. For example, in Kiama, where Silcar was used on the project, they had trained up all their staff and ensured that all the equipment was present and did not have one problem with the issue of asbestos. Asbestos is being used as a Trojan Horse by those opposite. I am not having them now confect a concern about asbestos when I, like many other people, heard the dismissive words expressed by the Leader of the Opposition to Bernie Banton. It was one of the most disgraceful episodes I have witnessed and it is beneath the Leader of the Opposition. If he has found a concern about asbestos I welcome it, but he should remember that his previous words haunt him in this regard.


The other thing I want to mention is workforce planning. There has been a great deal of reference made in the report to workforce planning and subcontractor planning. It has been one issue that I have been particularly interested in from the get-go. Before my life here as a member of parliament, it was something that I represented as the national president of a union that covers workers in this area. We have enormous talent that exists out there that we need to employ and deploy on this project. One of the concerns that I have is that Telstra should be used more and more in the rollout of this project, because they do have people within Telstra, in the lines and in the field workforce, who can be used. 


One of the regrets I have is that NBN Co. has been stuck in a model that has been used and employed for many years in the sector, which is a contract-subcontract model. I doubt very much those opposite will move away from it. My issue with it is that NBN Co. does not have an internal workforce, and that internal workforce could easily be supplied by Telstra. You will not necessarily need an asset manager into the future with fibre. Fibre obviously costs a lot to deploy but costs very little to maintain into the future. There are people within Telstra and we should be forming a relationship with Telstra so they can be used more and more on the rollout of this project. This will ensure that the skills that are there within the sector can be employed to their best possible ability. It will also ensure that Telstra can aid NBN Co. in what is critical for them: network mapping, being able to determine the structure of the network and having robust systems into the future. I welcome this committee and all the work that it has done. It has done a great job for this parliament. In particular I note the contribution of the chairperson. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2013-06-18,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (12:46):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this rather concerning report. I noted that the member for Chifley said that the project confronted a few roadblocks, or a roadblock. I think the real concern here is that we are not confronting a roadblock, we are confronting a train wreck. We are confronting a train wreck because we have got a project that has not met a single target that has been set. That is of concern. They have had the opportunity to set the targets. They have not met one. By now we are supposed to be passing some 1.3 million houses. So how many houses or premises are we going to pass? We are not going to pass 1.3, we are not going to pass a million, we are not going to pass 500,000 houses. As we sit in wonder, the real question is: are we going to meet the revised, revised, revised target of 190,000 houses passed? Are we going to make it? I would suggest not. 


Let us look at connections. Around about now, 511,000 houses were to be connected, in just a couple weeks. How many are we going to connect? If we are lucky, 20,000 to 25,000. This is a project that needs to connect 6,000 houses a day to meet the targets that it set for itself. This is not a target set by the opposition. This is the target set by NBN Co.—6,000 houses a day. I think you would have to believe in Santa Claus and the Easter bunny to believe they are going to achieve that. 


If it were possible for things to become worse, well, they certainly have. NBN Co. is now further behind schedule that it was at the last report. The budget has blown out more than it was as at the last report. The rollout has slowed to a crawl. We have had the problems that have been mentioned by the member for Wentworth. We have the asbestos problem which that master of illusion, Mr Quigley, said was no real problem at all; 'no real problem at all', he said back in the April hearings. 'Don't you worry about that by golly, just a little bit of asbestos, not a problem at all.' Yet somehow he expects us to believe that, despite a range of sites being on hold, we are going to somehow meet the targets that he set for himself. History will show clearly that those targets will be missed. We have an interim satellite solution that is running out of capacity. We have NBN Co. staff rushing for the exits. We have an NBN Co. board that is trying to have the CEO removed from his post.


It is a project in crisis. It is a project that is heading for disaster. If a publicly listed company was in this position it would probably be in a trading halt—although I do not know that anyone would buy shares in NBN Co., given its past history, so a trading halt would probably be a mere technicality. A publicly listed company would be being required to make certain disclosures to the Australian stock exchange to get to the real situation with regard to the company. But, unlike a publicly listed company, NBN Co. is a black box. Every piece of information concerning this project must be prised out. We have this Orwellian regime of misinformation perpetrated by the CEO, Mr Quigley. He makes sure that absolutely no information that is useful is divulged to the parliamentary committee that has responsibility for oversight of this project.


We have tens of billions of taxpayer dollars at stake, and the Australian taxpayer is not being given clear and concise information as to the true status of this project. Every time the committee asked for information about the latest disaster we were told the information was commercial in confidence or that we somehow did not need to know this information. The only risk posed by releasing much of this information to the Joint Committee on the NBN is embarrassment to the government. And it is an embarrassment.


The chair of the committee, Mr Oakeshott, the member for Lyne, seems to be saying that everything is going okay. He said just yesterday that 'the NBN remains on track to deliver a rate of return to the taxpayer of over 7 per cent per annum'. Well, we will see. The member for Lyne is in fact complicit in the regime of deceit and dishonesty that this committee has had to endure. They are actually running a protection racket—




Mr Mitchell:
  Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member is making some very serious inferences at the member for Lyne. I think he has been here long enough to know his standing orders—I think he should withdraw those inferences.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Owens
):  There is no point of order. There are other mechanisms of the house if the member has a concern.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  I know the truth hurts, but I will move on with my contribution. Instead of talking about terms and allowing the light to shine in, the true status of this project remains a mystery. Let's look at the wireless rollout. What is the status of the wireless rollout? You guessed it, Deputy Speaker—behind schedule. We were supposed to have around 70,000 premises covered by the wireless network by 30 June. how much is it going to be? Is it going to be 70,000? Of course not. According to recent media reports, it is going to be 31,000 premises. The government will tell us it is right on target, right on track. We are not even halfway to the target that has been set by NBN Co. for itself—just another example. And they had the audacity to say that they underestimated the number of trees in regional Australia. It was a major technical hitch when they found there were big trees in regional Australia. It is a real concern.




Mr Mitchell:
  What was your last plan?




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  They underestimated the number of trees, Member for McEwen. They have entered into a whole range of agreements that have been problematic. When this project was conceived, the iPhone was released. Two years later the iPad was released. This project has not taken into account the huge shift in the amount of people using mobile networks.


One of the other concerns with this is that there has been a neglect of mobile services. There has been a total disregard for the situation with regard to mobile services in regional areas. In fact, Senator Conroy has said we are going to wait until the wireless network is rolled out in 2015 before we address the issue highlighted in the Regional Telecommunications Review—that of poor mobile services. I think the Australian people would be concerned as to whether the wireless rollout will be completed by 2015. We are not even up to half the scheduled rollout rate so far. I think you would have to, once again, believe in Santa Claus or the Easter bunny to believe that this government will bring it in by 2015.


Another interesting factor was in relation to the interim satellite service cap. It was revealed at the last round of the committee hearings that the interim satellite service cap of 48,000 customers would be reached by 2014, and the government has no intention of increasing the cap. So some people in remote Australia and in many areas of regional Australia will be left with no internet service for more than two years, until the long-term satellite solution is brought online. People who rely on the satellite internet will have no other option. The interim satellite solution is the only link for a range of customers.


The government said that it would be too expensive to increase the cap beyond 48,000. The minister said that it would cost $86 million to increase the cap by 7,000 customers from 48,000 to 55,000. I have to say that every person I have consulted in the satellite industry has said that those numbers are rubbish. It is widely accepted that there is sufficient capacity in the market to increase the cap to around 75,000 customers—an additional 27,000. The published cost for the interim satellite service is $300 million for 48,000 customers and, when you do the maths, that works out to be around $6,250 per customer. But, based on the minister's figures, to add 7,000 to the cap was going to cost an additional $12,285 a customer. How does that work? If you have been able to set up your overheads and all the costs of setting up the interim satellite solution at a total cost of $6,250 per customer, why does it cost you around double that to purchase additional capacity when it is available in the market? That is a mystery that remains unsolved.


If the cap is not increased the teams of installers currently working on the interim satellite solution will be disbanded and there will be a whole installation system and labour force that will need to be rebuilt from the ground up, which will mean it will take even longer for the NBN to roll out its long-term satellite solution. In reality the government has simply abandoned regional Australia by its failure to address this very important shortfall in the project with the need to continue the interim satellite solution past the cap. This is the government's track record, or NBN Co.'s track record, of being late with regard to everything.


This is a project that is of concern to taxpayers. It is a project that has not passed the test of accountability. It is a project that revolves around concealment and deceit rather than true transparency. I believe that, if the coalition were elected on 14 September, it will be the first opportunity to view the true status of this project and the true situation with regard to progress and costs, which have been concealed from the parliament to this point in time. So, I certainly raise very real concerns about the future of the project and I raise very real concerns about the accountability to this parliament.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2013-06-18,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:57):  I am very pleased to speak in support of the fifth report of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. We come into this place to talk about the biggest infrastructure project in Australia's history and to have those opposite come forward and rubbish it, I think, says everything about their debate on the NBN that has gone on in this 43rd Parliament. Much to the coalition's despair, and unfortunately for them, the NBN keeps getting more and more popular as a policy.


I am disappointed because, for the last speech that the member for Wentworth is going to make in the 43rd Parliament on the NBN, I really wanted him to give a blow-by-blow account of the 'fraudband' launch. How awkward was it? It was awks to the max! The Leader of the Opposition was moving into the shadows and saying, 'Come into the dark, Malcolm. Come to the dark side.' I thought he was going to start speaking like Darth Vader. It was absolutely embarrassing to watch, but amusing at the same time. I was hoping that the member for Wentworth was going to talk about that, but alas, no. Their comments are despite the fact that people like Vint Cerf, the father of the internet, has given his blessing to this project on many, many occasions. This is despite the fact that we had the CeBIT conference in Australia only a couple of weeks ago where, again, we were lauded as a government for our forward-thinking policy on this matter. As well, the ITU holds up Australia as an example of best practice in national broadband rollout.


One of the biggest complaints I still get from people is not that the NBN is happening but is, 'When am I going to get it?' People have waited for so long in backwaters of not only regional Australia but outer metropolitan cities as well. I was disappointed he has left the chamber, because the member for Cowper talked about the government abandoning regional Australia. He is the bloke who sold out on regional Australia. I will give you some facts and I will give you some evidence to support that in just a moment.


Just to go back a bit, firstly, I feel sorry for the member for Cowper having to come in here and push the member for Wentworth's lines on this matter. But let's not forget that when Telstra was fully privatised, when those opposite were in government, the Nats were absolutely sold down the river. They took all the elements that should have been about regional accessibility and affordability, moved them into a separate piece of legislation and told everyone that that would be okay. The member for Chifley mentioned it but I will talk a bit more about the sell-off process that not only led to issues with the Telstra pits that we see today but also made Australia, and confirmed Australia's position as, an absolute broadband backwater—behind countries like Estonia and many countries of Eastern Europe.


I will not have the member for Cowper coming in here and saying these things. He talked about mobile and fixed. I feel like I have been giving this same lecture, the same lessons, to some people opposite over and over again. The inability to understand the difference between mobile, wireless and fixed wireless is simply beyond me. It is a debate that was settled many, many years ago—that mobile and fixed are complementary, not substitutable, and that fixed wireless services require a backbone. In this case you look to the best backbone that you can build to maximise capacity, and that is a fibre backbone. It is no wonder that mobile operators are enthusiastically embracing the NBN for the opportunity to fibre up their base stations.


The member for Cowper talked about the lack of mobile access. In the early 2000s we had an attempt to introduce USO contestability in Australia. We had a pilot project for the Pacific Highway, running through the member for Cowper's own electorate, for which bidding was done, and which resulted in absolutely no measurable improvement. So the only thing that was done on this matter by those opposite when they were in government on this matter was an absolute, abject failure.


I will take up a few issues to do with regional Australia, which is one of the things I really want to talk about in relation to this particular report. There is the issue of a universal wholesale price under Labor's NBN versus there being no equivalent under the broadband plan of those opposite. I will quote from the Hansard of the public hearing on Friday 19 April. I specifically asked the question of Ms Teresa Corbin of ACCAN:


I presume you are also aware that the government has imposed a universal wholesale price for the NBN and, in light of your comments about affordability, how important is it not to discriminate against people who live in outer metropolitan areas and regional areas?


She answered:


This is very important to our members.


I went on to ask:


What feedback do you get already from consumers living in regional areas in particular about things like the digital divide?


She went on to explain how it is very important for people living in regional Australia to have the same opportunities for affordability and accessibility as those living in the city. Yet again, I am disappointed he did not stick around. I ask: what did the member for Cowper do to improve broadband in his electorate when he was part of a government? How many failed plans did we have from those opposite that produced no measurable improvements in broadband across Australia?


I would like to turn to something the member for Wentworth took some time mentioning—chapter 4 of the dissenting report, and specifically item 4.1. To be quite frank, I find it rather tawdry that those opposite want to come in here and start talking about—it is like a gossip chapter—the new chair of NBN Co. and the CEO of NBN Co., quoting various articles from News Limited, from The Australian and the Australian Financial Review. They have a recommendation in which they cannot even spell Ms McKenna's name properly, but I digress.


It is absolutely ridiculous for the member for Wentworth and those opposite to have spent so much time and energy on a chapter called 'Unstable governance and question over board's confidence in CEO.' Something that I learnt very early on—and I would have thought the member for Wentworth, as someone who is always coming in here talking about all the big deals that he has done with Rupert and friends, would have lectured me on this—is that the people who you are sitting opposite to and doing a deal with may one day very well be the people on your team. You do not want to go off making bizarre accusations and relying on hearsay and gossip. You want to rely on the facts. I find it absolutely ridiculous for the member for Wentworth to choose to spend so much time on this particular issue. He does himself great discredit. It is merely an attempt to again try and smear Mr Quigley. Whatever reasons he has for doing that, they are his own and I will leave him to it.


We again had those opposite come in here and start talking about the rollout targets. But the reality is that at the end of May NBN Co. was on track to beat its revised June rollout targets and to pass between 171,836 homes and 185,808 premises with fibre by the end of June—far exceeding its set target. It must be very disappointing for those opposite to have seen support for Labor's existing policy increase after those opposite released their policy. Prior to the release of 'fraudband', 73 per cent of people surveyed supported Labor's NBN. After 'fraudband' was released, that went up to 78 per cent. That must be striking a very raw nerve.


I have called out MPs before who say one thing in their electorates about how much they support increasing broadband opposite but who do something else when they come to Canberra. I am going to call out a few more. You will like this one, member for Moreton. This is a special one from the member for Moncrieff. On 5 June he sent a letter out to his electorate. I do not know what is the most disturbing thing about this. The opening line reads: 'Access to fast broadband is no longer a want; it is rapidly becoming a need for Gold Coast households and businesses.' It is not already a need? 'It is rapidly becoming a need'? Then there is a typo, but I digress. There are then some claims made. I quote: 'When Labor first announced the NBN in 2007, they said it would cost around $4.7 billion and be completed by 2013. Since then, Labor changed the forecast and said it would cost taxpayers $37 billion. Now we know it's actually going to cost taxpayers around $94 billion.' Where does this come from?


I specifically asked the NBN Co. about this when it appeared before the committee. And remember that these committee proceedings had the same rules as the parliament. I said:


Mr Quigley, I want to go back to your briefing at the start, just to be crystal clear. The NBN costs $37.4 billion. What veracity should then be given to assertions that the NBN cost could in fact be around $90 billion?


Mr Quigley said:


I can only repeat that we are confident of the $37.4 billion figure. 


Then I asked:


Do you know how that $90 billion figure was derived? 


Mr Quigley said:


No.


How on earth can these people get away with making continuous false claims? I will quote some comments from Delimiter about this particular letter:


… other elements of Ciobo's letter are demonstrably inaccurate, delivered without context, or could be considered highly contestable, in that they do not represent mainstream thinking in the telecommunications industry from the consensus of expert opinion.


There is a lot more that I could say about that one. But in the time available I will instead move on to the member for Calare.


The member for Calare claimed a couple of weeks ago that the coalition's national broadband policy would guarantee speeds of at least 25 gigabytes to all Australians by 2016, with Labor's policy to deliver a mere 100 kilobits. Now, 25 gigabytes is a pretty quick download speed. He also claimed that the coalition has guaranteed at least 25 gigs for everybody by 2016.


It gets better. We have the Leader of the Nationals on Insiders with Barrie Cassidy a couple of weeks ago. This is pretty special; it was quite embarrassing to watch; the guy had no idea. He was asked by Barrie Cassidy:


In your speech to the National Council meeting yesterday—


which I presume was the Nats' meeting—


you raised the NBN … you said under the Coalition every country household will have access to high speed broad band with a minimum speed 25 megabits per second, but how much will it cost householders to have access to that?


Mr Truss could not answer. He said:


Well it will be significantly cheaper than the NBN.


Mr Cassidy asked:


The NBN, under the existing arrangements, the access will be free?


Mr Truss answered:


… there will be still charges for … signing up.


Mr Cassidy said:


Yes but we're talking about connection fees to the house.


Mr Truss said:


Our connection fees will be lower.


He was absolutely incapable of answering the question.


The member for Chifley addressed some very important issues concerning asbestos. I too would be very keen to see what was in the documents when Telstra was fully privatised and what due diligence was done. There was the material risk in that everyone knew that many of those pits were built before World War II and would have asbestos lining in them. I do not remember any of the Liberals or the Nationals getting up in parliament at the time—and I followed the debate very closely—and saying, 'In the future, someone is probably going to open those pits and do some work in them. We'd better cover off this risk.' This has been uncontested: a direct result of the sell-off was the number of permanent staff that were made contractors. What was said in those public offer documents, in the sale documents, about the potential risk of having staff who become contractors rather than being directly employed by Telstra? I would be very interested to know these things.


I will end by saying that this continues to be a very popular policy with the Australian people. I know it is popular in my electorate. Firms have moved to my area just to take up the benefit of the NBN, including the Good Egg Studio at Riverstone. The member for Wentworth came to Blacktown and admitted that Blacktown would become a city divided: people who have access to the NBN and those who do not. That is not what we want from the National Broadband Network.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2013-06-18,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (13:12):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the fifth report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Broadband Network. When you look at this report, the thing that is most striking is the contrast between a view of the world as some would wish it to be—including, I note particularly, the chair of the committee, the member for Lyne—and the view of reality. There is quite a disparity between the two. The member for Lyne is an unashamed true believer in the marvels of the National Broadband Network in the present form in which it is being implemented by the Labor government, which he helped bring to power. In his chair's foreword, he said about the National Broadband Network:


It will make a big difference in many lives. It will strengthen our economy. It will promote our cultural identity in a flattening global culture … it will create opportunity and deliver equity for all Australians.


He repeats the claim that it will 'promote Australian culture to the world', 'show respect to sectors like education as our second biggest export market'. The powers of the NBN appear to be almost limitless in the faith of the member for Lyne. He says it will 'play to our strengths by unlocking entrepreneurship as a nation'. He says:


What an opportunity to promote Australia and expand our export economy by getting this build right.


The chair of this committee, the member for Lyne, is a true believer in the capacity of the National Broadband Network to do all of these things.


But I have to say, when I hear these overblown claims about what the NBN will do, my response is: no it won't. At the very highest, you could put the argument as follows. You could argue that the NBN is a necessary but not sufficient condition to achieve these marvellous outcomes—to promote Australia's cultural identity to the world, to unleash entrepreneurship. But to claim that building the NBN will 'deliver equity for all Australians' or will 'unlock entrepreneurship as a nation' is, I would suggest, an example of the kind of dangerously woolly thinking that is causing us to splash away so much money without being careful in our analysis of what we are getting for the money. It may be possible to argue—and it is a contentious proposition—that if you build and deliver an effective national broadband network it will encourage economic activity, it will encourage entrepreneurship. But there is that distinction that was hammered home in first-year philosophy: it may be a necessary but it is certainly not a sufficient condition. It is not enough to argue, as we repeatedly hear from the member for Lyne and other advocates for the NBN in its present form, that the mere construction of this network will lead 1,000 flowers to bloom. That is not true. There is much more that needs to happen. It may be that the NBN will assist in a range of outcomes, but it will not do it by itself. And to suggest, as the rhetoric in the chair's forward suggests, that it is sufficient to achieve these objectives, is misleading and is an indicator of the kind of fuzzy and woolly thinking that sadly has bedevilled far too much political commentary about NBN Co.


So, if the first objection that I have to the particular philosophy that is articulated in those introductory comments is to say that, even if you believe all of these claims, at best the NBN can be a condition towards achieving the outcomes and much more needs to happen, then the second—and even more substantial—objection I have is this: before any of these wonderful claimed outcomes can be expected, you need to get the thing built, and you need to get it done quickly, cost-effectively and efficiently. And if there is one thing that is clear, as we look at the state of progress with the National Broadband Network, when you turn your eye away from the lofty claims about the marvels that this network is going to deliver, and get on to the more prosaic level of what is actually happening now—how much money has been spent, what we are getting for it, whether the rollout is on time and whether the network been well designed—the answer to all those things is: this is a mess.


So the coalition makes no apologies for turning our eyes away from the wafting vision of the sunlit uplands, which the member for Lyne has once again been all too eager to lay before us. We make no apology for turning away and looking at the detail—and the detail is a very, very troubling picture. The proper role of this committee—on behalf of the Parliament of Australia and in turn on behalf of taxpayers who are compulsorily investors in this badly designed and ill conceived project—is to ask: how is it going? How much money is being spent? What is happening with the rollout? What confidence can we have that the project as presently conceived is going to be completed? All of that must necessarily and logically come before turning our minds to the marvels that the credulous member for Lyne appears to believe are just over the horizon.


I am a very strong believer in broadband. I am a very strong believer in the economic and social benefits of broadband. I have worked in the telecommunications sector, both in government and in the private sector, for many, many years. In fact, I am so interested in broadband that I wrote a book about it—and what a festival of pointy headedness that was, if I may say! But I would make the point that it is simply not good enough to have these wafting generalities in the report that we have before us. We need to get into the detail on behalf of the parliament and on behalf of the Australian people to ask the detailed question, how is the rollout going? And when we turn to that question, the answer is unambiguous. The rollout is going very, very badly. Let us start by looking at some of the numbers. By 30 June 2013, according to NBN Co.'s first corporate plan released in December 2010, this network was supposed to pass 1.3 million premises. In fact, on the most recent numbers, as at May this year—so there is only a month to go—it had passed around 103,000 premises. We also see that the estimates of usage of the network are well behind what is forecast and we also see, extremely troublingly, that the build of the fixed wireless network is running into difficulty and is behind schedule and at the same time we see that NBN Co. continues to burn through cash and spend lavishly on headcount.


Let me make this particular comment, coming as I do from a background in the telecommunications sector for many years. It is an open and notorious joke within the telecommunications sector that people are leaving existing telcos, particularly Telstra and Optus, and have been doing so for several years to go to roles at NBN Co. where they are paid very substantially in excess of what they were previously paid by their previous private sector employer. There is no question that NBN Co. is spending in a profligate fashion and is spending on staff and on other things in a way that no private sector telco would do. 


At the same time, the rollout is scandalously behind schedule and the performance which has been delivered is absolutely hopeless if you compare it to any benchmarks of what has been done. I cite, for example, the rollout within one year of the 3G network, the Next G network, under Sol Trujillo at Telstra. I have been critical of Sol Trujillo on many occasions, but Telstra's delivery of the Next G network within a very short period of time was an impressive engineering achievement. Or you could look at the rate at which both Telstra and Optus rolled out their HFC networks, their hybrid fibre-coaxial networks, across many cities of Australia during the mid-90s. If you look at the rate at which those networks were rolled out and you compare it to what has been achieved by NBN Co., it is chalk and cheese. Or you could look across the Tasman and you could have a look at what is being done in New Zealand. By December 2012, the Kiwis, with their fibre rollout, had passed 134,000 homes. Bear in mind that at that time NBN Co. in Australia had passed 72,400. The two rollouts began at roughly the same time. Australia is a country five times as large. If we had matched the performance of New Zealand, we would have been at several hundred thousand by December last year.


Wherever you go, if you look at the private sector and its history of rollouts, both fixed and mobile in Australia, and if you look across the Tasman at an analogous rollout of a fibre broadband network, you see that NBN Co. is doing a very poor job against those benchmarks. Indeed, if you are looking for tangible evidence that the rollout is well behind where it was expected to be, you could look at the fact that funding in the budget in 2014 was reduced by $3.5 billion compared to what had originally been proposed as recently as the October Midyear Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Why is that? It was not a conscious cost reduction strategy or fiscal discipline by the Treasurer, because that is not the kind of Treasurer that we have. It is because the rollout is running well behind time. Those budget cuts are a consequence of a delay in the rollout. 


So when we look at the very basis, the very centre of what this committee should be focused on, on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia, in having oversight of this rollout and determining whether taxpayers' money is being spent well, whether the project is being managed efficiently and cost effectively, there is no conclusion which can be reached other than that there are very serious red flashing lights here. This rollout is in a mess and it is in a mess, unsurprisingly, because we have a government which is absolutely atrocious at implementation. We have seen that with school halls, we have seen that with the home insulation program and we are seeing it as well with the National Broadband Network. I mentioned the fact that the fixed wireless rollout is a long way behind schedule. According to the Australian Financial Review, even in the best case scenario by the end of June the wireless network will cover just 31,291 premises, which is only 45 per cent of the target of 70,000 that the fixed wireless network was supposed to reach.


I come now to a question I have touched on already and will deal with in a bit more detail: the question of the NBN's management of human resources. There is no more important task in running a company than in managing your human resources efficiently. That means getting the right people in to do the job. It means paying them what  you need to attract them, but no more—I have already talked about the extent to which NBN Co. has paid well in excess of market levels. It also means maintaining a capable team in place rather than churning through executives, senior management and directors on a regular basis. Unfortunately, from NBN Co. we have seen a very substantial amount of churn amongst senior management and indeed amongst directors.


We are also seeing a very rapidly growing head count for NBN Co. As at the end of February there were 2,477 employees. That is an increase of nearly 50 per cent on staff numbers in June 2012. So this company is continuing to grow without restraint. It is continuing to add people even though the rollout, the core job it is there to do, is running very badly behind plan. This is a very significant contributor to the overall cost of this project, a cost that taxpayers are funding. It is another indicator of the way in which basic financial disciplines that you would see in a similar private sector investment project have been troublingly absent.


On the question of churn of employees, since October 2009 some 14 senior executives and 55 executive level employees have left the company. There does appear to be significant evidence of unusually high levels of churn amongst the senior management team and amongst directors.


I will close by referring to one other point that is touched on in this report, which is the meandering discussion about whether more private equity should be sought for NBN Co. This is something of an interest of the chair. It is a ridiculous interest that makes no sense, because the legislation says that you cannot have private sector equity until the build is finished, and five years later. The chair voted for that legislation, so he should know that.


Debate adjourned.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-06-18,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (12:16):  I want to draw honourable members' attention to the dissenting report by the coalition members and senators which sets out some very disturbing facts about the disastrous state of this project. The debate over the NBN, of course, has been contentious, but the rollout has been proceeding for long enough now for there to be some objective facts on the ground and, indeed, in the ground.


The first point that the coalition have made is that the fibre rollout is well behind schedule. The original NBN Co. corporate plan published at the end of 2010 forecast that fibre would be available and connected to 950,000 brownfield and 319,000 greenfield premises by June 2013. As at the end of May the fibre network had passed 71,000 brownfield and 32,000 greenfield premises. That is a catastrophic shortfall. It is not just a question of falling short of the 2010 forecasts. By brownfield, of course, honourable members understand I am talking about the already built-up areas as opposed to new developments. I mentioned that the first forecast was 950,000 to be passed by end June 2013. In August last year their new corporate plan slashed that down to 286,000, then in March 2013, just a few months ago, that target was again reduced to between 155,000 and 175,000, and as of mid-May the fibre network had passed only 71,000 brownfield premises. This is one shortfall after another.


There have been cascading forecasts, the target is dropping down, and it says something about the management of this business and their capacity to forecast. They set a new target in August last year, they then had to dramatically reduce it in March this year, and now it appears they are going to fall short of a target that was set 90 days prior to the target date. There are no forecasts in the corporate plan that one can take seriously.


This slowness of the rollout is a very significant issue. Honourable members will understand that one of the arguments in favour of the National Broadband Network has always been that having everyone in Australia connected to very fast broadband will deliver economy-wide benefits, big spillover effects, externalities. We do not doubt that those benefits are there to have ubiquitous connection to very fast broadband. The big question is: what is the incremental benefit, if any, between having people connected to very fast broadband at the speeds it can be achieved under the approach we favour—in most built-up areas, fibre-to-the-node—and having fibre-to-the-premises? The one thing that is clear—and there is no argument in any of the literature or in experience—is that having everyone connected to very fast broadband, even at speeds much slower than the peak speeds available on fibre, is a real benefit. The problem that we face, therefore, with the NBN's slow rollout is that we are not getting the benefits of ubiquitous connectivity any time soon, and perhaps we might not be getting them for 20 years or so. At the current rate of progress the completion of this network will take many decades.


In our re-examination of the NBN's financial model, in our alternative policy, we assumed that it would take another four years to complete. That is a very optimistic assumption. At the moment the NBN is passing less than a quarter of the number of premises it should be passing, even according to its revised corporate plan. For a project that is passing around 350 premises a day, as it is at the moment, to seriously imagine that in 18 months or so it is going to be passing well over 6,000 a day is just incredible.


The reality is that this project is going to be long delayed. That means that the benefits of universal or ubiquitous connectivity will also be long delayed. It is cold comfort to say to somebody—and there are at least two million premises in Australia in this category that have, effectively, no broadband at all since they do not have broadband at a speed that would enable them to watch a YouTube video—'Don't worry, you are going to get the Rolls Royce option, the fibre-to-the-premises option, in 10 years or 20 years time.' That may well be beyond the lifetimes of some of the occupants of these premises, and it is certainly beyond the time their children will be at school.


The issue really boils down to a fundamental one of management. There is an argument about technology, but even if you accept Labor's argument about technology the fact is that the project is just not getting there. One of the problems that we are seeing is that the civil contractors who have been employed—Silcar, Transfield, Syntheo and Visionstream—have not been delivering the premises that they have been contracted to deliver. It is common knowledge in the industry that they are all losing a huge amount of money. The word on the street, as it were, is that these contractors will need to have contract prices increased by something in the order of 30 per cent of the current contracted rates if they are able to make any money or any margin at all.


That being the case, what does that tell us about the reliability of the NBN Co.'s cost forecasts? It has a corporate plan that its management tells us is based on the current contracted costs, yet we know that the contractors are going backwards financially. This has had some pretty dramatic results: the Silcar CEO Peter Lamell left the company in May; the Service Stream managing director, Graeme Sumner, left the company in April; and the Syntheo joint venture appears to be about to be dissolved.


The failure to have satisfactory commercial relationships with the civil contractors is a profound failure of the NBN Co., because it does not have a huge civil workforce of its own and is not proposing to have a huge workforce of its own, although it has sought to take over the management of the construction in the Northern Territory. But it needs to have a satisfactory relationship with its civil contractors and it needs to have contracts with them that enable them to pay their subbies a fair price and make a margin for themselves. If they cannot do that, it simply will not continue. We have set them out in some detail in this dissenting report.


I spoke earlier about the asbestos issue. I will not go over all of that ground again. But the coalition are very concerned that the Commonwealth will be liable for asbestos risk, notwithstanding that it is in Telstra pits that are being remediated by contractors working for Telstra. As you know, the Work Health and Safety Act imposes on NBN Co. a duty to workers, including workers employed by—for example—Telstra or contractors to Telstra if their work is influenced or directed by NBN Co. It is very arguable, it seems to us, that NBN Co. is in that position of influence and therefore could have liability for this asbestos risk.


We are particularly concerned that the issue of asbestos has been well-known for a long time and this does not reflect well on either Telstra or NBN Co. There has clearly been a failure of supervision on the part of both companies. I simply note and draw the attention of honourable members to the comments that we have made there.


I want to now turn to the question of the fixed wireless rollout, which has not had enough public debate or discussion because the fibre-to-the-premise rollout is so much bigger. Fixed wireless is the technology solution for about four per cent of the country. Under the plan, 93 per cent gets fibre-to-the-premise, four per cent gets fixed wireless and three per cent gets satellite. I might say that under the approach that we would sake many of those premises or households in the fixed wireless footprint at present will get wire line, fixed line, very fast broadband. They are in towns that have less than 1,000 premises, which will not get fibre-to-the-premise under Labor's approach but which will be eminently suitable for a vectored VDSL fibre-to-the-node solution of the kind that we are proposing. There are many smaller communities in rural and regional Australia that will get much faster and much more convenient broadband services under our approach than they will under Labor's approach.


Looking at the way the NBN Co. is tracking at the moment, it has been reported that even on their best case scenario their fixed wireless network will cover only 31,291 premises by the end of June, which is only 45 per cent of the 70,000 target. The explanations for this shortfall given by the NBN Co. management frankly beggar belief. Their explanation is—and this has been given by the minister as well—that there has been an unanticipated level of tall trees in rural and regional Australia. I will quote the evidence from the NBN chief technology officer, Gary McLaren, in estimates of 30 May in which he talked about these trees. He said: 


We have always expected there will be some areas, mainly due to vegetation—trees and the like—that will cause those installations to not be able to pass through that qualification step …We are seeing those being slightly higher than we would have originally expected.


Being ambushed—bushwhacked—by the presence of tall trees in regional Australia is a fairly pathetic excuse. But it does underline the poor planning and the poor management of this project.


Finally, I want to touch on the very, very troubling issues about management. We have at the moment a new chairman, Siobhan McKenna. She has been on the NBN board from the outset but she became chairman on 21 March, replacing Harrison Young. She has said publicly that she is taking a much tougher approach to management. She has said that she does not want Senator Conroy, the minister, being able to communicate directly with NBN Co. Chief Executive Mike Quigley, although Senator Conroy seems to have said that he will not play along with that.


More troublingly, it is being widely reported—and has not been anywhere denied—that Siobhan McKenna has, on behalf of the board, sought the dismissal of the Chief Executive, Mr Quigley, and that she has no confidence in him. If this were a publicly listed company, belonging to a bunch of superannuation funds and private investors, and there was published in the newspaper a report saying that the chairman had no confidence in the chief executive and wanted the chief executive sacked, that matter would have to be resolved within hours. And, yet, we have at the moment with this company, the biggest infrastructure project in our history, a situation where the management is tearing itself to pieces, the board is opposed to the chief executive—it sounds like the Labor Party caucus, frankly—and there is no denial, clarification or confirmation. When Mr Quigley was sought to be questioned about this in estimates, as we have set out in this dissenting report, Senator Conroy prevented him from answering any questions. This project, sadly, is in utter chaos. This dissenting report, which I commend to honourable members, sets out in some detail the sorry tale of mismanagement that the NBN project is today.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-06-18,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (12:31):  It is a great pleasure of mine to be able to speak to this report—the fifth and final report of the joint committee. It is a project that has had a great degree of oversight in the rollout and in the management of the project itself. In fact, I have from time to time been concerned that we have overlaid too much oversight. I am certainly one for, obviously, the parliamentary ability to probe and test the way in which government business enterprises like this operate. But, when you consider all of the ways in which this project has people looking at it, you would not have a similar level of investigation imposed on an organisation external to government.


Having said that, NBN Co. has always sought—from my impression, and I am sure it would be the impression of others, particularly on the government side—to cooperate with questions and to be available to answer inquiries from members of parliament. Be it in estimates, the joint committee or the public hearings, they have tried to do the right thing, to talk about a project that is going to transform this nation. There is no doubt that this will economically transform the way that we operate, and it will put us at an advantage compared to other countries that have not been able to do this to the same breadth and the same level of detail that has been undertaken in this project.


It is an investment of just over $30 billion in a technology that is already, through the internet—if you take on board the Deloitte study—contributing about $50 billion in economic value to this country currently, and will contribute $70 billion into the future. It has already been indicated that that investment will have a return of seven per cent, but, to be honest, I see that the actual return itself will come when you look at the way that it will change the manner in which the economy operates, the way in which firms operate, the way in which communities connect and interrelate, the way that education is delivered in this country, and the way that health care is delivered in this country. On top of these things, the fact that there are applications and there are ways in which technology that is not currently known will do the same thing, is something to note.


I had the opportunity recently to speak to a venture tech firm, BlueChilli, that operate out of Sydney. They bring together capital and people who want to transform the way in which things are done at the moment through their own ideas, their own innovative energy, and completely alter the way in which people operate and conduct their business. These types of firms, from what I have seen—and this firm is based in the Sydney CBD—are doing remarkable things in terms of changing the way the business operates. And they certainly always encourage the innovators within their organisations to continue to think differently about what can be done, what we do now and how we can do it differently, and how we can add value to the economy. These are the types of firms that get unleashed when they have access to a technology that has been using, as a platform, what we are doing through the National Broadband Network.


Through this process we have tackled a massive capacity constraint. It is well known that the former government was told by bodies such as the Reserve Bank that capacity constraints would limit the ability of the economy to grow and that failing to do so would hurt the economy into the longer term. Those opposite tried, as has been reflected upon here, 19 times to address the fact that people could not get access to broadband. I represent people who had previously been stuck in a dial-up world—or a broadband wasteland, as I have described it—and faced very little chance that they would actually get access to modern telecommunications infrastructure. As a result of what we have been doing, we have been able, through a combination of the work being done by Telstra and the rollout being done by NBN Co., to free these people from being stuck with dial-up, which in this day and age is the technological equivalent of a dinosaur. We have freed suburbs such as Woodcroft and Doonside from that.


Last week my colleague the member for Greenway and I were proud to turn the NBN on in Blacktown with the minister for communications, Stephen Conroy. This has already seen 1,300 homes having access to the NBN at the outset. What has also been great is that RSPs like Telstra and Optus are out there now actively seeking customers and getting a tremendous response from customers who are wanting to sign up. In actual fact, if you look at the fifth report itself—and this is important—on page 19 it indicates that the revenue that NBN is receiving as a result of the RSPs going out and connecting customers and having this then flow back to NBN Co was $5.3 million and has risen by nearly $2 million since June of last year. So, in a short space of time it is already increasing the amount of money that it is generating as a result of customers coming onboard. And, as has been anecdotally indicated to me, once the customers get onboard with the NBN their usage changes. They use more and they want to be able to—and are certainly happy to—change their plans, because they are getting value for money per gigabyte that they are using as a household. And households like small businesses—for example, accounting firms that operate from home and design firms that operate from home—are now able to access a network. The more these home based businesses operate and the more people can change the way in which they work through telework, the more we will see other benefits. For example, in Western Sydney we are plagued very much by this issue of congestion in terms of traffic and the like. Being able to have economic development in local areas rather than having people feel that they have to travel long distances to conduct work will have huge economic benefit.


I mentioned earlier that there are other countries that have tried to do what we are doing. If you look at the US in particular, Verizon, through its fibre optic service, had gone to five states but has slowed down in its delivery because it does not have a dedicated investment program, unlike what is happening here. And Google is now rolling out fibre in Kansas and Utah and is expecting that these networks will operate profitably. Others are catching up and recognise that the use of this fibre instead of copper—fibre that delivers light at 300,000 kilometres per second and delivers a signal that has much more capacity and benefit and ability than anything that can be delivered on fibre—is a serious way in which to construct a future network.


That is why, when the opposition were in government, they had committees looking at this, and the member for Sturt even indicated in reports that he authored that, hands down, fibre is the best form of technology to deliver a modern broadband network. Certainly that has been evident, and there is very little to suggest otherwise. There is a suggestion that there will be a better form of technology—for example, a reliance on vectoring. Yes, vectoring does have its benefits, but most people will tell you that it is nowhere near as good as having fibre to the premises. Those opposite have had to come up with a policy for the sake of a policy but, having spent the best part of this parliamentary term determined to kill off this project, they have been unable to, due to two things. Firstly, they have an idea that nothing is wrong with the current broadband network in this country—and that does not stack up. Secondly, they have realised that businesses and the community expect a modern, robust form of infrastructure that will ensure that the country can progress in the years ahead and not stumble along in the way that they had been overseeing it when they were in office.


The opposition are continually focussed on the claim—and we continue to get this; we heard it from the member for Wentworth, and others, not necessarily those currently in the chamber, will probably bleat on today in reference to it—that NBN Co has failed to meet its forecast. In fact, the member for Wentworth today used the term 'catastrophic failure'. 



An honourable member interjecting— 




Mr HUSIC:
  He is using a word that denotes something extremely harmful either in a physical or financial sense. Financial ruin would occur as a result of the failure, in their words, to meet the targets. It is an absurd claim. They well know that the 2011-13 corporate plan was produced well before any definitive agreements had been signed up, before one of the biggest corporate agreements was signed with Telstra and before the Optus deal was even finalised, to ensure the handover of their network and their agreement in terms of the way in which NBN Co rolls out the network. They know that no-one in this country could have predicted that the ACCC would have brought down a points-of-interconnect decision that would see the points of interconnection increase by a multitude, from 14 to 121. Those opposite had never predicted it. It suits their political argument to say that it does not meet the target, while neglecting to mention the things that have happened in between. Any company will have to, from time to time, confront roadblocks and work out how they structure their corporate plans accordingly. Those opposite are unable to have the decency to tell the Australian public why these figures had changed.


There is no doubt that this project, as it picks up speed, will roll out further and further, and will not necessarily be held up by the type of scare campaigns that have been put by those opposite. We had the member for Wentworth, for example, picking up on this issue of asbestos. No-one doubts for one moment that the issue is one that is critical and needs to be managed properly. Asbestos has sat in the Telstra system for decades, and then the member for Wentworth says in an offhand remark that this has been known for some time by NBN and Telstra. Yes, it has been known by Telstra. I would be interested to go back to the initial prospectus that was put out as it was being privatised to see whether or not it was denoted as a risk. What did those opposite do, when they were in government for 13 years, about the issue of asbestos? In any due diligence process you would know that it is an issue and you would have to deal with it. I would be interested to know now what the opposition, in government, did to mitigate risk.


The fact of the matter is that there are very smart people in Telstra, who, while they will not be able to pinpoint right now where these things are on a network map, will be able to determine this, based on likely roll-out. They will be able to deal with it where the roll-outs occur, at any point in time, and they do. For example, in Kiama, where Silcar was used on the project, they had trained up all their staff and ensured that all the equipment was present and did not have one problem with the issue of asbestos. Asbestos is being used as a Trojan Horse by those opposite. I am not having them now confect a concern about asbestos when I, like many other people, heard the dismissive words expressed by the Leader of the Opposition to Bernie Banton. It was one of the most disgraceful episodes I have witnessed and it is beneath the Leader of the Opposition. If he has found a concern about asbestos I welcome it, but he should remember that his previous words haunt him in this regard.


The other thing I want to mention is workforce planning. There has been a great deal of reference made in the report to workforce planning and subcontractor planning. It has been one issue that I have been particularly interested in from the get-go. Before my life here as a member of parliament, it was something that I represented as the national president of a union that covers workers in this area. We have enormous talent that exists out there that we need to employ and deploy on this project. One of the concerns that I have is that Telstra should be used more and more in the rollout of this project, because they do have people within Telstra, in the lines and in the field workforce, who can be used. 


One of the regrets I have is that NBN Co. has been stuck in a model that has been used and employed for many years in the sector, which is a contract-subcontract model. I doubt very much those opposite will move away from it. My issue with it is that NBN Co. does not have an internal workforce, and that internal workforce could easily be supplied by Telstra. You will not necessarily need an asset manager into the future with fibre. Fibre obviously costs a lot to deploy but costs very little to maintain into the future. There are people within Telstra and we should be forming a relationship with Telstra so they can be used more and more on the rollout of this project. This will ensure that the skills that are there within the sector can be employed to their best possible ability. It will also ensure that Telstra can aid NBN Co. in what is critical for them: network mapping, being able to determine the structure of the network and having robust systems into the future. I welcome this committee and all the work that it has done. It has done a great job for this parliament. In particular I note the contribution of the chairperson. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2013-06-18,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (12:46):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this rather concerning report. I noted that the member for Chifley said that the project confronted a few roadblocks, or a roadblock. I think the real concern here is that we are not confronting a roadblock, we are confronting a train wreck. We are confronting a train wreck because we have got a project that has not met a single target that has been set. That is of concern. They have had the opportunity to set the targets. They have not met one. By now we are supposed to be passing some 1.3 million houses. So how many houses or premises are we going to pass? We are not going to pass 1.3, we are not going to pass a million, we are not going to pass 500,000 houses. As we sit in wonder, the real question is: are we going to meet the revised, revised, revised target of 190,000 houses passed? Are we going to make it? I would suggest not. 


Let us look at connections. Around about now, 511,000 houses were to be connected, in just a couple weeks. How many are we going to connect? If we are lucky, 20,000 to 25,000. This is a project that needs to connect 6,000 houses a day to meet the targets that it set for itself. This is not a target set by the opposition. This is the target set by NBN Co.—6,000 houses a day. I think you would have to believe in Santa Claus and the Easter bunny to believe they are going to achieve that. 


If it were possible for things to become worse, well, they certainly have. NBN Co. is now further behind schedule that it was at the last report. The budget has blown out more than it was as at the last report. The rollout has slowed to a crawl. We have had the problems that have been mentioned by the member for Wentworth. We have the asbestos problem which that master of illusion, Mr Quigley, said was no real problem at all; 'no real problem at all', he said back in the April hearings. 'Don't you worry about that by golly, just a little bit of asbestos, not a problem at all.' Yet somehow he expects us to believe that, despite a range of sites being on hold, we are going to somehow meet the targets that he set for himself. History will show clearly that those targets will be missed. We have an interim satellite solution that is running out of capacity. We have NBN Co. staff rushing for the exits. We have an NBN Co. board that is trying to have the CEO removed from his post.


It is a project in crisis. It is a project that is heading for disaster. If a publicly listed company was in this position it would probably be in a trading halt—although I do not know that anyone would buy shares in NBN Co., given its past history, so a trading halt would probably be a mere technicality. A publicly listed company would be being required to make certain disclosures to the Australian stock exchange to get to the real situation with regard to the company. But, unlike a publicly listed company, NBN Co. is a black box. Every piece of information concerning this project must be prised out. We have this Orwellian regime of misinformation perpetrated by the CEO, Mr Quigley. He makes sure that absolutely no information that is useful is divulged to the parliamentary committee that has responsibility for oversight of this project.


We have tens of billions of taxpayer dollars at stake, and the Australian taxpayer is not being given clear and concise information as to the true status of this project. Every time the committee asked for information about the latest disaster we were told the information was commercial in confidence or that we somehow did not need to know this information. The only risk posed by releasing much of this information to the Joint Committee on the NBN is embarrassment to the government. And it is an embarrassment.


The chair of the committee, Mr Oakeshott, the member for Lyne, seems to be saying that everything is going okay. He said just yesterday that 'the NBN remains on track to deliver a rate of return to the taxpayer of over 7 per cent per annum'. Well, we will see. The member for Lyne is in fact complicit in the regime of deceit and dishonesty that this committee has had to endure. They are actually running a protection racket—




Mr Mitchell:
  Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member is making some very serious inferences at the member for Lyne. I think he has been here long enough to know his standing orders—I think he should withdraw those inferences.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Owens
):  There is no point of order. There are other mechanisms of the house if the member has a concern.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  I know the truth hurts, but I will move on with my contribution. Instead of talking about terms and allowing the light to shine in, the true status of this project remains a mystery. Let's look at the wireless rollout. What is the status of the wireless rollout? You guessed it, Deputy Speaker—behind schedule. We were supposed to have around 70,000 premises covered by the wireless network by 30 June. how much is it going to be? Is it going to be 70,000? Of course not. According to recent media reports, it is going to be 31,000 premises. The government will tell us it is right on target, right on track. We are not even halfway to the target that has been set by NBN Co. for itself—just another example. And they had the audacity to say that they underestimated the number of trees in regional Australia. It was a major technical hitch when they found there were big trees in regional Australia. It is a real concern.




Mr Mitchell:
  What was your last plan?




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  They underestimated the number of trees, Member for McEwen. They have entered into a whole range of agreements that have been problematic. When this project was conceived, the iPhone was released. Two years later the iPad was released. This project has not taken into account the huge shift in the amount of people using mobile networks.


One of the other concerns with this is that there has been a neglect of mobile services. There has been a total disregard for the situation with regard to mobile services in regional areas. In fact, Senator Conroy has said we are going to wait until the wireless network is rolled out in 2015 before we address the issue highlighted in the Regional Telecommunications Review—that of poor mobile services. I think the Australian people would be concerned as to whether the wireless rollout will be completed by 2015. We are not even up to half the scheduled rollout rate so far. I think you would have to, once again, believe in Santa Claus or the Easter bunny to believe that this government will bring it in by 2015.


Another interesting factor was in relation to the interim satellite service cap. It was revealed at the last round of the committee hearings that the interim satellite service cap of 48,000 customers would be reached by 2014, and the government has no intention of increasing the cap. So some people in remote Australia and in many areas of regional Australia will be left with no internet service for more than two years, until the long-term satellite solution is brought online. People who rely on the satellite internet will have no other option. The interim satellite solution is the only link for a range of customers.


The government said that it would be too expensive to increase the cap beyond 48,000. The minister said that it would cost $86 million to increase the cap by 7,000 customers from 48,000 to 55,000. I have to say that every person I have consulted in the satellite industry has said that those numbers are rubbish. It is widely accepted that there is sufficient capacity in the market to increase the cap to around 75,000 customers—an additional 27,000. The published cost for the interim satellite service is $300 million for 48,000 customers and, when you do the maths, that works out to be around $6,250 per customer. But, based on the minister's figures, to add 7,000 to the cap was going to cost an additional $12,285 a customer. How does that work? If you have been able to set up your overheads and all the costs of setting up the interim satellite solution at a total cost of $6,250 per customer, why does it cost you around double that to purchase additional capacity when it is available in the market? That is a mystery that remains unsolved.


If the cap is not increased the teams of installers currently working on the interim satellite solution will be disbanded and there will be a whole installation system and labour force that will need to be rebuilt from the ground up, which will mean it will take even longer for the NBN to roll out its long-term satellite solution. In reality the government has simply abandoned regional Australia by its failure to address this very important shortfall in the project with the need to continue the interim satellite solution past the cap. This is the government's track record, or NBN Co.'s track record, of being late with regard to everything.


This is a project that is of concern to taxpayers. It is a project that has not passed the test of accountability. It is a project that revolves around concealment and deceit rather than true transparency. I believe that, if the coalition were elected on 14 September, it will be the first opportunity to view the true status of this project and the true situation with regard to progress and costs, which have been concealed from the parliament to this point in time. So, I certainly raise very real concerns about the future of the project and I raise very real concerns about the accountability to this parliament.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2013-06-18,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:57):  I am very pleased to speak in support of the fifth report of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. We come into this place to talk about the biggest infrastructure project in Australia's history and to have those opposite come forward and rubbish it, I think, says everything about their debate on the NBN that has gone on in this 43rd Parliament. Much to the coalition's despair, and unfortunately for them, the NBN keeps getting more and more popular as a policy.


I am disappointed because, for the last speech that the member for Wentworth is going to make in the 43rd Parliament on the NBN, I really wanted him to give a blow-by-blow account of the 'fraudband' launch. How awkward was it? It was awks to the max! The Leader of the Opposition was moving into the shadows and saying, 'Come into the dark, Malcolm. Come to the dark side.' I thought he was going to start speaking like Darth Vader. It was absolutely embarrassing to watch, but amusing at the same time. I was hoping that the member for Wentworth was going to talk about that, but alas, no. Their comments are despite the fact that people like Vint Cerf, the father of the internet, has given his blessing to this project on many, many occasions. This is despite the fact that we had the CeBIT conference in Australia only a couple of weeks ago where, again, we were lauded as a government for our forward-thinking policy on this matter. As well, the ITU holds up Australia as an example of best practice in national broadband rollout.


One of the biggest complaints I still get from people is not that the NBN is happening but is, 'When am I going to get it?' People have waited for so long in backwaters of not only regional Australia but outer metropolitan cities as well. I was disappointed he has left the chamber, because the member for Cowper talked about the government abandoning regional Australia. He is the bloke who sold out on regional Australia. I will give you some facts and I will give you some evidence to support that in just a moment.


Just to go back a bit, firstly, I feel sorry for the member for Cowper having to come in here and push the member for Wentworth's lines on this matter. But let's not forget that when Telstra was fully privatised, when those opposite were in government, the Nats were absolutely sold down the river. They took all the elements that should have been about regional accessibility and affordability, moved them into a separate piece of legislation and told everyone that that would be okay. The member for Chifley mentioned it but I will talk a bit more about the sell-off process that not only led to issues with the Telstra pits that we see today but also made Australia, and confirmed Australia's position as, an absolute broadband backwater—behind countries like Estonia and many countries of Eastern Europe.


I will not have the member for Cowper coming in here and saying these things. He talked about mobile and fixed. I feel like I have been giving this same lecture, the same lessons, to some people opposite over and over again. The inability to understand the difference between mobile, wireless and fixed wireless is simply beyond me. It is a debate that was settled many, many years ago—that mobile and fixed are complementary, not substitutable, and that fixed wireless services require a backbone. In this case you look to the best backbone that you can build to maximise capacity, and that is a fibre backbone. It is no wonder that mobile operators are enthusiastically embracing the NBN for the opportunity to fibre up their base stations.


The member for Cowper talked about the lack of mobile access. In the early 2000s we had an attempt to introduce USO contestability in Australia. We had a pilot project for the Pacific Highway, running through the member for Cowper's own electorate, for which bidding was done, and which resulted in absolutely no measurable improvement. So the only thing that was done on this matter by those opposite when they were in government on this matter was an absolute, abject failure.


I will take up a few issues to do with regional Australia, which is one of the things I really want to talk about in relation to this particular report. There is the issue of a universal wholesale price under Labor's NBN versus there being no equivalent under the broadband plan of those opposite. I will quote from the Hansard of the public hearing on Friday 19 April. I specifically asked the question of Ms Teresa Corbin of ACCAN:


I presume you are also aware that the government has imposed a universal wholesale price for the NBN and, in light of your comments about affordability, how important is it not to discriminate against people who live in outer metropolitan areas and regional areas?


She answered:


This is very important to our members.


I went on to ask:


What feedback do you get already from consumers living in regional areas in particular about things like the digital divide?


She went on to explain how it is very important for people living in regional Australia to have the same opportunities for affordability and accessibility as those living in the city. Yet again, I am disappointed he did not stick around. I ask: what did the member for Cowper do to improve broadband in his electorate when he was part of a government? How many failed plans did we have from those opposite that produced no measurable improvements in broadband across Australia?


I would like to turn to something the member for Wentworth took some time mentioning—chapter 4 of the dissenting report, and specifically item 4.1. To be quite frank, I find it rather tawdry that those opposite want to come in here and start talking about—it is like a gossip chapter—the new chair of NBN Co. and the CEO of NBN Co., quoting various articles from News Limited, from The Australian and the Australian Financial Review. They have a recommendation in which they cannot even spell Ms McKenna's name properly, but I digress.


It is absolutely ridiculous for the member for Wentworth and those opposite to have spent so much time and energy on a chapter called 'Unstable governance and question over board's confidence in CEO.' Something that I learnt very early on—and I would have thought the member for Wentworth, as someone who is always coming in here talking about all the big deals that he has done with Rupert and friends, would have lectured me on this—is that the people who you are sitting opposite to and doing a deal with may one day very well be the people on your team. You do not want to go off making bizarre accusations and relying on hearsay and gossip. You want to rely on the facts. I find it absolutely ridiculous for the member for Wentworth to choose to spend so much time on this particular issue. He does himself great discredit. It is merely an attempt to again try and smear Mr Quigley. Whatever reasons he has for doing that, they are his own and I will leave him to it.


We again had those opposite come in here and start talking about the rollout targets. But the reality is that at the end of May NBN Co. was on track to beat its revised June rollout targets and to pass between 171,836 homes and 185,808 premises with fibre by the end of June—far exceeding its set target. It must be very disappointing for those opposite to have seen support for Labor's existing policy increase after those opposite released their policy. Prior to the release of 'fraudband', 73 per cent of people surveyed supported Labor's NBN. After 'fraudband' was released, that went up to 78 per cent. That must be striking a very raw nerve.


I have called out MPs before who say one thing in their electorates about how much they support increasing broadband opposite but who do something else when they come to Canberra. I am going to call out a few more. You will like this one, member for Moreton. This is a special one from the member for Moncrieff. On 5 June he sent a letter out to his electorate. I do not know what is the most disturbing thing about this. The opening line reads: 'Access to fast broadband is no longer a want; it is rapidly becoming a need for Gold Coast households and businesses.' It is not already a need? 'It is rapidly becoming a need'? Then there is a typo, but I digress. There are then some claims made. I quote: 'When Labor first announced the NBN in 2007, they said it would cost around $4.7 billion and be completed by 2013. Since then, Labor changed the forecast and said it would cost taxpayers $37 billion. Now we know it's actually going to cost taxpayers around $94 billion.' Where does this come from?


I specifically asked the NBN Co. about this when it appeared before the committee. And remember that these committee proceedings had the same rules as the parliament. I said:


Mr Quigley, I want to go back to your briefing at the start, just to be crystal clear. The NBN costs $37.4 billion. What veracity should then be given to assertions that the NBN cost could in fact be around $90 billion?


Mr Quigley said:


I can only repeat that we are confident of the $37.4 billion figure. 


Then I asked:


Do you know how that $90 billion figure was derived? 


Mr Quigley said:


No.


How on earth can these people get away with making continuous false claims? I will quote some comments from Delimiter about this particular letter:


… other elements of Ciobo's letter are demonstrably inaccurate, delivered without context, or could be considered highly contestable, in that they do not represent mainstream thinking in the telecommunications industry from the consensus of expert opinion.


There is a lot more that I could say about that one. But in the time available I will instead move on to the member for Calare.


The member for Calare claimed a couple of weeks ago that the coalition's national broadband policy would guarantee speeds of at least 25 gigabytes to all Australians by 2016, with Labor's policy to deliver a mere 100 kilobits. Now, 25 gigabytes is a pretty quick download speed. He also claimed that the coalition has guaranteed at least 25 gigs for everybody by 2016.


It gets better. We have the Leader of the Nationals on Insiders with Barrie Cassidy a couple of weeks ago. This is pretty special; it was quite embarrassing to watch; the guy had no idea. He was asked by Barrie Cassidy:


In your speech to the National Council meeting yesterday—


which I presume was the Nats' meeting—


you raised the NBN … you said under the Coalition every country household will have access to high speed broad band with a minimum speed 25 megabits per second, but how much will it cost householders to have access to that?


Mr Truss could not answer. He said:


Well it will be significantly cheaper than the NBN.


Mr Cassidy asked:


The NBN, under the existing arrangements, the access will be free?


Mr Truss answered:


… there will be still charges for … signing up.


Mr Cassidy said:


Yes but we're talking about connection fees to the house.


Mr Truss said:


Our connection fees will be lower.


He was absolutely incapable of answering the question.


The member for Chifley addressed some very important issues concerning asbestos. I too would be very keen to see what was in the documents when Telstra was fully privatised and what due diligence was done. There was the material risk in that everyone knew that many of those pits were built before World War II and would have asbestos lining in them. I do not remember any of the Liberals or the Nationals getting up in parliament at the time—and I followed the debate very closely—and saying, 'In the future, someone is probably going to open those pits and do some work in them. We'd better cover off this risk.' This has been uncontested: a direct result of the sell-off was the number of permanent staff that were made contractors. What was said in those public offer documents, in the sale documents, about the potential risk of having staff who become contractors rather than being directly employed by Telstra? I would be very interested to know these things.


I will end by saying that this continues to be a very popular policy with the Australian people. I know it is popular in my electorate. Firms have moved to my area just to take up the benefit of the NBN, including the Good Egg Studio at Riverstone. The member for Wentworth came to Blacktown and admitted that Blacktown would become a city divided: people who have access to the NBN and those who do not. That is not what we want from the National Broadband Network.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2013-06-18,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (13:12):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the fifth report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Broadband Network. When you look at this report, the thing that is most striking is the contrast between a view of the world as some would wish it to be—including, I note particularly, the chair of the committee, the member for Lyne—and the view of reality. There is quite a disparity between the two. The member for Lyne is an unashamed true believer in the marvels of the National Broadband Network in the present form in which it is being implemented by the Labor government, which he helped bring to power. In his chair's foreword, he said about the National Broadband Network:


It will make a big difference in many lives. It will strengthen our economy. It will promote our cultural identity in a flattening global culture … it will create opportunity and deliver equity for all Australians.


He repeats the claim that it will 'promote Australian culture to the world', 'show respect to sectors like education as our second biggest export market'. The powers of the NBN appear to be almost limitless in the faith of the member for Lyne. He says it will 'play to our strengths by unlocking entrepreneurship as a nation'. He says:


What an opportunity to promote Australia and expand our export economy by getting this build right.


The chair of this committee, the member for Lyne, is a true believer in the capacity of the National Broadband Network to do all of these things.


But I have to say, when I hear these overblown claims about what the NBN will do, my response is: no it won't. At the very highest, you could put the argument as follows. You could argue that the NBN is a necessary but not sufficient condition to achieve these marvellous outcomes—to promote Australia's cultural identity to the world, to unleash entrepreneurship. But to claim that building the NBN will 'deliver equity for all Australians' or will 'unlock entrepreneurship as a nation' is, I would suggest, an example of the kind of dangerously woolly thinking that is causing us to splash away so much money without being careful in our analysis of what we are getting for the money. It may be possible to argue—and it is a contentious proposition—that if you build and deliver an effective national broadband network it will encourage economic activity, it will encourage entrepreneurship. But there is that distinction that was hammered home in first-year philosophy: it may be a necessary but it is certainly not a sufficient condition. It is not enough to argue, as we repeatedly hear from the member for Lyne and other advocates for the NBN in its present form, that the mere construction of this network will lead 1,000 flowers to bloom. That is not true. There is much more that needs to happen. It may be that the NBN will assist in a range of outcomes, but it will not do it by itself. And to suggest, as the rhetoric in the chair's forward suggests, that it is sufficient to achieve these objectives, is misleading and is an indicator of the kind of fuzzy and woolly thinking that sadly has bedevilled far too much political commentary about NBN Co.


So, if the first objection that I have to the particular philosophy that is articulated in those introductory comments is to say that, even if you believe all of these claims, at best the NBN can be a condition towards achieving the outcomes and much more needs to happen, then the second—and even more substantial—objection I have is this: before any of these wonderful claimed outcomes can be expected, you need to get the thing built, and you need to get it done quickly, cost-effectively and efficiently. And if there is one thing that is clear, as we look at the state of progress with the National Broadband Network, when you turn your eye away from the lofty claims about the marvels that this network is going to deliver, and get on to the more prosaic level of what is actually happening now—how much money has been spent, what we are getting for it, whether the rollout is on time and whether the network been well designed—the answer to all those things is: this is a mess.


So the coalition makes no apologies for turning our eyes away from the wafting vision of the sunlit uplands, which the member for Lyne has once again been all too eager to lay before us. We make no apology for turning away and looking at the detail—and the detail is a very, very troubling picture. The proper role of this committee—on behalf of the Parliament of Australia and in turn on behalf of taxpayers who are compulsorily investors in this badly designed and ill conceived project—is to ask: how is it going? How much money is being spent? What is happening with the rollout? What confidence can we have that the project as presently conceived is going to be completed? All of that must necessarily and logically come before turning our minds to the marvels that the credulous member for Lyne appears to believe are just over the horizon.


I am a very strong believer in broadband. I am a very strong believer in the economic and social benefits of broadband. I have worked in the telecommunications sector, both in government and in the private sector, for many, many years. In fact, I am so interested in broadband that I wrote a book about it—and what a festival of pointy headedness that was, if I may say! But I would make the point that it is simply not good enough to have these wafting generalities in the report that we have before us. We need to get into the detail on behalf of the parliament and on behalf of the Australian people to ask the detailed question, how is the rollout going? And when we turn to that question, the answer is unambiguous. The rollout is going very, very badly. Let us start by looking at some of the numbers. By 30 June 2013, according to NBN Co.'s first corporate plan released in December 2010, this network was supposed to pass 1.3 million premises. In fact, on the most recent numbers, as at May this year—so there is only a month to go—it had passed around 103,000 premises. We also see that the estimates of usage of the network are well behind what is forecast and we also see, extremely troublingly, that the build of the fixed wireless network is running into difficulty and is behind schedule and at the same time we see that NBN Co. continues to burn through cash and spend lavishly on headcount.


Let me make this particular comment, coming as I do from a background in the telecommunications sector for many years. It is an open and notorious joke within the telecommunications sector that people are leaving existing telcos, particularly Telstra and Optus, and have been doing so for several years to go to roles at NBN Co. where they are paid very substantially in excess of what they were previously paid by their previous private sector employer. There is no question that NBN Co. is spending in a profligate fashion and is spending on staff and on other things in a way that no private sector telco would do. 


At the same time, the rollout is scandalously behind schedule and the performance which has been delivered is absolutely hopeless if you compare it to any benchmarks of what has been done. I cite, for example, the rollout within one year of the 3G network, the Next G network, under Sol Trujillo at Telstra. I have been critical of Sol Trujillo on many occasions, but Telstra's delivery of the Next G network within a very short period of time was an impressive engineering achievement. Or you could look at the rate at which both Telstra and Optus rolled out their HFC networks, their hybrid fibre-coaxial networks, across many cities of Australia during the mid-90s. If you look at the rate at which those networks were rolled out and you compare it to what has been achieved by NBN Co., it is chalk and cheese. Or you could look across the Tasman and you could have a look at what is being done in New Zealand. By December 2012, the Kiwis, with their fibre rollout, had passed 134,000 homes. Bear in mind that at that time NBN Co. in Australia had passed 72,400. The two rollouts began at roughly the same time. Australia is a country five times as large. If we had matched the performance of New Zealand, we would have been at several hundred thousand by December last year.


Wherever you go, if you look at the private sector and its history of rollouts, both fixed and mobile in Australia, and if you look across the Tasman at an analogous rollout of a fibre broadband network, you see that NBN Co. is doing a very poor job against those benchmarks. Indeed, if you are looking for tangible evidence that the rollout is well behind where it was expected to be, you could look at the fact that funding in the budget in 2014 was reduced by $3.5 billion compared to what had originally been proposed as recently as the October Midyear Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Why is that? It was not a conscious cost reduction strategy or fiscal discipline by the Treasurer, because that is not the kind of Treasurer that we have. It is because the rollout is running well behind time. Those budget cuts are a consequence of a delay in the rollout. 


So when we look at the very basis, the very centre of what this committee should be focused on, on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia, in having oversight of this rollout and determining whether taxpayers' money is being spent well, whether the project is being managed efficiently and cost effectively, there is no conclusion which can be reached other than that there are very serious red flashing lights here. This rollout is in a mess and it is in a mess, unsurprisingly, because we have a government which is absolutely atrocious at implementation. We have seen that with school halls, we have seen that with the home insulation program and we are seeing it as well with the National Broadband Network. I mentioned the fact that the fixed wireless rollout is a long way behind schedule. According to the Australian Financial Review, even in the best case scenario by the end of June the wireless network will cover just 31,291 premises, which is only 45 per cent of the target of 70,000 that the fixed wireless network was supposed to reach.


I come now to a question I have touched on already and will deal with in a bit more detail: the question of the NBN's management of human resources. There is no more important task in running a company than in managing your human resources efficiently. That means getting the right people in to do the job. It means paying them what  you need to attract them, but no more—I have already talked about the extent to which NBN Co. has paid well in excess of market levels. It also means maintaining a capable team in place rather than churning through executives, senior management and directors on a regular basis. Unfortunately, from NBN Co. we have seen a very substantial amount of churn amongst senior management and indeed amongst directors.


We are also seeing a very rapidly growing head count for NBN Co. As at the end of February there were 2,477 employees. That is an increase of nearly 50 per cent on staff numbers in June 2012. So this company is continuing to grow without restraint. It is continuing to add people even though the rollout, the core job it is there to do, is running very badly behind plan. This is a very significant contributor to the overall cost of this project, a cost that taxpayers are funding. It is another indicator of the way in which basic financial disciplines that you would see in a similar private sector investment project have been troublingly absent.


On the question of churn of employees, since October 2009 some 14 senior executives and 55 executive level employees have left the company. There does appear to be significant evidence of unusually high levels of churn amongst the senior management team and amongst directors.


I will close by referring to one other point that is touched on in this report, which is the meandering discussion about whether more private equity should be sought for NBN Co. This is something of an interest of the chair. It is a ridiculous interest that makes no sense, because the legislation says that you cannot have private sector equity until the build is finished, and five years later. The chair voted for that legislation, so he should know that.


Debate adjourned.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-06-18,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (13:28):  These bills seek to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to implement a range of new fees in relation to registered and prospective Commonwealth registered celebrants under the Marriage Celebrants Program. Previously, Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants were not required to pay a fee to be authorised under the Marriage Celebrants Program.


The bills also makes some minor amendments that relate to the administration of that program. The bills seek to implement an annual celebrant registration fee to existing Commonwealth registered celebrants and also registration fees for prospective celebrants who are seeking registration. The bills will also allow for the imposition of an application processing fee for those seeking an exemption from any of the abovementioned fees.


Amendments in relation to the administration of the program seek to allow an Australian passport to be used as evidence to determine the date and place of birth of marrying parties. The requirement for the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to conduct performance reviews on all marriage celebrants every five years will be removed.


According to the Attorney-General's Department there are currently 10,500 Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants administered by the program in Australia, with an additional 500 being registered each year. Civil ceremonies now account for 71 per cent of all marriage ceremonies conducted in Australia—a substantial increase from two per cent when the program was first established in the early 1970s. 


I believe it is worth noting that the industry has considerable concerns about these bills as they are proposed by the government. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is inquiring into these bills, received 113 submissions—largely from marriage celebrants themselves—and it is fair to say that marriage celebrants are not in favour of most of the recommendations within this bill, particularly the additional impost of fees.


The government contends that it is necessary to implement the new fees to recover the costs of administering the large number of celebrants under the program. The other amendments relating to the administration of the program are considered to be noncontroversial.


On 21 March 2013, the Senate jointly referred both of these bills for inquiry and report. However, the Senate report is not due until 5.00 pm today. The coalition is very keen to see what recommendations the Senate committee might make in relation to these bills. Of course, depending on what the committee recommends, we reserve our right to have a look at amending this bill in the Senate, although we do not oppose its passage through the House today.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2013-06-18,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (13:35):  I rise to speak on the Marriage Celebrant Administration Charge Bill 2013 and the Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2013. These bills seeks to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to implement a range of new fees in relation to registered and prospective Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants under the marriage celebrants program, which is managed through the Attorney-General's Department. The bills will also allow for the imposition of an application registration fee for those seeking an exemption from any of the above mentioned fees.


There are also amendments in relation to the administration of the program that seek to allow an Australian passport to be used as evidence to determine the date and place of birth of marrying parties. Furthermore, the requirement for the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to conduct performance reviews on all marriage celebrants every five years will be removed.


Currently, there are three categories of people under the Marriage Act who are authorised to solemnise marriages in Australia. The first category includes ministers of a religion of a recognised denomination under section 26 of the act. These minister are nominated by their denomination—for example, by the Catholic or Anglican churches—and are registered and regulated by state and territory registrars of births, deaths and marriages. In total, there are approximately 24,500 people in this category.


The second category includes officers in states and territories authorised to perform marriages as a part of their functions in registering marriages, of which there are approximately 730 in Australia. Again, they are regulated by state or territory registrars of births, deaths and marriages. The third category, which this bill addresses, are Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants registered by the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants in the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. This includes approximately 10,500 people who are civil celebrants or who are ministers of a religion whose denomination is not proclaimed under section 26 of the act.


Currently, Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants are not required to pay a fee to be authorised under the marriage celebrants program. Under these changes, the fee will be set at a maximum of $600 in 2013-14, with an application processing fee of $30 for those seeking an exemption from the annual celebrant registration charge, the registration application fee or the annual ongoing professional development obligations.


The impetus to commence charging registration and administration fees is recognition of the changing nature of marriage ceremonies and therefore which category of marriage celebrant solemnises marriages. When the program was established in the early 1970s, approximately two per cent of marriage ceremonies were civil ceremonies. Today, that figure stands at approximately 71 per cent for all marriage ceremonies. Significant attempts at reforms have been made since 2001 to, according to the Attorney-General's Department, improve the transparency of the appointment process and improve the overall quality of the services provided to the public. Ultimately, from 2003 to 2012, the number of Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants grew from 3,632 at the end of 2003 to 10,467 at the end of 2012.


The government announced in 2011 that it would introduce cost recovery for this program and would implement this from 1 July 2013. I find it curious that the government has waited this long to introduce the bill and that we are debating it today, considering that, although the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is due to report on this bill today, 18 June, at this specific point in time the report has not been released. One of my constituents has reiterated to me her concerns about the imposition of a fee on marriage celebrants. Broadly speaking, it is important to consider the nature of the work that marriage celebrants do and the effort that goes into conducting it. As my constituent has noted, celebrants have a lot of expenses to get work. They need to advertise to the general community via the Yellow Pages, websites, social media, bridal magazines and other publications. Some attend wedding expos and other promotional events. There is a lot of expense in advertising each year, as well as insurance, peak body subscription fees to keep up to date and travel and publishing expenses. There is a fairly expensive course to become a celebrant, and then, often, some years waiting to be registered. Therefore, it is extremely important to consider that a celebrant needs to perform quite a lot of weddings each year just to break even.


Given these upfront costs, the feedback that I have been receiving is in favour of the department implementing a fee per wedding. I understand that civil celebrants see the costs in terms of keeping up with new legislation and professional development as reasonable, but civil celebrants feel it is a step too far to then impose further fees on someone who may not be using the services of the department. To quote from my constituents specifically: 'Why would a celebrant doing, for example, 50 weddings a year pay the same annual fee as a celebrant starting out or working part-time doing just a couple of weddings a year?' 'I am happy to pay to attend an annual all-day professional development session, so I am already getting that information at my cost.' Civil celebrants are already paying to maintain their professional standards and therefore want to know exactly what they will be paying the federal department for with a proposed new annual fee.


To their credit the government implemented a consultation process in 2011 on those proposed measures. I have noted some of the concerns of one such constituent who was closely involved in these deliberations. The Attorney-General's Department organised a consultation meeting in Brisbane in November 2011 which I understand was well attended by marriage celebrants. Many issues were raised regarding the imposition of an administration fee on those who act as marriage celebrants on a part-time basis. Those people were very much against the idea. Of course, it must be noted that well-established and full-time marriage celebrants would receive an advantage if there is, in fact, a decrease in the supply of marriage celebrants with perhaps hundreds or thousands dropping out of the program. The most recent anecdotal evidence I have heard is that imposing a fee may make it prohibitively expensive to continue to be involved and many may drop out of the marriage celebrant program.


As I mentioned, to be a Commonwealth registered marriage celebrant one must first complete compulsory training courses, specifically a Certificate IV level qualification, which can be quite costly. A registration fee will be yet another cost to becoming a marriage celebrant. It is worthy to note, however, that for many who are working part-time or are considering starting out the imposition of a fee means that their participation in the marriage celebrant program will simply not be feasible. What I want to see and what the Senate committee should address is that the department needs to fully account for the costs involved in administering the program and, therefore, as part of the formal cost-recovery policy, it should be honest and upfront about how the fees will be used to cover those costs.


I do note that the Attorney-General's Department have said in their submission that these fees will enable the department to improve the services delivered to marriage celebrants while also effectively regulating the celebrants. This does beg the question, of course, of whether the department considers the services they currently deliver to be adequate for the program. The department should identify how they will improve services and, indeed, which services they consider need improving. They also need to consider that if Commonwealth marriage celebrants do, in fact, drop out of the program, what affect will this have on the cost of administering the program. If costs are reduced, is it likely that the department will consider reducing the fees and charges? I do not hear of many examples where a government department actually genuinely cuts the fees it charges even if the associated costs are reduced.


There do remain genuine concerns and questions which still need to be addressed. I will therefore wait to see the report of the Senate committee due on 18 June, today, and the recommendations therein.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:05):  I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2013 and the Marriage (Celebrant Registration Charge) Bill 2013. These bills seek to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to implement a range of new fees in relation to registered and prospective Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants under the Marriage Celebrants Program. Previously, Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants were not required to pay a fee to be authorised under the Marriage Celebrants Program.


The bills also make minor amendments relating to the administration of the program and seek to implement an annual celebrant registration fee to the existing Commonwealth registered celebrants and a registration fee for prospective celebrants seeking registration. The bills will also allow for the imposition of an application processing fee for those seeking an exemption from any of the abovementioned fees. The amendments in relation to the administration of the program seek to allow an Australian passport to be used as evidence to determine the date and place of birth of marrying parties. The requirement for the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to conduct performance reviews on all marriage celebrants every five years will be removed.


According to the Attorney-General's Department there are currently 10,500 Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants administered by the program in Australia and an additional 500 are registered each year. Civil ceremonies now account for 71 per cent of all marriage ceremonies conducted in Australia, a substantial increase from the two per cent when the program was first established, in 1970.


It is worth noting industry concerns about these bills that are being proposed by the government. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee received 113 submissions, largely from marriage celebrants, on their inquiry into the bills. In their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, Marriage Celebrants Australia Inc. said:


In our common commitment to professional and high quality marriage celebrants, both civil and independent religious celebrants, we urge consideration be given to the following points.


1. As 70% of the Australian public are now choosing a civil marriage ceremony, they are being made to pay extra to cover the cost of the planned registration fee. The other 30%, using religious celebrants, will not have this fee imposed upon them. This Government has supported anti-discrimination in law, and yet is supporting this blatant discrimination.


That is, discrimination against marriage celebrants. They continue:


2. MCA (Inc) supports a substantial fee to new applicants for registration as marriage celebrants. The Attorney General's Department (Marriage Law and Celebrant Section) has told us repeatedly that the processing of applicants is extremely time consuming.


Why should established celebrants have to pay for this? It is of no advantage to have more appointments made when the current average of seven weddings per year per celebrant, providing an average gross income of $3,500 per year, is already stretching our budgets. Indeed, in some regional areas marriage celebrants probably perform fewer than that. They probably perform an average of about two marriages a year. Quite often when I attend ceremonies many of these marriage celebrants also sometimes take the role of religious celebrants in conducting religious services. So it is absolutely crazy that the government now contends that it is necessary to implement the new fees to cover the cost of administering the large number of celebrants under the program. The other amendments relating to the administration of the program are considered noncontroversial.


On 21 March 2013 the Senate jointly referred the Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2013 and the Marriage (Celebrant Registration Charge) Bill 2013 for inquiry and remote. I believe the Senate committee is due to report very soon—I believe it is today. The coalition is very keen to see the recommendations made by this committee and reserves the right to potentially move amendments in the Senate pending the committee's report. On that basis, the coalition does not oppose the passage of these bills through the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair—Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (16:10):  I thank members for their contribution to the debate. I want all those listening to the deliberations or reading the Hansard transcript o note that the coalition is supporting this legislation—despite the words of the member for Brisbane, she will be voting for this legislation. I would like to thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for its ongoing work to consider these bills, on which it is scheduled to report later today. The government will, of course, consider any recommendation arising from the committee report.


The bills implement a 2011 budget decision to introduce cost recovery for Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants in Australia. The introduction of cost recovery will allow the Attorney-General's Department to improve the level and range of services to Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants. These changes will provide celebrants with access to support and guidance in carrying out their duties, which will in turn improve services to marrying couples. The amendments will allow the Attorney-General's Department to provide stronger regulatory and information services to existing and aspiring Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants.


Subject to the passage of this legislation, from 1 July 2013 there will be a $600 registration application fee for a prospective celebrant seeking registration, a $240 annual celebrant registration charge imposed on all Commonwealth registered celebrants and a $30 application processing fee for seeking an exemption from the annual celebrant registration charge, the registration application fee or annual ongoing professional development obligations.


The celebrant administration and fees bill makes some minor administrative amendments to enhance the operation of the program. This includes the introduction of an Australian passport as an additional identity document that a celebrant may use to establish a marrying party's place and date of birth. This has received significant report from the celebrant community. I acknowledge there are a range of views on these reforms within the celebrant profession, a point I noted in my own electorate of Blair when I met with local celebrants. A dramatic expansion in the number of celebrants has taken place since 2003. This is the result of the former Howard coalition government relaxing the cap on celebrant numbers and, thereby, putting financial pressure on many excellent celebrants practising today.


The member for Ryan raised the issue of ensuring transparency in the development of cost recovery. The Attorney-General's Department has provided a cost recovery impact statement as part of its submission to the Senate inquiry into the bills. This sets out in detail the costs that are to be recovered and the department's activities in administering the program. In accordance with the longstanding cost recovery principles, the government will review regularly the operation of these fees to demonstrate they are recovering only the cost of administering the Marriage Celebrants Program. I note that the amount set for the fees and charges will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance.


The member for Ryan noted the extensive consultation the government undertook in the lead-up to the introduction of these bills. These consultations have provided useful input into what services and support celebrants wanted from the department. In response to this consultation, the government will strengthen the application process for prospective celebrants as well as developing new ways of engaging with celebrants online and by telephone and undertaking more targeted monitoring of performance. While no-one wants to pay a new fee, celebrants can take heart in the knowledge that this change will bring immediate and longer term benefits to the profession. It is relevant that this is not something that has come about without warning; there has been extensive consultation around the country since the measure was announced in 2011. Ultimately this package of reforms will ensure that marrying couples are legally and validly married through a professional and caring service, as they should rightly expect on their wedding day.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (13:28):  These bills seek to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to implement a range of new fees in relation to registered and prospective Commonwealth registered celebrants under the Marriage Celebrants Program. Previously, Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants were not required to pay a fee to be authorised under the Marriage Celebrants Program.


The bills also makes some minor amendments that relate to the administration of that program. The bills seek to implement an annual celebrant registration fee to existing Commonwealth registered celebrants and also registration fees for prospective celebrants who are seeking registration. The bills will also allow for the imposition of an application processing fee for those seeking an exemption from any of the abovementioned fees.


Amendments in relation to the administration of the program seek to allow an Australian passport to be used as evidence to determine the date and place of birth of marrying parties. The requirement for the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to conduct performance reviews on all marriage celebrants every five years will be removed.


According to the Attorney-General's Department there are currently 10,500 Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants administered by the program in Australia, with an additional 500 being registered each year. Civil ceremonies now account for 71 per cent of all marriage ceremonies conducted in Australia—a substantial increase from two per cent when the program was first established in the early 1970s. 


I believe it is worth noting that the industry has considerable concerns about these bills as they are proposed by the government. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is inquiring into these bills, received 113 submissions—largely from marriage celebrants themselves—and it is fair to say that marriage celebrants are not in favour of most of the recommendations within this bill, particularly the additional impost of fees.


The government contends that it is necessary to implement the new fees to recover the costs of administering the large number of celebrants under the program. The other amendments relating to the administration of the program are considered to be noncontroversial.


On 21 March 2013, the Senate jointly referred both of these bills for inquiry and report. However, the Senate report is not due until 5.00 pm today. The coalition is very keen to see what recommendations the Senate committee might make in relation to these bills. Of course, depending on what the committee recommends, we reserve our right to have a look at amending this bill in the Senate, although we do not oppose its passage through the House today.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (13:35):  I rise to speak on the Marriage Celebrant Administration Charge Bill 2013 and the Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2013. These bills seeks to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to implement a range of new fees in relation to registered and prospective Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants under the marriage celebrants program, which is managed through the Attorney-General's Department. The bills will also allow for the imposition of an application registration fee for those seeking an exemption from any of the above mentioned fees.


There are also amendments in relation to the administration of the program that seek to allow an Australian passport to be used as evidence to determine the date and place of birth of marrying parties. Furthermore, the requirement for the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to conduct performance reviews on all marriage celebrants every five years will be removed.


Currently, there are three categories of people under the Marriage Act who are authorised to solemnise marriages in Australia. The first category includes ministers of a religion of a recognised denomination under section 26 of the act. These minister are nominated by their denomination—for example, by the Catholic or Anglican churches—and are registered and regulated by state and territory registrars of births, deaths and marriages. In total, there are approximately 24,500 people in this category.


The second category includes officers in states and territories authorised to perform marriages as a part of their functions in registering marriages, of which there are approximately 730 in Australia. Again, they are regulated by state or territory registrars of births, deaths and marriages. The third category, which this bill addresses, are Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants registered by the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants in the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. This includes approximately 10,500 people who are civil celebrants or who are ministers of a religion whose denomination is not proclaimed under section 26 of the act.


Currently, Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants are not required to pay a fee to be authorised under the marriage celebrants program. Under these changes, the fee will be set at a maximum of $600 in 2013-14, with an application processing fee of $30 for those seeking an exemption from the annual celebrant registration charge, the registration application fee or the annual ongoing professional development obligations.


The impetus to commence charging registration and administration fees is recognition of the changing nature of marriage ceremonies and therefore which category of marriage celebrant solemnises marriages. When the program was established in the early 1970s, approximately two per cent of marriage ceremonies were civil ceremonies. Today, that figure stands at approximately 71 per cent for all marriage ceremonies. Significant attempts at reforms have been made since 2001 to, according to the Attorney-General's Department, improve the transparency of the appointment process and improve the overall quality of the services provided to the public. Ultimately, from 2003 to 2012, the number of Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants grew from 3,632 at the end of 2003 to 10,467 at the end of 2012.


The government announced in 2011 that it would introduce cost recovery for this program and would implement this from 1 July 2013. I find it curious that the government has waited this long to introduce the bill and that we are debating it today, considering that, although the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is due to report on this bill today, 18 June, at this specific point in time the report has not been released. One of my constituents has reiterated to me her concerns about the imposition of a fee on marriage celebrants. Broadly speaking, it is important to consider the nature of the work that marriage celebrants do and the effort that goes into conducting it. As my constituent has noted, celebrants have a lot of expenses to get work. They need to advertise to the general community via the Yellow Pages, websites, social media, bridal magazines and other publications. Some attend wedding expos and other promotional events. There is a lot of expense in advertising each year, as well as insurance, peak body subscription fees to keep up to date and travel and publishing expenses. There is a fairly expensive course to become a celebrant, and then, often, some years waiting to be registered. Therefore, it is extremely important to consider that a celebrant needs to perform quite a lot of weddings each year just to break even.


Given these upfront costs, the feedback that I have been receiving is in favour of the department implementing a fee per wedding. I understand that civil celebrants see the costs in terms of keeping up with new legislation and professional development as reasonable, but civil celebrants feel it is a step too far to then impose further fees on someone who may not be using the services of the department. To quote from my constituents specifically: 'Why would a celebrant doing, for example, 50 weddings a year pay the same annual fee as a celebrant starting out or working part-time doing just a couple of weddings a year?' 'I am happy to pay to attend an annual all-day professional development session, so I am already getting that information at my cost.' Civil celebrants are already paying to maintain their professional standards and therefore want to know exactly what they will be paying the federal department for with a proposed new annual fee.


To their credit the government implemented a consultation process in 2011 on those proposed measures. I have noted some of the concerns of one such constituent who was closely involved in these deliberations. The Attorney-General's Department organised a consultation meeting in Brisbane in November 2011 which I understand was well attended by marriage celebrants. Many issues were raised regarding the imposition of an administration fee on those who act as marriage celebrants on a part-time basis. Those people were very much against the idea. Of course, it must be noted that well-established and full-time marriage celebrants would receive an advantage if there is, in fact, a decrease in the supply of marriage celebrants with perhaps hundreds or thousands dropping out of the program. The most recent anecdotal evidence I have heard is that imposing a fee may make it prohibitively expensive to continue to be involved and many may drop out of the marriage celebrant program.


As I mentioned, to be a Commonwealth registered marriage celebrant one must first complete compulsory training courses, specifically a Certificate IV level qualification, which can be quite costly. A registration fee will be yet another cost to becoming a marriage celebrant. It is worthy to note, however, that for many who are working part-time or are considering starting out the imposition of a fee means that their participation in the marriage celebrant program will simply not be feasible. What I want to see and what the Senate committee should address is that the department needs to fully account for the costs involved in administering the program and, therefore, as part of the formal cost-recovery policy, it should be honest and upfront about how the fees will be used to cover those costs.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (16:24):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this afternoon and comment on the report Bridging the dental gap: report on the inquiry into adult dental services. There is a list of recommendations and information in this report that I do not need to go into. But I would like to comment on some of the things that came out of this report upon the investigation of the committee; in a nutshell, it would probably be the need for cooperation between the federal government and the state governments and private providers to make sure that we have a network of dental services as far across the nation as we can and that we also get the services to where they are needed.


I was very pleased that the committee came to my electorate. Actually, the only hearing that this inquiry held outside Canberra was in Dubbo. What was interesting about our day in Dubbo was that we actually saw some of the issues whereby people are suffering from lack of dental services. We heard great evidence from the Aboriginal Medical Service at Walgett. We heard from the prosthodontist Peter Muller. Peter is very passionate about serving the people of New South Wales. He spoke about the changes since the cessation of the chronic disease scheme and how that has impacted on his clients. He also spoke of his frustration in terms of being able to service those clients as well as he might, and the difficulties that these clients have in funding the treatments. Many of the people he deals with are in a bad way with their general health because of their lack of suitable dentures with which to eat.


The other thing that was of interest to the committee when it came to Dubbo was the work of the Flying Doctor. Their plane, which is affectionately known in the west as the 'tooth fairy', is now delivering dental services right across western New South Wales. It has been a major step forward for the people of the west to have those services delivered, and there is a need for ongoing funding for that service. But probably the highlight of the day was seeing the work Charles Sturt University is doing in its School of Dentistry and Health Services at the Dubbo campus. We were able to see students and dentists working side by side delivering services to members of the community while these students were actually undertaking their training. It is a magnificent facility. It was funded in the last days of the Howard government and constructed in the early days of the Rudd government. Those young dentists are trained in the bush and have a good experience there. They probably have a superior training opportunity because of the ratios of staff to students and the fact that they will probably stay in that area. There is also a private clinic operating from the same facility.


So I do endorse this report. There is a lot of information in there about the relationship between the state and the federal government. This report also touches on the need to elevate the status and responsibility of dental hygienists and raises the possibility of a trial for Medicare provider numbers for hygienists. Certainly I would not like to see, as a stopgap measure, hygienists and dental nurses replacing dentists in country areas. I think that people in the country are entitled to the same level of service as everyone else, but I think that there is an argument to be had for some funding for hygienists to work throughout the school network in a preventative way. There is certainly a lot of scope to improve that.


I thoroughly recommend this report, and I acknowledge the work of the secretariat. This was possibly one of the fastest reports that I think the health and ageing committee has ever undertaken and printed, and hopefully the minister and subsequent ministers in following governments can use this and look at implementing a program that will fill in the gaps and ensure that people right across the country do get the adequate services that they need.

I think that was a credit to the secretariat, who always do a wonderful job on the health and ageing committee, and to the members, because of the mindset that they had towards delivering a report that is unanimous and is one that we can all get behind and argue from different perspectives in relation to it.


The day in Dubbo when we took evidence was really special. It is very important that members get out into rural and regional areas. I come from a regional area, but it is a regional metropolitan area. In that area, yes, there are challenges in relation to dental. There are real challenges, but they are nowhere near the challenges faced by the people in Dubbo, and they are nowhere near the challenges faced by people who live even further out in rural and remote areas. The needs that they face and their inability to access services when they need them are very great. The committee recognised the fact that in an area like mine there is a shortage of dentists, but with the introduction of the national partnership agreement on dental I have found that there has been a massive reduction in the number of people who are waiting to access dental treatment. But in the member for Parkes' electorate you do not have that same turnaround because he does not have the dentists or the dental professionals to deal with the problems that people experience with their teeth. That remoteness and the rural and regional aspect of it really does impact on a person's ability to utilise services.


In Dubbo, I found it really refreshing to see the approach of all the people who gave evidence to the committee. They had one mindset. You could see that they were a team and you could see that they worked together on issues. We had the Flying Doctor, we had the Aboriginal Medical Service, we had the hygienists and the dental prosthesis and Charles Sturt University—a fantastic facility. What it has delivered to the community is a credit to the Howard government and to the current government. A thing that is really special about it is that you have Charles Sturt University working alongside the Western New South Wales Local Health District. You have dentists who are funded one way, through the university, working on one side, and dentists who are funded through the health system working on the other side of the facility. But they are sharing their expertise. They all go out to those rural and remote areas, and they are prepared to give their support to their communities, so there is a real sense of community. It is not the same level of services that are available in a city, but they certainly have a total commitment to the people that they are servicing. The Royal Flying Doctor Service shared with us their perspective of how they will go out and help people and, once again, gave that other aspect of what it is like to live in a rural and remote area.


The member for Parkes said that, for him, the thing that came across, the thing he got the strongest message about, was the need for state, Commonwealth and private dental services to work together. It is always a problem with the states and the Commonwealth. There is always that tension that exists between the levels of government, and there are always issues around the interface between government and the private sector. I think that is a very important issue, but for me the most important issue is the lack of consistency. In 1996, there was the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. The Howard government did not continue it. Then there was the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, and this government did not continue that. Now there is the national partnership agreement which, as I mentioned, has already made a big dint in the waiting lists in my area.


It is important that people in Australia have certainty that there is going to be a continuation of dental services, that it is not going to constantly change and that, if they are eligible for assistance under a particular scheme, that that eligibility will continue. From my perspective, I felt that the chronic dental health disease program was poorly targeted, but members on the other side of the parliament did not agree with that. Even given that, we were able to work around it and come out with the recommendations that we have here before us today.


It is fair to say—isn't it, Member for Hasluck?—that we all felt that there was a lack of consistency in the way dental services had been delivered over the years. We all acknowledge that the Commonwealth does have a responsibility for it. I feel that our underlying feeling was that we would love to see a health system in which dental care was covered by a similar scheme to Medicare, where, if you had problems in your mouth and you were really ill, you could go and have that treated, without it being treated as a secondary, non-important type of illness. It is oral disease. Anyone who has had an abscess or a really chronic dental problem will know that there is nothing more painful or more debilitating than having a problem in in your mouth. In fact, I had a constituent come to see me who ended up in intensive care in the public hospital system because he had had an abscess on his tooth. That abscess had infected his whole system. That was a massive cost to our health system, because he was fighting for his life for a couple of weeks. It was only through the fantastic medical care that you can get in this country that he was able to get over that illness.


There are a lot of new programs that are starting up. There is the Grow Up Smiling campaign that will be good for young children. When I was younger—and I suspect you will remember, Deputy Speaker, and member for Hasluck, and maybe all of us in this room—there was a Commonwealth dental scheme where the dentists came around to the school and looked at our teeth.



An honourable member:  All of those pink tablets.




Ms HALL:
  Pink tablets. I lived in the country where they did not even give us pink tablets. We did not have fluoride. We did not have any of those scientifically advanced procedures. That program in place, and then it was removed, and we have had various other programs, such as the Teen Dental Health program which I do not think has had the take-up that other programs have had.


Overall, we need to have a continuous approach to dental care. We need to recognise that dental care is important, and we need to recognise how important it is to access dental care. Also, the national partnership agreement is an excellent scheme for people that have health care cards. They are the people that really need to access dental health through the public system. They are the people that are on the dental health waiting list. They are the people that will be assisted by the national partnership agreement. There is an interim agreement in place now, and the full agreement starts in 2014.


There is a group of people that are on incomes just above the health care card level, where it is very hard for them to afford the dental treatment that they need. This is a very complex issue, and it is an issue that, as a nation, I do not think we have dealt with well. I think it is time for governments of all persuasions to recognise that our dental health is important and that our dental health influences our overall health. It will not be the current government that responds to this report. It will be the next government, whatever political persuasion it is, that gets to respond to it. I hope that they take into account very seriously the need for consistency and recognise that dental health is very important.

Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (16:43):  I am reminded of my growing up, which was in the fifties. We did not have reticulated water; I remember we had tank water. Amongst the people in my neighbourhood there were lots of false teeth and teeth that were not too good.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr LYONS:
  Yes, my front ones are gone, but they were knocked out playing footy. The interesting thing is that we do have, on the whole, much better teeth now than we used to have. I know that our society is better, we are a healthy people, and we actually live longer. Part of the reason is that we have much better teeth as a result of fluoride. I notice that the Queensland government have dropped the requirement to have fluoride in reticulated water, which is to the detriment of the people of Queensland, and I hope they rectify that.


I rise to add my remarks to the report, Bridging the dental gap, of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. In this inquiry the committee considered: demand for dental services across Australia and issues associated with waiting lists; the mix and coverage of dental services supported by state and territory governments, and the Australian Government; availability and affordability of dental services for people with special dental health needs; availability and affordability of dental services for people living in metropolitan, regional, rural and remote locations; the coordination of dental services between the two tiers of government and with privately funded dental services; and workforce issues relevant to the provision of dental services.


Improving dental health will help relieve the pressure on hospitals. I know this from my personal experience through being in the health system in Tasmania for 20-odd years. A number of cases came along that had to get taken into theatre for what were, in fact, dental problems. It does show that we are not on top of this issue. As I said, improving dental health will help relieve the pressure on hospitals and broader health systems, which is why this inquiry is so important. We know that one in five of our lowest income earners have not been to the dentist for over five years, if ever. This is a serious concern. Poor dental health has wide-ranging impacts on speech, sleep and eating.


The committee heard from a number of parties who stated that there are many groups of people in Australia who are struggling to receive adequate dental care. This can lead to a range of poor dental health outcomes which often result in patients requiring more extensive medical treatment. This includes low-income earners, the elderly, people living with a disability, those living in regional and rural areas of Australia, and homeless and Indigenous Australians. Because low-income earners are less likely to receive preventative care they are more likely to have extensive treatment, for example, tooth extraction rather than fillings. The reasons for the increased risk of oral disease in these populations are complex, but are generally associated with poor visiting patterns to dental and oral health services. For some, this may be indicative of poor availability of dental services outside metropolitan centres thus making access difficult. For others, a significant barrier may be the cost of accessing services.


The committee heard evidence that public dental waiting lists also represent a barrier to care, with eligible patients often unable to afford access to local services and unable to access services elsewhere. Treatments through the public health system usually focus on providing emergency treatments rather than preventative or restorative services. Even so, the demand for limited public dental services is such that there are significant waiting lists in all states and territories with the average waiting time of 27 months. For adults who are not eligible for access to public dental services, treatment is only available through the private system.


The Australian government understands the importance of timely access to affordable, high-quality, oral health care for all Australians, and in particular for low-income earners and disadvantaged people. The government knows that many Australians on low incomes miss out on access to dental care, and a number of those missing out are children.


On 29 August 2012, the government announced the landmark $4.1 billion dental reform package. This package will build a fairer dental system. The package includes $2.7 billion for Grow Up Smiling, a children's dental scheme that will start on 1 January 2014; $1.3 billion to states and territories from 1 July 2014 to expand services for adults in the public system; and a $225 million flexible grants program beginning from 2014 to provide dental infrastructure, both capital and workforce, in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas. The government allocated $5.5 million to Tasmania in 2013-14 to cut the public dental waiting lists, which will make a real difference for Tasmanians and people with dental concerns.


The committee heard that a highly skilled health workforce is critical to the backbone of the health system. Projects such as the construction of a new purpose-built clinical training facility in Launceston with six additional dental chairs is fantastic for Northern Tasmania. Work is currently underway on the $4 million extension to the public dental services in Kelham Street, Launceston, to allow for dental student work placements in our region. This will be a state-of-the-art facility which is vital for Northern Tasmania.


The importance of good dental and oral health to general health and wellbeing is well recognised. There are well established associations between poor dental and oral health and acute or chronic health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. Furthermore, the pain associated with poor dental and oral health, coupled with social anxieties about appearance and the avoidance of certain foods, can impact significantly on the quality of life.


This inquiry has certainly been worth while. I encourage MPs and senators to read the report and the recommendations from this committee. I was particularly impressed by the service provided in the Dubbo area. There was a fantastic service training new doctors and also providing a private clinic, which I think is fantastic. It was my first trip to Dubbo and I was very impressed by the service provided in that area.


In closing, I wish to thank all those who took the time to put in submissions and appear before the committee. I also thank my fellow committee members and, in particular, the secretariat for the valuable work they provided.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2013-06-18,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (16:24):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this afternoon and comment on the report Bridging the dental gap: report on the inquiry into adult dental services. There is a list of recommendations and information in this report that I do not need to go into. But I would like to comment on some of the things that came out of this report upon the investigation of the committee; in a nutshell, it would probably be the need for cooperation between the federal government and the state governments and private providers to make sure that we have a network of dental services as far across the nation as we can and that we also get the services to where they are needed.


I was very pleased that the committee came to my electorate. Actually, the only hearing that this inquiry held outside Canberra was in Dubbo. What was interesting about our day in Dubbo was that we actually saw some of the issues whereby people are suffering from lack of dental services. We heard great evidence from the Aboriginal Medical Service at Walgett. We heard from the prosthodontist Peter Muller. Peter is very passionate about serving the people of New South Wales. He spoke about the changes since the cessation of the chronic disease scheme and how that has impacted on his clients. He also spoke of his frustration in terms of being able to service those clients as well as he might, and the difficulties that these clients have in funding the treatments. Many of the people he deals with are in a bad way with their general health because of their lack of suitable dentures with which to eat.


The other thing that was of interest to the committee when it came to Dubbo was the work of the Flying Doctor. Their plane, which is affectionately known in the west as the 'tooth fairy', is now delivering dental services right across western New South Wales. It has been a major step forward for the people of the west to have those services delivered, and there is a need for ongoing funding for that service. But probably the highlight of the day was seeing the work Charles Sturt University is doing in its School of Dentistry and Health Services at the Dubbo campus. We were able to see students and dentists working side by side delivering services to members of the community while these students were actually undertaking their training. It is a magnificent facility. It was funded in the last days of the Howard government and constructed in the early days of the Rudd government. Those young dentists are trained in the bush and have a good experience there. They probably have a superior training opportunity because of the ratios of staff to students and the fact that they will probably stay in that area. There is also a private clinic operating from the same facility.


So I do endorse this report. There is a lot of information in there about the relationship between the state and the federal government. This report also touches on the need to elevate the status and responsibility of dental hygienists and raises the possibility of a trial for Medicare provider numbers for hygienists. Certainly I would not like to see, as a stopgap measure, hygienists and dental nurses replacing dentists in country areas. I think that people in the country are entitled to the same level of service as everyone else, but I think that there is an argument to be had for some funding for hygienists to work throughout the school network in a preventative way. There is certainly a lot of scope to improve that.


I thoroughly recommend this report, and I acknowledge the work of the secretariat. This was possibly one of the fastest reports that I think the health and ageing committee has ever undertaken and printed, and hopefully the minister and subsequent ministers in following governments can use this and look at implementing a program that will fill in the gaps and ensure that people right across the country do get the adequate services that they need.

 (Shortland) (16:30):  by leave, I wish to address the chamber. Thank you to my colleagues. It is great to see that there are four colleagues from the health and ageing committee here in the chamber tonight. I would like to express my thanks to them for the constructive contributions that they made to this report.
