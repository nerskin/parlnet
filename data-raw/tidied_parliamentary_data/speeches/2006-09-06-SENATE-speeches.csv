"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I rise to speak to the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Bill 2006. The bill sets out a scheme of sanctions on employers and labour suppliers who knowingly or recklessly engage illegal workers. Labor will support this bill as far as it goes, but the provisions of the bill are seven years late and reek of compromise. The Howard government claims to be concerned about people who seek to work illegally in Australia, but I have my doubts about how genuine that concern is. Despite the supposed concern we hear at election time, the government’s own stated current estimate is that there are around 46,000 visa overstayers in Australia on any given day. After 10 long years of Howard government blather about border security, this admission proves our borders are more porous than ever. So much for, ‘We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they are here.’
We all know that hollow rhetoric only applies to a handful of terrified people who occasionally venture here in rickety boats, not the illegal workers who fly here to steal Australian jobs and undermine Australian working conditions each and every day. The Howard government proudly boasts about stopping people who come here by boat, but we all know that the biggest threats to Australia’s border security fly into this country—and they steal jobs. How else would these visa overstayers be able to finance their stay unless they were picking up cash work from bosses who turn a blind eye?
The Howard government’s approach to date in dealing with the problem of illegal workers in Australia has been to busy itself, ignoring reports that it has commissioned. The 2000 edition of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs’ report on immigration compliance offers an insight into just how irresponsible the Howard government has been in the vital task of protecting Australia’s borders. Chapter 9 of the report relates to the problems of illegal work in Australia. The report says that, during 1999-2000, 2,519 people were found to be working illegally in Australia by department compliance staff. The report also says:
The Minister launched the report of the Review of Illegal Workers in Australia in December 1999. The recommendations included:
- a system of sanctions for those employers and labour suppliers who recruit or refer for employment people without the right to work in Australia, underpinned by a system of administrative warnings.
Here we have a report that is six years old—before Tampa and all the Howard government’s crocodile tears about deciding ‘who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come’—talking about the review that the minister had launched a year earlier.
Just so we are clear: seven long years ago, the Howard government launched a review that recommended that they introduce a system of sanctions for bosses who employ people who have no right to work in Australia, and they have only now gotten around to bringing the matter before the Senate. Yet the slack clowns have the hide to bang on about how responsible they are with Australia’s border security. The Howard government has not just been slack and incompetent in getting this bill to the Senate; they have managed to make a dog’s breakfast of the bill’s content.
Honourable senators will recall that the report of the review of illegal workers in Australia recommended seven long years ago that the Howard government implement:
a system of sanctions for those employers and labour suppliers who recruit—
and the wording is important: employers ‘who recruit’—
people without the right to work in Australia.
The Howard government was left to fill in the details of the circumstances in which an employer who recruits people without the right to work in Australia will be liable for sanctions and the obligations required of employers to take responsible, reasonable steps to look into the right to work of people they recruit. After seven long years, the Howard government has come up with a bill that proposes that offences will only apply where the employer or labour supplier knew the person was an illegal worker or was reckless to that fact.
That is quite different from the approach that has been taken in other countries. It is a weak and gutless approach. It is an approach that is born of a desire to appease crooks. Countries such as Switzerland and Canada have already introduced measures where the threshold test to prosecute bosses who employ illegal workers is merely acting negligently or failing to exercise due diligence in checking work rights. This is a much lower threshold test to ‘knowingly or recklessly’, the one the Howard government has decided to use in this bill. It does not take a genius to work out that with this bill the Howard government is bending over backwards to make it virtually impossible for dodgy bosses who turn a blind eye to illegal workers in order to lower their wage costs to be actually convicted. That is the way of the Howard government: the velvet glove for dodgy bosses and jackboots for workers.
I invite senators to compare the Howard government’s approach to dealing with workers in past bills with the way they deal with bosses in this bill. The Howard government are only too happy to guillotine debate to ram through legislation to impose $30,000 fines on Australian workers who withdraw their labour for one day, but they take seven long years to get around to legislation imposing $13,000 fines on bosses who recklessly employ illegal workers. The Howard government are all too happy to give the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner outrageously undemocratic powers to pursue workers and their representatives. The Howard government legislated to give the commissioner the power to compel workers and union officials to answer questions in an interrogation without the right to silence or protection from self-incrimination under sufferance of six months imprisonment. Six months jail for refusing to dob on your mates but a slap on the wrist for the crooked practices of dodgy bosses in the horticultural industry, for example. That is a clear indication of this government’s priorities and they should be ashamed. Labor will support the bill as it is a small, albeit flawed, step towards dealing with the problem of illegal work in Australia—even if it has taken the Howard government seven long years to get around to it.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EMPLOYER SANCTIONS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2006-09-06,"—It is certainly a pleasure to follow my colleague Senator Sterle in this debate today and to carry on comments that Senator Sterle was making quite forcefully about the nature of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Bill 2006 and the lack of effort by the federal government until this point now, seven years after it was reviewed. You would have to think that the government is starting to get a little delusional at the moment. I have been trying to look on the web today to see the comments by Mr Hardgrave—and I am not quite sure what ministerial title he holds. I gather that at the moment one of the answers to our skills crisis in Australia is to train Africans in their detention camps, or whatever they are called, in Kenya and to bring them over here. I want to talk about that a little later but I think that it indicates the two difficulties that the Howard government has had before it for some seven years and is still grappling with.
Firstly, we are undoubtedly experiencing a skills crisis and we are undoubtedly—as I will mention shortly—experiencing a crisis with the lack of employment and career opportunities particularly for young people. Secondly, as this legislation puts forward, we are now dealing with the crisis that has been exposed for some time of the exploitation of so-called ‘skilled guest workers’. As my Labor colleagues have said, Labor does support the bill and does support the sanctions contained in the bill for employers who knowingly or recklessly employ or refer for work unlawful noncitizens or noncitizens in breach of visa conditions.
As Senator Sterle articulately outlined, this issue has been before the federal government for seven years and it is only lately that the government has decided to respond to the Review of illegal workers in Australia: improving immigration compliance in the workplace. That report found significant problems with the number of illegal workers in Australia, the subsequent denial of jobs to Australians and the loss of revenue through uncollected tax and falsely claimed social security benefits. This was reported to the Commonwealth government seven years ago, but here we are in September 2006 finally dealing with this issue. We still have not dealt with the issue of the lack of a skilled workforce available amongst Australian citizens.
Under the previous regime that will no longer apply once this bill is carried, the penalties for illegal employment were weighted heavily against the worker. They were liable under section 235 of the Migration Act. However, for the employer there were no relevant primary offences and the fines under both the Migration Act and the Criminal Code did not exceed $10,000.
Under the new provisions in this bill, employers found in breach can face imprisonment of between two and five years for allowing an unlawful noncitizen to work or a noncitizen to work in breach of a visa condition. This bill fixes a discrepancy in the seriousness of the punishment applicable to both employees and employers. It recognises the culpability of employers who allow people to work for them who would otherwise not be permitted to do so under the law. The second message it sends is to unscrupulous employers who seek to profit from cheap, illegal labour: obey the law and cease your exploitation of illegal workers.
There are substantial numbers of visa overstayers in Australia—46,000 as of December 2005—and they are potentially in the workforce and earning money without paying taxes. We on this side call on the government to follow through on these measures with inspections so that employers using illegal labour are suitably identified and punished. There is a justifiable expectation from the Australian community that these employers will be prosecuted. However, this government has a record of indifference towards the exploitation of workers under the Australian visa system.
We saw only this week the case of ABC Tissues, which employed 50 Chinese workers on 457 visas. They were found to be unskilled in the jobs they were brought here to do. They could not read or understand the English safety signs, were unaware of safe work practices and did not have licences to operate the machinery on the site. I hope it does not disturb the government that, if these Chinese workers came from western China, they are more likely to be Muslims! I do not know if that is disturbing enough for the Commonwealth government to get off its bum and get around to doing something.
We are in the grip of a skills crisis, and that is the reason we have to import skilled workers from overseas, despite the exploitation that they are liable to experience, under the 457 visa system. It is expected that some 40,000 457 visas will be granted this year. That number has increased over the last four years by 66 per cent. On the department of immigration website, the description for the 457 visa says:
This visa is for employers who would like to employ overseas workers to fill nominated skilled positions in Australia.
I feel very sorry for those men and women who have been brought to Australia under bodgie schemes, under schemes that have been misleading. We have had plenty of instances of exploitation of such people, particularly of women in the sex industry. In fact, when I was on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, chaired by Bruce Baird, we were involved in an inquiry into just this issue, and we saw there was exploitation of women in particular in this area. But we are still receiving evidence of the exploitation of men and women in relation to these so-called skilled migration schemes and have received some only recently.
I have been advised that there is a Bankstown company that tried to deport a father of two after his fingers were chopped off in its workshop. Workers Online reports:
 … a 46-year-old Korean says the employer refused to call an ambulance after four of his fingers were hacked off at work.
This man said:
… he didn’t believe his employer had workers compensation cover, required by law.
He admitted he was working in Australia illegally, but his predicament has sparked calls from a number of people for rogue employers to face sanctions as set out in this legislation. The man said:
… he lived inside the Bankstown factory where he was required to labour for up to 120 hours a week. He said, for two years, he was paid a flat rate of $10 an hour, with no holidays, sick leave, or super.
As I said earlier, his fingers were chopped off on 19 May this year. This man is desperate.
Only in today’s newspaper we have reports about a Melbourne printing company called Aprint, which hired four Chinese labourers on 457 visas. The Age reports that the company paid them below the minimum wage, did not pay any overtime and made $10,000 of arbitrary deductions from their pay. One man, Jack Zhang, was sacked as soon as the $10,000 was fully deducted from his pay. That was at a rate of $200 a week for 50 weeks. Mr Zhang had a four-year contract. The money was paid to the company’s owner, Dor Tu, who claimed it was for legal fees and travel. This money is on top of the $10,000 Mr Zhang paid in China before he entered Australia. Mr Zhang was also found to have been working 60 hours a week. His weekly pay for ordinary hours was $751.92, which places his hourly rate at around $12.50—below the minimum rate of $12.75. He was also paid a flat rate of $12 an hour for overtime when he should have been paid double time. The AMWU, the union that brought this to the newspaper’s attention, estimates this gentleman was underpaid by about $388 a week compared to the award rate. Mr Zhang must now find another sponsor to hire him or he will have to leave Australia in 28 days.
This is an example of what has been able to occur under the manipulation of the visa scheme. That is why this legislation is welcome. But it is seven years too late for people like the man in the Bankstown factory, people like Mr Zhang or the exploited women in the sex industry throughout Australia. In our country we are seeing Australian workers being denied these work opportunities and appropriate skills training. Why is the government’s solution to the skills crisis to import labour?
This morning, as I said, we heard a suggestion from Mr Hardgrave—I think he is the minister for employment services; I am sure a coalition member will correct me if not, if he or she gets up later. Mr Hardgrave has suggested that the Commonwealth government would build TAFE colleges in Kenya—I think that is correct—for people who are waiting in camps there, and in other places in Africa. I think he only started with Kenya; he might move on, but Kenya is the first place. How ridiculous is that? How ridiculous is it, Madam Acting Deputy President Troeth, for you, a senator who comes from a manufacturing state, Victoria, to stand by and see your coalition colleagues advocate a proposal like that? A Queenslander, I think Mr Hardgrave is; is he a Queenslander? I do not know. He should hang his head in shame. It goes to show just how out of whack Queensland people are when they vote for the coalition.
 (Senator Troeth)—Senator Hutchins, I think you will find that Mr Hardgrave is a Queensland member, the member for Moreton, and he is also the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education.
—Thank you very much, Madam Acting Deputy President. The point I want to make is that, since the coalition has been in power, 300,000 young Australians have been turned away from TAFE colleges. No funding has been made available for that. Three hundred thousand—that is, 30,000 a year—since John Howard has been in power. What is the government’s answer to this debilitating skills crisis? It builds colleges in East Africa or South Africa. I have no problem with that and I do not make a racist comment about it, but it just strikes me as strange that we have the money to build these TAFE colleges in other parts of the world but we deny them to our own people.
Let me go to the government’s record on skills investment. It is, as I said, appalling. Australia is the only advanced economy that has gone backwards on education spending since 1995. Spending has been cut by eight per cent. The average in OECD countries has been to increase education spending by 38 per cent. Ten years of John Howard’s government has had the effect of deskilling this country. By 2010, it has been estimated that Australia will fall short of tradespeople by 100,000. The government makes much of the unemployment rate, but, significantly, there are two million Australians who want to work, or want more work, but cannot get it. What this points to is the skills base failing to correspond to the demands of industry, causing a generation of Australians to sit idle—untrained, unskilled and ignored by the Howard government.
At the last sitting of parliament, I made a contribution concerning the loss of jobs in regional New South Wales. I mentioned the jobs that are being lost at the Central Coast, the central west of New South Wales, Western Sydney and the Illawarra. I mentioned that there are hundreds of jobs being lost. Those people would welcome the opportunity to retrain or reskill, but what is the government’s contribution to them? They are indeed making available to some sections and to some of these men and women an ability to get more redundancy pay. Big deal. That can last for only so long. They would say: ‘Why can’t I work in a job where there is a demand for that skill? Why are you trying to continue to bring people in from overseas? Why are you building TAFE colleges in East Africa when you should be doing it here for Australians?’ The second part about that, as we all know, is that it is meant to put downward pressure on wages. We saw evidence outlined in today’s paper by the Australian metalworkers union. They have outlined exactly how much less a man earned in a week by working under those conditions. We cannot compete with our neighbours. We are a First World country, but without an investment in skills we cannot be competitive.
On Tuesday, in the Sydney Morning Herald, Bob Birrell, the Director of the Centre for Population and Urban Research at Monash University, said:
There are plenty of skilled workers in the Philippines, China, India and elsewhere willing to work for wages and conditions well below the market rate in Australia.
Australian workers are increasingly having the odds stacked against them under the coalition. Work Choices strips away overtime, leave loading and leave entitlements. It exposes workers to instant dismissal without recourse for appeal. To add insult to injury, the coalition are making it easier to import cheap overseas labour that does not even meet the skills criteria in some cases. Those people can enter the workforce for up to four years on a 457 visa, and that places downward pressure on wages.
Australian workers do not want charity; they want a fair go. They want a government that is looking after them. I started my contribution by saying that I think that the government is becoming delusional. If they really think that putting money into TAFE colleges in East Africa is going to go well out there in the electorate, they are becoming delusional. It will be up to people like you, Madam Acting Deputy President Troeth—from Victoria, the primary manufacturing state in this country—to change the direction of this government or they will be out on their bum at the next election.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EMPLOYER SANCTIONS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I rise to make some brief comments about the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Bill 2006. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to introduce new offences for employers, labour suppliers and other persons who allow illegal persons to work. Currently, it is an offence under section 235 of the act for an unlawful noncitizen to do any work in Australia, whether for reward or otherwise, and for a noncitizen who holds a visa that is subject to a work condition to work in Australia in contravention of that condition. While penalties are applicable to persons who work illegally in Australia, there are no mechanisms in the act to penalise persons who allow noncitizens to work in Australia illegally.
The proposed new offences have the objective and are supposed to be the mechanism that the government is putting in place to deter employers and labour suppliers from employing illegal workers or referring them for work. The offences are supposed to encourage employers and labour suppliers to verify the work entitlements of potential employees when there is a substantial risk that they may indeed be illegal workers. The proposed new offences carry criminal penalties of imprisonment for five years for an aggravated offence or in other cases imprisonment for two years. A feature of this bill, which we welcome very much, is the much higher penalties for offences where aggravating circumstances are present such as where the illegal worker is in a condition of sexual servitude, forced labour or slavery.
Generally speaking, the Labor Party and I commend the theory behind the bill. It looks to introduce new offences for employers, labour suppliers and other persons who allow, encourage or supply illegal workers to work in Australia, and that is to be commended. However, we cannot escape the reality that without any effective policing we can have any number of laws or sanctions but they simply will not be of any use. They will be completely ineffective.
The government has known about the large problems regarding illegal and unregulated workers since a review entitled Review of illegal workers in Australia: improving immigration compliance in the workplace undertaken by DIMIA in 1999, which outlined the problems and offered several solutions. In fact, the review found that work needed to be done in policing and compliance, that most visa overstayers had found employment of some description and that there needed to be work done to address that. The review said:
The Review found that the current measures in place to combat illegal workers were insufficient to address the extent of the illegal worker population. In particular, the Review concluded that:
while DIMA compliance action is increasingly successful, there is little prospect that the workload will diminish.
They also recommended that a system of sanctions be introduced to discourage business owners, employers and labour suppliers from recruiting illegal workers. So, while the government is content to set up systems, checks, compliance regulations and laws, it does not police them adequately or provide the necessary infrastructure for the application of the laws and sanctions that it is legislating for today, which renders the whole process rather pointless and useless. We can demonstrate that quite clearly with the regular and systematic abuse we have seen of the 457 visas, something that has been a contentious issue for some time and is growing. It is getting more and more out of control when we see these visas in particular being abused and misused and little or no effort being applied by the government to police its regulations. We see a flurry of activity once issues are brought to public attention, but it is all reactive. There is no proactive program in place that we can see to ensure that abuses of 457 visas are not occurring in a systematic and systemic way.
One of the fundamental problems with the 457 visa is that it is a free-for-all for employers to simply engage workers from overseas because they would prefer to do it that way. One has to question the underlying motives of that—and the underlying motives are well known to this government because Senator Vanstone indicated that one of the purposes and one of the benefits of 457 visas was to keep a cap on wages and conditions in this country. That is our experience so far. We have seen workers on these visas being used to replace Australian workers. We have seen these 457 visas being used to drive down wages and conditions. We have seen them being used to force people to work extraordinary hours in quite bad occupational health and safety conditions and standards.
Employers, when looking to use the 457 visa, do not even have to demonstrate that there is a shortage of skills here when they want to use that visa application. They simply are able to make the application, get it passed by government and bring people in from overseas to do work whether there is a shortage or not. People talk about the skills shortage as if there is a shortage everywhere. I want to talk a little about the plumbing and electrical industries. It is said often—and often in this place—that there are severe skills shortages in those two trades. That is simply not the case. While there are some shortages in some of the specialist areas of those trades, it is not across the board. As a consequence of that and the abuse of 457 visas, Australian apprentices who are already engaged in apprenticeships are unable to be kept on, trained and to complete their apprenticeships because there is a misconception that there is a skills shortage across the board.
I received some figures yesterday from VICTEC, which is the largest electrical and plumbing group training company in Australia, based in Victoria. Over the course of this year it has had up to 34 apprentices every month unemployed, and it has been unable to provide work for them during this period when at the same time we have employers bringing in supposedly skilled overseas workers for these trades. Out of a much smaller group of 65 plumbing apprentices in the month of January this year, 16 were sent back and VICTEC were unable to provide work for them.
This is happening across the board, not only in group training companies. My understanding is that all the major electrical contracting companies in Victoria are having serious problems keeping their apprentices employed this year and many of those companies have been employing their apprentices for two weeks on and two weeks off. And people are still saying: ‘Let’s bring in people on 457 visas. Let’s bring them in for these trades.’ The problem is that they do not have to demonstrate that there is a skills shortage. An employer does not even have to demonstrate that they have advertised to fill a vacancy that they had in their workforce before they use these particular visas. One can only conclude that they are being used to undermine the working conditions of Australians who are already employed. And, in this case, the flow-on effects are that Australian apprentices—people who are already engaged in apprenticeships—are unable to be trained and fully employed during their training period.
Moving on to another example—but I will come back to the particular example of electricians—yesterday I again asked the minister about the issue of the abuse of 457 visas at ABC Tissues. I asked the minister to confirm that ABC Tissues had been found to be in breach of immigration, industrial workplace safety, and taxation laws in its employment of temporary foreign workers under the 457 visa scheme. And, further, I asked the minister if she could confirm that her department investigated the company in August 2005 and found breaches under the Migration Act.
I also raised these concerns directly with the minister in this place in June this year. I asked the minister how it was possible that ABC Tissues were able to continue to exploit 457 visas and breach a raft of laws after two investigations by the department in less than one year. The minister responded that on 28 July this year the department had issued companies involved with ABC Tissues with a notice of intention to sanction on a number of grounds, including failure to pay the minimum salary level, failure to comply with other immigration laws, failure to comply with workplace relations laws, failure to ensure necessary licensing of workers, failure to notify Immigration of relevant changes of circumstance and failure to deduct taxation instalments. That is a fairly serious set of breaches across the company, yet we see, in the case of ABC Tissues, that they and the companies involved with them are still able to utilise the 457 visa arrangements.
Even after the ongoing breaches since August 2005 were demonstrated—had been investigated by the department—the use of the 457 visas continues. And it would appear that, while there are eventually going to be some sanctions, no sanctions have been put in place at this point in time. That, I think, clearly demonstrates the point I make that all those things have been and were illegal, yet if there is not proper policing, regulation, oversight and control of these arrangements, you can pass all the laws you like, but they effectively become meaningless. You can have all the sanctions you like but, unless you are going to investigate and prosecute people, the sanctions, again, are purely meaningless. While we commend the government for bringing forward this bill increasing the sanctions—although, as we have said, many years too late—we do not see any evidence of the government getting their act together and ensuring there is a proper policing regime in this area.
DIMA regulations stipulate that workers on 457 visas should be skilled and fully qualified for the work they have travelled to undertake and be able to comply with local safety laws. The ABC Tissues case, which came on top of so many others, was, of course, exactly the opposite. It transpired that the site was closed by ABC Tissues for a fortnight after inquiries by WorkCover and concerns by unions. Workers on the site said none of the Chinese workers could speak English, they could not read safety signs or follow emergency procedures and many had to be trained to perform some of the most basic tasks.
Clearly, there is a minimum standard of safety required on building sites in this country. It is a very dangerous industry. To have some workers not complying with safety regulations—because they are incapable of doing so either because of their skill level or their communication skills—puts everyone else on those sites at risk. It is simply not appropriate to say that we can bring people in small pockets onto a construction site and that they can work in an isolated way and will not have an impact on other workers. It is important for everyone on a site to ensure that safety and skills are applied across the board.
In this case, one tradesman said he was stunned to see one of the guest workers make a non-compliant Chinese power tool fit a socket by stripping the cord and inserting the naked wires straight into the plug. As an electrician myself, I shudder at the thought of that sort of activity and at the thought of the safety implications for the rest of the site when that sort of activity is taking place. There were forklift drivers and electricians without appropriate licences as well as workers being paid in China rather than in Australia. The company could not nominate bank accounts where the workers were paid. They could not specify how much the workers were being paid or confirm that superannuation was being paid. These all fall under the breaches that the minister acknowledges have taken place, yet we still see ongoing use of 457 visas by this company.
As for importing Chinese electricians, I have already made the point that electricians in general—certainly construction electricians—are not in shortage in most areas, apart from Western Australia. I have checked with the industry training board. There is no serious shortage of skilled tradespeople across most of Australia in the general application of electrical workers. There are, specifically, shortages in line workers and substation mechanics, but certainly not in electricians that work in the construction industry. You simply cannot bring a Chinese electrician into Australia and apply the Chinese standards, as they have tried to do in this case, to the Australian system.
First of all, there is a minimum training requirement for tradespeople in this country. In the electrical trade, overseas workers from any country apart from New Zealand would have to get their trade recognition certificate. They would have to come here and demonstrate the quality of their schooling. They would need to sit an exam. If they passed a skills test, which would be a practical test and a theoretical test—and, again, you would not be able to do that if you could not speak English—they would get a trade recognition certificate. But that would be only the first step. They would then require a licence to work as an electrician in this country. They would have to sit and pass the full licensing exam before they could be issued with a licence to work.
So 457 visas would simply seem to allow employers to bring people in through a DIMIA controlled process to do work which they are legally not able to do in this country. But there does not seem to be any policing by DIMIA or any checks and balances. In one particular case Chinese electricians were brought in to work on a construction site. They had no trade recognition and no equivalent standard to Australian electricians. There were no licensing requirements. Again, it was accepted by the minister that there had been breaches in licensing requirements, yet people were working in a way that put other workers at risk and, of course, ultimately the work did not comply with the Australian standards. To top it off, this occurred in an area where there is no direct skills shortage. This is the opposition’s concern about this legislation.
As I have said, while we welcome the bill in itself, if there is no proper policing, no regulation, no oversight of these issues—and we do not see any evidence of any—the bill’s sanctions simply become meaningless. We call on the government to put proper structures and resources in place to ensure that there is such oversight. The government does not have to look past the examples of the 457 visa abuse. Cases are coming up day after day where those visas are being abused. The response seems to be reactive. We do not hear of cases—I cannot say there are none but we certainly do not hear of them, and if there are any we would like to hear about them—where the department, in a proactive way, have initiated investigations which have identified breaches of the 457 visa conditions and are able to tell us what remedial action has been taken. I suspect we will not be hearing of those examples because what we believe to be the case is that no such activity takes place.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EMPLOYER SANCTIONS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2006-09-06,"—The Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Bill 2006 amends the Migration Act 1958. It does so by introducing new offences for employers, labour suppliers and other persons who allow illegal workers to work in this country. Currently it is an offence under section 235 of the act for an unlawful noncitizen to do any work in Australia, whether for reward or otherwise, and a noncitizen who holds a visa that is subject to a work condition to work in Australia in contravention of that condition. We know that currently there are penalties that are applicable to persons who work in this country illegally. They range up to having to leave the country if they are caught in those circumstances.
However, there are no mechanisms—and there have been no mechanisms—in the act to penalise persons who allow noncitizens to work in Australia illegally. In fact, there has been no way in which we have been able to put pressure on employers who set out to exploit people in the workplace who are in this country illegally or as tourists and to breach our current laws. They are able to do so, and have always been able to do so, with impunity. So it is not before time that this legislation has been introduced. The proposed new offences will deter employers and labour suppliers from employing illegal workers or referring them for work and will encourage employers and labour suppliers to verify the work entitlements of potential employees when there is a substantial risk that they may be illegal workers.
The proposed new offences carry criminal penalties of imprisonment for five years for an aggravated offence and, in any other case, imprisonment for two years. A feature of the bill is the much higher penalties for offences where aggravating circumstances are present. These include where the worker is in a condition of sexual servitude, forced labour or slavery. But, interestingly enough, the penalties specified in the bill will only take effect six months after the passage of the bill. You have to ask: why the time lag?
There has been an argument that there should be an imposition of strict liability on employers. It is true that the definition of ‘recklessness’ within the bill will allow some employers to escape liability even though they have employed illegal workers. There will be some areas where it will be difficult to establish that an employer did so knowingly or recklessly. However, it is difficult to justify the introduction of strict liability as it would put an extraordinary imposition on employers. It is not always easy to assess whether or not someone is an illegal worker. In particular, people without work rights can be granted tax file numbers, which would otherwise be the simplest test. Consequently, the level of checking that strict liability would impose on employers could be seen as excessive. For this reason, liability is imposed on an employer only if they act knowingly or recklessly.
The flip side of this, however, is that it leaves holes that offending employers may be able to get through. The onus of proof may be too heavy in many otherwise legitimate cases. However, it has to be said that whilst these amendments to the Migration Act are welcome—and, as I said, they are being made not before time—and while they may, in a lot of circumstances, prevent persons who otherwise would not be able to work here from being exploited in the workplace, there will still be many who are able to slip through the net.
However, these conditions will not apply in the circumstances of temporary migrant workers—workers who are brought here on 457 visas or 456 visas for temporary employment in this country. A spate of issues have arisen in relation to temporary migrant workers over the past couple of years, a number of which have been identified by my colleague Senator Marshall in his contribution here this morning. We have seen workers employed in Australia on 457 visas where the visa terms are nowhere near the reality of the people’s employment or the circumstances under which those persons are being employed.
Some 40,000 workers, we understand, will be granted 457 visas this year. That is a boom of some 43 per cent up from the 28,000 who were employed last year. The visas were intended for companies looking to import skilled labour that was otherwise unavailable because of skill shortages. These skill shortages, I might add, did not suddenly hit us between the eyes; skill shortages were identified very early in the piece. In fact, I recall chairing a committee—the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee—in an inquiry it held in 2003, and its report entitled Bridging the skills divide made something like 49 recommendations to this government on ways and means of dealing with the issue of skill shortages, most of which were totally ignored.
So the skill shortage is not something that has suddenly emerged. It was identified early and people—employers and employer organisations—have been clamouring for this government to do something about it. It is a situation that was substantially ignored by this government over a number of years and it has directly led to a circumstance where visas are being issued to import skilled labour because of the claim those skills are no longer available.
The requirement of those visas essentially was that the company would demonstrate an inability to find appropriate labour in Australia and then ask to import a worker to do the job. But, whilst there is a requirement for employers to demonstrate that there is a skill shortage, in practice the department does not require applicants for these visas to demonstrate that they have identified a skill shortage or that they have taken action to establish whether persons with the skills required are available in the area in which the work is going to be undertaken.
It is accepted by this government that the fact that we have an unemployment rate across the board of 5.7 per cent—I think those were the last figures that were issued—is sufficient to establish that we have a labour shortage and that the skills are unavailable. We know that those figures are averaged—that they are a reflection of a sample survey—and we know that unemployment in many parts of this country is substantially higher than the national average, particularly in regional Australia, where a lot of this work is being undertaken by persons on 457 visas. But there is no requirement—the department is not insisting on it—for employers to demonstrate that they have established that in the marketplace there is a shortage of the skills that they are seeking. It is accepted, because the general average shows unemployment has fallen, that the skills do not exist.
At the very best, this is a stopgap measure in dealing with our skill shortages, which, as I have said, have been caused essentially by the neglect of this government and the way in which they have dealt with the vocational education training system since they were first elected in 1996. Whilst there is a set of requirements governing the way in which temporary visas are to be applied, that is not, in practice, what has been happening. The scrutiny of the way in which companies have been functioning in this field has been very minimal indeed.
Workers have been exploited by dodgy bosses using temporary 457 visas. Senator Lundy, who is in the chamber, identified a number of examples in the restaurant industry in Canberra where workers were being substantially exploited under these visas. Senator Marshall has just identified a number of instances where workers have been exploited under these visas.
There are employers out there who have deliberately set out to use the visas to exploit workers in order to maximise the benefit to them. We have seen, for example, workers who are skilled, but not 100 per cent proficient in English, being brought into this country and employed under pretty horrendous conditions. Consider the case, some time ago, of 20 Korean welders who were basically suckered into working long, long hours for low, low wages. They were told to bring their families with them on the promise of quick approval of permanent residency. The labour hire company that was employing them was receiving $40 an hour for these workers and passing on only $15 of that to the workers.
More importantly, when the company discovered that the workers had discussed this with other workers on site, they had those workers escorted from the workplace. One of the welders was visited early in the morning at home by the labour hire firm’s chief solicitor and told to sign a new contract, the new contract being in English only. No negotiations were entered into, and he was refused a copy of the contract. This is not new. This is an issue we raised with the Employment Advocate. Before the 457 visas came onto the horizon, I raised with the Employment Advocate at estimates that we had situations in this country where migrant workers with limited English were being given AWAs that were drafted by people with university degrees and expected to understand the implications of those agreements and sign them on the basis that they understood them. And here is a similar situation in which a worker under a 457 visa is being exploited in the same way.
Other workers were forced to buy cars on their first day in the country for three times the market value of the vehicle. The employer was not only getting the workers to buy the cars but also making a substantial profit on the deal for himself on the way through. Another worker was promised $72,000 a year but was paid $840 a week for a 56-hour week. Some workers have been forced to work long hours for well below market rates, and some have been forced to live in substandard, rat infested accommodation. There was a case in Queensland in which the Office of Workplace Services engaged solicitors to pursue the union because the union took action to protect the workers. They did see sense eventually and dropped the case because they knew they were in an unwinnable situation.
There is no doubt that these visas have been used and abused for the purpose of importing cheap, exploitable labour. Essentially, whilst these workers are being engaged under the concept of filling skills gaps, the reality is that the vast majority of them coming in under 457 visas are simply being brought in by companies who have not tested the labour market and have not demonstrated that there are practical shortages of the skills in question. It is simply to exploit the availability of the workers and hold down wages in this country.
It is said that the minimum wage for people engaged on 457 visas is $41,000. But that wage is below the market rate, so there are still substantial problems in these areas. Dr Phil Toner of the University of Western Sydney told the Sydney Morning Herald:
Clearly the implication is that though the minimum may be $41,000, any jobs that might have a market rate over that are going to see a downward pressure.
He means downward pressure on wages in those areas. That is the fact of the way this system is operating. He also said that the program is a disincentive to spend money on training and that this exacerbates the existing skills shortages. The reality is that the point of the visas is not to address skills shortages; it is essentially to hold down wages. As I said, the changes in this bill, while welcome, will not address any of those issues.
In respect of the 457 visas, the government does have it within its power to deal harshly with employers who breach the conditions of the 457 visas. What the government has not done is to show the political courage to instruct the department to deal harshly with them. It has allowed these cases to occur and the exploitation to run on. As Senator Marshall pointed out in his contribution, it has essentially only been when these issues have been exposed publicly that the government has sought to do anything about addressing the problem. It has been reactive, slow and reluctant in ensuring that the conditions of these visas are being adhered to.
As I said in my initial comments, the changes to this bill are welcome. They do address gaps in respect of the illegal worker situation. A review of illegal workers in 1999 identified that some 53,000 people were at that time overstaying their visas and living in Australia. The review also painted a picture that some overstayers were finding work. These people were in breach of their visa conditions and, if caught, were subject to punishment under the Migration Act. The big problem with the act was that there was no punishment for the employers who were involved in encouraging these people to take up employment, and that situation continues until today. In 2000 a phone advice line was set up for employers. In 2001 a set of graded sanctions were foreshadowed, and warning notices were implemented some time after that. But, until now, there has been no substantial penalty to be pressed upon employers who have been doing the wrong thing.
Even after this bill passes, it will be six months before employers become liable in terms of those penalties. From 1999 until now, the problem has been clear but the government’s response has been inadequate, as it has been in addressing the problems under 457 visas. The question will be: how long will it be before the government moves to address some of the wrongs that are occurring to employees who have been brought into the country under the 457 visas?

",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EMPLOYER SANCTIONS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-09-06,"—I welcome the support for the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Bill 2006 that members of the opposition have indicated. I will deal with one or two of the issues which have been raised in the second reading debate. This bill, as senators know, addresses the government’s long-held concerns about those who seek to work illegally in Australia. Illegal work causes a number of problems for the Australian community. It takes job opportunities away from Australian citizens and lawful migrants and that was a point a number of senators made in their remarks.
The cost of detecting illegal workers, of course, is an unwelcome burden on the taxpayer. Very importantly, some illegal work is linked to organised crime, particularly in the sex industry. The trafficking of people, particularly women and children, is a despicable crime. The government is determined to deal with anyone who knowingly participates in this kind of criminal activity, including employers who seek to exploit the victims of trafficking. Despite the continued success of our immigration compliance activities, the government believes that additional statutory reforms are required. Experience has shown that there must be some method of imposing sanctions on the small number—and I think it is a small number—of employers and labour suppliers who deliberately engage or refer illegal workers.
The bill introduces fault based criminal offences. The proposed offences will only be committed where the employer or labour supplier knew the person was an illegal worker or was reckless as to that fact. This ensures that the focus is on the employers and labour suppliers who are of concern to the government without imposing any additional burden on businesses generally. This bill introduces high penalties for offences where aggravating circumstances are present. These circumstances arise where the illegal worker is being exploited through forced labour, slavery or indeed sexual servitude.
Turning to one of the key points raised during the debate, a number of senators have also suggested that not enough is being done to prevent 457 visa holders from being exploited. Senator George Campbell, in his remarks, made this particular point. The point to note is that the offences in this bill will help to reinforce existing sanctions arrangements and that is clearly one of the reasons that this bill is enjoying support in the Senate. For example, where an employer moves a 457 visa holder into a low-skilled or semiskilled position the offence in clause 245AC of allowing a noncitizen to work in breach of their visa conditions may be committed.
In summary, we believe this bill addresses some very serious issues in Australian society. However, we think it strikes the right balance by ensuring that only those employers and labour suppliers who are of genuine concern to the Australian people will be caught by these offences. I urge the Senate to allow a speedy passage of this bill.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT (EMPLOYER SANCTIONS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I rise to speak on the Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Bill 2006. This bill is essentially a post facto attempt by the government to make up for the fact that it mucked-up the bill the first time around. Perhaps it is worth while going into the history of the government’s muck-up. This bill amends provisions introduced by the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 which implement the special recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force in combating terrorism funding. The Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, is an intergovernmental body designed to develop and promote policies to combat international money laundering and terrorism financing. To that end, it has developed two different sets of recommendations. Firstly, there were 40 recommendations on anti money laundering. The latest update took place in 2003. In October 2001, following, of course, the September 11 attacks, there was another set of nine special recommendations specifically relating to financing of terrorist activity. So there were 40 more broad anti-money-laundering recommendations from FATF and a further nine dealing with the financing of terrorist activity.
In 2003, the Minister for Justice and Customs promised that Australia’s Financial Transaction Reports Act would be updated and brought into line with both the special and the general recommendations. Currently, it is more than three years and counting since that promise was made and still no bill has been brought to parliament. Last year we saw some small attempt by the government to bring Australia into line with world standards on this issue through the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2), which Labor supported. That bill, amongst other things, was designed to bring Australia up to speed with a number of recommendations from FATF, but it was a stopgap measure. The new provisions introduced by the bill were only interim. They were designed to provide a temporary fix while the government’s long-delayed revision of the Financial Transaction Reports Act was being drafted. Unfortunately, it is nearly a year later and there is still no end in sight for that particular piece of legislation.
In any case, the problem with the legislation was simply the utter lack of consultation, and we are seeing the problem being exacerbated again. During the course of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s inquiry into the bill, an inquiry that the government wanted to hold over a single day, we found out that the Attorney-General’s Department had not consulted with industry on the final text of the bill. Let us fast forward a few months, and industry has finally managed to convince the Howard government that the changes introduced in the antiterrorism bill that the government have allowed to come into force will devastate sections of it. Surprise! That is not scaremongering by the Labor Party. Let us turn to the explanatory memorandum if you think we are putting it out there. The EM says:
If the amendment to restrict the application of Division 3A of Part II of the FTR Act to ADIs—
that is, authorised deposit institutions—
is not made, then certain legitimate non-bank money remitters assert that they could be put out of business.
That is what they then put forward after they brought forward legislation and this fix to fix their fix.
Now we have come to a situation where the government was forced to go back and amend its sloppy legislation, which was only intended to be a bandaid solution in the first place. There is stopgap after stopgap. But that is not the end of it; we were surprised again. It caught me off guard completely when yesterday afternoon the Senate found there was another amendment to fix the problem in this bill as it appears before the Senate. We now have the government piling ad hoc solutions on top of each other as belatedly as yesterday. They then found that the original stopgap was not enough: there is another amendment to this bill to fix the first bandaid, and now we have a supplementary EM to fix this bill because it apparently did not fix the problem. I do not know how many fixes you need but the fix is on by this government.
Labor will support the legislation. We would have been happy with it if it had not been a bandaid solution and we would have been much happier to support it if the government had consulted on it, got it right and provided an outcome that suited industry, suited the fight against terrorist financing and ensured that the legislation was properly drafted. But we are not happy with it—let us make that plain. We will support the legislation because it is necessary. If we do not then, if the explanatory memorandum is to be believed, legitimate Australian businesses will be put out of business. That is not what the Labor Party stands for; it might be what the Howard government’s unintended consequences do, but they seem to be working pretty hard to try to fix it with bandaid solutions. However, we are not happy with this legislation because it is sloppy. It is a sloppy drafting by this government. It is not acceptable for the government to have the attitude that they can continually bring in poorly drafted legislation and then expect the private sector to do the checking for them, because that seems to be what has happened. The private sector foreshadowed, even after they had not been consulted, that there might be some problems with it. If the government had consulted the private sector in the first place, we may have been able to at least avoid some of this happening now.
But, again, it is important to note that the situation will finally be resolved when the government brings forth its long-awaited—three years and counting, by my reckoning—anti-money-laundering and counterterrorist financing laws to update the Financial Transaction Reports Act. Let us hope that that does not suffer the same fate and is bandaided when we find it in parliament. I can say it has been consulted on. Let us hope it does not suffer the same piecemeal attack.
Going to some of the background: this bill introduces a number of changes to the legislation. Basically, the bill does three things. It provides a new definition of ‘account’ for certain parts of the act. It provides a new definition of ‘customer information’ for parts of the act. It removes non-ADI—that is, authorised deposit institutions; basically banks—cash dealers from the operation of certain sections of the act. I will deal with each of these in turn.
Firstly, the bill alters the definition of ‘account’ under the act. The new definition of ‘account’ will apply only to division 3A of the act—that is, the division dealing with international funds transfer instructions. The changes to the definition of ‘account’ bring this section into line with that in the draft AML-CTF bill and were brought about due to concerns of industry. Bringing the definition of ‘account’ into line with the draft AML-CTF bill means the industry will only have to go through one rather than multiple system changes. Let us hope that that is still the case with the current round. Under the new section an account includes:
a credit card account; and
a loan account (other than a credit card account); and
an account of money held in the form of units in:
a cash management trust; or
a trust of a kind prescribed by the regulations.
Labor supports these matters; they are needed by AUSTRAC, the government and financial institutions to ensure that they can conduct legitimate business under this legislation. It also properly addresses the area. However, a further point of contention has been raised by the Australian Bankers Association with the current definition and the inclusion of credit cards. This is because credit card account numbers are quite often used as stand-alone loans in a transaction and no signature is required if the credit card is being used to purchase something over the phone or the internet.
The Attorney-General’s Department has indicated that it will discuss the matter of credit card accounts further with the ABA. However, I think we really seriously have to ask ourselves why this was not done before the current bill was introduced. Are we going to be back here in another couple of months amending the legislation yet again because the Attorney-General’s Department has found another hole in its ad hoc, bandaid solution—as we found out only yesterday that it had? If the government had listened to industry, I suspect they would have remedied it a lot earlier than this, but be that as it may.
The next change that this bill makes is the alteration of the definition of ‘customer information’ to allow a greater latitude for the use of ID numbers attached to international funds transfer instructions. Currently, every time a bank sends an instruction for the transfer of funds to another institution overseas, a range of information must be included. The range of information that may be included was expanded substantially yesterday afternoon when the government brought forward its supplementary amendments—perhaps I could call them the bandaid to the bandaid solution. There is now a wide range of information that may be included, including the customer’s address, business number and date and location of birth. In any case, the proposed amendment will allow for much greater use of identification numbers rather than account numbers. Account numbers will now only be required to be included when the instruction relates to the transfer of money directly from a single account held by the customer. In other cases an identification number will suffice. This amendment is designed to simplify the transfer of IFTIs and provide a more practical option for financial institutions.
Turning to cash dealers, as per division 3A under the legislation as it stands—unless there is a late amendment: although it is not yet in force, a cash dealer is required to supply customer information alongside an international funds transfer instruction where the cash dealer who is not an ADI is acting on behalf of another person who is not an ADI. So, if I am a cash dealer and I am sending an international funds transfer instruction on behalf of another person who is not an ADI then I am obliged to include certain information to identify the customer—account numbers, names and addresses. This is a requirement of special recommendation VII of FATF. However, one of the main changes of this bill is to significantly restrict the application of this section. The bill will effectively remove non-ADI cash dealers from the operation of division 3A—that is, there will not be any requirement for those dealers to include customer information with any outgoing international funds transfer instructions. The stated reason for this is that it seemed impractical to require the IFTIs sent from one institution in one country to the same institution in another country to include originator information, because in effect this would require the institution to pass on the information to itself. That makes sense.
These changes are necessary to compensate for poor drafting and a lack of proper consultation in the first place. But we have no wish to see legitimate cash dealers put out of business through no fault of their own. The Howard government, in this instance, has brought shoddy legislation before parliament, amended its own act and has now brought in further amendments to amend it. I will take the opportunity in the committee stage to ask whether that was a matter that you consulted on in the supplementary EM as well. I am sure you will be able to arm yourself with a response during the second reading debate.
However, these changes cannot stand in the long term. If you have a situation where some cash dealers are subject to these requirements but others are not then you are essentially erecting a maginot line—a strong, impenetrable fortress that can easily be circumvented, that you can go around. As I noted above, the requirements for cash dealers to include customer information in the IFTIs are stated under the FTAF special recommendation VII and there are serious concerns that the bill before us would effectively step back, in terms of compliance, from those standards. That seems to be the case, although it is a little confusing. I am sure the department and the minister will be able to tell me whether I am right about that. It is only a temporary solution. The longer term solution of course will be with the AML-CTF bill when it hits parliament and is steered through.
The department has suggested that the current framework of the FTR Act is unsatisfactory for the proper implementation of this requirement and that the special recommendation VII obligations will be properly enacted when the final version of the AML-CTF bill is released. Perhaps the minister could advise when, and whether that will be in the first or second tranche. We have no date for when the second tranche of the AML-CTF bill will be brought forward. However, this still leaves this problem with the final version, which we have not seen as yet.
A further issue with the bill was identified by the Australian Bankers Association, the ABA, relating to its application to their hub-and-spoke system. As identified in submissions to the Senate inquiry, the ABA noted that a number of their member organisations operated via a system whereby payments sent by one institution to one of their offshore sites are routed through Australia. I bring this up at this point because, once again, the response of the Attorney-General’s Department was that it ‘would like to seek further input from the ABA before any amendments were made to the bill to clarify this situation’. But that was after they did not consult and after they brought the amendment forward. When the ABA appeared before the Senate committee—which the government said could sit for one day—the ABA said: ‘Now we’ve looked at it, there is a problem. Can you fix it?’ The government came back yesterday afternoon and the Senate was presented with amendments that in part deal with exactly the problem that the ABA brought up. Surely this is something that the government should have looked into before the bill was brought into the Senate—at least that way they could have made it a little tidier. My concern is that we will be back here again in a couple of months fixing yet another problem that has resurfaced in the legislation. Is it the case that, when this gets broad application, more problems will arise on the interim solution?
Once again, we will support this bill, because we feel that it is unfair to saddle the legitimate business community in Australia with the mistakes of the Howard government. They are mistakes by the Howard government. It is sloppy legislative drafting, and they know it. They have brought it in piecemeal. We deplore the ramshackle, ad hoc approach that passes for legislative drafting under this government. I will touch on that further in the committee stage.
The approach to this legislation by the government has been down a very troubled path. They have not followed what you would call a model of consultation to ensure they got it right. I will be moving amendments in the committee stage to ensure that the title of the bill more accurately reflects what is intended to be achieved—that is, to fix drafting errors which are present because of the government’s ineptitude and unwillingness to consult before bringing this legislation before the parliament. The government might understand and know these types of amendments because they are the ones who do it. I will move an amendment to rename the bill the Anti-Terrorism (Correction of Government Legislative Errors) Bill 2006. It is the title which most accurately reflects the intent of the legislation before us today. And perhaps I could add an addendum to that: a supplementary amendment that we got yesterday which amends the bill.
This is an arrogant government—it really is. When you look at how it has approached this legislation you will see that. It is an arrogant government which has failed again and again to get it right. It has failed to bring into parliament legislation which would make Australia compliant with the Financial Action Task Force 40 plus nine recommendations. The government’s ad hoc, bandaid solutions seem to only paper over the cracks in the legislation—which is now the subject of a further bandaid solution. They are piling bandaids on top of bandaids trying to fix the legislation—and it is only a short-term fix, in any event. We are still waiting for the major piece of legislation to come before parliament, and I suspect we will see that before the end of this year. It is not good government policy. It is government policy that has been made on the run. And it is government policy that is really moved by panic. I foreshadow that I will be moving that amendment.
It is a stopgap measure to plug another stopgap measure—that is all there is to say about this government’s approach to legislation and accountability. That is what it really is about. That is this government’s approach to legislation and accountability: ‘We’ll be sloppy about it. If we need to fix it, we’ll be driven to fix it. If you point out the error, if it suits us we’ll fix it and we will bring an amendment in here to do it.’ It seems to be the way they deal with legislation and the accountability that goes with it—and that is disappointing. But Labor will support this bill. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-06,"—According to the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of the Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Bill 2006 is to ‘vary the amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 made by schedule 9 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005’. The amendments are to the new division 3A, which was inserted by schedule 9 of the ATA at part II of the FTRA. So the shadow minister is quite accurate that this is a bill designed to correct drafting errors and perhaps unintended consequences.
The proposed amendments include: an amendment to the definition of ‘account’ for the purposes of division 3A, clarification of the definition of the term ‘customer information’ in section 17FA of the FTRA, an amendment to the definition of ‘customer information’ for incoming international funds transfer instructions under section 17FB of the FTRA and an amendment to restrict the application of division 3A to authorised deposit-taking institutions only and not all cash dealers.
Australia’s anti-money-laundering program is encapsulated in the Financial Transaction Reports Act and places obligations on financial institutions and other financial intermediaries. Enacted in 1988, it is Australia’s primary anti-money-laundering legislation and was initially aimed at the financial, gambling and criminal sectors. It imposes obligations to report significant and suspicious transactions and international fund transfers, makes it an offence to open a bank account in a false name, and requires cash dealers to verify identities of cash holders or signatories.
It also requires reporting of certain transactions and transfers and creates record-keeping obligations. When division 3A comes into force in December this year it will require cash dealers in Australia to include required information about the ordering customer with an international funds transfer instruction when transmitting international funds transfer instructions out of Australia. It will be an offence not to include this information, which is reported to AUSTRAC, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, Australia’s anti-money-laundering regulator and specialist financial intelligence unit.
When the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body designed to establish international standards and develop and promote policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, conducted an evaluation of Australia’s anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing legislation, they noted that the estimated value of money-laundering offences in Australia amounts to between $2 billion and $3 billion per year—and I suspect that may be a conservative estimate. Although Australia has in place anti-money-laundering legislation, it does still continue to represent a major challenge and problem for law enforcement agencies.
Because the hard yards in this particular area of law had been done in the time of a Labor government, money laundering some years ago was considered a fringe issue by this coalition government. But in the wake of the September 11 events in the United States and, over the subsequent years, major terrorist attacks in other countries around the world including Spain and the United Kingdom, anti-money-laundering has moved very quickly up the ladder of geopolitical concern. That is because terrorism cannot operate at this high level of activity without very significant funds. Of course this new interest in anti-money-laundering will have useful effects on criminal and drug activity and the way in which the people involved in those activities move moneys around the world, and on tax evasion.
In recognition of all this, very soon after the United States September 11 events, the Financial Action Task Force expanded its mandate in October 2001 and issued eight special recommendations dealing with specific issues relating to terrorist financing. In October 2004 they published a ninth special recommendation. In conjunction with the nine special recommendations, the 40 recommendations have also been modified and there have been reviews over the years, the most recent being in 2003. According to their 2005-06 annual report, the Financial Action Task Force consider that the so-called 40 plus nine recommendations:
... form a comprehensive framework for governments to develop their domestic efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing.
I note with some approval the scathing comment by Senator Ludwig in his additional comments to the Senate report on this bill. He said at 1.4:
These measures themselves were brought forward from the Government’s long delay in bringing forward the anti-money laundering regime due to botched consultation with affected industries, and were themselves perhaps prompted by the Howard government’s failure to meet the international Financial Action Task Force mutual evaluation on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, in which the Government scored just 9 out of 40 on anti-money laundering, and 0 out of 9 on counter-terrorism financing.
That sort of criticism really does need to be noted and I, amongst others, have chivvied the government about their delays in getting on with these vital tasks. It is pointless sending our troops and making all the efforts we do around the world to assist in counterterrorism activity when we do not back that up with as much domestic law change as we can in this field concerning the financing or the potential financing of crime and of terrorism.
As a member nation of the Financial Action Task Force, Australia has worked towards maintaining the Financial Action Task Force standards, and has made some changes in response to the changing world in which we live including the introduction of the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act in 2002. The Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act is aimed at restricting financial resources available to terrorist organisations and making the financing of terrorists a criminal offence as well as requiring cash dealers to report terrorist financing transactions—a very good intention that lies behind that act.
However, in an evaluation of Australia’s anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing laws by the Financial Action Task Force in 2005, it was reported that our system was falling behind the task force standards. The Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Bill 2006 is therefore part of the government’s long-coming response to international pressure to crack down on the potential for money laundering, particularly with respect to the financing of terrorism. I cannot see it simply as a bill designed to correct a drafting mistake; it is part of a continuing response.
According to the Parliamentary Library’s Bills Digest No. 64 on the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005, the government is particularly concerned with rectifying the non-compliant status that the Financial Action Task Force deemed Australia to have in relation to special recommendation VII, which relates to wire transfer of funds. Whilst such legislation is of critical importance in an age where information exchange is taking place at increasingly rapid rates and through a plethora of national and international channels, such legislation also needs to be approached with care and concern for those ordinary, law-abiding citizens which it captures in its operation.
Although one may suggest that the bill currently under consideration is of a dry and somewhat technical nature, it still does impact upon an issue which is of central and increasing concern in the society in which we live: that of privacy. Privacy is a matter which has concerned this government in its 10 years of office and it is a matter which concerns our society. Privacy concerns were issues strongly highlighted by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee in their report on the exposure daft of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2005. The anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing laws, of which the Financial Transaction Reports Act is a part, legislates mandatory reporting requirements in relation to people’s personal financial information.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2006-09-06,"—The term ‘freedom fighter’ conjures up images of flag-waving revolutionaries marching through the streets, or perhaps brightly coloured and costumed superheroes, the stuff of comic books and cartoons. We almost certainly do not picture a well-groomed, neatly dressed, moustachioed gentleman of a century ago. Yet that is what Bruce Smith was. He was a freedom fighter who devoted his life to advocating for individual freedom, not because it was popular but because it was in society’s best interests. Bruce Smith is not exactly a household name in Australia, nor has he been graced with a parkland statue, but his unassuming name masks his legacy as one of Australia’s significant and early liberal thinkers.
Arthur Bruce Smith was born in Surrey, England, in June 1851, educated in England and then at Wesley College in Melbourne. He studied law at the University of Melbourne before returning to London, where he was called to the bar in early 1877. Later that year, he returned to Melbourne and was admitted to the Victorian bar on the same day as Alfred Deakin. The two men would be prominent figures in Victorian and federal politics for the next couple of decades.
Bruce attempted to make his first foray into politics when he stood for the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Emerald Hill in February 1880. He was unsuccessful. That was in fact the first of five attempts he made to enter Australian parliaments. He moved to Sydney the following year and practised at the bar. But Bruce’s political ambitions remained strong and, on 23 November 1882, he won a by-election for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Gundagai. As luck would have it, parliament was dissolved that same day, so Bruce again went to the polls and was re-elected 20 days later, on 13 December.
An issue of the Bulletin that year praised Smith, saying he added ‘the strong common sense of the experienced commercial man to the acumen of the practised advocate’. Smith resigned that seat in 1884 and returned to Melbourne to become joint managing director of his father’s shipping company, WM Howard Smith and Sons Ltd. He went on to found the Victorian Employers Union in 1885 and served as its first president until 1887.
Bruce enjoyed writing and over the years contributed to several journals, including the Victorian Review, Melbourne Review, Centennial Magazine and the Sydney Quarterly Magazine. He returned to Sydney in 1888 and founded the New South Wales employers union.
Smith made a fourth run at parliament and re-entered via the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, this time in the seat of Glebe in 1889. He joined with the free traders and served in Parkes’s last ministry as secretary for public works and then colonial treasurer. The turbulent politics of that time took their toll on Bruce, and his commitment to his immediate family saw him again bow out of politics in 1894. In 1901 Smith made his fifth and final attempt to enter parliament, becoming the first federal member for Parkes, a seat he would hold for 18 years and be re-elected to six times before being defeated in 1919.
Smith never wavered from his enduring belief in the values of liberalism. During his parliamentary career he was one of the most fervent opponents of immigration restriction, the White Australia policy, compulsory arbitration and the new welfare liberalism espoused by some of his colleagues. He was also a vocal supporter of the women’s movement, advocating equal rights and opportunities for both genders. He continuously argued that freedom and liberty were the most effective instruments to ensure societal wellbeing, not ‘meddling legislation’, as he termed it. Smith retired to his home in Bowral in 1925 and died there in 1937, aged 86.
Smith penned a number of works including Our Commonwealth in 1904 and the brilliantly titled Paralysis of a nation, attacking socialism, in 1914. But his most important contribution was his documentation of his political philosophy in the aptly titled work of 1887, Liberty and liberalism. One hundred and twenty years later, the principles that underscore Smith’s commentary are still relevant. His work has stood the test of time.
Throughout his life he remained true to his belief in championing the rights of individuals and the value of free enterprise—as he coined it, ‘true liberalism’. Perhaps the most important message Bruce Smith left is the reminder that governments have limited capacity to improve the welfare of individuals. Australians are better off when encouraged and nurtured to work on improving themselves rather than turning to the state for answers. One of Smith’s ideological allies, John Bright, spoke in this same vein when he observed:
… there is a danger of people coming to the idea … that a government can do anything that is wanted—that, in fact, it is only necessary to pass an Act of Parliament to make any one well off. There is no more serious mistake than that.
Liberalism is often shouted down by the Left as an instrument of the wealthy, but Smith knew that those who suffer most from loss of liberty are actually the poorest members of society. Smith reminded those of us charged with the responsibility for legislating that acts of parliament remove ‘a liberty from somebody, because it must of necessity speak of something which shall or shall not be done, where before it was optional’. As the federal member for Parkes, Smith stunned other members of the House when he addressed them stating:
I have not that exalted opinion of the powers of Parliament. It can transfer things from one person to another, and it can do a great deal of harm.
Bruce Smith held freedom as sacred and recognised legislation as potentially its greatest threat. It is fascinating to compare the ideas of Smith with the opposing ideas of the political Left. Though the Left claim the battleground for women’s rights, they forget that classical liberals like Bruce Smith stood strong for their equality. In a speech to the House in 1901, Bruce Smith argued that women should receive equal workplace pay. And it was not the Left but rather proponents of liberalism like Bruce Smith who were the most fervent critics of the White Australia policy.
The socialists of Smith’s time, much like their ideological kin today, assert moral ownership over the notion of ‘opportunity for all’, but equal opportunity has always been a strong ideal of true liberalism. Many of Smith’s battles were against those who misinterpreted the goals of liberalism or deliberately skewed them for personal advantage. Smith said:
Liberalism does not seek to make all men equal: nothing can do that. But its object is to remove all obstacles erected by men, which prevent all having equal opportunities.
It might at first glance appear odd that a member of a government would be lamenting the influence of the very entity that they are representing. But the spirit of liberalism is not anti government—that amounts to anarchy—but one in which the intervention of government in the private life of a citizen is sought to be thoroughly minimised.
Today Bruce Smith would be turning in his grave. Right around the country, Labor state governments are presiding over a series of emerging nanny states. They tell us what we should say, how we should feel and what we should think, and none is worse than the government of the sovereign state of Victoria, currently headed by Mr Bracks. A case in point is that the Bracks government’s Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006—the bill of rights—illustrates exactly what Bruce Smith warned against. This is the sort of meddling legislation that purports to advance freedom and liberty but in fact does exactly the opposite. This bill of rights hands to the judiciary the power and responsibility to make laws.
Labor’s bill of rights requires the courts to ensure that every single piece of legislation—past, present and future—must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with human rights. This gives a legislative power to the courts—a power that properly resides with democratically elected parliaments. It does nothing to protect people’s rights; rather, it limits them by prescribing them. As the old proposition goes: to define a right is to limit it. The problem with prescribing rights is that, once you start detailing some, other important rights are omitted. For example, property rights are included in the bill, but the bill’s explanatory memorandum expressly states that the bill does not deal with the issue of compensation for property being taken.
Bruce Smith would be horrified at the perverse implications of this bill. It was the men of his time who decided against a constitutional bill of rights. In a final slap in the face for democracy in Victoria, the Bracks government refused the opposition’s request to put the proposed bill to a referendum. It is, unfortunately, now law. The final word on the Victorian bill of rights should go the author of a personal submission to a parliamentary committee in 2001. It reads:
A bill of rights would pose a fundamental shift in tradition, with Parliament abdicating its important policy-making functions to the judiciary ... A bill of rights is an admission of the failure of parliaments, governments and the people to behave in a reasonable, responsible and respectful manner. I do not believe we have failed.
That personal submission was actually penned by former New South Wales Labor Premier Bob Carr. He got it right.
What disturbs me even more is the restriction of freedom of speech in Victoria as a result of the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001. No-one should ever condone racial vilification. It is completely unacceptable in Australian society to vilify anyone on the basis of their racial background. It was a desire to protect members of our community that prompted the bill. Anti-Semitism was particularly in the minds of the proponents and the authors of the bill, but the act has gone too far. It limits freedom of religious expression, freedom of speech and freedom of conscience in a way that is totally unacceptable in a liberal, pluralistic democracy. Religious vilification should be condemned, but the difficulties of legislating against religious vilification have become evident.
Two Christian pastors have been found guilty by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal of making fun of Muslim beliefs and practices. The crime was to quote the Koran and evoke laughter from the audience. No-one suggested that the pastors were quoting the Koran incorrectly, just that the response to quoting passages from the Koran was laughter. In Victoria today, laughter amounts to religious vilification. The core business of clerics is to advocate why they believe—to advocate their world view and why their truth is the right one. Of necessity, this means saying why you believe that another’s belief system is flawed. The battle of ideas, the battle of world views and the battle of beliefs is at the heart of what makes us a pluralistic society. Pluralism is not the housing of beliefs in silos; it is the interaction of those ideas and the tolerance of those ideas. But tolerance does not mean a denial of contestability. All ideas in our society should be contestable.
But there is worse to come. A convicted Wiccan paedophile serving time in jail has used the religious vilification provisions of the legislation to pursue the Salvation Army for allegedly vilifying his Wiccan religious beliefs. The paedophile voluntarily enrolled in an alpha course—a church run course to explain Christianity. The crime? Those conducting the course did not speak well of witches, astrologers and occultists. The Wiccan was unsuccessful in his action, but the fact that this matter could even go to a directions hearing means that the laws are fundamentally flawed. I again turn to Bob Carr for assistance. He had this to say about such laws:
As they are used in practice, religious vilification laws can undermine the very freedom they seek to protect—freedom of thought, conscience and belief.
This is yet another example of meddling legislation. The solution to the articulation of poor ideas, stupid ideas and offensive ideas is not to gag those articulating them. The solution is to rebut them with good ideas—the sort of legitimate exchange of ideas that people like Bruce Smith spent their lives engaging in. I fear that I am giving Bob Carr too much credit, but I will give him the final word on this particular piece of legislation. He said, ‘Leave these matters to the common sense of the Australian people.’
I congratulate the state Liberal leader, Ted Baillieu, and the shadow Attorney-General, Andrew Macintosh, for their stands on these issues of freedom. The Victorian opposition is committed to repealing the bill of rights and to reviewing the religious vilification provisions of the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act. Bruce Smith would be proud. We need to be vigilant and resolute and reject being told how to live our lives. It is always time to stand up for individual freedoms, liberty and equal opportunity. It is time to stand against these new nanny states. It is time to revive the spirit of Bruce Smith.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Mr Bruce Smith</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,3,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-06,"—My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Can the minister confirm her claim yesterday that on 16 August 2006 ABC Tissues were issued with a notice of intention to sanction by her department on the grounds that two workers were not carrying out their nominated duties? Is it also true that two days later, on 18 August 2006, the department approved sponsorship for 12 more 457 nominations for ABC Tissues, with one application approved on the same day? Didn’t this follow the department finding breaches by the company as far back as August 2005? Isn’t it a requirement of the 457 program that the sponsor has a ‘good business record and abides by immigration law’ and that ‘there must be nothing adverse known about the business’? Can the minister explain how ABC Tissues were allowed to bring in more foreign workers on 457 visas when there was clear evidence they had broken the law?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Skilled Migration</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-06,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister. I understand that the minister will take the question on notice and provide confirmation. I ask whether the minister can confirm that on 5 July 2006 the department received an allegation that the pregnant wife of a 457 worker employed at the ABC Tissues site in Queensland was forced to return to China against her wishes. Isn’t it a fact that if the wife had stayed in Australia then ABC Tissues would have been required to cover her medical expenses? Do employers have the right to forcibly remove from Australia family members of workers on 457 visas? Has the minister investigated that allegation? If she has, can she provide some information to the Senate?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Skilled Migration</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2006-09-06,"—Senator, I will check the detail of what you suggest happened afterwards, but I make one point clear. This was a point that was struggled with, but I will pass up the opportunity to be disparaging of someone. I make the point that approval of nominations is not a visa approval. I will have a look at the rest of the detail contained in the question. I indicated yesterday that there were a large number of people, relatively speaking, working with the Hunan company. That matter has not been resolved. I indicated that we had had a reply from ABC Tissues and that was being looked at, but that related to only two workers. In any enforcement area we need to keep a sense of balance. There will be people who will make mistakes and there will be minor infractions. You need to balance that up. I do not have with me details of what Senator Ludwig alleges may have happened afterwards. I simply make the point that I would have thought, on the basis of—
—This was your answer yesterday.
—Senator, your contribution last week indicates that you do not understand the migration program, so perhaps you could butt out and leave it to one of your colleagues who does have an interest.
—You answered this yesterday. Come clean. You were asked about this yesterday.
—Senator Evans will cease interjecting and Senator Vanstone will address her remarks through the chair.
—The leader demonstrated by embarrassing himself in the last fortnight that he did not understand the program or the figures that he was using. What I was saying to Senator Ludwig, who does have an interest in this matter, a longstanding one—and I think he does understand the issues—is that I will have a look at what he said and I will report to him later.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Skilled Migration</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2006-09-06,"—I have no advice with respect to that allegation. I will certainly look into it. People who have a visa to lawfully stay in Australia are entitled to stay here until that visa is cancelled or it expires. I can see no reason why someone should be entitled to ‘forcibly remove’ someone. However, let me leave it open, since I have no advice of this matter, and say that there may have been—I am not suggesting there was—a contractual arrangement whereby someone might have agreed to sponsor a worker and it was a part of the contract that if their wife were to go into confinement the birth would take place back home. That may be the case; I would be surprised.
—Why?
—It is simply because I do not have any information on this that I am reluctant to say any more than I will have a good look at it.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-09-06,"—Senator Allison was kind enough to indicate that she was going to ask for an explanation as to why this question had not been answered. Senator Allison, I regret to say I do not have an explanation for why it has not been answered, but I do have the answer! I therefore seek leave, Mr President, to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The answer read as follows—

QUESTION NUMBER: 1796
SENATOR ALLISON asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 15/5/2006:
With reference to the proposed new access card for health and welfare services:
What proportion of the estimated savings of up to $3 billion over 10 years is estimated to be due to fraud; and (b) can a breakdown of the figures relating to fraud be provided.
What data is available on the number of fraud incidences per year for each of the 17 health and social services programs within the Human Services portfolio that will be covered by the new access card; and (b) can this information be provided broken down by the type of fraud and program for the past 5 years.
For the past 5 years, what is the estimate of annual funds illegally obtained through fraud for each of the 17 health and social services programs within the Human Services portfolio that will be covered by the new access card (can this information be provided broken down by the type of fraud and program).
What proportion of funds is illegally obtained through fraud by: (a) service providers and their employees; (b) service users; and (c) other members of the public intent on defrauding the government.
The Minister for Human Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
The health and social services access card was not introduced as a savings measure. The savings estimate of up to $3 billion over 10 years was developed by KPMG on the basis of high level estimates of fraud and leakage, particularly in Centrelink and Medicare Australia.
(2)(a) & (b) and (3)
Medicare Australia
The available data relating to the number of fraud incidences for Medicare Australia is shown in Table 1 below. This data is not available for 2001-02 and has thus not been provided.
Medicare Australia investigates over two hundred new cases of suspected fraud each year. Where fraud can be proven, the matter is referred to the Commonwealth Director for Public Prosecution. Proven incidences of fraud are categorised only by provider, pharmacist or patient. Further categorisation by type of fraud would require close examination of case files and would be a significant project for which Medicare Australia has no assigned resources.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-09-06,"—I seek leave to incorporate a response to question on notice No. 1148 from Senator Allison which has been outstanding for some considerable time. It was dated 7 September 2005.
Leave granted.

The answer read as follows—

QUESTION NO. 1148
Senator Allison asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 7 September 2005:
Can the Minister clarify a recent statement that the Government will ensure services to customers in areas of ‘market failure’ after full privatisation of Telstra.
Are ‘areas of market failure’ determined by the Government to be in: (a) rural; (b) remote; or (c) metropolitan, areas.
What is the Government’s definition of ‘market failure’.
To what extent and how does the Government consider that the privatisation of the Telstra environment will facilitate competition in areas of ‘market failure’.
Has the Government accepted that areas of ‘market failure’, however defined, are never likely to attract competition.
Does the Government agree that the commitment to ensure services to customers in areas of ‘market failure’ provides a perverse incentive for Telstra to: (a) withhold or diminish services in these areas; and (b) impede efforts by competitors to set up service provision in these areas.
What is the extent of ‘market failure’ that has been caused by Telstra’ s prevention of other businesses from setting up services
How will the Government deal with the well-documented cases of Telstra pushing small competitors out of business when they try to establish competing businesses, particularly in regional areas in, for example, Crookwell, Bungendore and Albury-Wodonga.
How will the Government deal with excessive regulatory gaming by Telstra, whereby it effectively delays or prevents access by competitors to declared services.
What is the Government’s estimation of the effect of the proposed additional regulation on: (a) Telstra’s annual profits; and (b) Telstra’s share price.
Does the Government have a conflict of interest in protecting the shareholders from the cost of additional regulation and ensuring consumers receive the benefits of modern telecommunications infrastructure and services; if so, to what extent.
How will the Government reconcile the mutually exclusive objective of providing for effective regulation of telecommunications and maximising Telstra’s share price.
How will the Government ensure that the operational separation model for Telstra creates an incentive for Telstra to treat its retail arm and its competitors equitably.
How will the Government ensure that Telstra does not operate its retail arm at a loss by charging high wholesale prices to itself and competitors.
Will the Government give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) divestiture powers in case operational separation fails.
What were the reasons for structural separation of Telstra not being considered in the package.
Does the Government agree that the fact that Telstra is vertically integrated is the single most important factor in Australia being ranked 21st in broadband penetration in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Communications Outlook, 2005.
How does Australia compare with other OECD countries in terms of the rate of penetration of broadband, as opposed to the current rate of uptake.
Does the Government acknowledge that Australia’s rate of uptake is relatively high because it starts from a very low base compared with other OECD countries.
How does the Government’s definition of ‘broadband’ differ from other countries in the OECD.
What will the Government do about the obvious weakness [of the] anti-competitive conduct regime in the Trade Practices Act as demonstrated by the ACCC’s experience with the Telstra broadband pricing competition notice.
What will the Government do to make it easier for Telstra’s competitors to get access to reasonably-priced backhaul.
How will the Government ensure that people in regional areas where there is no competition receive better broadband services as standards improve in metropolitan areas.
What safeguards will the Government put in place to ensure that money put aside for regional areas will: (a) not simply fall back into Telstra’s hands so as to cement its monopoly in regional areas; and (b) be applied equitably and not directed to Coalition or marginal electorates.
Senator Coonan – The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:
Yes. The Government’s policy is to target assistance, in the form of funding programs, to those areas where the competitive market alone does not meet consumers’ needs for a timely, quality service at reasonable cost.
(2) and (3)
Market failure may occur anywhere where commercial incentives do not exist to provide key services to consumers at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.
(4)   Telstra’s shareholding structure has no direct effect on the existence or otherwise of market failures.
(5)   In the long term, technological and market developments have the ability to increase functionality and reduce costs for the provision of services. This can make previously unsustainable business cases commercially sustainable. Hence, the number of instances of market failure are likely to diminish over time.
While market failures continue to exist, they will continue to be addressed by the measures previously mentioned.
(6)   (a)   No.
(b)   No.
(7)   Should this conduct occur, the Government has established competition laws that are able to deal with it.
The ACCC as the competition regulator has extensive powers under the Trade Practices Act to investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute anti-competitive conduct. Under Part XIB of the Trade Practices Act the ACCC can issue a competition notice to carriers and carriage service providers with significant market power that it has reason to believe are engaging in anti-competitive conduct. Competition notices are designed to stop the conduct and open the way to substantial penalties and damages.
(8)   See the answer to question 7. The investigation of instances of anti-competitive conduct is the responsibility of the ACCC.
(9)   The Government has established a telecommunications access regime in Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act which confers rights on access seekers to obtain access to bottleneck services.
The Government has regularly made legislative amendments to close off opportunities for regulatory gaming.
The Telecommunications Legislation Amendments (Competition and Consumer Issues) Act 2005 conferred a wide discretion on the ACCC to set procedural rules for access applications under Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, with a view to speeding up the resolution of those applications. It also removed the ACCC’s obligation to consult before making an interim determination, in certain circumstances, which again removed a source of delay.
The Telecommunications Competition Act 2002 made many procedural changes to facilitate timely access determinations under Part XIC, including removing merits review of the ACCC’s final access determinations, introducing time limits for decisions by the ACCC and the Australian Communications Tribunal on access and undertakings, limiting parties’ rights to introduce new evidence on the review of the ACCC’s decisions on access and undertakings, and introducing a requirement for the ACCC to promulgate model access conditions for access to core telecommunications services which will streamline access determinations relating to those services.
Earlier, the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Act 2001 made streamlining changes to the Part XIC access regime which, among other things: required the ACCC to develop pricing principles to be applied in access determinations; introduced the option of alternative dispute resolution to quickly resolve disputes about access terms; removed access seekers’ rights to object to interim access determinations; enabled the holding of joint arbitration hearings to resolve common disputes; enabled the use of documents and information from one arbitration in another arbitration; and prevented certain decisions of the Australian Competition Tribunal from being stayed.
While taking robust action to foreclose opportunities for unjustified delaying tactics, the Government also recognises the need to ensure that parties to access proceedings are afforded a reasonable opportunity to argue their case and present evidence. This affords them procedural fairness and also facilitates the making of properly informed access decisions.
(10) The Government designs regulation to achieve the intended policy outcome in the most efficient way and without imposing any unnecessary costs or constraints on business. Regulatory action has to be accompanied by a Regulation Impact Statement (RIS) and to go through a consultation and cost-benefit analysis process.
The Government’s measures do not target Telstra’s annual profits or its share price. The measures seek to create a regulatory environment which serves the interests of consumers of telecommunications services and the Australian economy as a whole. Telecommunications businesses, including Telstra, have to operate in that environment.
(11) Yes. There is a latent conflict of interest whenever a government both sets regulations for an industry sector and has an interest in a commercial enterprise which operates in that sector. This is one of the reasons why the Government has decided to sell its remaining equity in Telstra.
(12) By selling its remaining shareholding in Telstra.
(13) In providing for the operational separation of Telstra’s wholesale, retail and network services business units with regard to the provision of designated services, the operational separation plan will have to ensure that:
there is effective organisational and operational separation between Telstra’s wholesale and retail units, as well as between those units and its key network services unit;
the wholesale unit is not able to be controlled or influenced by the retail unit; - the key network services unit provides high quality and equivalent services to the retail unit and Telstra’s other wholesale customers;
the wholesale unit maintains equivalence between the prices it charges the retail unit and the prices it charges Telstra’s other wholesale customers, and also equivalence regarding the non-price terms of supply;
Telstra establishes an internal compliance function to supervise compliance with the operational separation plan; and
Telstra meets extensive reporting requirements relating to its activities covered by the operational separation plan (which involve reporting to both the Minister and the ACCC).
Thus, the operational separation plan will work through a combination of creating incentives, mandating specific actions, and providing for ongoing monitoring.
(14) Telstra’s freedom to charge its wholesale customers high wholesale prices for declared services is already constrained by the ACCC’s access price determinations applying to those services under Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act. The price benchmarking requirement in the operational separation plan will provide transparency to the ACCC that Telstra is not favouring its own retail activities over those of its wholesale customers.
(15) Access by Telstra’s competitors to Telstra’s declared wholesale services ultimately does not depend on operational separation. It is already guaranteed by Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act.
Appropriate enforcement mechanisms are included in the Telecommunications Act. If Telstra contravenes the operational separation plan, the Minister can impose a rectification plan on Telstra. If Telstra fails to comply with the rectification plan, the ACCC can direct it to take specified remedial action. Compliance with the rectification plan is a condition of Telstra’ s carrier licence.
The Act gives the Minister the power to vary the operational separation plan from time to time. This will enable the plan to be modified if it is considered not to be working in the way that was envisaged.
Section 61A of the Telecommunications Act requires the Minister to order a comprehensive review of operational separation before 1 July 2009 and to publish and table a report of the review. The review will provide an opportunity to assess how operational separation has worked.
(16) Given the high costs and risks associated with forced structural separation of Telstra, as compared to its uncertain benefits, the Government has concluded that operational separation is to be preferred. Operational separation will provide similar benefits to structural separation, in terms of greater transparency and diminished incentives and opportunities for discriminatory treatment of non-Telstra wholesale customers, without the costs and risks associated with structural separation.
(17) No.
(18) According to the latest OECD statistics (December 2005), Australia’s broadband penetration rose from 7.7 subscribers per 100 inhabitants in 2004, to 13.8 in 2005. This compares to OECD averages of 10.2 and 13.6 subscribers per 100 inhabitants for those years. In terms of the net increase (growth) over the 2004-2005 period, Australia ranks 5th out of 30 OECD economies.
(19) Australia’s high growth rate of broadband uptake in recent times is due to a wide range of factors. On the supply side, improved availability of Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) infrastructure has underpinned strong uptake. On the demand side, changing consumer preferences and decreases in the price of broadband service packages have also fuelled strong growth, with many consumers switching to broadband from dial-up internet.
(20) The OECD’s current definition of broadband is based on subscription by technology type including digital subscriber line services, cable modem services, satellite broadband internet, fibre-to-the-home internet access, ethernet LANS, fixed wireless subscribers. The latest guidance from the OECD regarding broadband definitions is contained in paragraphs 87 to 91 of the Guide to Measuring the Information Society, Working Party on Indicators for the Information Society, 8 November 2005 (OECD document DSTI/ ICCP/IIS (2005) 6/FINAL).
The Government’s guidelines for the Broadband Connect and Metro Broadband Connect programs specify that service providers offer customers a minimum speed of 256 kilobits per second.
(21) The issuing of the broadband pricing competition notice by the ACCC was followed by a progression of price reductions by Telstra for its wholesale broadband services and culminated in the withdrawal of the notice by the ACCC in February 2005 after it was satisfied that the anti-competitive conduct had ceased. As part of the resolution of the notice, safeguard mechanisms were agreed to by Telstra, under which Telstra will give prior notice to the ACCC of retail price changes and special offers, so that the ACCC can carry out a preliminary assessment of their likely effect on competition and raise any concerns with Telstra. Various other steps were agreed to between the ACCC and Telstra to prevent a recurrence, including using independent expert advice to identify appropriate price relativities between retail and wholesale broadband prices. Telstra also offered its affected wholesale customers reduced wholesale prices and rebates amounting to $6.5 million.
The competition notice was thus effective in producing a satisfactory outcome. Telstra reduced all of its wholesale broadband prices by at least 30%, and now provides wholesale DSL services in regional areas at metropolitan rates. The ACCC has stated that it believes this will increase competition between broadband providers in regional areas.
Competition notices are a powerful aid to enforcement. They constitute prima facie evidence of the anti-competitive conduct specified in the notice, and thus facilitate the taking of enforcement action by the ACCC. The available enforcement actions for anti-competitive conduct (contained in Division 7 of Part XIB) include the following:
the ACCC can seek pecuniary penalties and an injunction from the Federal Court;
the Federal Court can award damages to any individual or company that has suffered loss or damage as a result of the anti-competitive conduct; and
any individual or company that has suffered such loss or damage can itself commence civil proceedings for damages against the perpetrator.
There are no specific procedural requirements in the legislation which pose an obstacle to the ACCC taking appropriate and timely action to enforce a competition notice.
(22) The telecommunications access regime under Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act which the Government has established ensures that there is fair access to services such as backhaul. The regime enables the ACCC to declare that for certain services Telstra must provide access to its network on fair and reasonable terms.
The ACCC has declared the domestic transmission capacity service, which can be used by regional broadband providers to access backhaul transmission capacity. Hence, this service is now subject to the access regime.
The ACCC published a high-level pricing principle in 2004 to provide guidance on how it would determine a reasonable price for transmission capacity should it be called upon to do so in the event of a dispute between Telstra and another party seeking to use its network.
The ACCC has recently indicated that it has started considering both the suitability of the existing transmission capacity declaration and its approach to pricing the transmission capacity service. The ACCC is making inquiries of Telstra and other broadband service providers to gain a better understanding of the market conditions that currently exist for transmission capacity in regional Australia. The ACCC is also examining whether further pricing guidance from the ACCC would promote more reasonable access to transmission capacity and what form any further guidance should take.
I have designated transmission as a designated service for the purposes of the Telstra operational separation plan. Subjecting the transmission service to operational separation will help to ensure transparency and equitable treatment of other service providers as regards the terms on which Telstra gives them access to the service.
(23) The Government is implementing a comprehensive communications package called Connect Australia – the major component of which is the $878 million Broadband Connect program which commenced on 1 January 2006. Broadband Connect provides subsidies to internet service providers to connect homes, small businesses and not-for-profit organisations to fast, reliable and affordable broadband services.
(24) The Government’s targeted assistance funding is available to all telecommunications providers, including Telstra. There are currently more than 45 registered Broadband Connect providers.
The Connect Australia programs are targeted towards under-served areas.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 1148</title>,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,7,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked by Senators Ludwig and George Campbell today relating to the 457 visa program.
We have again heard horror stories about employer abuse of 457 visas, but they are now continuing to pile up. It is one upon the next, upon the next. What is now more disturbing is that they are becoming more serious and more shocking as they come out. When you look at the number of 457 visas, you will see that they have increased by 66 per cent over the last two years. We have had a rise in the number of 457 visas. The 457 visa concept itself is a good initiative, but this government is making an art form of how to abuse it or how to let employers abuse it.
Today the employer sanctions bill went through, but it has a six-month introduction time before it will start to impact upon this situation. I would suggest that this government prefers that long delay so that employers can continue to abuse it. What also concerns me is that there are reports in the Age today about a person who came to Australia on a 457 visa. He first had to pay nearly $10,000 to an employment agency in China. When he got to Australia there was another $10,000 debt waiting for him which he had to repay to the employer. Those types of abuses are starting to not only be more widespread but be reflected in the media. This is a government that is not addressing the problems directly. This is a government which is allowing people to be grossly underpaid in this area, at a rate below the federal minimal award and where penalties are also seemingly not paid.
The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union calculated that that man was underpaid by nearly $400 a week based on the award rate and industry standards. You then have a situation where this person starts to be $1,100 out of pocket. The government’s answer to this is: other people in the other area might also have been underpaid. But that is not an answer to the 457 visa; it is a reflection, more likely, on the inability of this government to ensure compliance with its own laws more generally not only in the migration area but also in the Work Choices area, in their industrial relations laws or in their occupational health and safety laws. It seems to be a government that much prefers laws not to be obeyed. It will not ensure compliance because it is more convenient to ensure people get these types of jobs to help employers out. But it is not an aberration; it is a system showing the hallmark of a system out of control.
This is not how 457 visas were supposed to operate. They were intended to be used as part and parcel of a proper immigration system, but it is breaking down significantly. The aim of the Howard government’s extreme workplace relations legislation is to work hand-in-glove with Work Choices and 457 visas to drive down the wages and conditions of Australian workers. We also have the controversy surrounding the ABC Tissues work site where foreign workers employed on 457 visas were not covered by workers compensation insurance and could not fundamentally speak or read English, therefore safety signs and emergency procedures could not be followed. The government must ensure that these matters are addressed, but I do not think they want them addressed. I do not think it is a government that seriously wants these issues dealt with. When you look at the requirements for 457 visas, there is no requirement to test whether there are actual skills shortages in those areas before a company can access these visas. There is no requirement to check whether there is a glut of graduates such as in the IT sector. Even in that area, it seems to say it is okay to import foreign workers to do the work. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-09-06,"—Let me contribute to this debate by saying, first of all, I am extremely concerned about the way in which the opposition in question time today chose to use as fodder for its questions a series of matters that are obviously being investigated in Australian workplaces. The opposition is quite happy to characterise these matters as breaches of the law with respect to the use of section 457 visas and other infractions against good practice and proper dealing with such workers when the evidence on those matters for the most part is not yet clearly available to any of us—not to you, not to me, not to the minister, not to any of us. Again, we see what we saw very clearly with the Work Choices campaign run by the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party: a series of allegations thrown out willy-nilly creating an atmosphere of concern and, when the facts come in, we will all have moved onto something else.
As the minister made very clear in her remarks today in answer to questions, there is certainly the possibility that some cases have produced instances of people abusing their opportunities as employers under section 457 visas. The question here, with great respect, is not whether there are isolated cases of employers who choose to break the law; it is whether or not it is the way in which Australian employers are generally using section 457 visas. I have no hesitation in saying, despite the evidence presented today, there is absolutely no case for saying that Australian employers are using or abusing section 457 visas in the way alleged by the opposition. The vast majority of employers are using the visas appropriately to replace serious work skills shortages in this community. There is no doubt about that whatsoever.
Secondly, I reject the assertion that the government in some way is not concerned about breaches of the law. On what basis is that claim made? There have been a small number of cases drawn to the attention of the Senate. In each of those cases, the minister has indicated that she and her department are fully, properly and quickly investigating them. These issues are being taken seriously by all concerned. There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that the government does not want the laws to be obeyed or the issues to be seriously addressed, as Senator Ludwig suggested, because for some reason the government wants to allow employers to operate these sweatshops, exploit workers in this way, drive down their wages, treat them like dirt and somehow enhance the profitability of corporate Australia as a result. Those suggestions are so laughable as to put great discredit onto members of the opposition in suggesting that they could seriously be entertained in this place.
Anybody in the workforce today knows that we face significant skills shortages. They know that we have a significant problem in this country, a problem growing as each year passes. Like so many other places in the world, we have no choice but to use the services of overseas workers, guest workers, to plug employment gaps in our workforce and our economy. That has to happen. Even Senator Ludwig has acknowledged that we have to have devices like section 457 visas.
Having accepted that fact, you cannot get away from the possibility that somewhere at some time an employer may be a rogue employer, may cut corners, may split those workers and may break the law. It is one thing to say that a thing can happen; it is quite another to suggest that in some way the government condones or encourages it. It is up to the opposition to produce the evidence of that, Senator Marshall and Senator Ludwig.
—We have!
—No, you have not. You have produced no evidence of that whatsoever. You have asserted that there have been no proper investigations—there have been plenty of proper investigations. These matters have been thoroughly examined and are being examined at the present time. The allegations are being taken extremely seriously. When you indicate how they are not—that people are not being prosecuted for breaches of the law—then I will take your claims seriously. For the meantime, the government is pursuing these matters appropriately, and will continue to use section 457 visas to ensure Australians—(Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I must say, that was an incredible contribution by Senator Humphries. He is in fairyland. We on this side of the chamber have not said that every employer who is bringing employees in on 457 visas is seeking to rort the system. There are a lot of employers legitimately bringing people in to meet genuine skills shortages. The New South Wales government has been doing it with nurses. It has been paying them under the same rates and conditions as other nurses in the health industry. That is fine. There is not a problem with that. But, Senator Humphries, there is indisputable evidence that there are employers bringing people into this country on 457 visas and using and exploiting them. They are using them as cheap labour and employing them in circumstances where it is disadvantaging Australian workers.
Let us take the example of ABC Tissues; a question was asked of the minister about this in question time today. ABC Tissues brought workers in from China to install equipment in the tissue plant that is being constructed in Wetherill Park. There was labour available in this country to undertake that work. There was a company 20 minutes from the site in Wetherill Park that had installed similar equipment for the ABC Tissues company in Queensland, and whose employees had sought the contract at Wetherill Park. They did not get it. They wanted it but, instead, the company organised, through a Chinese labour hire company, to provide the labour out of China. This was brought to the attention of ABC Tissues, and was raised with the minister in a letter written on 23 May, which set out the concerns the union had with what was occurring on that site. I will only read a part of it, but the letter said:
The first matter is the exploitation of guest workers in terms of their occupational health and safety and related issues. The second issue is the fact of guest workers’ inferior wages and conditions being used as a means of undermining the wages and conditions of local workers, who were denied the contract despite the fact they had done similar work for the company on a previous site built in Queensland.
So it was drawn to the minister’s attention on 23 May. The company eventually got a meeting with the department on 23 June—it took a month to get a meeting with the department to discuss the issue! At that meeting, the circumstances of the case were again run across the department, but the case did not surface as an issue until August; the department had done nothing in the interceding month.
And what happened when there were inspections on the ABC Tissue site at Wetherill Park? What did they actually find, Senator Humphries? They found that workers were working on the roof, 15 metres in the air, with no safety rail and with no safety equipment whatsoever. They found that there were unqualified electricians handling exposed cables. They found that welders were wearing completely inadequate safety glasses. They found that there was handling of hydrochloric acid with no safety gear. They found that tools and equipment did not meet Australian standards. They found that there were no signs in Chinese on the site, despite the fact that the Chinese workers did not speak English. WorkCover said that those workers needed supervision at all times. The crowning glory was that there was one woman to interpret for all of the Chinese workers on the site, and she had to carry out administrative duties at the same time. The Labor Party are not blaming the workers, but it is obvious—
—You are blaming the government.
—Yes, we are. We are blaming the government because the government are allowing it to happen. It took the government seven years to make changes to the Migration Act in order to be able to take action against employers who are exploiting illegal workers. How long will it take the government to clean up their act in terms of properly supervising the use of these visas and the way in which employees who are brought into this country as temporary labour are looked after by the same terms and conditions as Australian workers?

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-09-06,"—In following Senator George Campbell in this debate, my only regret is that the proceedings of parliament are broadcast only on radio. I think it is about time we brought ‘Parl TV’ in because, if anyone could have seen the face of Senator George Campbell, it would have told them the real truth about what an absolute beat-up we are dealing with in relation to 457 visas. Let’s bring TV in so we can get right close up on Senator George Campbell and the speaker who is to follow me, because they are not telling the truth. They are seeking to pull down the 457 visa system. They are sullying it—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator McGauran is not able to make that claim under the standing orders.
—Senator McGauran, you will need to withdraw that comment.
—I do indeed withdraw it; I realised that I would have to as I said it, Mr Deputy President. But I am so passionate about this issue of wanting to bring in ‘Parl TV’. We would then see a few home truths when people from the Labor Party stand up and try to present a case that they and their party simply do not believe in. The Labor Party are seriously against 457 visas. If they were not, they would not attempt to sully them by making false and misleading assertions as the Labor senators and the leader—
—Which one?
—Where do I begin? Let me start with Senator Evans, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Some weeks ago, when questioning Senator Vanstone, Senator Evans created a case which was false in every line and every element: the caravan case. They are all blushing over there because I have mentioned the 457 visa case that Senator Evans raised which was utterly false. He misrepresented the facts when he said that unskilled workers had been brought in to work in a caravan park, when in fact those unskilled workers were the family of the skilled worker who was brought into this country. Senator Evans conveniently left out that particular fact. And that was not enough. Senator Evans decided that the classification of the job was ‘caravan worker’ when in fact it was ‘caravan manager’. I would be surprised if he did not know that. The position of a caravan manager is a skilled position.
It was not too long before Senator Ludwig gave the game up when he dovetailed this whole debate into the industrial relations debate. That is the key to the reason that the Labor Party continually raise this issue in the parliament. They are seeking to put fear into the minds of Australian workers by making them think that a foreigner is going to take their job and that they are going to experience lower wages—when nothing could be further from the truth. The facts are on the board: after millions of dollars have been spent, the Labor Party’s industrial relations campaign is already petering out. Spend some more—go right ahead; you have got 12 months before the next election to sell your case. I can tell you now: it is petering out, because the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The unemployment rate is 4.8 per cent and heading down, and wages are increasing. They increased in the last quarter and, as we know, over the past 10 years they have increased some 16.8 per cent.
The government reject that 457 visas are an instrument for cheap labour. It is quite the contrary. We are able to separate the abuses—and there are some. As Senator Vanstone has stated, we have followed them up with vigour on every occasion, including the case that the Age reported with regard to a Hawthorn printing company. The worker himself reported the case. I do not know where the union was at the time, but the worker had the wit to report the case to the department. The very next day, the department interviewed the workers concerned, and the case is now under investigation—as is the ABC Tissues case. Those cases will be investigated vigorously.
We are able to separate the few abuses of this worthwhile visa program—which meets the short-term skills shortages of Australia—from the absolute merit of the program. No Australian will be put aside because of this program; no Australian will have lower wages because of this program. It does meet a particular need and the states support it. Why don’t you go back to Western Australia or New South Wales and tell the premiers that you are not in favour of this scheme? Tell them that you are in here sullying the scheme with beat-up cases.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I guess that demonstration from Senator McGauran just confirms why we ought to be so worried about this scheme. He has tried to drive all the issues down to the level of a joke. We are very concerned about the abuse of the 457 visa category. We certainly acknowledge that, in areas where there is a demonstrated skills shortage, there should be such a scheme. As Senator Campbell pointed out, in the case of nurses this scheme has worked very well, and we support that. People have come in, they are not being exploited and they are receiving the proper rates of pay that apply to the other nurses in those situations.
Senator Humphries and Senator McGauran seem to be in a state of denial about the evidence that has been presented day after day in this parliament and widely in the public domain. They want to deny that there are actually problems. But there are very serious problems. The most serious problem is that you do not need to demonstrate that there is a skills shortage to apply this visa.
All the government would need to do to make this process work more appropriately and to take out most of the abuse would be to ensure that, if an employer wants to bring someone in for a skills based vacancy because they cannot fill that vacancy from within Australia, they are able to demonstrate that that is truly the case. If there were a process where the employer had to at least advertise, go through a process and demonstrate to DIMA that they had tried to fill the vacancy from within Australia, I think that would take a lot of the abuse out of the system. I cannot understand why the government will not take that very minor but absolutely important step. One would automatically assume that if you need to recruit from overseas it is because you cannot fill the position from within Australia. For those who do not even bother to do that but simply have a preference for employing people from overseas, you have to seriously question their motivation. That is what leads to the abuse, and the abuse has been demonstrated time after time.
Senator Humphries said that it is not appropriate for the opposition to raise matters that are under investigation by the department and that, in all instances, these matters are under investigation. I want to say to Senator Humphries that I think that is a little bit rich. If we look at the ABC Tissues case, back in August 2005 ABC Tissues was found to have breached a number of migration rules and regulations in terms of these visas. They were found to be in breach then. But what happened? Time after time, they were allowed to reuse the visa when they had knowingly broken the conditions. They were able to bring people in under the same visa application again, and there were simply more breaches.
I cannot remember whether Senator Humphries was here yesterday, but I assume he probably was here during question time. He would have heard Senator Vanstone say—in answer to a question I asked her—that the Hunan industrial company, which works directly for ABC Tissues, was getting a notice of intention to sanction on a number of grounds, including failing to pay the minimum salary level, failing to comply with other migration laws, failing to comply with workplace relations laws, not ensuring the necessary licensing of workers, failing to notify Immigration of relevant changes in circumstances and failing to deduct tax instalments.
Senator Vanstone has admitted these breaches in this area. These are breaches that have already occurred. So what has happened? That company, ABC Tissues and the Italian company—which Senator Vanstone did not name but referred to as the other company involved in the group of three—are continuing to be granted more 457 visas when it has been clearly demonstrated that those visas are being abused. Case after case has been put on the public record and raised here.
Senator Humphries, who obviously was not listening to Minister Vanstone yesterday, went on to ask on what basis we say that the government is not interested in ensuring that the law is upheld. We only have to point to that particular case. In August 2005 the company was found to have breached the migration laws and it is already through the process— (Time expired)

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-09-06,"—Following a briefing by departmental officials and the receipt of satisfactory responses, on behalf of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I give notice that at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for two sitting days after today for the disallowance of the Migration Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 10. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee’s correspondence concerning these Regulations.
Leave granted.

Dear Minister
I refer to the Migration Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 10. These Regulations amend the principal Regulations concerning the scope of certain powers of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the discretion of the Minister for Immigration in granting visas in certain circumstances. Following its consideration of these Regulations, the Committee raises the following matters.
Item [1] of Schedule 1 to these Regulations provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may determine, as a ground for cancellation of a visa, that the holder of a visa is a person whose presence in Australia is contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interests, or is directly or indirectly associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
According to the Explanatory Statement, the first of these two grounds has been inserted to broaden the scope of the Minister’s discretion so that it covers Australia’s broader foreign policy objectives, rather than being limited to Australia’s relationship with another country. The scope of the amended discretion appears to be very wide. The Committee therefore seeks your advice as to the meaning of the term ‘foreign policy interests’ and whether there are any limitations on this discretion. The Committee also seeks an assurance regarding the rights of appeal that can be exercised by a person whose visa is to be cancelled as a result of this discretion.
The Committee also seeks your advice as to whether the term ‘weapons of mass destruction’ is defined anywhere for the purposes of this provision.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 5 May 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson
Thank you for your letter of 30 March 2006 regarding the Migration Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument No. 10 of 2006 (‘the MAR 2006 (No. 1)’). The Committee has requested my advice in relation to the amendments made to the Migration Regulations 1994 (‘the Migration Regulations’) in particular relating to the scope of certain powers of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Committee refers to the amendments made by Item [ 1 ] of Schedule 1 to the MAR 2006 (No. 1), to paragraph 2.43(1)(a) of the Migration Regulations, relating to the prescribed grounds on which the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs may cancel a visa under paragraph 116(1)(g) of the Migration Act 1958 (‘the Act’). As amended by the MAR 2006 (No. 1), paragraph 2.43(1)(a) provides that certain visas may be cancelled where the Minister for Foreign Affairs has personally determined that the holder is a person whose presence in Australia is, or would be, contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interests, or may be directly or indirectly associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The Committee notes that the scope of the amended discretion appears to be very wide, and seeks my advice as to the meaning of the term ‘foreign policy interests’ and whether there are any limitations on this discretion.
The term ‘foreign policy interests’ as it appears in paragraph 2.43(1)(a) is not defined in the Migration Regulations. As such, the phrase is to be given its ordinary meaning.
I am advised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that prior to the amendments made by the MAR 2006 (No. 1), paragraph 2.43(1)(a) enabled the Minister to determine that a visa holder’s presence in Australia ‘is, or would be, prejudicial to relations between Australia and a foreign country’. If the Minister made such a determination, the effect would be to require the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to cancel the person’s visa. It was not clear that this formulation would allow the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a determination affecting the visas of persons representing or acting on behalf of their governments. The amended formulation of the discretion addresses this shortcoming by allowing the Minister for Foreign Affairs to determine that an applicant’s presence ‘is, or would be, contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interests’.
The Minister’s discretion has been limited such that it no longer applies to certain (mainly onshore) protection, refugee and humanitarian visas to avoid potential conflicts with Australia’s international obligations. It should be noted that the discretion under paragraph 2.43(1 )(a) can be exercised only by the Minister for Foreign Affairs acting personally.
The Committee seeks an assurance regarding the rights of appeal that can be exercised by a person whose visa is cancelled as a result of the exercise of this discretion.
Section 338 of the Act provides the legislative basis under which decisions made pursuant to the Act are merits reviewable by the Migration Review Tribunal. Under section 338, a decision to cancel a visa under section 116 of the Act is reviewable by the Migration Review Tribunal if the visa holder is in Australia (but not in immigration clearance) at the time the decision to cancel the visa is made. In certain circumstances, the visa holder may also be able to seek judicial review of the decision.
The Committee also seeks my advice as to whether the term ‘weapons of mass destruction’ is defined anywhere for the purposes of this provision. I can advise that the term ‘proliferation of weapons of mass destruction’, which is used in subparagraph 2.43(1)(a)(ii), is defined in regulation 1.03 of the Migration Regulations. The definition states that ‘proliferation of weapons of mass destruction’ includes directly or indirectly assisting in the development, production, trafficking, acquisition or stockpiling of: (a) weapons that may be capable of causing mass destruction; or (b) missiles or other devices that may be capable of delivering such weapons.
I hope that this information is of assistance to the Committee.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 9 May 2006 responding to the Committee’s concerns with the Migration Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 10.
The Committee has considered your response but considers the explanation of the term ‘contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interests’ unclear. You indicate that the phrase is to be given its ordinary meaning but it is the lack of a clear ordinary meaning that prompted the Committee’s inquiry. You advise that one example of the need for the new term is that it is intended to clarify the capacity to cancel the visa of a person who is representing or acting for their own government. It is not clear to the Committee why the original formulation did not cover this situation. More importantly, it does not appear that the new term is limited to that situation. Given these uncertainties, the Committee seeks your advice as to whether legal advice was received regarding this matter. If so, the Committee would appreciate receiving a copy of that advice.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 9 June 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Thank you for your letter dated 22 May 2006 concerning the meaning of the term ‘contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interests’, contained in the Migration Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. l), Select Legislative Instrument No. 10.
As advised by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone, in her letter to the Committee of 19 May 2006, the term ‘contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interest’ is not defined in the Migration Regulations. As such, the term is to be given its ordinary meaning, with decisions on visa applications and/or visas made personally by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on a case-by-case basis.

Thank you for your letter of 5 June 2006 concerning the meaning of the term ‘contrary to Australia’s foreign policy interests’, contained in the Migration Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 10.
In your response you advise that the term ‘is to be given its ordinary meaning, with decisions on visa applications and/or visas made personally by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on a case-by-case basis’. This response does not further the Committee’s understanding of this term. Accordingly, the Committee would appreciate a briefing by departmental officials to resolve this matter.
The Committee would like to meet with departmental officials at 8.45 am on Thursday 22 June 2006. Could you please arrange for the department to contact the Committee Secretary, Mr James Warmenhoven (6277 3066) to finalise the details for this meeting.
As a precautionary measure, and in order to allow time for further discussion on this matter, the Committee has agreed to give a notice of motion to disallow these Regulations on Monday 19 June 2006.

Dear Minister
Thank you for making a number of officials from your Department available today to brief the Committee on the provisions of the Migration Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 10.
The briefing allayed many of the Committee’s concerns and the Committee intends to withdraw its disallowance notice at the next available opportunity. Issues such as the circumstances in which the power might be exercised, and the broad categories of persons to whom it might apply, became clearer as a more detailed explanation was provided by the Department. In particular, it became clearer that the scope of the power has become wider because the wording of the previous provision did not easily cover some situations in which the power had been exercised.
The Committee considers that it would be helpful if a more detailed explanation of the provision were to be included in a revised Explanatory Statement. While such an explanation need not canvass each particular situation in detail, it would be helpful if it noted that the power is intended to be exercised only in exceptional circumstances; that it only applies to temporary visa holders or applicants; that it is intended to apply in situations where there may be some inconsistency between a visa holder/applicant’s individual circumstances and their representational capacity; and that there is an opportunity for judicial review of the exercise of the power on the ground of jurisdictional error. The need for a briefing would have been obviated had the information provided at the briefing been included in the explanatory material.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 4 September 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I rise today to speak on a matter of public importance: the collapse in the share price of Telstra since T2, and the contribution to its decline by the Howard government’s continual bungling, misrepresentation and financial incompetence on telecommunications. By now, Telstra shareholders must cringe every time they see a news report of a Howard government minister talking about Telstra. It would be an entirely understandable response. It seems that every time someone in the Howard government opens their mouth about Telstra, one way or another it is the company’s 1.6 million shareholders who are on the receiving end. Whether it is the Prime Minister’s incompetent spruiking of T2, the communications minister’s attacks on Telstra’s management or the finance minister’s botching of the announcement of T3, the Howard government is never short of a word that will hurt Telstra shareholders’ interests.
The detrimental impact on Telstra’s shareholders of the Howard government’s bungling, misrepresentation and incompetence in telecommunications started in 1999 when the government was pushing ahead with its sale of the second tranche of Telstra. The Prime Minister was travelling around the country and talking up the government’s T2 offering. John Howard, the Prime Minister, told Australians that T2 ‘will be an extremely good deal for those who get involved’. He told prospective investors that T2 was a ‘marvellous opportunity for more of the mums and dads of Australia to buy shares in this great enterprise’. The Prime Minister supported his claims by basing his T2 offer on a front-end loaded, tricked-up yield flowing from large Telstra dividends, coupled with an instalment payment structure.
However, those who listened to and believed John Howard’s claims about T2 have been badly burnt. Seven years later, Telstra’s share price is less than half its T2 retail offer price of $7.40. Small investors who bought into John Howard’s tricked-up T2 yield structure have now lost around $2 on every Telstra share they bought, even after the company’s dividend stream is taken into account. For every $1 that those small investors invested in T2, they now have just 74c left. That is right—for every $1 put into Telstra by those poor small shareholders, they now have 74c left.
I am sure that Telstra shareholders who bought into T2 on the strength of the Prime Minister’s word are now wishing that he had kept his mouth shut. I know for a fact that they were wishing that the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Nick Minchin, would have kept his mouth shut this week. The Telstra investors who have lost thousands of dollars by investing in T2 are rightly furious at Senator Nick Minchin for telling them this week that they have done very well out of T2. It is hard to know whether such a patently absurd statement is the result of economic incompetence or spectacular arrogance. It could of course be both. The fact that the minister then went on to say, ‘If they have not sold, they have not lost their money,’ simply beggared belief. Terry McCrann, in the Herald Sun, described the comment as one of ‘astonishing stupidity’, and he was dead right. Telstra shareholders would have been merely exasperated.
Clearly, Telstra investors have no chance of sympathy from this government when the minister is so out of touch that he does not even realise that his own mother has lost thousands of dollars from the T2 debacle. Senator Bernardi may well laugh, but this is the public record. Senator Minchin’s own mother has taken a bath. In fact, in question time this week, Senator Minchin hung up on his mum over Telstra and showed no sympathy for her losses or Telstra’s other 1.6 million shareholders, and they can hardly hold out for much compassion.

Senator Scullion interjecting—


Senator Colbeck interjecting—

—I hear shouts from the other side that it is a risky business. It is if you suck them in and mislead them. These people chose to believe the Prime Minister. They actually made the mistake of believing the Prime Minister when he told them it was a great buy. He did not tell them it was a risky buy; he told them it was a great buy.
However, the Prime Minister’s incompetent spruiking of T2 was only the start of the Howard government’s attack on Telstra shareholders. A more recent example of Telstra shareholders being hurt by this government’s bungling in telecommunications can be seen in the government’s gag on Telstra’s management. The government’s efforts to gag Telstra management show a government that are completely out of touch with Telstra’s shareholders. Telstra’s long-suffering shareholders rightfully want to hear from the company’s management team about the prospects for the company. However, the Howard government do not understand this. I think that they do, in truth. I actually think that John Howard’s government understand exactly what they are doing.
The Howard government feels threatened by a Telstra management that is bold enough to disagree with the government and wants to shut down the debate. The Howard government is too scared to have the policy debate about telecommunications regulation. It was only three months after the new CEO of Telstra was appointed, just over 12 months ago—I know it certainly seems longer to Senator Ronaldson—that Prime Minister Howard walked around this country and said, ‘Services are up to scratch.’ Do you remember that? We all remember that. Mr Trujillo, at a press conference just three months later, stood up and said: ‘I’ve got to tell the truth’—and these were his words—‘Telstra has underinvested in its own network. It hasn’t delivered the cutting-edge technologies that the company needs to guarantee its future profitability.’
Mr Trujillo blew the whistle on the government. That is why they hate him so much: because he has blown away the conspiracy of silence between the previous Telstra board and management, the government and the investment banking community about the true state of Telstra and where the company is at in the marketplace today. That is why, instead of having a debate about government policy, this government are trying to make Telstra executives the issue. They want to complain about Mr Trujillo, Dr Burgess and the chairman, Mr McGauchie. They want to make it look like it is all their fault. Instead of engaging in a policy debate, the Howard government are engaging in a personal vendetta against the Telstra management. The government are playing the man, not the ball, because they cannot afford to take the field of policy debate.
Once again, Telstra’s existing and prospective shareholders are set to pay the price for yet another incompetent intervention in telecommunications from the Howard government. Small shareholders go onto the scrap heap to protect the government with a glass jaw. It is completely unacceptable for the Howard government to gag the management of a public company. This is a company in which 1.6 million Australians own shares—encouraged by the Prime Minister. These Australians deserve to be kept fully aware of the company’s prospects. The market needs to be kept completely informed of Telstra’s situation. The editorial of the Australian Financial Review was 100 per cent right when it stated:
If a company of Telstra’s stature has ever made such an abject submission to the federal government in the modern era, The Australian Financial Review missed it.
The AFR hit the nail on the head when it said that the government’s gagging of Telstra management raises serious concerns about the extent of full and frank disclosure by Telstra of its true assessment of the impact of any new regulatory imposts. The AFR is right to say that regulation is important to the Telstra sale and that Telstra shareholders need to be properly informed of its impact. But don’t worry about that: this government is not going to let you hear that. It has put the fix in to make sure that Australians out there who want to understand the prospects of this company do not get told the truth.
Perpetual Investments—one of the biggest recommenders and brokers in the country—has told its clients: ‘A major factor impact in Telstra is the heavily regulated nature of the telecommunications industry in Australia. A highly regulated industry can create significant uncertainty for the companies within that industry and hence investors’. So the person whose name we are not allowed to speak, if you are a cabinet minister—Phil Burgess—has said that the idea that regulation and business are somehow two different things is a view that only a person from another planet could have.
It is critical that potential investors in T3 completely understand the impact that regulation has on Telstra’s prospects. For this to occur, Telstra management need to be free to speak their minds. Given the Howard government’s record of deception of Telstra, prospective investors in T3 need to hear both sides of the debate about the impact of regulation on Telstra’s prospects. Investors who were misled by Mr Howard’s irresponsible spruiking on T2 are right to take the government’s claims about the impact of regulation on T3 with a grain of salt. Telstra shareholders are right to want to hear the views of Telstra management on telecommunications over those of the Howard government. However, the Howard government is not interested in the interests of Telstra’s other shareholders; it is only interested in its own political interests.
Gagging the board alone was not enough for the Howard government. Gagging the management was not enough for the Howard government. In order to be able to get the T3 float away, the government needed to be able to offer investors a tricked-up dividend yield, and that meant locking Telstra into its forecast level of dividends. Never mind that Telstra will be forced to borrow to pay these artificially high dividends. Never mind that Moody’s, Standard and Poors and Citibank have all described Telstra’s forecast dividend levels as unsustainable. Can you imagine, if a Labor state government got a recommendation like that—that the government’s position was unsustainable—from Standard and Poors or Moody’s, what the public outcry would be? There would be a scandal. There would be front-page headlines and, even better, every one of those in the opposition would be screaming it from the rooftops. Never mind that the government is forcing Telstra to siphon money away from the types of capital investments which will improve the company’s prospects in the long term. Such a policy could hurt the company.
The government is not concerned with the long-term interests of Telstra’s shareholders; it is only interested in its own short-term political interests. So in the lead-up to the government’s announcement of its intentions to proceed with T3, news reports began appearing quoting government sources demanding that Telstra maintain dividend payments at its forecast levels. Newspaper articles started appearing suggesting that the government was contemplating sacking the board. The message to the Telstra board was loud and clear: fall into line on dividends or face the sack. Again, Telstra shareholder interests were not in the government’s mind at any stage during this monstering of the Telstra board. The government completely ignored the fact that in the secret briefing document provided to the government by Telstra management in August of last year, the government had been told—and these were Telstra’s words to the government in August last year:
The Telstra board has already recognised that this kind of borrowing to pay dividends is not a sustainable policy or practice ...
The government completely ignored the fact that just last month, during the announcement of Telstra’s annual results, Telstra had stated that the level of future dividends will be subject to regulatory outcomes—that was just four weeks ago. The government completely ignored the fact that since the announcement was made every regulatory decision, including the biggest one from Telstra’s point of view, the ULL pricing, went against Telstra. The government was not interested in the long-term impact that this enforced dividend policy would have on Telstra or its other shareholders. All it was interested in was its own short-term political interest. Again, Telstra shareholders will pay the price.
If gagging the Telstra management and leaning on the board over dividends were not enough, in the last two weeks the Howard government has launched a new front in its campaign against Telstra shareholders. The Howard government’s bungled announcement of the structure of the T3 sale, yet again, shows its willingness to sacrifice Telstra shareholders for its own political interests. When the government snuck out the announcement, at 5.30 on a Friday afternoon, that it would proceed with T3, it failed to provide any information about the details of any existing shareholder entitlements in T3. An observer might have thought that in the 12 months between the passage of the Telstra sale legislation and the government’s announcement of the sale structure a decision might have been able to be made on this issue. However, this important element of the T3 offer was either forgotten or purely incompetently left out of the government’s announcement of its intention to proceed with T3. I know Senator Minchin is chasing a new press secretary, but surely somebody could have managed to put the paperwork together.
That completely inept failure created the real possibility that Telstra’s share price would plummet when the markets reopened on the Monday morning. Come the Monday morning, investors would have been free to dump their existing Telstra holdings, safe in the knowledge that they would be able to buy it back more cheaply in T3. However, with those investors having read the commentary in the weekend papers warning of the risk, the government again acted incompetently to try to avert that result.
To prop up the share price when trading resumed, the government’s T3 sale team told journalists at the Australian Financial Review, the Australian, the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald that existing Telstra shareholders could expect a discount on T3 shares. In the words of the Financial Review, one individual working on the sale told the AFR on 27 August that a discount was ‘in the mix’ for the sale. This ambiguous intervention promoted speculation in the share market and was designed to prop up the Telstra share price when trading resumed. However, once the government was confident the share price of Telstra would not collapse, it began telling the very same journalists, whom it had already briefed, to play down the suggestion of a shareholder discount in T3. That is right: on Monday morning, faced with the collapse of the Telstra share price, the government put a story into the papers that said, ‘Do not sell, because there will be a discount if you hold.’ But, 24 hours or 36 hours later, the same people are on the phone to the same journalists telling them, ‘We did not really mean that, so talk it down.’ As a result, the share market has been in a state of utter confusion on the value of Telstra ever since. In relation to Telstra stock, Mr Ivor Ries, of EL and C Baillieu, notes:
The stock is suffering from chronic uncertainty because the Government has not announced any of the terms of the entitlement, so the stock is trading in an information vacuum ...
The Financial Review quoted another stockbroker as saying that if Telstra were ‘a small mining company the stock would be suspended by now’. There are some people in this chamber that know about these rules. They are going to be speaking in this debate, and I look forward to their contribution. People with financial services licences know the obligations about the marketplace, so I want to know what has been going on. We on this side would like some answers.
So, as a result of this government’s incompetence, shareholders are left in the dark because their Telstra shares are trading in a market that lacks the basic information relevant to the value of the shares. It is in this environment of uncertainty that the government is planning its final deception of prospective Telstra investors. Small investors considering participating in the upcoming T3 float should ask themselves one simple question: would I buy a used car from Mr John Howard? After hundreds of thousands of Australians were burnt in T2, small investors should take the government’s salesmanship on Telstra with more than a grain of salt.
Unfortunately, the way that the government has structured T3 creates the real possibility that small investors could be duped once again. The government’s sales pitch on Telstra relies on a tricked-up short-term dividend yield for investors in T3. By leaning on the Telstra board to guarantee a large dividend this year, while also spreading the cost of T3 shares across two payments, the government has created an artificially high short-term return for investors in T3.
There is a reason Mr John Howard is adopting this complex structure for the sale: it is designed to lure investors in with a strong up-front return. But they will get burnt a few years down the track. It is important to remember that this return is artificial and that many have questioned its sustainability. This is just like T2: retail investors buy now and pay later, but they will buy now and pay hard later for trusting John Howard. John Howard is laying a trap for small investors: buy Telstra now for the juicy yield and get burnt in two years when institutions drop the stock.
As Terry McCrann, financial adviser and financial expert has noted in the Herald Sun:
Understand that the Government is quite deliberately setting out to artificially entice you to invest. It is doing so by giving you an unsustainable supercharged dividend income.
Telstra has given T3 investors only one year’s security on its dividend payments, and then it is anyone’s guess. Both Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s agree that it will be unsustainable for Telstra to pay its current level of dividends next year. As Charlie Lanchester of Perpetual Investments has noted:
It’s certainly a concern if you are buying for the yield. There is a bit of confusion.
The simple equation for potential T3 investors is that, once the dividend drops, so does the Telstra share price. As Marcus Padley, author of the Marcus Today newsletter, has said of T3:
If yield is the only thing people are buying it for, then you would have to be extremely fearful of what price Telstra is the day after it went ex-dividend, because if people are only holding it for the yield, it’s going to get carted out ex-dividend ...
As Terry McCrann has noted, small investors who buy Telstra now for the tricked-up yield risk getting burnt in two years when the dividend gets cut and the institutions cut and run. The institutions have made their view of the T3 offer clear. These are the institutions. These are the big boys. Geoff Wilson of Wilson Asset Management noted soon after the announcement of the structure:
The way it will be structured will be very attractive from a short-term perspective.
However, Mr Wilson went on to say that he doubted that he would be in the stock in two years time. That is right: he said that he doubted that he would be in the stock in two years time. Get in, rip out the yield, rip out the dividend and then dump it. And guess who is going to be left holding the baby.
Even worse, at the same time as Telstra’s unsustainably high dividend starts to fall, the overhang of Telstra shares in the Future Fund, if the government has its way, will be dumped on the market, further depressing the share price. Just as the institutions are getting out because the supercharged dividend price is starting to go ex dividend, the Future Fund will start selling 30 per cent of the stock on the market. By dumping more than four billion Telstra shares in the Future Fund, the government has created an overhang that will depress the Telstra share price for years into the future. The Howard government’s economic incompetence has crippled this nation, and Telstra shareholders in particular, at every turn.
This is a financial scandal. This is another trap designed to mug Telstra shareholders—just as Paul Neville indicated when he said that incentives are okay and entitlements are okay, as long as they don’t ‘suck people in’. That is exactly what is going on. The chairman of your own regional telecommunications committee knows exactly what you are up to. He has blown the whistle. He says you are trying to suck in small investors, and he is dead right. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-09-06,"—When I walked in here this afternoon, I was fearful that I would see the broadcasting light on, and my fears were confirmed. That could be the only reason why we would hear the speech we had from Senator Conroy today. It was a set piece that, quite frankly, would make you wonder what is going on. Everyone knows that Senator Conroy—much to his horror—is actually the shadow shadow minister. The real shadow minister, of course, is Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne. Today’s speech was another attempt by the shadow shadow minister to justify the position that he actually does not enjoy, as we learned from Mark Latham’s book. Senator Conroy does not enjoy this portfolio but, to his great credit, he is fighting very hard to keep it.
I noted with interest that there was a lot of talk about mothers today. I am not too sure that we should be going down the path of talking about the mothers of members of parliament, but that was raised today in the context of the Minister for Finance and Administration. I pose a question: what is the difference between the mother of Wayne Swan, the member for Lilley, and Senator Conroy and the Australian taxpayer? What is the difference between those three? The difference is that the member for Lilley and Senator Conroy are quite happy to bag the living daylights out of Telstra—to bring the Telstra price down—but they are also quite happy to lump the Australian taxpayer with 30 per cent of Telstra ad infinitum. They are prepared to sacrifice with the dog, as they describe it, the Australian taxpayer through the Future Fund indefinitely, but apparently the same rules do not apply to their mothers.
This just shows the utter stupidity and hypocrisy of the position of the Australian Labor Party. What fascinates me is the difference between the member for Melbourne in the other place and Senator Conroy. If you find a position from Senator Conroy, you will find a different position from that of the real shadow minister. They have been going hammer and tongs on this for about two years. Bubbling away under the surface is a fight of some magnitude.
Today Senator Conroy talked about Telstra borrowing to pay for special dividends. He was lampooning that as being totally inappropriate. Again, the real shadow minister for communications, the member for Lilley, said this last year:
Labor welcomes today’s announcement to the Stock Exchange by Telstra that it will focus on its existing business and return money to shareholders.
That was in relation to the announced special dividend—the same special dividend that Senator Conroy was attacking here today.
It is not just in the area of special dividends where Senator Conroy and the real shadow minister for communications, the member for Lilley in the other place, are opposed; it is also in relation to regulation. In February of this year, when the government made its announcements in relation to where it was requiring Telstra to go with separation, Mr Tanner said that not only did he support the government’s regulatory framework but he claimed credit for it. He actually went on to say that it was Labor policy at the previous election. It does not really stack up, but it is always flattering to hear the other side talking positively about what you are doing. He said:
... we are strong believers in a genuine internal separation of Telstra between wholesale and retail, so we can have fair-dinkum, level-playing-field competition ...
They are the comments of the real shadow minister, the member for Lilley. Senator Conroy’s comments are totally opposed. The point I am making in relation to this is that the Labor Party is a policy-free zone in relation to communications. There are two men fighting over the one job who take an absolutely opposite view in relation to the serious matters that confront Telstra and the Australian taxpayer.
The other matter that causes me great concern is the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in relation to privatisation. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, has been talking about privatisation since the early nineties. He is the one who boasted about the sale of Qantas, CSL and the Commonwealth Bank. And he stood up in the other place, and gave speeches elsewhere, talking about the fact that he was a great supporter of privatisation and that the then Keating and Hawke governments were equally supportive. If I can find the quote I will read it. It will be just at my fingertips I hope—it is indeed, luckily.
On 24 August 1994, the then Minister for Finance, and now Leader of the Opposition, delivered a speech entitled ‘Paying for our future: the changing role of public investment’. We actually got to hear what Mr Beazley really thought about privatisation when he was being totally honest. He said:
Privatisation fits in with the Government’s broader economic imperative to create jobs ... Privatisation is not pursued because of a New Right ideology ...
He then went on:
Privatisation, for instance, can strengthen the performance of enterprises by allowing private capital injections, as happened with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank ...
—Who said that?
—It was the then Minister for Finance and now Leader of the Opposition, on 24 August 1994, in a speech entitled ‘Paying for our future: the changing role of public investment’. What honourable senators will no doubt find fascinating about the Labor Party’s present policy in relation to 30 per cent of Telstra going into the Future Fund and remaining there is that that happens to be the exact figure that the Australian Labor Party had put on their sell-down of the Commonwealth Bank. That 30 per cent rings some quite remarkable bells.
On this debate on a matter of public importance that was lodged with the Senate, I think it is a pity that Senator Conroy has not fully detailed what has been provided to T2 shareholders. I think, in the interests of completeness, he should also have inserted that there had been franking credits of some 78c, which he neglected to mention.
This motion is formulated under the guise of accountability and general business accountability, and I find it quite extraordinary that a party with its track record of public accountability and business accountability is lecturing this government in relation to the Telstra share sale. This was the government who delivered us Ros Kelly and the sports rorts affair—a classic example of public accountability. This was the government who allowed one of its own members to claim a compensation payment for a motorcycle accident that occurred out the front of this place. That government allowed him to sue himself. This is the same opposition—and they will not be in government for a long, long time—whose member was found by a royal commission to have falsely denied to the public her knowledge ‘of the affair that she was involved with’—a business affair, I hasten to add. This is the same opposition which has a building called Centenary House, about two kilometres away from this place as the crow flies, and which has allowed the Labor Party to receive some $36 million-plus extra into its own pockets. This is accountability Labor Party style, and we will not be lectured by them in relation to this matter.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,25,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-09-06,"—The Australian government’s management of the last tranche of the Telstra sale is a matter of public importance. In fact, it is a matter of public disappointment. The situation of Telstra’s share price is a complex one. The Democrats recognise that there are many factors that have affected the Telstra share price, including the dotcom crash and the worldwide trend downwards in the value of telecommunications companies. In Australia the share prices of other telcos have also dropped considerably.
However, there is no denying that Telstra shareholders from the second tranche have suffered. The Telstra share price fell from $7.40 a share, at the time of T2, to $3.64 today. And we think the federal government has to shoulder a large amount of the blame for that. Senator Minchin is reported to have said:
My mother, like many Australian investors, knows the risks of investing in the Australian share market, and those risks were pointed out in full at the time of T2.
But just how true is that? I seem to recall that the federal government at the time was heavily spruiking the sale of Telstra. The Prime Minister said:
All I can say is that buying into Telstra 2, as buying into Telstra 1, will be an extremely good deal for those who get involved.
And you will remember that, at the time, T1 was hugely undervalued by the government, and shares went up almost immediately after the float. So this message would have been heard loud and clear by those people the Prime Minister was trying to appeal to. The government promoted the sale as an opportunity for small investors, first-time investors and mum and dad investors, urging them to participate in the Australian share market. And it worked. Telstra shareholders represent 1.6 million Australian electors—far more than the shareholders of, for instance, AMP, with 900,000; Commonwealth Bank, with 740,000; or BHP Billiton, with 375,000 shareholders.
Many of the investors in the Telstra 2 sale were first-time investors—so-called mum and dad investors—who had no experience whatsoever of the stock market and, arguably, no real understanding of the risks. And why would they think it was risky? The government was telling them that this was an extremely good deal. Surely the government’s spruiking of the T2 shares was ethically wrong when it could not guarantee that the share price would be maintained or grow. In fact, what the government did then would surely be legally wrong now. Part 7 of the Corporations Act deals with insider and manipulative trading, as well as broader provisions dealing with misleading and deceptive conduct. Specifically, part 7.10, section 1041E prevents ‘false or misleading statements’ and section 1041F prevents ‘inducing a person to deal’.
It could be argued that a reasonable person might be misled into believing that statements made by ministers and other government members at the time were informed comments and predictions. While it is arguable that ministers have some protection in this respect by virtue of section 5A(4) of the Corporations Act, the protection is very limited because of section 8AT of the Telstra Corporation Act. Nonministers have no such immunity. Whether legal or not, the question of whether it was ethically wrong, I would argue, remains.
The government are now planning to sell 20 per cent of the shares to a new lot of investors. They are doing so at rock-bottom prices and are obviously feeling quite guilty about the treatment of T2 shareholders, as they are contemplating a discount or some other incentive to existing shareholders. The government have been accused—rightly, I think—of using speculation to prop up the share price. But just how responsible is this? I think this is a matter the Senate should concern itself with. Don Gimbel, who has been managing funds on behalf of Australians and Americans for 40 years, told the Sydney Morning Herald: ‘To try and flog this on ma and pa is a disservice to the Australian people.’
It is the opinion of the Democrats that the government’s decision to proceed with the float of $8 billion worth of shares in Telstra is foolish and incompetent; we have said that on a number of occasions. This massive float will drive share prices down even further, and institutional investors will snap up shares at bargain basement prices and the little guy will not benefit at all, in our view. Parking 30 per cent of the shares in the Future Fund is likely to have a further dampening effect on the share price.
But the threat to Telstra shareholders does not stop there. One of the arguments the government have made for selling Telstra is about the situation of being owner and regulator—that it is in conflict and untenable. The government have argued that they will be in a better position to regulate Telstra and the telecommunications market once they are no longer shareholders. Presumably the result of ‘better regulation’ will be a weakening of the monopoly power of Telstra, which will presumably drive down the share price. Yet wouldn’t it be politically damaging for the share price to go down, given that a potential 2.5 million mums and dads may own Telstra shares? And, if the government are mindful of the political fallout, will they in fact appropriately regulate? The conflict of interest here remains. In fact, it has perhaps become even worse than prior to any of the tranches of Telstra privatisation.
We say that the government has well and truly bungled the management of Telstra. It has shown itself to be ideologically driven on privatisation, despite the absurdity of proceeding in the current climate. Australian shareholders and Australian taxpayers should be angry. They have a sale with no guarantee of protection for consumers, they have a sale with no guarantee that broadband will be rolled out and they have no influence over Telstra. This situation is likely to get worse, not better.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,25,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-09-06,"—I came here this afternoon prepared for a serious debate on the sale of Telstra and Telstra generally, but I must say, having heard Senator Conroy, that I have never experienced a more confused, illogical and hypocritical contribution than that which Senator Conroy gave today. It was a contribution that could rightly be described as a boondoggle. I do not want to be personally insulting to Senator Conroy—he is a nice enough sort of fellow and quite friendly—but he really should stick to things that he knows, such as stacking branches in the Victorian Labor Party or going back to driving trucks or whatever he did in the Transport Workers Union before he came here.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Is that what it was? I thought he was a truck driver; he was pretty big in the truckies union. That is what he should stick to and he should stay away from the things that he quite clearly does not understand. His contribution quite dramatically demonstrated a complete lack of understanding—indeed, an ignorance—of the financial markets and the share markets. In fact, Senator Conroy’s speech and contribution was downright insulting to the investors in Telstra and those who are considering investing in Telstra.
If there is a problem with the price of Telstra at the moment—and I emphasise ‘if there is’—you can lay the blame directly at the feet of people like Senator Conroy and Mr Wayne Swan, who have been consistently running down the company and raising issues that are not real issues and doing whatever they can to reduce the value of the company. You have heard from Senator Conroy this afternoon and about Mr Swan saying that he would not recommend these shares to his mother or to the people of Australia. Having said that, Mr Swan wants all the Australian public, through the Future Fund, to be kept as owners of the shares. The arguments are just so illogical and contradictory that it is difficult to fathom which angle the Labor Party is coming from.
It would appear from the argument the Labor Party are proposing that, every time they talk about their three mines uranium policy, that may have an impact on those mum and dad investors who invest in shares of uranium exploration companies. Perhaps every time the Democrats and the Greens get up and attack the forestry industry they might be having an impact on those mums and dads who have quite wisely—in my view, although I am not a financial adviser—acquired shares in any number of the forestry companies around the place.
There was some suggestion that comments by the Prime Minister might have affected the sale price of T2. I do not think that is right. I want to quote this paragraph from a letter from the then Minister for Finance and Administration, John Fahey, that came with the prospectus for T2. I want to quote it in full because it clearly identifies the government’s position and it is an appropriate statement from the government:
Investors should be aware that the value of instalment receipts and shares can go down as well as up, and that an investment in Telstra is not guaranteed by the Commonwealth. You should read this offer document carefully, and the separate Appendices if you wish, before you make any investment decision. You should consult a Stockbroker or financial adviser if you are unsure about whether to invest in Telstra.
You cannot get anything clearer than that and that is, of course, the way everyone enters into investments in the share market. In recent times, I have bought and sold a few shares—not always successfully—but if they go down, I do not turn around and blame the government. I do not even blame the Labor Party or the Greens. These are decisions that I, as an investor, make and I suggest they are decisions that every investor will make. As I say, I think that Senator Conroy is downright insulting to investors to suggest that they enter into share investments without properly considering what is happening.
The hypocrisy of the Labor Party is identified and highlighted again by what is almost their passion for stopping the sale of Telstra, I might add while the coalition is in government. We all know that Mr Beazley, when he was the Minister for Finance, actually got his department to put up a submission for the privatisation and sale of Telstra. Every time the debate about privatisation and sale of government assets comes up, it amazes me that the Labor Party cannot remember the days when, having promised before an election not to privatise the Commonwealth Bank, immediately they won government after that promise, practically the first thing they did was to privatise the Commonwealth Bank. That was supported, I might say, at that time by the opposition because it was the right decision. But the Labor Party made it.
Not only did they privatise the Commonwealth Bank; they privatised Qantas, CSL and ADI—all, I would suggest, appropriate things to do in an economy like Australia’s, which was undergoing economic reform. That was the right thing to do, they were right to consider it and, had they remained in government, I will guarantee you that they would have sold Telstra long before this. They would have been able to do it perhaps at a share price of $7.40 because the opposition, had we then been in opposition, would have supported it because we know that it is good for Australia and good for our economy. But the Labor Party continue to play this charade here that, having privatised just about everything else that was left standing, they would not privatise Telstra. I have said this many a time: if the Labor Party had won any of the last few elections or if they happen to win one in the future and Telstra is not by then privatised—and it will be—the first thing they would do would be to sell Telstra. We know from experience just what their comments mean when it comes to selling or not selling.
Senator Conroy then, as part of his scattergun approach, started talking about the services of Telstra not being up to scratch. I remember the days when the Labor Party used to run the government instrumentality of Telstra or whatever it was then called. The services in those days before privatisation were just appalling. Instead of leading the world, as Australia now does in telecommunications, we were dragging along well at the end of the chain. As someone who lives in country Australia and who travels very regularly in remote parts of this country I can say to you that the telecommunications service we have here is brilliant and it is better than most others anywhere else in the world.
I know that this is not always a popular argument to take to the country. There is some concern, I acknowledge, in places about Telstra not being privatised but, when you sit down and discuss the issue with those who have that view and ask them how services have been improved in recent years, most will grudgingly agree that Telstra have done a magnificent job in the recent past. They can always do better, and they will, but it should not be left up to a private commercial company to provide services that perhaps are not profitable. That is a job for government to do by subsidy and it is a job that this government will continue to do. It should not be a matter for a commercial operation to have to fund. Our government will continue to do that, but you can be assured from Labor’s approach to rural and regional Australia that, were Labor ever again to attain government, the first thing they would do would be to cut the subsidies to rural and regional Australia in telecommunications and other areas. Labor’s matter of public importance today is really a mishmash of ideas. It has not been well argued and it is not an argument that I think the Senate should take much more notice of. (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2006-09-06,"—I think we are all very privileged that Senator Conroy has raised this issue today because we have actually seen the birth of a new branch of economic theory. I would like to call it, for want of a better word, ‘roosternomics’. I refer to it as ‘roosternomics’ not because of the description given to Senator Conroy and a few of the other roosters by Mark Latham and not even because of the cocksure and theatrical manner in which Senator Conroy delivered his sterling address to this chamber and to the people at home; I call it ‘roosternomics’ for the simple reason that the rooster always takes credit for the sun rising. So small and so limited is the rooster’s intellect and grasp of the laws of physics—in this case, the motion of the earth—he insists that he is responsible for the rising of the sun. The only way that Senator Conroy’s arguments can be sustained is if ‘roosternomics’ takes both sides of the equation. Senator Conroy is not alone in adhering to ‘roosternomics’, because the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, is also a proponent of it. According to Mr Beazley, if we sell our Telstra shares, or if we sell them and park some in the Future Fund, there is going to be an overhang, the share price will fall and the investors will suffer. But, of course, if we decide not to sell the shares and park them in the Future Fund, the market will say there is excessive regulation and it is hamstringing the ability of the company to compete on an equal footing.
‘Roosternomics’ is not limited to Telstra. The opposition’s basic philosophy goes like this: ‘When we are in government we can sell 11 different companies’—Senator Macdonald talked about some of them like CSL and the Commonwealth Bank—‘we can sell the family silver but, rather than investing that money in productive enterprises, what we are going to do, according to “roosternomics”, is pour it into a black hole—a $96 billion black hole that existed in 1996.’ But of course they will not acknowledge that there is a black hole. They will deny it, as Mr Beazley did. He said in 1998 that there was no black hole and no $10 billion deficit. But, of course, the undeniable truth came out when Gareth Evans, a former senator, said that the deficit in 1995 and 1996 was actually $10.3 billion.
Once again, ‘roosternomics’ has both sides of the argument. The theory goes like this: you can spend your way to prosperity, you can continue to spend and spend, and you will eventually get richer. It does not work like that. The world does not work like that. You have to save and you have to invest. Part of investment for Australians is in the share market. We are one of the great share-owning democracies. We have a very clear and straightforward corporations law which, for prospectuses for initial public offerings on the share market, spells out very clearly the risks of investment. We have professional advisory services across the country which people can avail themselves of. But it is not enough to be condemned for not disclosing the risks to shareholders on behalf of Senator Conroy, because I think what he is doing is having a shot at the other ‘roosternomics’ advocate, Stephen Smith. I would like to quote what Mr Smith when he was the shadow minister for communications in 2000. He said:
... shareholders in Telstra, like shareholders in any company, purchase shares with their eyes open and they take the consequence of the market going up and the market going down ... they buy with their eyes open and, like everyone else, they take their chances in the marketplace.
That is ‘roosternomics’, isn’t it? We have another conflicting opinion based on both sides of the argument. As a professional investor, and previously as a professional adviser, I have endured the vicissitudes of the market and taken them with equanimity. You just have to accept it. But, of course, the mum and dad investors do not always have that same approach to it, and so they rely on professional advice.
Senator Allison was talking before about how we overcharged the people of Australia under the Telstra 2 sale. I go back to 1999, again, and Senator Allison is actually on the record as quoting an analyst saying that they were expecting an increase of up to 40 per cent, windfall gains for the investors in Telstra 2. So, whilst she acknowledges all the analysts now, she was prepared to ignore what they were saying earlier on. Senator Allison made these comments in the context of saying we should have charged more for Telstra 2. That is quite contrary to what she is saying now. She may not be a fully paid-up member of the ‘roosternomics’ fan club, but she is certainly on her way to getting there.
The other quote that I think we need to bear in mind today is from Terry McCrann. Mr McCrann has been quoted extensively by the Labor Party from some of his recent judgements, columns and articles about our performance in selling Telstra and offering it to the public to make it a more flexible, positive and dynamic company. In an article headlined ‘Coonan should take a bow, Beazley should bow out of it’, Mr McCrann makes a number of claims but the essence of it is this:
Beazley set the tone for his opposition colleagues, all of whom have distinguished themselves with observations ranging from the inane to the utterly irrelevant.
I think that sums up pretty eloquently the case of ‘roosternomics’—the inane to the utterly irrelevant. We have Senator Conroy standing up and deciding that he will be the champion of the mum and dad investors. Let me tell you now that the champion of the mum and dad investors is this government. This government has put more wealth into the pockets of everyday Australians and done more to lower taxes for Australian men and women than any government in Australia’s history. This government has done more to encourage investment in superannuation, which encourages strong investment in our share market, which provides much-needed capital for the development of Australia and our positive economy as it is going forward.
I consider us very privileged to have seen the birth of this new economic theory. It has been a long time in gestation but, while the rooster makes a lot of noise, he does not deliver much. That is why there is only one in every henhouse; they do not lay any eggs and you get no service from them. That is what will happen with the Labor Party. If they ever get into government, the people of Australia will be utterly dismayed at their performance.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I present the seventh report of 2006 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Committee Alert Digest No. 9 of 2006, dated 6 September 2006.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In tabling the committee’s Alert Digest No. 9 of 2006 and seventh report of 2006 I wish to draw the Senate’s attention to the amendments made to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. These amendments raise no issues within the committee’s terms of reference. However, as the committee has noted on page 12 of its Alert Digest No. 9 of 2006, the amendment to proposed new subsection 76(1), inserted by item 202 of schedule 1 of the bill, addresses a concern raised by the committee in its commentary on the bill in Alert Digest No. 5 of 2006. In that digest the committee expressed concern that the proposed new subsection would give the minister an unfettered discretion to delegate certain functions or powers to ‘a person’. Since its establishment, the committee has consistently drawn attention to legislation that allows significant and wide-ranging powers to anyone who fits the all-embracing description of ‘a person’. Generally, the committee prefers to see a limit set, either on the sorts of powers that might be delegated or on the categories of people to whom those powers might be delegated. The committee’s preference is that delegates be confined to the holders of nominated offices or to members of the senior executive service.
In this case, the committee noted that the proposed new subsection was expressed in the same terms, in this respect, as the existing subsection, and that as a result it may have been thought that the ministerial discretion required no justification. The committee also noted that the existing provision was enacted when the act was first passed, in 1976, before the establishment of this committee. In his response to the committee the minister confirmed that no thought had been given to amending the subsection, as it was in the same terms as the existing provision. However, the minister undertook to seek further advice on the issues raised by the committee and to give consideration to whether amendments should be made to meet the committee’s concerns. The amendment to proposed new subsection 76(1) of the bill stipulates that the functions and powers in question may be delegated to ‘the secretary of the department or an SES employee or acting SES employee of the department’. I am pleased to note that the minister’s word is his bond and, on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank him for this amendment, which addresses the committee’s concerns.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I present the seventh report of 2006 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Committee Alert Digest No. 9 of 2006, dated 6 September 2006.
Ordered that the report be printed.

That the Senate take note of the report.
In tabling the committee’s Alert Digest No. 9 of 2006 and seventh report of 2006 I wish to draw the Senate’s attention to the amendments made to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. These amendments raise no issues within the committee’s terms of reference. However, as the committee has noted on page 12 of its Alert Digest No. 9 of 2006, the amendment to proposed new subsection 76(1), inserted by item 202 of schedule 1 of the bill, addresses a concern raised by the committee in its commentary on the bill in Alert Digest No. 5 of 2006. In that digest the committee expressed concern that the proposed new subsection would give the minister an unfettered discretion to delegate certain functions or powers to ‘a person’. Since its establishment, the committee has consistently drawn attention to legislation that allows significant and wide-ranging powers to anyone who fits the all-embracing description of ‘a person’. Generally, the committee prefers to see a limit set, either on the sorts of powers that might be delegated or on the categories of people to whom those powers might be delegated. The committee’s preference is that delegates be confined to the holders of nominated offices or to members of the senior executive service.
In this case, the committee noted that the proposed new subsection was expressed in the same terms, in this respect, as the existing subsection, and that as a result it may have been thought that the ministerial discretion required no justification. The committee also noted that the existing provision was enacted when the act was first passed, in 1976, before the establishment of this committee.

That the Senate take note of the document.
The audit report Export certification: Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, which was tabled today, provides additional weight to the call by Labor, and by the New South Wales Farmers Association, for a thorough overhaul of Australia’s quarantine arrangements and the organisations responsible for managing them.
This particular audit report examines the performance of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service as the body responsible for certifying that our exports meet the health and quarantine requirements of importing countries. This is a most important function. Australia exports $32 billion worth of meat, dairy, fish, horticulture, grain, live animals and organic products each year. Around $21 billion worth of these exports require a certification by AQIS that they meet the health and quarantine requirements of importing countries.
Over many years Australia has developed a well-earned reputation as a reliable source of high-quality, safe food and fibre products. Importing countries have relied on the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to guarantee that quality. AQIS is held in high esteem in the international marketplace and considerable value is put on the AQIS stamp. AQIS has earned its high reputation but it cannot be allowed to rest on its laurels.
In the report tabled today the Auditor has identified a number of areas of concern about the way AQIS performs this important task of certifying our agricultural exports. I urge the government to read this report closely and to action any of the areas of concern raised by the Australian National Audit Office. The areas of concern fall into three broad categories: to improve guidance to industry, to assure audit quality and reliability, and to improve management reporting and performance information. I want to deal briefly with each of these areas.
The Audit Office gave AQIS a tick for the fact that current export control orders are less prescriptive and better focused on industry needs than in the past and agreed that this had simplified and assisted compliance with regulatory requirements. However, it also found that AQIS guidance programs for industry and staff were in some cases out of date or only available in draft form. This is just not good enough. Industry and staff have a right to expect that information provided by AQIS is accurate and up to date. The Audit Office also found that the guidance material that is up to date and available is not being broadly communicated. Presumably, this means that in some cases staff and industry are unaware of its existence. The auditor recommends that AQIS review and improve the availability of export and licensing information. This is a sound recommendation and ought to be taken up immediately.
In terms of assuring audit quality and reliability, it is of real concern that the auditor raised as a central issue AQIS’s management of industry compliance in terms of the consistency and quality of its assessments and decisions. The Audit Office found that, while AQIS has some systems to facilitate audit quality and reliability, the extent to which they were used varied between export programs. This, according to the auditor, ‘limits management assurance on audit quality and reliability’.
It is interesting that the report finds that the exception is the meat export program, where there are good quality-assurance measures in place. If there are good procedures in place within the meat program, there is no reason why good procedures cannot be put in place to guarantee the quality and reliability of other programs. Once again, the issues raised by the auditor should be addressed as a matter of some urgency; in particular, the recommendation that all assurance arrangements should be strengthened by capturing and assessing data on the extent and cause of variations between the quality assurance procedures used in the different programs.
On the question of better management reporting and performance information, most of the systems AQIS uses to determine whether required standards are being met are regionally based or are managed by third parties. There is no overall system for capturing and routinely reporting data on the quality control audits, result, compliance or corrective action. This means that senior management are not getting the information they need to map and respond to trends or patterns in noncompliance or associated risks.
Clearly better data collection and information management systems are needed. Also needed, according to the auditor, is a system of key performance indicators, which would enable senior management and industry to determine how well AQIS is doing its job, particularly in the area of ensuring compliance with regulations and industry requirements. Such indicators would help in alerting management to areas of the organisation where performance could be improved.
A large proportion of Australia’s $32 billion agriculture export market relies for its continuing existence on our reputation for delivering high-quality, safe products. In most cases it is AQIS that provides the guarantee of that quality. I urge the government to closely examine this important report and to respond to its recommendations as a matter of some urgency. This is a very important sector of Australia’s export market.
The opposition and farmer organisations have been rasing serious concerns about the operation of Australia’s quarantine arrangements for some time. We are not saying that the system has completely broken down. Clearly, in many areas, the system serves the country well, but there is room for improvement in many others. This report provides further evidence that it is time for a thorough review of our quarantine arrangements to ensure that we have the best organisational structures and systems in place to meet our needs now and into the future.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2006-09-06,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the reports.
In support of this motion, I want to make what I think are some important remarks. Annual reports place on the public record a great deal of information about government departments and agencies and they are an important element of accountability to parliament. The information provided in annual reports is intended to assist parliament in the effective examination of the performance of departments and agencies and the administration of government programs. They are a key reference document and a document for internal management. It is unusual for a senator to speak to a report on annual reports, but I want to underline their important function and how they can be neglected as an important accountability measure. I also want to spotlight the work being done by the Judge Advocate General.
It is of vital importance to have effective machinery that allows independent statutory bodies to alert the minister, the parliament and the public to their concerns. The requirement for the Judge Advocate General to prepare for, and provide to, the Minister for Defence a report relating to the operation of the Defence Force Discipline Act strengthens the JAG’s independence and enables his office to perform its oversight role more effectively. The JAG is able to draw to the minister’s attention and alert the parliament to problems with the operation of the Defence Force Discipline Act and make recommendations to rectify shortcomings. This report demonstrates the importance of this function and the effectiveness of the JAG’s report. The JAG said in his report:
In raising matters in the annual reports, successive JAGs have endeavoured to flag for parliament and the Service Chiefs important issues that need to be addressed ... it will be necessarily apparent that practically all of the suggestions and recommendations made over the years have subsequently been introduced. Regrettably, however, it has often taken subsequent intervention, such as the recent inquiry into the Effectiveness of Australia’s Military Justice System, for that to occur. By the time of this intervention, several years will inevitably have passed and what was originally a matter of keeping the legislation up to date with developments in the law within Australia and overseas becomes, instead, an issue of serious concern.
The JAG noted that there is no formal mechanism for matters raised in the annual report to be formally considered and responded to. In his view, this arrangement is a ‘serious deficiency which defeats the self-regulating purpose of the JAG’s report’. He referred to his previous report, the 2004 report, in which he expressed concern that his report—and the purpose of his report: providing parliament with an independent report relating to the operation of the Defence Force Discipline Act—was not fully appreciated.
One of the reasons I decided to speak to the Senate about the JAG’s report is to highlight the JAG’s view on the lack of attention given to his report and how a valuable accountability measure can be overlooked. His observation applies not only to his report but also to the many annual reports presented to the parliament by key statutory bodies that have this important oversight function. In his report the JAG said:
... if used properly, the JAG’s annual report is an important part of the self-regulating machinery designed to keep the Defence Force Discipline Act, and the discipline system as a whole, current.
The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee noted the JAG’s observations that, under his reporting regime, there is no mechanism for the government or the ADF to respond to recommendations in his report. This is clearly an area that warrants serious consideration for reform. The committee is aware that the Australian Defence Force is undergoing a period of reform, including the establishment of a permanent military court and associated changes. It is important to ensure that the oversight and reporting role now filled by the JAG continues after the establishment of the Australian Military Court. Indeed, the JAG stressed the importance of a report such as his in ‘maintaining the jurisprudential currency of the military justice system’. He noted:
If the report is to be discontinued, it is important that some other mechanism be put in its stead.
The committee strongly supports the JAG in his view. The JAG raised a number of other significant matters with respect to the independent oversight of the operation of the Defence Force Discipline Act and related legislation, particularly in light of the proposed permanent military court, which includes factors that underline the security of tenure of judicial officers, renewable fixed terms and the conditions for termination of appointment. The committee believes that these matters warrant the closest attention and should be a key consideration when decisions are finally taken on the creation of the court. The JAG also referred to delays in bringing matters to trial. Again, the committee has taken notice of the JAG’s comments and will monitor progress in this area vigorously.
The legislation to establish the court has not yet been introduced into the parliament. Nonetheless, the committee notes the JAG’s concerns and will pursue them as part of its role in scrutinising the implementation of reforms to Australia’s military justice system. Furthermore, the committee believes that the views and recommendations of the JAG contained in this and previous reports should be a central consideration for those in the ADF and the government who are involved in implementing reforms to Australia’s military justice system.
The committee considers that the JAG’s statutory independence provides an effective mechanism for making the types of observations and recommendations contained in this report. The statutory position of the JAG’s office—outside the military chain of command—provides the greatest possible guarantee of impartiality and independence. This report is an example of how independence and impartiality can improve the overall function and accountability of the military justice system. The committee welcomes and endorses the JAG’s active stance in suggesting improvements to the military justice system and it also welcomes the JAG’s initiative of providing public information regarding the operation of particular aspects of the military justice system.
It is crucial that, under the reforms now taking place, the oversight and reporting function now filled by the JAG continues into the future. The committee has on previous occasions advocated that the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force have the same reporting regime as the JAG. Indeed, the JAG’s report provides an ideal model and underscores the many benefits that would result from a separate annual report by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force to the minister. It would allow the same objective and frank assessment of the health of Australia’s military justice system, as shown in the JAG’s report on the discipline system. It would allow the necessary oversight free from the influences of the ADF, provide vital feedback to the Australian Defence Force on the strengths and weakness of the military justice system and inform the parliament about the effectiveness of the system as a whole.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legislation Committees</title>,COMMITTEES,29,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I too want to take note of the committee reports on the examination of annual reports tabled by 30 April 2006. In particular, I want to comment on the annual report of the Judge Advocate General. It is probably unsurprising that, once again, there is clear evidence of government inertia with respect to the ongoing reform of military justice within the Australian Defence Force. This was initially highlighted some two or three weeks ago when there was a six-monthly review by the relevant Senate committee into military justice changes. Now this report of the Judge Advocate General draws quite similar conclusions. Together they show us and interested observers that true reform is still a long way down the pike. The government has been making some note of a significant number of reforms fast-tracking change within the military justice system, but both the Senate committee report and this report of the Judge Advocate General show that some of that fast-tracking is illusory at best. The JAG report and the previous Senate committee report of a fortnight ago identify significant cultural and procedural issues that continue to undermine the success of institutional reform. They show how the government needs to implement institutional change and so give effect to public comments by the government, by the Minister for Defence and by the Chief of the Defence Force.
Who is the Judge Advocate General? He is a High Court judge or a Supreme Court judge, serving or retired, whose office provides civilian judicial oversight of Defence Force discipline and plays a role in the legal welfare of the Australian defence forces. It is a very important position with significant responsibilities. As such it has the capacity to play a pivotal role in the implementation of changes to military justice which remain an ongoing sore point. The military justice inquiry last year found systemic flaws and abuses within the system. In its report it made a number of recommendations to improve the system, such as setting up a permanent military court and appointing a director of military prosecutions. The government response to that military justice inquiry report accepted a number of recommendations. But the government response, tabled at the time by Senator Hill, baulked at implementing other major reforms such as agreeing to civilian authorities investigating alleged criminal activity within the armed forces. Hence these issues continue to plague the system.
To help overcome this, and to perhaps encourage ongoing reform, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee was asked to do a series of six-monthly reviews to assist the government to keep on track in terms of its commitment to and implementation of reforms within military justice. The first review in June of this year identified a number of major shortcomings in the government’s implementation of reform. It found that reform was inordinately slow; that there was a prevailing culture within the Australian defence forces that could undermine the success of current reforms; and that there was a significant number of new and ongoing correspondents making continuing complaints to the committee. It is time to give the same committee the ability to review the annual report of the Judge Advocate General because both provide damning evidence that the government’s commitment to reforming military justice shows perhaps a lack of substance.
Some of the main concerns flagged by the Judge Advocate General and considered by the Senate committee go to the independence of the JAG office. The JAG says this is compromised by being bankrolled by Defence legal. The government initially agreed the office would be removed from Defence legal and devolved to a more appropriate place—that is, the office of the Vice Chief of the Defence Force. That has not happened yet despite commitments in writing. I suggest that is further evidence of government inertia in terms of implementing reform. The JAG went on to say that the government continues to be slow to act on recommendations made in the JAG’s annual reports. That was an ongoing problem. The Senate committee has backed up the JAG’s concerns that there remains no formal mechanisms for matters raised in the annual report to be responded to. The Judge Advocate General publishes a report, it is tabled in the parliament, it identifies a range of problems or issues that need resolution but there is no formal mechanism—or no requirement in legislation or regulations—for government to respond to those recommendations of the JAG. That is an ongoing problem. As the Judge Advocate General says, that system, which by design fails to result in change, defeats the very purpose of the Judge Advocate General making reports—which is that they are supposedly self-regulating.
Finally, whilst he welcomed the creation of the DMP—the Director of Military Prosecutions—the Judge Advocate General made the very pertinent point, which the Senate committee endorses, that he was concerned that the role remained within the chain of command. He said it was preferable for that very important position to be independent with its own budget, thereby avoiding any perception that resources might be limited because of command influence. That is a critical point. If you are going to have judicial oversight, it needs to be separate, it needs to be funded properly and it needs to be independent in its operations. If the serving responsible officers in charge of that operation are part of the chain of command then by definition they have conflicting responsibilities—firstly, to themselves, their career and the armed forces; and, secondly, to the obligations imposed upon them. I am not so sure that the current system provides a suitable way for those conflicting responsibilities to be resolved.
The Senate committee in considering that also backed up the JAG’s concern about the independence of the proposed Australian Military Court. It made reference to safeguards to ensure that the military court’s independence included security of tenure and independence of salary of serving judges. Again, the government has failed to assure this important forum. So whilst it makes a lot of noise about implementing reform and it makes the appropriate statements in public, when it comes to the issue of introducing legislative change to achieve that reform—and a fundamental way of doing so is to ensure that the senior officers who have judicial oversight are truly independent and not part of the chain of command—the government baulks. Finally, in that context the JAG made the obvious comments that there is a lack of wisdom about appointing judicial officers to boards of inquiry. These boards of inquiry do not have judicial power and by definition are constrained in their terms of reference.
Appointing a judicial officer to these administrative inquiries undermines the legal integrity of that officer. Indeed the committee considered that and supports the recommendations and findings of the Judge Advocate General in that respect. It heeds its warning about a lack of independence of the Australian Military Court, security of tenure for judicial officers and no real measure by which the government is able to respond to the JAG’s recommendations, even if it is so inclined. The JAG and the Senate committee further call on the government to strengthen the independence of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force. This could also be done by ensuring the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force has the capacity to make an independent report, as is the case with the Judge Advocate General.
That would be in part a measure of just how committed the government is to true reform of the military justice system, but I must say, in conclusion, that evidence is that progress of reform, if any, is at best slow. A lot of the legislative response that has been put on the table, when one examines the detail, shows perhaps the opposite is occurring when the relevant senior officers do not have separate tenure, are part of the chain of command, do not have their own budget, do not have their own reporting capacity and, when they do make reports in their annual reports, the government of the day is not obligated in any way to respond.
So the government needs to pay more attention to ongoing reform of military justice within the Australian defence forces. It is fair to comment that a lot of the spin that has been coming out of late does not serve any real purpose. It gives the appearance of acting but in fact covers up or hides. We suggest—and the Senate committee is of the view—that the government must act on the JAG’s recommendations contained in his report to ensure that there is true cultural and—

If the serving responsible officers in charge of that operation are part of the chain of command then by definition they have conflicting responsibilities—firstly, to themselves, their career and the armed forces; and, secondly, to the obligations imposed upon them. I am not so sure that the current system provides a suitable way for those conflicting responsibilities to be resolved.
The Senate committee in considering that also backed up the JAG’s concern about the independence of the proposed Australian Military Court. It made reference to safeguards to ensure that the military court’s independence included security of tenure and independence of salary of serving judges. Again, the government has failed to assure this important forum. So whilst it makes a lot of noise about implementing reform and it makes the appropriate statements in public, when it comes to the issue of introducing legislative change to achieve that reform—and a fundamental way of doing so is to ensure that the senior officers who have judicial oversight are truly independent and not part of the chain of command—the government baulks. Finally, in that context the JAG made the obvious comments that there is a lack of wisdom about appointing judicial officers to boards of inquiry. These boards of inquiry do not have judicial power and by definition are constrained in their terms of reference.
Appointing a judicial officer to these administrative inquiries undermines the legal integrity of that officer. Indeed the committee considered that and supports the recommendations and findings of the Judge Advocate General in that respect. It heeds its warning about a lack of independence of the Australian Military Court, security of tenure for judicial officers and no real measure by which the government is able to respond to the JAG’s recommendations, even if it is so inclined. The JAG and the Senate committee further call on the government to strengthen the independence of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force. This could also be done by ensuring the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force has the capacity to make an independent report, as is the case with the Judge Advocate General.
That would be in part a measure of just how committed the government is to true reform of the military justice system, but I must say, in conclusion, that evidence is that progress of reform, if any, is at best slow. A lot of the legislative response that has been put on the table, when one examines the detail, shows perhaps the opposite is occurring when the relevant senior officers do not have separate tenure, are part of the chain of command, do not have their own budget, do not have their own reporting capacity and, when they do make reports in their annual reports, the government of the day is not obligated in any way to respond.
So the government needs to pay more attention to ongoing reform of military justice within the Australian defence forces. It is fair to comment that a lot of the spin that has been coming out of late does not serve any real purpose. It gives the appearance of acting but in fact covers up or hides. We suggest—and the Senate committee is of the view—that the government must act on the JAG’s recommendations contained in his report to ensure that there is true cultural and—

It is being assessed by the Tasmanian government and has not come to the Commonwealth at this stage. It is likely to come to the Commonwealth.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-09-06,"—I, jointly with Senator Brown and Senator Murray, have sought to disallow the government’s regulation which seeks to give effect to an increase in the House of Representatives printing entitlements from $125,000 per member per year to $150,000 per member per year, and also to the proposed changes to the Senate printing entitlements. We do so because the proposed changes are not in the best interests of Australian parliamentary democracy. We think the increase in the provision for House of Representatives members is way beyond what is reasonable. It has not been publicly justified. There appears to be no real justification other than the fact that the government can make such a decision.
I suppose it takes us back to the debate we had yesterday, which is where we talked about regulation of parliamentary salaries and how we handed those decisions to the Remuneration Tribunal, being the independent umpire and the appropriate place for the determination of the salaries and conditions of parliamentarians. I take the very strong view that parliamentarians ought not to be involved in decision making about their own salaries and conditions, and I take that view about other professions and occupations as well. I think that the proof of the worth of that argument is seen in this regulation. Here we have a minister in the government of the day, the Special Minister of State, who is responsible for electoral matters, seeking to increase the entitlement to use taxpayer funds to allow members to communicate with their electorates—that is, on this occasion, to increase their printing entitlements by $25,000 a year so that they can print more material for distribution to their constituents.
Of course, in principle, there is nothing wrong with members being able to communicate with their electors; it is a core part of our function, and we all do it. We are all required to do it, and no-one would argue that that is not a key part of the function of a parliamentarian. But what we are seeing is the government attempting to ensure that incumbency in this country is almost an overwhelming factor in Australian political life. We are seeing sitting members of parliament given entitlements of some magnitude, which they can use increasingly for election related purposes. The distinction between electoral matters and one’s role as a parliamentarian has blurred considerably in recent years; the definitions have been widened. I accept that these have always been difficult definitions, but we have a situation where, increasingly, members are able to campaign using their Commonwealth funded entitlements.
This latest measure of the government’s is really going a yard too far. We have not only gone a yard too far but the decision has been made by the government for the government. This is not a matter that has been considered on the basis of argument and evidence by the Remuneration Tribunal; this is the government trying to push through an increase in entitlements for parliamentarians, without reference to anyone else and without proper discussion in the parliament or with other parties, just because it can. These are similar to changes that they sought in the last parliament but the numbers in the Senate prevented them from achieving those changes. We now have a government with absolute power in the Senate seeking to increase the entitlements of members of parliament in terms of their printing allowances. As I said, this is not something that has gone to the Remuneration Tribunal. This has been done purely by the government for, I think, the government and for government members. There is no public rationale that stands up to any sort of scrutiny; therefore, Labor is trying to be consistent in saying that we will oppose this because we think it has gone too far, that it has not been independently tested and that there is no good argument for supporting it.
In a sense we are arguing against our self-interest, because all the Labor House of Representatives members will benefit from these changes. They will use them. They will have access to these resources, which will help solidify their incumbency and protect them from challenge at the next election. But you have to take a step back from self-interest and ask: is it in the interests of Australian parliamentary democracy? Is it in the interests of the body politic that the advantages of incumbency at taxpayers’ expense become so large? I think the answer has to be no. I do not think that we should be supporting the sitting members getting such an advantage in an election context as it is now proposed they get.
While it is true to say that a lot of this resource will be used for the normal activity of a parliamentarian, there is no doubt that a lot of that activity will be centred on promoting the member of parliament—promoting their profile and promoting their prospects of being re-elected. I will come to some of the detail later as to why these provisions are even more insidious in the way the use of them has been structured. Labor will oppose these regulations. We join with the Greens and the Democrats in saying that it is a yard too far.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2006-09-06,"—Yesterday I asked a question of the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, about the immense contribution the Australian Institute of Sport has made at all levels of sport in Australia, specifically in light of its recent 25th birthday celebrations. I would like to elaborate briefly on my involvement with the AIS and my shared joy in the celebrations of the 25 years of success it has undoubtedly developed over the period of its existence.
Like Minister Kemp, I was at the celebrations last week. It was quite amazing to see the level of success the Australian Institute of Sport has achieved over the period of time. I was there in my capacity as a former recipient of an AIS scholarship and, more recently, as a board member of the Australian Sports Commission. Therefore, this is an issue of close personal significance to me. I remember that, when I was first invited to apply for a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport, I felt it was a great honour. I was a 17-year-old, fresh out of school and doing my first year at university. I went into a very gruelling regime and, fortunately for me, passed the test and was offered a scholarship that enabled me to go on and represent not only the Australian Institute of Sport but also the people of Australia and of my home state, South Australia, in a number of international and local competitions.
If I am truthful about it, I think my first job outside of my family business was with the Australian Sports Commission. I was a part-time worker. Part of the culture at the Australian Institute of Sport is to deliver well-rounded individuals, not just sports focused individuals. Accordingly, you have to study or do some work in that environment as well as train in your particular sporting discipline.
Discipline is a key point about the AIS and its success. The athletes there are extremely committed. They do train very hard and they maintain regimes that I think most people would find difficult to maintain. They do it because they are passionate about what they do and they know that it will deliver the results that they so earnestly desire. It is about commitment and dedication to a cause.
As a member of the board of the Australian Sports Commission, one sees an extension of that commitment to a cause. The cause for the board members, of course, is to deliver a better, more robust and stronger Australian sporting system. The board members are all committed; they are knowledgeable. Under the tutelage and chairmanship of Peter Bartels, who has been a longstanding chairman of the Australian Sports Commission, and certainly with the deputy chairman Alan Jones, we have two of the most knowledgeable people in sport in this country and two people who are extremely passionate about ensuring not only that there are great opportunities for us at the elite end but that our health, wellbeing and participation rates in sports in this country are maximised.
The Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport have undoubtedly assisted Australia to become one of the best, most powerful sporting nations on the international stage. I have to say it is a great honour to have participated in it and made a humble contribution but it is also inspiring to know that governments on both sides of the political argument have continued to support the Australian Institute of Sport and have worked very hard together to maintain levels of funding. In recent times, the funding has been quite significantly increased to cope with an ever-increasingly competitive world in the area of sport and to ensure that Australia is at the forefront of technological as well as raw sporting advantage.
Our record in large international sporting events such as the Olympic and Commonwealth Games are testimony to what has been created there over the last 25 years. Athletes who have been through the Australian Institute of Sport program won 65 per cent of Australia’s tally of 49 medals at the 2004 Olympic Games. This figure was also reflected in our athletic success in our home games in Sydney in 2000, where 32 of the total 58 medals were won by existing or former AIS scholarship holders. It does not stop there. Our Paralympic team successes have also reflected the contribution of the Australian Institute of Sport: 63 medals were won by AIS athletes at the 2004 Athens Paralympics and AIS athletes won almost half of the total medals at the 2000 Sydney Paralympics.
Let me stress that the Australian Institute of Sport is about elite sport. It is about achieving success for Australia, but we cannot undersell the benefits of sporting success. In a country such as Australia, where sport is very much a part of our culture, we take an inordinate amount of pride when we see our sporting heroes succeed on the world stage and we are very proud of our teams and individuals who do that. But, more importantly, it gives our children the opportunity to have good, positive role models in their lives. It encourages children. For every sporting success we have, every gold medal we achieve, every world champion that is created through the Australian sporting system, we have a number of children who participate more fully in the sporting process. Not all of them, of course, will achieve great levels of success but the emphasis on health and wellbeing, getting children active and ensuring that they participate will not only make a healthier and brighter future for Australia but also maintain the pool of athletes who will enable us to continue our sporting success.
The minister in his answer yesterday touched on why the Australian Institute of Sport was set up. We were one of the first Western nations to actually centralise our sporting system in this regard. The reason is, quite simply, failure. It was failure at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. At those games, Australia came in 32nd place on the medal tally with one silver and four bronze medals. New Zealand won more medals at that Olympics than we did.
The Australian government and senior sporting officials at that time realised that something had to be done to tap into the sporting potential of Australia. In 1981 the Australian Institute of Sport was opened, followed by the Australian Sports Commission a couple of years later. This marked the turning point for Australian sport and our talented athletes. The AIS originally offered scholarships in eight sports. Currently we have 35 separate programs covering 26 individual sports, and over 700 athletes are participating in the Australian Institute of Sport program.
It is not only Olympic and Commonwealth Games athletes who benefit from the expertise and training of the AIS. Many AIS athletes have gone on to have champion sporting careers in netball, basketball, cricket, soccer and tennis, to name a few. We also have a more expansive program across Australia. It is not only the 65-hectare site in Canberra where our athletes receive the best possible attention, we have training programs in Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, Sydney and on the Gold Coast. We have also established a European training site which will allow our athletes to achieve excellent results during their tours of the European sporting season.
Back in the late 1970s, when this was first conceived, there was no single integrated and interconnected support system for our elite athletes. It was sorely missed and it showed in our results. When we first came up with the AIS proposal, we did not have sports psychologists, nutritionists, biomechanists or sports medicine experts—all of the people who have since come on board and who help to put the Australian sporting system at the very forefront technologically and also physiologically for our athletes.
Our athletes previously did not have carbon fibre bikes or ‘go fast’ swimsuits. These things are now taken for granted. They are things that have been pioneered in Australia and exported across the world. These sorts of technological advances can make the difference between simply qualifying or actually winning a medal.
The AIS would not be where it is today without its committed and enthusiastic support staff who, more often than not, could achieve much higher salaries overseas in supplying their trade to competing nations, but they are committed to the development of sport in this country and they are committed to seeing Australia achieve the best it possibly can. For that, I extend my gratitude.
It would not be possible to have this level of success without the commitment of government. As the biggest sponsor of Australian sport in this country, I would like to recognise the contribution of not only this government but also previous governments and encourage them to continue to support the Australian sporting system for our health and for our future, and also because we all enjoy the benefits that accrue from winning medals.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Institute of Sport</title>,ADJOURNMENT,33,1,speech
